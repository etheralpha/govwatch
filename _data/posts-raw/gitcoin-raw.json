With GG20 wrapping up this week, I wanted to bring some learnings from this process to light. This post will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retro on Community Council and their experience</li>\n<li>Retro on the selection criteria, additional learnings and how we might move forward differently.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov\">@Sov</a> for spearheading the initial idea of the evolution of Community Rounds, and to the 7 members of the council, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mashal\">@mashal</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/thedevanshmehta\">@thedevanshmehta</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/azeem\">@azeem</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/zer8\">@ZER8</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lanzdingz\">@lanzdingz</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wasabi\">@wasabi</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/feems\">@feems</a>, who embarked on this experiment with us! It was an honour to coordinate this undertaking and learn alongside everyone throughout the process.</p>\n<p>As a recap, the new governance process included enabling communities to upload proposals to our forum, and applying for extra matching funds from Gitcoin to run in a Gitcoin Grants round (GG20 was the first iteration). The Community Council then reviewed and voted on the proposals, with the top 5 being selected for matching funds. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with this process, read the following posts for further context: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-eligibility-criteria-community-rounds/17846\">GG20 Eligibility Criteria - Community Rounds</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-rounds-announced/18402\">GG20 Community Rounds Announced</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-council/17749\">GG20 Community Council</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-council-retro-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-council-retro-2\"></a>Community Council retro:</h3>\n<p>This being the first iteration of Gitcoin electing an external GG Community Council, I have been personally very pleased with the results and the council that was elected. The council‚Äôs diversity and experience put us in a strong position to govern GG20.</p>\n<p>A detailed survey was presented to the council gathering feedback on their experience and ways we could improve the process. They had to scale their overall experience from 1-5 (1 being ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and 5 being ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù). The results revealed that the average rating for the council‚Äôs overall experience was approximately 4.71 out of 5. This indicates a highly positive experience among the council members. <em>Each member also roughly spent 10 hours on this initiative, in line with what we set predicted.</em></p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúFor how fast everything moved and the care needed to effectively carry this out with a tight timeline I thought it was done as well as it could have been when you factor in everything. We were able to identify what needed to be changed in the future, without letting that affect our ability to get the current task done on time now. everything was handled in a way that gives me a lot of confidence for the foundation of what we‚Äôre building/Gitcoin is working towards helping create.‚Äù</em> - Lana</p>\n<h3><a name=\"retro-on-the-selection-criteria-learning-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#retro-on-the-selection-criteria-learning-3\"></a>Retro on the selection criteria, learning:</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"using-charmverse-as-a-platform-to-review-vote-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#using-charmverse-as-a-platform-to-review-vote-4\"></a>Using CharmVerse as a platform to review &amp; vote:</h4>\n<p>Other options we explored before selecting CharmVerse: Ranked Voting through Google Sheets, which tested unsuccessful due to the results needing more than 7 voters and reviewers. We also looked at manual reviews, which is labour intensive and not favourable. We wanted a platform where the council could easily review and comment on proposals as well as vote using a rubric, which was why CharmVerse was a great option.</p>\n<p>Within the same survey, the council was asked to rank their experience with the platform chosen on a scale of 1-5 (1 being ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and 5 being ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù). The average rating for using CharmVerse as a platform was 4.14 out of 5. This suggests a generally positive consensus towards continuing to use CharmVerse, with most members indicating satisfaction, though a couple of members saw room for improvement. We have given the CharmVerse team some feedback on how we would like the UI to be improved in the future, but with this outcome in the survey, we will most likely keep CharmVerse as the platform moving forward, making sure that the improvements are implemented by GG21, <em>barring any necessary changes due to adaptations of the rubric and eligibility criteria detailed below.</em></p>\n<h4><a name=\"improvements-to-the-rubric-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#improvements-to-the-rubric-5\"></a>Improvements to the Rubric:</h4>\n<p><em>Here are some suggestions that surfaced in the survey that we would like to implement in the rubric for future rounds. <strong>NOTE:</strong> these are not set in stone right now, as we will circle back with the council on this and ensure the rubrics are created in collaboration with what the council suggests.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include ‚Äòcommunity reach/impact‚Äô and details about community leaders‚Äô public/social impact.</li>\n<li>Introduce a rubric for round deliverables or milestones, possibly weighing the network effects.</li>\n<li>Expand and refine rubric definitions to ensure clarity, such as defining terms like ‚Äòleverage‚Äô more explicitly.\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of mechanics that determine the ratio of matching being received by a Community Round; this could be a subset of the rubric focused on the financial aspects of the application.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Add more measurement criteria tied to application questions for easier referencing.</li>\n<li>Incorporate individual or group sessions with applicants and add a measurement for more diversity of projects to prevent monopoly by well-known names and popular/ same projects getting funding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"changes-to-eligibility-criteria-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#changes-to-eligibility-criteria-6\"></a>Changes to Eligibility Criteria:</h4>\n<p><em>Strong eligibility criteria that are also closely linked to the rubrics used for evaluation can ensure high-quality, values-aligned funding rounds that serve the community well. The council‚Äôs input will set the eligibility criteria for future rounds.</em></p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider restrictions such as disallowing back-to-back funding rounds for previous recipients, with a potential reinstatement after a cycle or annually.</li>\n<li>Require previous recipients to provide impact tracking metrics and improvement plans for subsequent rounds.</li>\n<li>Standardize metrics more comprehensively to enhance comparability across different projects and rounds.</li>\n<li>To share progress, community size, and all other relevant stats</li>\n<li>Address transparency and conflict of interest concerns, such as disclosure of relationships between applicants and round participants.</li>\n<li>Disclose all forms of funding</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"those-not-selected-for-matching-felt-excluded-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#those-not-selected-for-matching-felt-excluded-7\"></a>Those not selected for matching felt ‚Äúexcluded‚Äù:</h4>\n<p>One thing that we picked up is the rounds not selected for matching funds felt excluded and disempowered to still continue and run a round during GG20. This is not something that we intentionally set up and one of the biggest pieces of this process I would like to change. How might we ensure each round that applies feels empowered, but still upholds the resources that Gitcoin can give community rounds during a round?</p>\n<p>For example, when it comes to marketing rounds outside of those selected for matching, there are many factors to consider: resources, vetting of the rounds, intentional coordination, etc. We are actively working on creating a system that is inclusive and impactful for all involved and making sure the process is fair, vetted, and well resourced.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"moving-forward-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#moving-forward-8\"></a>Moving forward:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of making the process more inclusive for all involved, I suggest the following:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The top 5 are still selected for matching through the same review and voting process, but the top [ X ] will be included in our marketing efforts. The exact number of rounds we can support and what this marketing support will look like will be discussed internally and fleshed out in another post leading up to GG21.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will update the rubrics and eligibility criteria with the council, as we would like to give them more autonomy in this regard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An updated Roles &amp; Responsibilities doc will be posted to the forum, outlining the new and updated responsibilities of the council as their roles will evolve moving forward.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>‚ÄúThe comms part by the Gitcoin team was excellent. On the whole, I‚Äôve taken this role pretty seriously and have felt that it was a big responsibility to make sound decisions with intentionality and countering bias that comes with decision making. I‚Äôd love to stay updated re the results of each round, and to understand how they were run ++ learnings et al from them (would esp like to understand challenges and what went well + didn‚Äôt from each). This will help in improving decision making for the next one.‚Äù</em> - Mashal</p>\n<p>The goal of Community Rounds is for Gitcoin to continue empowering those within the ecosystem to fund what matters to them most, creating an inclusive and collaborative environment during GG, and further decentralizing our grants program.</p>\n<p>We have taken a great first step, and through these iterations and learnings, we can continue to improve over time.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-round-governance-a-retrospective/18766\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-round-governance-a-retrospective/18766","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 22:22:11 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18766"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-round-governance-a-retrospective/18766.rss","#text":"GG20 Community Round Governance: A Retrospective"}},{"title":"Gitcoin's Continued Path to Decentralized - Executive Director Elections","dc:creator":"CoachJonathan","category":"ü§ñ DAO Governance and Vision","description":"<h3><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1\"></a>TLDR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gitcoin‚Äôs structure is about reinforcing the legitimacy of its governance through the GTC token</li>\n<li>Gitcoin‚Äôs structure has changed a bit since the launch of the DAO in 2021, but not by much (diagram of the current structure below)</li>\n<li>Starting in Jan 2025, Gitcoin will begin electing its Executive Director on its path to decentralization</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h3>\n<p>With the recent announcement of a<a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/another-passing-of-the-torch/18704/9\"> passing of the torch</a> for the Executive Director role at the Gitcoin Foundation, I wanted to take a moment to create some clarity on what I‚Äôm seeing as an emerging structure at the DAO.</p>\n<p>This post is intended to be a follow up to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a>‚Äôs <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778\"> Consent of the Governed post</a> that was released soon after the formation of the DAO.

In order to create the DAO, Gitcoin had to appoint an Executive Director for the Gitcoin Foundation. At that time, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle\">@kyle</a> was given that role and has owned that responsibility until recently.</p>\n<p>Soon after the launch of the DAO, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> created the aforementioned post that starts by defining the idea of the Consent of the Governed:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"owocki\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"9778\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/user_avatar/gov.gitcoin.co/owocki/48/12006_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778/1\">Consent of the Governed (and Legitimacy by Process) in GitcoinDAO</a></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p> the phrase consent of the governed refers to the idea that a government‚Äôs legitimacy and moral right to use state power is justified and lawful only when consented to by the people or society over which that political power is exercised. </p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>It then goes on to list differences between how an organization like Meta structures itself vs. how a DAO like Gitcoin structures itself to create legitimacy by empowering users and contributors to create bottoms-up buy-in.</p>\n<p>At the core of the post is a principle that still stands true at Gitcoin:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"owocki\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"9778\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/user_avatar/gov.gitcoin.co/owocki/48/12006_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778/1\">Consent of the Governed (and Legitimacy by Process) in GitcoinDAO</a></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p> Legitimacy should flow in circles, not just one way </p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>In order to minimize confusion, I will not repost any diagrams from the initial post‚Äîreaders can take a look at themselves to get a sense of what the initial vision for governing the DAO was at inception.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"shifting-structure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#shifting-structure-4\"></a>Shifting Structure</h3>\n<p>Though initial vision might have been a <em>bit</em> ambitious, the structure we‚Äôve landed on is not too far off from the ideal set in Jan 2022.</p>\n<p>Here is a shot at visualizing how (I am seeing) legitimacy currently flowing at Gitcoin:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45\" title=\"ConsentoftheGoverned\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45_2_324x500.jpeg\" alt=\"ConsentoftheGoverned\" data-base62-sha1=\"gS6KyFKY4145J8lWbfdVcmQQfDT\" width=\"324\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45_2_324x500.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45_2_486x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45_2_648x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Users are airdropped tokens.

Passing/rejecting of token requests through a Token proposal</strong></p>\n<p>Stewards have the power to approve and withhold on DAO spending. This is one of the highest leverage points where Stewards have a say on how the DAO is operating and spending.</p>\n<p>Should Stewards be dissatisfied with the performance of a unit, they can vote against a budget proposal either until the proposal is amended to their satisfaction <em>or</em> until the unit winds down from a lack of funding.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Election/removal of the Executive Director through a Legal Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>Stewards also have the power to elect and remove the Executive Director of the Gitcoin Foundation. The intention of this mechanism is to create accountability for the Executive Director to properly guide the organization and ensure that all the right people are in the right seats.</p>\n<p>This is essentially a hierarchical structure with the ED at the top and all DAO contributors arranged below. This is a common structure in coops and is a structure (at this point in time) being used at Gitcoin to ensure that goals are being hit and that the DAO is successfully pursuing its mission while achieving financial sustainability.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"whats-next-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#whats-next-6\"></a>What‚Äôs Next</h3>\n<p>In the past, Executive Directors have been appointed but have not been elected.

It allows for decentralized decision-making and management of resources.</p>\n<p>An alternative definition of DAOs: DAOs are how groups of humans coordinate around a shared objective.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of the 2nd definition, it is okay to treat the literal definition of DAOs as more of a spectrum. Some projects will be 100% decentralized, 100% autonomous, + an organization, some will only be partially so.

Which enables more experimentation.</li>\n<li>without the burden of having to last forever, we can make more pragmatic decisions about what to do over a short period of time without worrying about entrenching power.</li>\n<li>without the burden of having to last forever, we can test/iterate with bold bets in the short term.</li>\n<li>we can learn from decentralized movements of the past, many of which ebbed and flowed, (Occupy Wall St or the Civil Rights movement are two examples) + transcribe their lessons into our ephemeral DAO experiments‚Ä¶</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"ephemeral-dao-design-space-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#ephemeral-dao-design-space-6\"></a>Ephemeral DAO Design Space</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"examples-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#examples-7\"></a>Examples</h2>\n<p>Examples of Ephemeral DAOs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pop up villages like Edge City or Zuzalu or Metacamp. <em>(weeks long)</em></li>\n<li><span class=\"mention\">@_SEAL_Org</span> or other ‚ÄúWhitehat group‚Äù style fund rescue operations <em>(several hours - several weeks long)</em></li>\n<li>Gitcoin style QF rounds.  <em>(weeks long)</em></li>\n<li>Optimism style Retro Funding Rounds <em>(weeks long)</em></li>\n<li>Accelerator cohorts go through an educational cohort together over an 8 week program (months long)</li>\n<li>Point in time fundraisers like ConstitutionDAO or <a href=\"https://juicebox.money/@free-pertsev-and-storm\">The Free Alexey &amp; Roman Legal Defense Fundraise</a> <em>(weeks long)</em></li>\n<li>Protocol Guild‚Äôs first cohort <em>(1 year long)</em></li>\n<li>Projects like Meta Cartel, which dissolved itself after transferring all their remaining assets to the lawyers of tornado cash devs. <em>(years long)</em></li>\n<li>Investment DAOs like those created by <a href=\"https://www.hydraventures.xyz/\">Hydra Ventures</a> last only as long as they have capital to deploy <em>(years long)</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"dao-purity-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#dao-purity-8\"></a>DAO-purity</h2>\n<p>Some definitions of DAOs out there have rigid adherence to the properties of autonomousness (emphasis on computer code doing most of the work), achieving very high levels of decentralization (e.g. no member can have more power than another) and being an organization (as opposed to a network).</p>\n<p>I find myself gravitating towards a more simple &amp; broad definition: DAOs are how groups of humans coordinate around a shared objective.</p>\n<p>Projects that are in between the more rigid definition of DAOs and the more simple/broad one can be said to be DAO-ey.</p>\n<p>I can hear the naysayers say to me ‚ÄúKevin those don‚Äôt count as DAOs. We shouldn‚Äôt be flexible in our interpretation of our design space and should be dogmatic about 100% decentralization + autonomy‚Äù. Well, I‚Äôm sorry I failed your purity test. But I disagree. We should choose the right amount of autonomy + decentralization for the job. For decentralized money (BTC, ETC), we need 100% purity.

Starting July 1st we‚Äôll move from the Seasons concept (made to align previously with Gitcoin Grants rounds) to traditional quarters (Q3 &amp; Q4) and request a budget for the 2nd half of the year, as needed, depending on the spinout. We want and encourage broader DAO feedback and find it crucial to optimize our roadmap.</p>\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity and reputation management. In the next partial season we‚Äôll concentrate on five key pillars:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ease:</strong> Improve ease of use for both end users and partners</li>\n<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Improve identity scoring models</li>\n<li><strong>Adoption:</strong> Grow to 1.5M passports</li>\n<li><strong>GTC Utility</strong>: Strengthen GTC-based identity and community ties</li>\n<li><strong>Partnerships:</strong> Increase both API and onchain partnerships</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Outline</h2>\n<p>Passport is the premier web3 native offering that enables ecosystems to protect, understand and organically grow what matters most ‚Äì their communities.

While they are in a loose priority order, their final sequencing is still under evaluation.</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n   <td><strong>Initiative/Project\t\t</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Outcome</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Milestone/ deliverable</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Ease\n   </td>\n   <td>Reduce time to obtain a passing Passport\n   </td>\n   <td>Average user is able to claim a Passport in &lt;5 minutes\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Effectiveness\n   </td>\n   <td>Enhance the scoring model\n   </td>\n   <td>Develop a scoring model with &lt;10% Type I errors (False positives - Sybils are classified as human)\n<p>\nAggregate L2 Models\n   </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Adoption\n   </td>\n   <td>Expand user base\n<p>\n</p><p>Grow Model based detection (MBD)</p>\n   </td>\n   <td>Increase Passport count 150k to 1.3M Passports from a baseline of 1.15M\n<p>\nLaunch MBD and score &gt; 10,000 addresses\n   </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>GTC Utility\n   </td>\n   <td>Strengthen GTC-based identity and community ties\n   </td>\n   <td>Increase GTC staked 220k to 1.87M GTC from baseline of 1.65M GTC\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Partnerships\n   </td>\n   <td>Increase API integrations\n<p>\nOnboard onchain partners\n   </p></td>\n   <td>Partner &gt; 64 API users from a baseline of 54\n<p>\nEngage &gt; 12 onchain partners from a baseline of 7\n   </p></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2>Milestone Update: Season 21</h2>\n<p>In Season 21, our top line growth picked up quite a bit adding 279k new Passports or 35% total growth in the last 3 months. We continued to underperform against aggressive targets, but excited to see the growth as the markets are becoming more bullish. We have a total of 1.1M unique all time passports. We also continued to drive strongly against our targets in GTC staking, hitting over 1.5M GTC staked.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôve continued to expand our potential service offerings beyond the standard Passport &amp; onchain Passports to include our new Model Based Detection (MBD) system that is now in beta with the Eth activity model. This is proving to be highly effective at classifying Sybils (94% accurate) and enables scoring of addresses without requiring any user interaction. The Ethereum Activity model is the first model with additional models to be added to the MBD endpoint soon. Additions will include: NFT (Eth L1), zkSync (L2), OP (L2) and Polygon (L2) with more in the pipeline.</p>\n<h3>Milestone Report for Past Season</h3>\n<p><strong>Legend:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/green_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":green_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":green_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Success/Completed/Shipped<br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Incomplete, but partial success<br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":red_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":red_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Incomplete, Will Not Hit Goal<br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/black_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":black_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":black_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Canceled</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n   <td><strong>Initiative/Project</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Key Results</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Value Delivered</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Improve Effectiveness</strong> \n   </td>\n   <td>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/green_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":green_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":green_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> 95% accuracy with Eth Stamp</p>\n   </td>\n   <td>Launched new zkSync Activity stamp, NFT stamp, and revamped all credential weights to dramatically improve classification and reduce Sybils able to get a passing score of 20.\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Grow Adoption &amp; Usage</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> 1.15M Passports</p>\n   </td>\n   <td>Continued to drive top line growth of unique Passports by adding 279k brand new Passports, but were still short of our target of 1.5M\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>GTC Utility</strong> \n   </td>\n   <td>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> 1.65M GTC Staked</p>\n<p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> 22,100 Community staking addresses</p>\n   </td>\n   <td>Staking remains strong, having increased another 350k GTC staked, but unable to hit the 2M GTC target.

The reasoning behind this law involves several key ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Distortion of Incentives</strong>: When a particular metric is chosen as the target for policy or performance evaluation, it often leads to a change in behavior to optimize specifically for that metric. This change in behavior can lead to unintended consequences that distort the original purpose of the measure.</li>\n<li><strong>Overemphasis on Measurable Outcomes</strong>: People tend to focus on what can be easily measured and quantified. When a measure becomes a target, there is a risk that other important but less quantifiable aspects are neglected, leading to a narrower and potentially misleading evaluation of success or progress.</li>\n<li><strong>Manipulation and Gaming:</strong> There is a tendency for individuals or organizations to manipulate or game the system to achieve better scores on targeted metrics, regardless of whether this results in genuine improvements in the underlying objectives. For instance, schools might focus on teaching to the test rather than improving overall educational quality if test scores become the primary measure of educational success.</li>\n<li><strong>Reductionism</strong>: Goodhart‚Äôs Law highlights the dangers of reductionism in policy-making and management, where complex systems are reduced to simplistic numbers or targets. This reductionism can oversimplify reality and lead to decisions that might work well for the metric but poorly for the system as a whole.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The law serves as a caution against over-relying on any single measure or metric for decision-making, especially in complex systems where multiple factors should be considered. It underscores the importance of using a balanced set of measures and remaining vigilant about the ways that incentives can influence behavior.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"goodharts-law-public-goods-funding-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#goodharts-law-public-goods-funding-4\"></a>Goodhart‚Äôs Law <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/handshake.png?v=12\" title=\":handshake:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":handshake:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Public Goods Funding</h1>\n<p>In this post, I will argue that this has massive implications for how we fund public goods in the future.</p>\n<p>Why?

We have an evolutionary pressure insofar as the best ecosystems will be continuously evolving their measures forward, but in what ways can we do it?</p>\n<p>This is the frontier, and so unless you‚Äôve run dozens of PGF rounds, you probably don‚Äôt know the answer (yet). But we can reason about this. I think there are a couple ways we can think about it though.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>OODA Loop -</strong> Each PGF round is an OODA (Observe Orient Decide Act) loop by the mechanism designers. After each PGF round, mechanism designers will have to learn from that round, and figure out how the measure fared, and evolve it forward based on those learnings.</li>\n<li><strong>Algorithmic Randomness:</strong> Introduce elements of randomness in the reward or evaluation processes to reduce predictability and the effectiveness of gaming strategies. For example, random spot checks or audits can be used to ensure compliance without the system being entirely predictable.\n<ol>\n<li>In RetroPGF, the voting on metrics element of Round 4 design has a good amount of randomness built into it, as well as hard to predict game mechanisms like quorum rules and scoring formulas</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Community Feedback Mechanisms</strong>: Implement robust feedback systems that allow participants to report and address concerns about the integrity of the metrics or behaviors in the community. This feedback can be used to refine and improve the system continuously.</li>\n<li><strong>Hard to game metrics</strong> - metrics that are hard, or expensive, to game, will be resistant (but not immune) to goodharts law.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversified Metrics</strong>: Rather than relying on a single metric or indicator, use a diverse set of metrics to assess performance or impact. This helps ensure that different aspects of the desired outcomes are being captured and reduces the risk of any one metric becoming overly dominant.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic and Adaptive Metrics</strong>: Implement mechanisms that allow for metrics to be adjusted or replaced as the system evolves. This adaptability can help prevent the gaming of static metrics and ensure that measures continue to align with the underlying goals of the DAO. Metrics should also have counterbalancing forces, eg, new users vs retained users. It‚Äôs very hard to do both</li>\n<li><strong>Cap and Rotate Mechanisms</strong>: For critical metrics or roles within the system, consider using caps (limits on the maximum score or benefit) and rotating the focus among various metrics or areas. This can prevent over-optimization for any single metric and encourage broader contributions across different areas. An example of this policy in practice: one metric can never be more than 20% of the allocation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A feature in my view ‚Äî is that this is a competitive landscape. If lots of actors start trying to game a metric, then it‚Äôs value collapses. There will always be alpha in looking for areas where you have outsize impact in hard areas.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"immutable-evolutionary-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#immutable-evolutionary-7\"></a>Immutable =&gt; Evolutionary</h2>\n<p>In much of the history of the crypto ecosystem, we have placed a value on complete immutability of our protocols.</p>\n<p>Often, this is for good reason. Immutable protocols are incorruptible. We need this in our protocols for money - which according to crypto lore, should not be subject to the whims of any party. Because of this, we have uncensorable money, unprintable money, in BTC + ETH.</p>\n<p>But do we need immutability in every protocol for everything?</p>\n<p>Crypto-era Public Goods Funding has been born from this era of immutability, but it must also transcend it in order to be successful.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We can gain the benefits of immutability in some places (eg intra-round, we should depend on credibly neutral protocols where anyone can verify the vote count), while we partially deviate from it in between rounds (for good reasons, outlined above).</li>\n<li>We must recognize that our emphasis on immutability has often made us aim for the perfect solution and think less iteratively. Public Goods Funding experiments could and should take the opposite approach - iterate towards a local maxima over time. Have a bias towards action + have the courage to ship something imperfect soon over never shipping the (theoretically) perfect thing.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Goodhart‚Äôs Law, introduced by British economist Charles Goodhart in 1975, articulates that ‚ÄúWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.‚Äù This principle highlights how using a specific metric as a target for policy or performance can lead to behaviors aimed at optimizing that metric, often at the expense of the intended goal. This manipulation and overemphasis on measurable outcomes can distort the original purpose of the measure, reduce the complexity of systems to simplistic numbers, and potentially lead to misleading evaluations.</p>\n<p>We think this has massive implications on the funding of public goods in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), particularly through mechanisms like quadratic funding and badgeholder review.</p>\n<p>We suggest that the best public goods funding (PGF) systems would benefit from being evolutionary and adaptable, incorporating strategies such as diversified metrics, dynamic adjustments, and robust community feedback to stay effective and resistant to gaming.</p>\n<p>We advocate for a balance between immutable protocols and adaptable strategies to ensure long-term success in funding public goods.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-must-be-evolutionary/18728\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-must-be-evolutionary/18728","pubDate":"Fri, 03 May 2024 16:20:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18728"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-must-be-evolutionary/18728.rss","#text":"Public Goods Funding MUST be Evolutionary!"}},{"title":"Gitcoin Citizens Rounds - Value Generation Opportunities","dc:creator":"owocki","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>(Thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya\">@Viriya</a> for helping me review, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/krrisis\">@krrisis</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a> for their role in  pushing Citizens rounds forward.

This is a minor tweak, but I like sharing this type of thing with the community because transparency/ community consent for the algorithms we run is is good. I also always love feedback, positive or negative.</p>\n<p>Before I go further, <a href=\"https://github.com/Jmiller4/qf-variants\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">you can find the code here.</a> The function COCM (with the default inputs) is what I‚Äôll be explaining in this post.</p>\n<p>COCM (Connection Oriented Cluster Match) works in three steps.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, it takes in data about ‚Äúclusters‚Äù, which are just different (possibly overlapping) groups of users. You could generate cluster data from POAPs, twitter follower lists, or even the donation records (where if someone donates to project X, they‚Äôre put in project X‚Äôs cluster). Users can also have ‚Äúweights‚Äù in a cluster, denoting how strongly they belong to it. For example, you could use github repositories as clusters, where if I make <em>n</em> pull requests to that repository, I have a weight of <em>n</em> in that repository‚Äôs cluster. In general, round operators can choose what cluster data to use (or they can not use COCM at all, of course).</li>\n<li>COCM calculates ‚Äúsimilarity scores‚Äù between each user and each cluster.</li>\n<li>Finally, COCM runs QF, but then attenuates each project‚Äôs funding if many of its donors are similar according to the scores calculated in step 2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 2 is what we‚Äôll focus on here. First, here‚Äôs how we used to calculate similarity scores. Lets call the user U and call the cluster X. If a U is in X, their similarity score to X is 1. Otherwise, we look at all the other clusters that U is in, and look at all the people in all of those clusters. Then we ask, how many of <em>those</em> people are in X? We use that fraction as the similarity score.</p>\n<p>The issue with this method is that we don‚Äôt use any of that juicy weight information I mentioned above. Let‚Äôs say user U is in cluster Y, and everybody else in Y is also in X, with a really high weight. If we gave all those people a really low weight instead, it wouldn‚Äôt change the similarity score between U and X. But shouldn‚Äôt it?</p>\n<p>So our new way of calculating similarity scores essentially does exactly that. You can think of it as an adaptation of the old method but with a weighted average, instead of an unweighted average.</p>\n<p>You can also think of the new method as an analysis of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Markov process</a>, like what Google uses in their PageRank algorithm. We can think of a graph of all users and all clusters, where directed edges from users to clusters (and vice versa) are weighted according to that user‚Äôs weight in that cluster, and normalized so that all outgoing edges sum to 1 (thus forming a probability distribution). Then, we can start at user U‚Äôs node and randomly jump to a cluster that U is in according to the probabilities on their outgoing edges. Then we can randomly jump from that cluster to a user, with probabilities proportional to each user‚Äôs weight in that cluster. Then we can jump to another cluster from whatever user we wind up at.</p>\n<p>Now, here‚Äôs a question: what‚Äôs the probability that after all of that jumping, we wound up at cluster X? If user U is closely connected to X via many intermediate clusters and donors with high weights, the probability will be high. If U isn‚Äôt closely connected to X, the probability will be low. So this probability is precisely what we use for the similarity score between U and X.</p>\n<p>This new method of calculating similarity scores really improved the sybil resistance of the algorithm. All of the charts in <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a> 's <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524/1\">recent post</a> were calculated with this new version of COCM.<br>\n.<br>\nThat‚Äôs all for now.

The tl;dr is that I will be stepping out of all official interactions I have with Gitcoin and will be taking over as co-lead of the Passport Business Unit as we work to spin out the business unit. Read on for more details and sappy stories with lots of appreciation!</p>\n<p><strong>Gitcoin entering its endgame</strong></p>\n<p>As I posted a couple months ago, Gitcoin is entering its endgame, and I want to make sure the <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-dao-has-no-ceo/9852\">DAO doesn‚Äôt have a CEO</a>. As a result, much of the soft power that was accruing to me needed to be diffused in the new BUs, and Ecosystem Collective. At the same time, there are very real requirements that the Gitcoin Foundation both needs to meet, but then also advances for the DAO. <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet\">@deltajuliet</a> will be taking over as interim Executive Director (until such time a token vote can ratify the new Exec Director), and she will lead the Gitcoin Foundation. I will let her chime in with more on the details of her role shift, and the timing for an election/formalization of the new ED.</p>\n<p><strong>Passport Future</strong></p>\n<p>I have worked with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> for years to build out &amp; design a proof of personhood approach that was pluralistic by default. He believes in the power that anti-sybil technology creates, and I believe in the power that non-doxxing reputation can bring to the world. On this quest, we wanted to ensure any solution we built protected users‚Äô privacy while enabling them to prove they are unique humans. We launched Passport years ago after many hours were spent combing through usage data to prevent sybil attacks on our Grants Program.</p>\n<p>Today, Passport has evolved a bunch, and Passport.xyz is live (more updates coming soon!). I am excited to narrow my focus to this opportunity where Passport enables web3 citizens to build reputation and prove they are unique humans - combating the sybils and bad actors. I have internalized the need for Passport to decrease user friction, and for us to lead with more data analysis - your voices have been heard and we will keep improving this. Co-leading the Passport team is an honor and I am elated they will have me back (again, and again!).</p>\n<p><strong>The road behind and path ahead</strong></p>\n<p>I joined Gitcoin when we were a small team in Consensys. <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a>, Joe Lubin (and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kriak.eth\">@kriak.eth</a>) afforded me the opportunity to grow the Gitcoin team, and work to support our spinout and success. Three years later, I am immensely grateful and proud of what we have accomplished:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Spun out of Consensys</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fund raised to capitalize the organization that would launch the DAO and Protocol</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch $GTC and seed the DAO with a compelling purpose</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build the decentralized Gitcoin DAO with legal rails for longevity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complete the treasury diversification to ensure stability during the bear</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scaling the protocol and GMV (this is where we are now!)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My cup is full, and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with so many amazing leaders and team members, lots of whom are now off and leading other organizations too! The alumni network of Gitcoin is stronger than most. So many great people have contributed to Gitcoin and have helped grow this team, the magic of the mission, and this community have made Gitcoin a household name in Web3.</p>\n<p>I plan to stay connected and participate in the governance of Gitcoin. I also plan to advocate for Gitcoin‚Äôs continued decentralization (through the work the Ecosystem Collective is doing) and expansion of GTC utility.</p>\n<p>This community is one of the best in the space, and is generally interested in changing the world for the better. I will always be trying to green pill degens and turn them into regens with moonshot bots, comic books and trading card games.

Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved decision making</strong> - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Retaining top performers</strong> - Some ideas and teams won‚Äôt produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher self awareness &amp; accountability</strong> - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowers individual contributors</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.</li>\n<li><strong>Removed intermediaries</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone‚Äôs compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible information usage</strong> - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source contribution data</strong> - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Self sovereign identity adoption</strong> - Individual contribution logs can be tied to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust based networks</strong> - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they‚Äôve built and the common connections they share.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Read our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution verification and contribution logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/approaches/contribution-verification-approaches\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification approaches</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Experimentation in Gitcoin</strong></p>\n<p>Individual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants process or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to start building up their own reputation. Idea funding and contributor funding could both experiment with individual contribution logs.</p>\n<br> \n<p><strong>Further investigation</strong></p>\n<p>These is an opportunity to create more tooling that could enable individual contributors to easily record and present their contribution efforts. Contribution logs could become increasingly useful and reliable for contributors to build their reputation in the ecosystem and for voters when making funding decisions.</p>\n<p>In the comings months the Web3 Association is going to look at what tooling already exists that could be used and then explore what new tools could be created to make it easier to record and present contribution efforts.

This fee varies, and it‚Äôs often as low as $0.05. You can find more information about the bridge fees in the <a href=\"https://docs.across.to/reference/fees-in-the-system#relayer-fees\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Across Protocol‚Äôs documentation</a>.</li>\n<li>We didn‚Äôt have to compromise on speed; it‚Äôs comparable to regular transfers. Across has consistently maintained its reputation as the fastest and lowest-cost bridge for end-users. Their recent milestone of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocol/status/1778770155218370694\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">crossing $7B in all-time volume</a> attests to its reliability.</li>\n<li>We set a minimum donation amount of $1. This ensures that bridging relayers can process transactions smoothly, without significantly limiting donors (usually $1 was the minimum amount eligible for matching).</li>\n<li>If for any reason the bridge transaction cannot be processed (e.g. donation is sent just before the round end), the donor receives back their funds after 6 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the code is open-source and can be verified here: <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/browser-extensions\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">browser extension</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/contracts/blob/DonationWrapper/src/contracts/DonationWrapper.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">smart contract</a>.

The contract code has undergone a sanity check by an independent smart contract developer.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"matching-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#matching-4\"></a>Matching</h2>\n<p>The question that naturally comes to mind is: will these donations be matched?</p>\n<p>Unlike the same-chain donations we built for GG18, where all the donations fell into the Gitcoin indexer pipeline and were therefore automatically included for matching and showed up in the history page, the cross-chain donation component required us to introduce a wrapper smart contract, consequently obfuscating the original donor.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôve developed and proposed a non-invasive solution for including these donations in the matching calculations with minimal effort and no changes to the Allo protocol. Donations made through our extension issue onchain attestations via the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eas_eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethereum Attestation Service</a>. These attestations are issued in a decentralized manner, making them immune to spoofing or alteration. You can read the complete technical explanation of the solution <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/browser-extensions/blob/master/CONTRACTS.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Knowing about the plans to make Allo the ultimate composable funding allocation protocol, we think this is something worth solving not only for GG20 but also for any future dev teams building independent frontends.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"about-us-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#about-us-5\"></a>About Us</h2>\n<p>For those of you who don‚Äôt know us yet, you can follow our work on the channels listed below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.idriss.xyz/gitcoin\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin Grant</a>  - <a href=\"https://www.idriss.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Website</a>  -  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IDriss_xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a>  -  <a href=\"https://warpcast.com/idriss\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Farcaster</a>  -  <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RJhJKamjw5\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Discord</a>  -  <a href=\"https://idriss.mirror.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mirror Blog</a>  -  <a href=\"https://docs.idriss.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Docs</a>  -  <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p>Feedback and ideas are very welcome.

We played a fun game of Human Bingo as an icebreaker ‚Äì kudos <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan\">@CoachJonathan</a> for organizing. I‚Äôd be remiss not to note that the Grants Lab product team ( <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/melissa\">@melissa</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/michelle_ma\">@michelle_ma</a> and yours truly) brought home the proverbial bingo trophies.</p>\n<p>We also held a Q&amp;A where the team was invited to send anonymous questions answered by leaders across the DAO. We received over 20 questions that led to a great discussion. We should do this format more often ‚Äì I will plan to roll it out for GL Monthly Meetings. <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet\">@deltajuliet</a> is leading a summary of the Q&amp;A that will be posted to the governance forum, and raw questions can be found here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iwrEctEaW7gKYTkOCy_NkK1WxLb_YfT9exfDE_lhhd8/edit?usp=sharing\">Lisbon Q&amp;A</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, we held a presentation by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> and myself on the <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/whitepaper\">Gitcoin 2.0 Whitepaper</a>. This was a great review and deep engagement and discussion from the team.</p>\n<p>Many of the Q&amp;A questions centered around Gitcoin‚Äôs financial strategy, which myself, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet\">@deltajuliet</a> , and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> spent time at the offsite talking about.

We‚Äôre focused on using our existing treasury and current bull market conditions to buy ourselves time and stability. This may include diversification of GTC into stablecoins, investigating yield generation efforts, and more.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, the Grants Lab team is focused on building network effects for eventual financial sustainability. The most important thing is to build Allo GMV growth and widespread Allo adoption (including, but not limited to Grants Stack adoption.) While we are focused on adoption, we will trial value capture mechanisms to validate that value capture can work at scale. After network effects are achieved, we will focus on scaling value capture mechanisms with the goal of financial upside and eventual financial sustainability.</p>\n<p>We will provide regular updates and revisit these goals in 12-18 months!</p>\n<h1><a name=\"day-2-3-grants-lab-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#day-2-3-grants-lab-2\"></a>Day 2 &amp; 3 (Grants Lab)</h1>\n<p>The Grants Lab + RPP teams spent the bulk of the retreat talking about how to increase Allo GMV. We have a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù goal of $15M in 2024. This is based on our $5M GMV achieved in 2023 and feels like an achievable, business-as-usual goal for this year and we‚Äôre tracking this publicly. We also have a stretch goal of $50M in 2024. This is our BHAG ‚Äì we think it is totally achievable if we get creative and push ourselves to think outside the box.</p>\n<p>We spent a lot of time building context on the market, our pipeline, and our competitors.

These include optimizing our sales cycle &amp; time to close, expanding our partnerships with current clients, and opening up more opportunities with organizations that are primed for growth this cycle.</p>\n<p>We explored and brainstormed different ways to hit $50M GMV this year and took bets on where they might come from: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18g5YuBU2DJOGTEbtWupZhrdBEraqQ1c-dXq-JiYI0CU/edit#heading=h.q58f0nx5vrm9\">$50gmv betting exercise</a>. We have a clear focus on selling into large treasuries as well as a number of bets we can place in innovative product and GTM strategies.</p>\n<p>With that innovation in mind, we also talked about where opportunities lie across different mechanisms. QF is our bread and butter, and we will continue to invest in making this an excellent product. Easy RPGF could be big ‚Äì or not! We‚Äôll be able to tell after the pilot program, which is currently running. We also believe that there is still lots of potential for Direct Grants, but we need to improve the product &amp; marketing for this to be successful.</p>\n<p>We were lucky to welcome the Rapid Prototyping Pod into Grants Lab meetings during the offsite and really enjoyed this collaboration. There‚Äôs been discussions about the future home of RPP now that <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> is taking on the CTO role in Grants Lab.

Here is the question I am interested in getting feedback on - <strong>Is it okay for Gitcoin‚Äôs dApps (like Passport, or Grants Stack) to create projects and apply to participate in GG20 as other grantees/projects normally would?</strong></p>\n<p>Gitcoin has been given a large amount of matching pool funds to be distributed using the QF mechanism with the intention of funding Ethereum‚Äôs Public Goods. To date, Gitcoin has distributed a large amount of this funding to a variety of projects across a number of categories (DeFi, Climate, NFTs, OSS, Community, etc.). Gitcoin facilitates the grants rounds using our credibly neutral QF mechanism and we have been responsible for driving user participation in those rounds and drawing in community donations to support future rounds.</p>\n<p>I want to better understand if the community has concerns with Gitcoin participating in these rounds as projects/grantees as well. No special treatment in Grants Stack would be provided to the Gitcoin Projects, but because the funds were earmarked for funding Ethereum‚Äôs public goods, it would be great to have Gitcoin‚Äôs dApps participate in that funding. Ultimately donors will decide if they want to donate, but allowing access/inclusion in the round would be valuable.</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts? Would you donate to a Gitcoin project? Are you okay with Gitcoin‚Äôs dApps receiving money from the matching pool?</p>\n<p>I believe Gitcoin‚Äôs dApps should be allowed to apply and should be treated equally like other projects (CLR.fund, Giveth, etc.). But, we want to make sure that before I apply to the round we have some community sentiment on if a conflict of interest exists here.</p>\n<p>Drop thoughts below!</p>\n            <p><small>19 posts - 11 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-gitcoins-dapp-eligibility-in-the-gitcoin-grants-rounds-gg20/18622\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-gitcoins-dapp-eligibility-in-the-gitcoin-grants-rounds-gg20/18622","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 18:50:01 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18622"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-gitcoins-dapp-eligibility-in-the-gitcoin-grants-rounds-gg20/18622.rss","#text":"[Discussion] Gitcoin's dApp eligibility in the Gitcoin Grants Rounds (GG20)"}},{"title":"Steward Onboarding Call","dc:creator":"system","category":"üëã News and Community","description":"<h2><a name=\"gm-gitcoin-stewards-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#gm-gitcoin-stewards-1\"></a>GM Gitcoin Stewards!</h2>\n<p>We are resuming regular Steward onboarding calls for new Stewards.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"who-is-this-for-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#who-is-this-for-2\"></a>Who is this for?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Anyone who is interested in being a Steward at Gitcoin.</li>\n<li>Someone who has already signed up and either feels lost or wants to better understand how they can contribute.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"what-to-expect-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-to-expect-3\"></a>What to expect?</h2>\n<p>You‚Äôll receive a 30 min introduction to Gitcoin, its structure, governance mechanics and details on how to get started.

Steward, delegator and governance coordinator as governooor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delegate the responsibility for updating the manual to the governance coordinator: Since the manual only reflects changes made by gitcoin governance, updating it should not require a DAO vote.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#next-steps-5\"></a>Next Steps:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Collect feedback from the community</li>\n<li>Submit a formal proposal</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-addressing-immediate-gaps-in-dao-governance/18620\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-addressing-immediate-gaps-in-dao-governance/18620","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 09:33:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18620"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-addressing-immediate-gaps-in-dao-governance/18620.rss","#text":"[Discussion] Addressing immediate gaps in DAO governance"}},{"title":"[PASSED] Gitcoin (Grants Lab) x Wonderland Partnership","dc:creator":"deltajuliet","category":"üìú Proposals","description":"<h2><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR:</h2>\n<p>We‚Äôre asking for 31.25k GTC /mo for a 4-year engagement (1.5M GTC total) with Wonderland to Build Allo Protocol.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wonderland\">@Wonderland</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/meglister\">@meglister</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> for co-creating this proposal. <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12\" title=\":pray:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":pray:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Wonderland (<a href=\"https://defi.sucks/\">defi.sucks</a>) is a team of developers, researchers, and creators who love building innovative solutions.

The tokens will begin to vest linearly from their starting date (TBC based on this proposal‚Äôs reception). Additionally, there is a two-month cliff; should Wonderland‚Äôs contract be terminated before the 2-month trial period ends, Gitcoin has the ability to activate the clawback function and reclaim 100% of the tokens. After the two-month mark, Gitcoin retains the right to retrieve all unvested tokens if the agreement is terminated. Both parties may terminate this agreement at any time effective immediately upon 15-days prior written notice to the other party due to any failure of either party‚Äôs obligations under what‚Äôs stated in this proposal.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the two-month trial, the Grants Lab team, led by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/meglister\">@meglister</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> , will assess Wonderland‚Äôs contributions and update this forum with their findings and guidance on continuing this partnership.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"wonderlands-partner-feedback-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#wonderlands-partner-feedback-7\"></a>Wonderland‚Äôs Partner Feedback</h2>\n<p>From <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wonderland\">@Wonderland</a> : Don‚Äôt trust, verify.

It emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extendable code that accomplishes a single task well. This philosophy is foundational to the development and design of Unix and its various offspring, including Linux. Key tenets of the Unix philosophy include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make each program do one thing well: Instead of creating complex programs that attempt to do many tasks, Unix encourages developers to build simple programs focused on one task. This makes the programs easier to develop, understand, and maintain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program: This encourages the design of programs that can work together, using pipelines and filters to pass data from one utility to another.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks: This principle emphasizes the importance of quick prototyping and iterative development.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build a prototype as soon as possible: Similar to ‚Äútry early‚Äù, this principle pushes for a working model that can be tested and improved upon, rather than trying to make it perfect the first time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use software leverage to your advantage: Reuse code when possible instead of reinventing the wheel, benefiting from the collective effort of the developer community.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Unix philosophy has influenced not only the development of Unix and Linux but also the design of software and operating systems across the computing landscape. It emphasizes efficiency, simplicity, and the importance of open standards and interoperability.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"why-is-the-unix-philosophy-powerful-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#why-is-the-unix-philosophy-powerful-4\"></a>Why is the Unix Philosophy powerful?</h2>\n<p>The Unix philosophy‚Äôs power lies in its emphasis on simplicity, modularity, and composability, principles that make software development more efficient and maintainable. By advocating for programs that do one thing well and work together seamlessly, it ensures systems are both robust and adaptable. This approach reduces complexity, making software easier to understand, debug, and enhance over time. Additionally, the focus on a universal interface and the encouragement of rapid prototyping and tool reuse accelerates development and fosters innovation, allowing developers to quickly iterate on ideas and leverage existing solutions.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Unix philosophy‚Äôs emphasis on portability and open standards has broadened software‚Äôs utility and longevity, ensuring applications can run across different environments and evolve alongside technological advances. This has not only democratized access to technology but also cultivated an ecosystem where interoperability and collaboration are foundational . As a result, the Unix philosophy has had a profound and lasting impact on software engineering, influencing not just Unix-derived systems but the broader landscape of computing and development practices.</p>\n<p>The modular approach supports the dynamic, distributed nature of DAOs like Gitcoin‚Äôs. The unix philosophy enables continuous integration, development, and community-driven innovation, making it a fitting philosophy for this new era of software development.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"monolithic-software-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#monolithic-software-5\"></a>Monolithic software</h2>\n<p>Monolithic software contrasts sharply with the Unix philosophy through its approach to design and functionality. Where the Unix philosophy advocates for simplicity, modularity, and the development of small, interoperable programs that each perform one task well, monolithic software typically bundles a wide range of functionalities within a single codebase. This integration means that tasks and features in monolithic applications are deeply entwined, making it challenging to modify, update, or scale individual components without affecting the entire system. As a result, monolithic systems can become complex and cumbersome, hindering rapid development and adaptability.</p>\n<p>While monolithic applications may initially be simpler to deploy and manage, the Unix philosophy‚Äôs approach typically offers greater efficiency, adaptability, and resilience over the software‚Äôs lifecycle.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"modular-software-gitcoin-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#modular-software-gitcoin-6\"></a>Modular software @ Gitcoin</h2>\n<p>Having built Gitcoin 1.0 the wrong way (cGrants was a monolith that was expensive and slow to maintain)‚Ä¶ I believe that Gitcoin should fully adopt the unix philosophy in its software development.</p>\n<p>This is already partially true.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our software is built upon modular blockchains.</li>\n<li>Allo protocol contains several different strategies: QF, RetroPGF.</li>\n<li>Grants stack contains several small applications:\n<ol>\n<li>Explorer - for browsing grants</li>\n<li>Builder - for building grants</li>\n<li>Manager - for making QF rounds</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But it is also partially false</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Allo strategies are all in the same repository.</li>\n<li>Allo strategies do not have corresponding webapps.</li>\n<li>Grants Stack‚Äôs modular apps are bundled into one repository and for many intents and purposes, one monolithic app.</li>\n<li>We are beginning to develop monolithic tendencies as a team (merging modular tools.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"modular-software-gitcoin-would-enable-bottoms-up-innovation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#modular-software-gitcoin-would-enable-bottoms-up-innovation-7\"></a>Modular software @ Gitcoin would enable bottoms up innovation</h2>\n<p>Right now the core apps at Gitcoin are</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explorer - for browsing grants</li>\n<li>Builder - for building grants</li>\n<li>Manager - for making QF rounds</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These apps work pretty well for what they do‚Ä¶ But let‚Äôs explore things they don‚Äôt do.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explorer is a plain vanilla way of exploring grants.

These incentives will include both ARB tokens and Thrive Points (which will be redeemable at the launch of Thrive DAO this summer). We have tried to strategically target this to drive meaningful participation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These additional bonuses will be available via Thrive Protocol working on behalf of Arbitrum DAO who is a sponsor of the OSS Rounds, the community rounds and other rounds that have applied for funding and fit within certain criteria. See below for more on matching funds below.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>During GG20</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>During the round grantees and community members will be able to claim rewards for posting about the projects they have supported and why they supported them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There will be bonuses for the most popular posts (based on reviewers‚Äô assessments and social media metrics).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There will be token rewards for hosting twitter spaces with other grantees.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There will be rewards for producing content that helps support or onboard new community members.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>After GG20</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Round operators will have incentives for how well they run rounds including paying funds out on time and the assessment of participants.

They do that with a strategically customized mix of incentives and feedback loops tailor made for each community they serve. What that looks like in practice is the assessment of the work of both grantees and grants program operators which is done by sets of reviewers using the same rubric.</p>\n<p>Key considerations of the Rubric we will use: timely execution of milestones, expert review of code, community adoption/ use (if applicable), and a overall assessment of quality from expert and general community reviewers. We will share more on the rubric and opportunities to weigh soon.</p>\n<p>A big thank you to Sejal, Sov, Mathilda, Meg, Laura, and everyone else at Gitcoin. I am so grateful for the thoughtful partnership and graceful brilliance of everyone on both of these teams, as well as all the community members, grantees, and partners who have helped shape this plan. It genuinely feels to me like a win-win-win-win scenario that can generate exponential growth for everyone involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>\n<p>Drive up community participation, project quality and verified impact.

By adopting a strategic approach to asset management, governance, and community engagement, we can ensure our mission‚Äôs long-term resilience and effectiveness in funding public goods.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"next-steps-for-execution-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#next-steps-for-execution-13\"></a>Next Steps for Execution:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Formal Proposals for some of the items mentioned above:</strong> Each component of our strategy will be detailed in individual forum proposals for community discussion and voting - starting with a yield generation proposal, swaps from the CSDO wallet, further leveraging <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle\">@kyle</a>‚Äôs <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-withdraw-and-leverage-partial-usdc-balance-in-treasury/15484\">diversification proposal</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Treasury Committee Consideration:</strong> Based on community feedback, we may form a committee to oversee the execution of these strategies, ensuring transparency and effectiveness.
