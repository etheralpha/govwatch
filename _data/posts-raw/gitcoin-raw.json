By removing this governance step, we can streamline the process and distribute matching funds more quickly to grant recipients.</p>\n<p>The ratification vote has served an important role in maintaining transparency and community approval for past funding rounds. However, as the Gitcoin Grants program continues to mature and refine its processes, this extra governance step has become redundant and unnecessarily delays payouts. We will still publish results but won‚Äôt have to formally request the funds from the Matching Pool in order to do so.</p>\n<p>The Gitcoin team has shown a strong commitment to transparency and fairness in fund distribution. Our upgraded methodologies and tools, such as the cluster-matching quadratic funding mechanism (COCM) and Passport‚Äôs model-based detection system, have significantly enhanced our ability to allocate funds objectively and resist sybil attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>By removing ratification, we can realize the following benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster payouts to grant recipients after each round concludes</li>\n<li>Reduced overhead and operational strain on the Gitcoin team</li>\n<li>Implicit trust in Gitcoin‚Äôs processes and methodologies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will continue to publicly disclose all relevant data, methodologies and funding calculations for each round.

From multiple meetings with various city officials, collecting the data on city‚Äôs grants programs, analysing it, presenting at <a href=\"https://innovation.eurasia.undp.org/urban-transformation/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UNDP</a> conference for cities, researching the needed tech stacks and potential integrations, to narrowing down the how and where we would use QF.</p>\n<p>Also, I applied for EF Next Billion with this project in mind. Not only the <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/24/next-billion-cohort4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">project was selected</a> as one of the very few, but it got additional funding for the purpose of building the app.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-are-we-building-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-are-we-building-3\"></a>What are we building?</h2>\n<p>Ethereum has a number of protocols and apps that are both mature enough and solve a need a city has. We are building an open-source app customised for cities, which will serve as an interface to the Ethereum ecosystem of apps and protocols. Premier example of these, and the first one we want to offer access to is Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>One of the most important things cities do, is allocating money for public goods. Whether they need direct grants, QF, retro funding or something else, they could and should use Allo protocol. We intend on running our grant programs on Allo protocol.</p>\n<p>Gitcoin has built Grants Stack for the purpose of providing an easy and powerful interface for using Allo protocol. While using Allo protocol is a non-brainer for us, for Grants Stack we have some obstacles to use it as-is. It comes with its own set of features which are not directly usable by cities in their interaction with non-web3-native citizens, while some features which are needed are missing. We want to use as much of Grants stack as possible, but we have yet to look deeper and decide how to do it.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the things we‚Äôll probably need to do differently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we need to offer users an in-app non-custodial wallet with no need to manage private keys (we plan to use Cometh Connect for this)</li>\n<li>we need to offer simple in-app onramp solution which works well with local banks, cards, currencies and KYC requirements.</li>\n<li>we need to abstract away the cryptocurrency used, so that users who top up euros, see euro balance (which means we need to use euro stablecoin)</li>\n<li>we need to make it in local language with local legal documents</li>\n<li>we need to be able to support different types of grants than what is currently supported by Gitcoin. (Eg. citizens propose projects, but the city gets the money and executes)</li>\n<li>we need to use city-specific tools and available data for sybil resistance, and possibly for KYC</li>\n<li>we need to only show the rounds which a citizen can participate in</li>\n<li>we might need to integrate a forum for discussions on the rounds</li>\n<li>we might need to integrate an option for donors to vote on disbursement of funds after the execution</li>\n<li>we might need to allow for documents submission</li>\n<li>we might need to add additional types of fields in the submission forms</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"where-are-we-now-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#where-are-we-now-4\"></a>Where are we now?</h2>\n<p>To advance [or help implement] this project I was recently selected as part of the Ethereum Foundation‚Äôs Next Billion Fellowship Program.  With their advisory and financial support we will build a minimum viable app for the purpose of running one specific QF grant round in Split, Croatia. Unfortunately, this funding is limited and besides building the app for pilot, doesn‚Äôt cover much more.</p>\n<p>Also, there are multiple grant programs with multiple grant rounds which we could run through the app as well. We could just run the pilot, or we could build such an MVP, which would be usable by any city or other institution to run local grant programs on Ethereum and Allo. We have already started talks with UNDP about this possibility. They work directly with more than 100 cities and national governments, and thourgh their network, we could reach more users quickly.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-do-we-expect-from-the-pilot-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-do-we-expect-from-the-pilot-5\"></a>What do we expect from the pilot?</h2>\n<p>The pilot will run in Split in September 2024. with a goal of at least 30 proposals and 1500 citizens donating (1% of population).</p>\n<p>These citizens will be onboarded on Ethereum and Gitcoin.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-do-we-expect-to-achieve-with-additional-funding-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-do-we-expect-to-achieve-with-additional-funding-6\"></a>What do we expect to achieve with additional funding?</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"june-2024-november-2024-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#june-2024-november-2024-7\"></a>June 2024 - November 2024</h3>\n<p>We will create an app and run a successful pilot in the city of Split during the fellowship ().

Thank you to my co-author, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a>, and for the key inputs from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sejalrekhan\">@sejalrekhan</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov\">@Sov</a>. As we continue to move forward and iterate on the grants program, it‚Äôs important to take stock on learnings and community feedback to inform the decision we make ahead of the remainder of this year and as we look into 2025.</p>\n<p>Below I am sharing a summary of the post, with the link to the detailed Mirror post for those who want to take some time for a deep dive.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Duration of GG20: <strong>April 23 - May 7, 2024</strong></li>\n<li>Key Learnings: Governance, Grantee Experience, Donor Experience, Operations</li>\n<li>Future Plans: Continuous improvement and innovation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Gitcoin Grants, a community-driven funding initiative, has facilitated over 3,500 projects with $60M distributed since 2019. GG20, running from April 23 to May 7, 2024, saw a $1.6M matching pool, the election of a Community Council, a protocol upgrade, and an improved sybil resistance strategy.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-learnings-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#key-learnings-2\"></a>Key Learnings:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Governance:</strong> The new Community Round governance process required proposals reviewed and voted on by a newly elected Community Council. The top five rounds received an extra $25K each in matching funds. Moving forward, Gitcoin plans to include more rounds in the marketing efforts, above and beyond of the top 5 chosen for extra matching funds.</li>\n<li><strong>Grantee Experience:</strong> Improvements in communication and platform navigation led to an 81% satisfaction rate among grantees (which met our key success metric). Positive feedback highlighted the need for better marketing resources, a more user-friendly grantee portal, and clearer guidance on creating strong grant proposals. Future plans include enhancing resources, such as Canva kits, and providing streamlined application processes for returning grantees.</li>\n<li><strong>Donor Experience:</strong> Despite a decrease in the number of donors, each donor contributed more, leading to a $27K increase in crowdfunding. Focus on retaining first-time donors and simplifying the donation process is essential. Strategies include potentially collecting donor emails for updates and making the donation process more user-friendly, especially for new donors. Running all rounds on Arbitrum and partnering with ThankARB enhanced the donor experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Operations:</strong> The introduction of decentralized review processes with ‚ÄúTeam Tiger‚Äù and the use of the AI-based tool ‚ÄúChecker‚Äù improved transparency and efficiency. Clearer instructions and better support for grantees were identified as areas for further improvement. Future plans include refining the review process, enhancing support during the application phase, and expediting payout timelines by improving the QF/COCM calculator app and pre-approving matching results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"moving-forward-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#moving-forward-3\"></a>Moving Forward:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marketing</strong>: Expand marketing efforts to include more community rounds, providing broader exposure and support to teams beyond the top five. This approach aims to ensure a more inclusive and impactful experience for all participants.</li>\n<li><strong>Grantee Support:</strong> Enhance resources to guide grantees in successfully marketing their grants. Improve the grantee portal to be more user-friendly and easier to navigate. Provide clearer resources on creating strong grant proposals and consider rolling applications for returning grantees to streamline the process. Finding ways to build a stronger builder community centered around mentorship, growth and education.</li>\n<li><strong>Donor Retention:</strong> Implement strategies to retain donors by collecting their emails for updates and exploring ways to allow grantees to email their donors. Make the donation process more user-friendly and continue promoting the popular collections feature to make the experience more social and engaging.</li>\n<li><strong>Operations:</strong> Continue refining the review process and expediting payout timelines. Improve support for grantees during the application phase and enhance project impact reporting. Maintain a fair and transparent process by not making team member wallet addresses public and focusing on the core mission of supporting open-source software and digital public goods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gitcoin is committed to evolving its grants program to be more resilient, inclusive, and impactful. The insights from GG20 will guide future strategies, ensuring continuous improvement and innovation as we move forward to GG21 and GG22. As we move into a multi-mechanism future, further experimentation and expansion will be enabled as we continue to evolve.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitcoin.mirror.xyz/GyT9ZE_PuopPVwSlgRIF-o7cm_ZTCqcXBKXMCNkc1Sk\">Read the detailed post here</a></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-reflections-insights-and-future-plans/19045\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-reflections-insights-and-future-plans/19045","pubDate":"Wed, 26 Jun 2024 11:04:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19045"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-reflections-insights-and-future-plans/19045.rss","#text":"GG20 Reflections, Insights, and Future Plans"}},{"title":"Onchain Capital Allocation Handbook","dc:creator":"owocki","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>At ETHcc this year I will be launching a new book entitled the <strong>Onchain Capital Allocation Handbook</strong>.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863\" title=\"GQ3Ki7kWMAAmmUD\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_338x499.jpeg\" alt=\"GQ3Ki7kWMAAmmUD\" data-base62-sha1=\"ndxEc7u8sxgMm5BUm5wBFCxyUv1\" width=\"338\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_338x499.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_507x748.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_676x998.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ADA9A1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://twitter.com/owocki\">DM me on twitter</a> if you would like an invite.

If you‚Äôve ever paid bills, taxes, or repaid friends for a meal, you‚Äôve allocated capital.</p>\n<p>Capital allocation can become a full time job: governments and grant-making organi- zations spend vast amounts of time and money figuring out the process, logistics, and decision-making involved in allocating capital. At scale, capital allocation inevitably be- comes mired in gatekeeping, rivalrous decision making, and lack of transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>Crypto with its programmable smart contracts, present incredible advantages towards allocating capital in an efficient, effective, and transparent manner.</p>\n<p>The internet revolutionized how information was distributed in society. If crypto succeeds in revolutionizing how society distributes scarce resources, it follows that it will upend, and improve, how we do capital allocation.</p>\n<p>What if we could solve coordination failures with capital allocation? What if we could create better, more sovereign, collective action? How might we bring centuries old capital allocation strategies onchain?

This is a set of open-source (creative commons) resources designed to empower growth leaders to create and manage high-impact grants programs within the web3 space.</p>\n<p>The project was birthed out of a question that we kept getting asked: ‚ÄúHow do I launch a grants program? Where do I even start?‚Äù</p>\n<p>So we went to work building a simple design tool that breaks down each step into manageable pieces that makes it easy for the most novice of grants operators to launch a program.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"streamlined-grantmaking-with-the-grants-program-canvas-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#streamlined-grantmaking-with-the-grants-program-canvas-1\"></a>Streamlined Grantmaking with the Grants Program Canvas</h3>\n<p>Our launch is mainly focused on introducing and driving adoption for the Grants Program Canvas ‚Äî which is a tool that visualizes the different elements of a grants program in phases (Define, Design, Execute and Learn), each with specific quadrants leading users through a complete process for program design.</p>\n<p>Taking inspo from the <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-business-model-canvas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">business model canvas</a>, we believe that this framework could become a standard for more comprehensive and streamlined grantmaking that has been a major gap for web3 ecosystems.</p>\n<p>The exciting part about this tool is that it can be used for both grants program creation AND evaluation and elevation of existing programs.</p>\n<p>We are already using this too internally to evaluate the Citizens Retro and are incorporating the tool in our grants services offerings as well.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://grantscanvas.gitcoin.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">download the canvas here</a> and upload it into any whiteboard tool to get started with it.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921\" title=\"Screenshot_2024-06-25_at_15.16.11\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921_2_618x500.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_2024-06-25_at_15.16.11\" data-base62-sha1=\"uYJya7Qd99dWhnxydRviyEm971L\" width=\"618\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921_2_618x500.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921_2_927x750.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"BECAD4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"dive-deeper-with-the-grants-program-design-playbook-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#dive-deeper-with-the-grants-program-design-playbook-2\"></a>Dive Deeper with the Grants Program Design Playbook</h2>\n<p>The comprehensive 100+ page guide dives deeper into each quadrant of the Canvas, offering invaluable tools insights.

We are driving towards $50M in GMV this year and a north star of $1B in GMV through Allo over the next several years.</p>\n<p>To hit these goals, we need best-in-class contributor talent that is motivated and aligned with our mission and ambition.</p>\n<p>Token grants are a key tool we have to create those alignments. After all ‚Äì the idea that we can program our values into money to ensure alignment is central to <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/whitepaper/read\">our vision for capital allocation</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"structure-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#structure-2\"></a>Structure</h1>\n<p>I propose that every contributor to Grants Lab is eligible for a 4-year token grant. These grants will be subject to linear vesting schedules and a 1-year cliff. Contributors who have been at Gitcoin for over a year and have not previously received a token grant will be eligible for an accelerated 6-month cliff, instead of 1 year.</p>\n<p>This proposal covers all current contributors to Grants Labs as well as an option pool for future contributors. In total, 3M GTC is requested. This represents 3% of the supply of GTC and is aligned with (or below) industry standards for team allocations. Though team allocations are typically only done at launch, Gitcoin has evolved substantially since the token launch in 2021. Most of the team that was present in 2021 are no longer active contributors, and the vast majority (80%) of current contributors do not have any token grants.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"potential-risks-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#potential-risks-3\"></a>Potential Risks</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Operational overhead\n<ul>\n<li>This will be part of the Grants Lab budgeting process and we will use available tools on the market (Liquifi or Hedgey or Gnosis Safe) to minimize overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How can we avoid negative impacts to the organization?\n<ul>\n<li>Tokens, once earned (including vesting), are wholly owned by the contributor and they have the freedom to do whatever they want with them. This autonomy and ownership are core to the culture we want to build.</li>\n<li>Additionally, unlocks will occur over a long period of time (4 years) to minimize potential disruption.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why now / how is this fiscally responsible?\n<ul>\n<li>As mentioned above, we‚Äôre at a critical juncture in Gitcoin‚Äôs ambition. Token grants are a tool we are deploying to ensure the success of our organization through creating a talented and aligned contributor base.

Owocki will not be requesting token grants through this program.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What about individuals who have current token grants?\n<ul>\n<li>These will be negotiated on an individual basis and may be transitioned to the new structure if the individual consents.

To remain at the forefront, we must adapt and innovate rapidly. This means developing highly configurable, custom solutions that cater to the specific needs of our community and partners. We are dedicating more energy to these key areas and focusing our resources on onboarding every web3 grants program into Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>In line with our proactive approach, we are hyperfocused on making adjustments that concentrate us on the greatest impact and alignment for our mission. As Passport spins out and we streamline the Grants Lab and Ecosystem Collective teams, we aim continue to strengthen  and position ourselves for future success. We intend to move more work into the community, leveraging their expertise and enthusiasm to deliver updates across Gitcoin more efficiently.</p>\n<p>We understand that these changes come with their challenges and will impact some of our valued contributors. We are committed to providing financial support and assistance to those affected during this transition, helping them find new roles within the industry or beyond.</p>\n<p>We want to assure all community members, stewards, and token holders that these changes have been taken very seriously and carefully considered. Our intention is to make Gitcoin as operationally efficient as possible while continuously bolstering our efforts to grow adoption for our suite of products, and knowledge base, further ensuring their longevity.</p>\n<p>I want to thank and show my genuine gratitude for the work that the Ecosystem Collective team has poured into the heart and soul of Gitcoin, and I‚Äôm optimistic that we‚Äôll have further opportunities to work together again in the future.

We learned so much over the past 3 rounds (see <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/citizens-round-a-case-study-retroactive-qf\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/overall-learnings-from-gcp-004-and-gitcoin-citizens-round-2-results/17201\">here</a> and this recent <a href=\"https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK8Zo6Ok=/?share_link_id=825112287835\">internal retro</a>), incrementally improving this initiative‚Äôs success and impact, with Round <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span> being the <a href=\"https://x.com/GitcoinCitizens/status/1780596740728430821\">most successful one to date</a>. We will continue to apply these learnings in what‚Äôs next.</p>\n<p>Now, let‚Äôs dive in.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-we-know-so-far-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-we-know-so-far-1\"></a>What we know so far:</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"timing-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#timing-2\"></a>Timing</h3>\n<p>Deviating from what was announced <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-proposed-updates/17649\">previously</a>,  <strong>we are now planning to run Citizens Retro <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2024-strategy-outline/18991\">after GG21</a>,</strong> which will allow us to reward Citizens for work done over the two preceding rounds, increase the available funding, and focus on some internal reorganization (more on this below), which will ideally lead to more impact, both for Gitcoin and for all Citizens.</p>\n<p>We are planning to run <strong>Citizens Retro <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> from September 24 to October 8, with applications opening up on August 27</strong>. This timing will be confirmed once we have secured the full budget.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"budget-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#budget-3\"></a>Budget</h3>\n<p>We have funding available for one more round through the current GCP. However, we plan to request an additional budget to bring <strong>the total sum of matching funding to 100K GTC</strong> ($125.000 at time of writing). We are announcing this well in advance, to invite Citizens to start working today towards earning their fair share of this budget tomorrow.</p>\n<p>This is the largest amount we‚Äôve allocated to Citizens to date, effectively doubling the matching. Our previous rounds had matching funds of 20K, 22K and 50K GTC respectively, not counting donations. Additionally, <strong>we hope to secure extra funding</strong> through external support, as we did in the past with the help of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> (respectively 4.20 eth + 10K GTC in the last two rounds) and Arbitrum (who doubled our matching for Retro <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span>).</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to get to work right now, you can and should</strong>: <a href=\"https://gitcoin.notion.site/Discord-Access-Guide-for-Citizens-5a91a307428b43c6966a5466438ff9fd\">join our Discord</a>,<a href=\"https://lu.ma/calendar/cal-yYcYQVROlvvWseF\"> attend Citizen office hours</a>, <a href=\"https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Idea-Board-3d839ea2b299495d9e4a6268cf1e0f9e\">dive into our idea board, propose your own ideas</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/GitcoinCitizens\">and follow us on X for inspiration</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-we-would-love-feedback-on-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-we-would-love-feedback-on-4\"></a>What we would love feedback on:</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"engage-builder-citizens-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#engage-builder-citizens-5\"></a>Engage Builder Citizens</h3>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoin-s-ratified-essential-intents-2023-2024-and-a-recap-of-our-successes/16818\">updated essential intents</a>, the focus of the Gitcoin team is more than ever on increasing <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2024-gmv-strategy-overview-grants-lab/18805\">Allo‚Äôs GMV</a>.

After an entirely retroactive round, one mixed, and another retroactive one, each on a different network, <strong>we are now planning to run our next round as <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack/rpgf\">a fully retroactive funding round, with badgeholders (RetroPGF).</a></strong> We have a lot of in-house experience with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a>‚Äôs team, who built one of the two frontends for <a href=\"https://round3.optimism.io/projects?after=undefined&amp;display=grid&amp;sort=mostAwarded&amp;search=&amp;seed=1718378572712&amp;categories=\">Optimism RPGF Round 3</a>, and Gitcoin is now also offering this <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack/rpgf\">as a service</a>.</p>\n<p>Next to our enthusiasm about <strong>dogfooding all things Gitcoin</strong>, we also have noticed how it is very often the same limited group of warm-hearted people donating to these public greats. We want to address <strong>potential donor fatigue,</strong> and see how only working with voting could influence the results of our next round. Next to this, it will allow us to work with <strong>categories of submitted work</strong>, which will make it easier to evaluate submissions, and potentially allocate funds in a different way.</p>\n<p>Switching to RPGF will be our biggest experiment yet, and we have a lot of things to figure out by then. <strong>We feel very inspired, and would like to use this opportunity to ask for your input on organizing this round.</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the questions that have come up for us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who should be the <strong>badgeholders</strong>, the voters for our round? Should it be all GG grantees? All donors? Should it only be participants of previous Citizens rounds?</li>\n<li>Should <strong>GTC holders</strong> be voters for this round, and if so, how do we set this up? Do we use simple voting, quadratic voting, conviction voting, ‚Ä¶? Should we mix grantees and GTC holders? Or try something else?</li>\n<li>Do we keep our successful <strong><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/signal-boosting-for-gitcoin-citizens-retro-3/18518\">signal boosting experiment</a></strong> in the mix, and how do we make this work with badgeholders? Do they have double or quadratic voting power, versus badgeholders just having one vote?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have so many questions (and a few potential answers) but first of all: we want to hear your thoughts. Let us know in the comments!</p>\n<h3><a name=\"one-more-thing-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#one-more-thing-7\"></a>One more thing</h3>\n<p>Lastly, <strong>I‚Äôve decided to step down as the main round operator for the Gitcoin Citizens Retro rounds, so we are looking for someone new</strong>.

GG supports both early-stage and more mature builders across the wider Ethereum ecosystem and  is run by Gitcoin core contributors. <strong><em>These rounds run twice annually.</em></strong></p>\n<p>With Gitcoin Grants 20, we refocused on our core mission of supporting open-source software and digital public goods and started on a journey to redefine how we continually fund and sustain the digital infrastructure that underpins our modern world.</p>\n<p><em>You have our commitment that we will work tirelessly to continue to create a more resilient, inclusive, and thriving future.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-rounds-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-rounds-4\"></a>Community Rounds</h3>\n<p>GG20 was the first iteration of a new Community Round structure: we created a dedicated pool of funds (up to $125K quarterly) available to support ‚Äúmatching on matching‚Äù pools and highlighting them alongside the Program rounds. Communities with any amount raised for matching and meeting the round criteria could apply for up to $25K in funding from Gitcoin to go toward their matching pool. The Community Council (a Gitcoin DAO-elected external council) reviews applications and votes on which communities to fund and accept into the round.

Note that due to time constraints, we will only run three GG rounds in 2024:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GG20:</strong> April 23 - May 7th [COMPLETED]\n<ul>\n<li><em>OSS Program (4 rounds) $1M Matching Pool</em></li>\n<li><em>5+ Community Rounds</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GG21:</strong> August 7 - 21\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ecosystem ‚ÄòSpotlight‚Äô Rounds</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ecosystem Rounds will now have the opportunity to share the stage alongside the community rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>10 Community Rounds</em></li>\n<li><em>$125k allocated towards matching for top 5 Community Rounds</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GG22:</strong> End of October (exact dates announced in the coming weeks)\n<ul>\n<li><em>OSS Program (4 rounds) $1M Matching Pool</em></li>\n<li><em>8 Community Rounds</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>During OSS rounds, our internal resources will likely be more constrained and due to this, we will only be able to support 8.

Because the Gitcoin Grants matching pool are funds that were entrusted to us by the community (separate from our treasury), it‚Äôs important that we run a program that is sustainable for the long term, which will create a runway for our builders well into the future beyond the next few years. To fund what matters to us, we realize we have to take steps to ensure financial sustainability, but still serve our community and builders in a foundational way.  Additionally, as Gitcoin grows its presence and product stack to the wider Web3 Ecosystem we want to allow these groups to be able to run during GG.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"learnings-from-past-rounds-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#learnings-from-past-rounds-6\"></a><strong>Learnings from Past Rounds</strong></h2>\n<p>Reflecting on past rounds, we‚Äôve gleaned several critical learnings that have shaped our 2024 strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Matching Algorithms:</strong> We‚Äôve improved our Quadratic Funding algorithms to better match contributions with projects, ensuring a more equitable distribution of funds. This has been done through the use of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/nerd-post-updates-to-cluster-mapping-matching/18705&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1718383498828793&amp;usg=AOvVaw3zm5wpN0R4XtOjQ6nZhIGs\">COCM</a> and Passport‚Äôs Model Based Detection: a <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524\">two-pronged sybil resistance strategy</a> that we rolled out in GG20, which proved to be incredibly successful.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Feedback:</strong> Incorporating feedback from participants has been invaluable. We‚Äôve streamlined the application process and introduced more robust support systems to assist grantees. GG20 saw an 80% grantee satisfaction rate, the highest we‚Äôve seen in at least the past year. <em>This was measured through a GG20 grantee survey conducted, where we received more than 70 detailed responses.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Operations:</strong> We saw the need for improving our operations for an enhanced user experience, and in GG20 we introduced Checker and ‚ÄòTeam Tiger‚Äô which helped expedite grantee applications reviews.<br>\nBy integrating these learnings, we aim to create a more effective and rewarding experience for everyone involved.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"new-updates-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#new-updates-7\"></a><strong>New Updates</strong></h2>\n<p>We plan to release dates of GG rounds further in advance than we have historically. This will allow Community Rounds and grantees to prepare for the rounds ahead of time adequately, and will enable us to better plan internally. Within the following weeks, we will release a 12-18 month roadmap for GG that will flow over into rough dates for next year. From 2025 onwards, we will return to <strong>4 rounds per year.</strong></p>\n<p>Builder engagement in between GG rounds is top of mind for the Gitcoin team, and we are proactively working on how to set up stronger 1) support systems 2) education funnels 3) active community spaces 4) builder care that fosters innovation and collaboration not only during a GG round but also during the periods outside of the rounds. <strong>No one knows what developers need more than developers.</strong></p>\n<p>We are exploring ways to introduce new funding mechanisms into the grants program.

The setup involved careful planning, including defining criteria, selecting and onboarding token engineers as advisors, and implementing a robust application and review system to ensure transparency and fairness. Key partners and stakeholders were engaged early in the process to align goals and expectations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"grant-round-objectives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#grant-round-objectives-2\"></a>Grant Round Objectives</h2>\n<p>The primary objectives of this grant round were to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support and accelerate public good projects that align with token engineering principles</li>\n<li>Encourage new ideas and solutions that will advance the token engineering field</li>\n<li>Build a stronger community by fostering connections between token engineering innovators and the broader public goods ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The grant round was specifically designed to engage and support projects and individuals advancing the field of token engineering, an area encompassing economics, system design with crypto, and the design and analysis of cryptoeconomic systems. The round targeted academics, researchers, educators, and developers focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Token engineering research</li>\n<li>Events, seminars, and papers educating the community about token engineering</li>\n<li>Software development for token engineering tools</li>\n<li>Building or enhancing social infrastructure related to token engineering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#implementation-3\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"setup-and-management-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#setup-and-management-4\"></a>Setup and Management</h3>\n<p>This being our 4th grant round, the setup process was streamlined based on previous experiences. We maintained the matching cap at 15% to allow up to 5-6 bigger projects to receive a substantial matching amount, optimizing the distribution of funds to drive meaningful impact. The eligibility criteria were improved with a list of project types perfectly aligned with the identified needs within the token engineering community, as informed by a TEC-sponsored <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xw48b/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Engineering Stakeholder Study</a>.</p>\n<p>We also implemented a new communication strategy that involved promptly notifying applicants of their acceptance or rejection, followed by a structured appeal process. This approach ensured clear and timely communication throughout the grant round, maintaining transparency and managing expectations effectively.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-and-solutions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#challenges-and-solutions-5\"></a>Challenges and Solutions</h3>\n<p>One ongoing challenge has been defining project qualifications clearly‚Äîdistinguishing between projects that genuinely advance token engineering as a discipline versus those that merely apply token engineering elements, such as launching a token or incorporating a token economy. To address this, we focused on enhancing the review process by involving advisors who are experts in token engineering. The involvement of 9 seasoned advisors enriched the evaluation process. Their insights were crucial in accurately assessing the true impact and relevance of each project to the field of token engineering. Additionally, we recognized the need to provide clearer feedback on application rejections, helping applicants understand exactly why they did not meet the criteria and how they might improve for future submissions.</p>\n<p>During this grant round, managing the simultaneous processes of late applications, appeals, and the donation period also proved challenging. The need to address late submissions and appeals while simultaneously driving the donation campaign stretched our resources. To streamline future rounds, we hope to establish a more definitive schedule that separates the closing of applications from the start of the donation period. This will allow dedicated attention to appeals and ensure all applications are considered without compromising our donation campaign efforts. Assigning specific team roles for managing appeals and rejections will further prevent operational overlap, maintaining our focus on effective campaigning and meticulous evaluation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"unique-features-or-approaches-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#unique-features-or-approaches-6\"></a>Unique Features or Approaches</h3>\n<p>Continuing from a previous round, we employed the <a href=\"https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF)</a> Matching Boost, a strategic enhancement to the Quadratic Funding allocation process that leverages token engineering expertise. TQF works by analyzing token-based signals of token engineering expertise in the wallets of donors participating in our Token Engineering Grants Round. When such signals are detected, we apply a ‚Äòboost‚Äô to the donations, thereby increasing the funding received by projects that attract support from well-regarded members of the token engineering community. This approach not only incentivizes quality contributions but also ensures that funding is aligned with genuine expertise in the field.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"outcomes-and-statistics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outcomes-and-statistics-7\"></a>Outcomes and Statistics</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"funding-and-contributions-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-and-contributions-8\"></a>Funding and Contributions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Total funding: $9,365</li>\n<li>Number of contributions: 1,619</li>\n<li>Average contribution: $16.90</li>\n<li>Unique donors: 554</li>\n<li>Participating projects: 32</li>\n<li>Average grant size: $TEC 2,975.88</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"participant-feedback-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#participant-feedback-9\"></a>Participant Feedback</h3>\n<p>Every round, we gather open and honest feedback from our grantees using an anonymous feedback form.

We were honored to be selected as one of Gitcoin‚Äôs sponsored community rounds, which significantly amplified our reach. The support from Gitcoin not only helped us attract a wider array of projects but also expanded our circle of grantees beyond the familiar faces from previous rounds. These new ideas and perspectives have been refreshing for our community.</p>\n<p>One critical insight from this round was the absolute necessity of crystal-clear criteria. We realized that to truly achieve our objectives, we must sharpen our ability to distinguish between projects that are simply using token engineering and those that are pushing the boundaries of the field. This clarity is crucial for steering our efforts towards projects that promise genuine advancement in token engineering.</p>\n<p>Another major takeaway involved the importance of supporting impactful initiatives. The round reaffirmed our commitment to not just funding projects but also measuring their long-term impact. This means developing robust metrics to assess both the potential and the realized impact of projects, ensuring that our investments continue to bear fruit long after the funding has been disbursed.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"areas-for-improvement-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#areas-for-improvement-15\"></a>Areas for Improvement</h3>\n<p>We discovered that many of our grantees were not maximizing opportunities to promote their projects. In future rounds, we need to provide more support for grantee marketing and engagement. Whether through resources, training, or incentives, we must empower our grantees to champion their projects effectively, to better boost their visibility and impact.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in future grant rounds, we plan to introduce detailed metrics and evaluation tools specifically designed to assess the direct impact of our funding on the supported projects. This initiative will allow us to track how our contributions aid in advancing each project‚Äôs goals and development within the field of token engineering. By refining our evaluation framework, we aim to ensure that our funding not only supports worthy projects but also maximizes their potential for success and growth.</p>\n<p>One logistical improvement from this round we would suggest is having earlier clarification of grant round dates. Knowing these dates in advance would significantly enhance our planning and coordination. This advance notice is crucial for ensuring that all aspects of the grant round‚Äîfrom application deadlines to project evaluation and donation campaigns‚Äîare better organized and clearly communicated.</p>\n<p>As we reflect on these lessons, we are inspired to refine our processes and approaches for future rounds. Each grant round is an opportunity to learn, adapt, and enhance the transformative potential of our funding. The insights gained from this round will undoubtedly influence our strategies moving forward, making each successive round more impactful than the last.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"closing-thoughts-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#closing-thoughts-16\"></a>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Reflecting on this grant round, several key learnings stand out as crucial for our growth and future planning. The importance of setting clearer criteria and an evaluation matrix cannot be overstated‚Äîit is essential for guiding both applicants and reviewers, ensuring that projects align with the true spirit of token engineering. This round has reinforced the necessity of planning ahead and meticulous time management, especially when aligning with Gitcoin‚Äôs timeline and balancing multiple processes such as appeals, late applications, and active donation campaigns.</p>\n<p>Constant and clear communication has been an essential component in running our round. Maintaining open channels with grantees, our community, and partners like Gitcoin has helped keep the process transparent and inclusive, fostering a trusting and engaged community environment.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, we are excited to continue refining these processes. Each round brings new opportunities to enhance our approach, deepen our impact, and expand our community‚Äôs engagement with token engineering. We encourage everyone‚Äîprojects/grantees, donors, and partners‚Äîto share their feedback on this round. Your insights are invaluable as they help us improve and innovate for future rounds.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/token-engineering-qf-grants-round-spring-2024-gg20-round-retro/18978\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/token-engineering-qf-grants-round-spring-2024-gg20-round-retro/18978","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 15:53:09 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18978"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/token-engineering-qf-grants-round-spring-2024-gg20-round-retro/18978.rss","#text":"Token Engineering QF Grants Round: Spring 2024 GG20 Round Retro"}},{"title":"[Discussion] Allo Fee Switch Proposal","dc:creator":"James","category":"ü§ñ DAO Governance and Vision","description":"<h1><a name=\"allo-fee-switch-proposal-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#allo-fee-switch-proposal-1\"></a>Allo Fee Switch Proposal</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#abstract-background-2\"></a>Abstract &amp; Background</h2>\n<p>Fire Eyes DAO has been working towards creating a roadmap for <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380\">GTC Value Accrual</a>  as well as driving more clear sustainability and value to the GitcoinDAO.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380\">GTC Value Accrual Intro</a> forum post, introducing a fee switch to the Allo Protocol is a straightforward decision that can allow us to begin this journey.</p>\n<p><strong>This forum post aims to ignite initial discussion on an Allo fee switch, not be a ‚Äòready to vote‚Äô proposal.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Allo protocol v2 (and its predecessors) have had $60m+ in combined volume. The introduction of a fee to Allo would create a new revenue stream which would be passed back into the DAO treasury.</p>\n<p>Uniswaps previous discussion on the activation of their fee switch provides some guidance around the process involved in making this change, and valuable insight into the wider community response to such a change.</p>\n<p>Although Gitcoin is a different protocol to Uniswap, the foundation of these decisions should follow the same logical course. <strong>Protocols cannot sustain being public goods indefinitely and leaning into value accrual as a protocol is important.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>This initial pre-proposal discussion centres around two decisions that need to be made before we move forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly (1.) if the fee is added to Gitcoin‚Äôs deployment of Allo protocol <strong>or</strong> (2.) to all deployments of Allo protocol.</li>\n<li>Secondly if this fee was to be added, what percentage of volume the fee would take.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Firstly:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The fee switch could added to the Allo Protocol but only be enacted via the official Gitcoin deployment, not at the overall contract level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This allows others to fork the contracts and deploy their own instance without the fee if they wish to.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The fee switch could be implemented at the contract level, meaning that all deployments would include the switch unless it was removed from the contract itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This more strongly encourages anyone using the allo contracts to contribute to the funding of public goods via GitcoinDAO.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Secondly:</strong> The fee level is an open question - we invite community feedback and discussion but envision the fee sitting at one of the following levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5%</li>\n<li>1%</li>\n<li>3%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For context, looking at these fee levels retroactively gives us an idea of how impactful a fee could be over time:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"gg20-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#gg20-5\"></a>GG20:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5% of total GG20 donations = $3165</li>\n<li>1% of total GG20 donations = $6330</li>\n<li>3% of total GG20 donations = $18,990</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"all-time-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#all-time-6\"></a>All time:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$300k</li>\n<li>1% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$600k</li>\n<li>3% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$1.8m</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These numbers show value flows that could be directed towards sustainability.</p>\n<p><strong>It is important to note that the proceeds of this fee will be deposited back into the Gitcoin DAO treasury,</strong> to be directed into funding both the development of Gitcoin infrastructure, and the commons more broadly. As such, it makes sense for the fee to be higher than average and that most users would be accepting of this given that the fee exists purely to sustain the provision of Allo and related public goods.</p>\n<p><em>FireEyes would recommend that the switch be implemented at the Allo contract level with a fee of 1%. This is because it provides a clear value proposition to GitcoinDAO‚Äôs sustainability whilst remaining reasonably unobtrusive to users donating via the Allo protocol. It is obviously still possible to remove or reduce this fee switch, but this would need to be an explicit decision to exclude by anyone deploying.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"drawbacks-risks-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#drawbacks-risks-7\"></a>Drawbacks / Risks</h2>\n<p>There are reasonable discussion points that this type of fee switch could damage Gitcoin‚Äôs public goods reputation, here‚Äôs how we feel that we could mitigate this if deemed necessary by the community:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with the checkout process having an optional donation/fee to Gitcoin DAO.</li>\n<li>Only enact the fee switch on the official Gitcoin frontend, and let others deploy their own frontends without fee switches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Allo has established itself as a credible tool for capital allocation, projects with large sums of capital have two incentives to use Allo with a fee switch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has pre-existing infrastructure which is easy to use, making the fee worthwhile.</li>\n<li>Using Allo (with a fee) also means that you are also contributing to public goods inherently by contributing to the sustainability of public goods infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We hope to foster community discussion around both the introduction of this mechanism and its finer details, as well as more broadly around sustainability for the GitcoinDAO and it‚Äôs infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We realise this is a controversial topic to introduce to a public goods focused community like Gitcoin however starting this conversation is an important step towards ensuring that we can continue sustainably building public goods infrastructure for years to come!</p>\n<p>Please share your thoughts and feedback in this forum post <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/robot.png?v=12\" title=\":robot:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":robot:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974","pubDate":"Mon, 10 Jun 2024 22:27:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18974"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974.rss","#text":"[Discussion] Allo Fee Switch Proposal"}},{"title":"Dark Matter, coin voting, bribes, transferable stake, etc","dc:creator":"skilesare","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>Hey all‚Ä¶I‚Äôve started a bit of discussion over on the DFINITY forums(i know, i know) about some issues we‚Äôre running into.

It has been a goal of mine and others on the team to graduate Passport from Gitcoin as Gitcoin has been focused on Grants and growing GMV for a while now. At the same time, the Passport team has been focused on identity and the emerging world of onchain reputation, with some support for Gitcoin, but largely prioritizing the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Creating separation from the two entities ensures Passport‚Äôs actions across the space are no longer associated with the Gitcoin brand, and while Gitcoin continues to focus on capital allocation, there will no longer be questions on why we have an identity solution in the portfolio.</p>\n<p>This budget request seeks funding to enable the spin out of Passport and fund the business for its initial six months. Here is what we are thinking. Passport has generated revenue on OP and Linea (by enabling onchain attestations of one‚Äôs unique humanity, and OP RPGF3). Together with this funding, and a six month budget, we would like to formally request a vote to spin out of Gitcoin DAO. In return for bootstrapping the business unit, we will ensure Gitcoin has equity ownership in the new entity, a token allocation if/when we launch a token and a board seat in the new entity. The details on how a DAO may participate are a little murky (ie, have equity, and a board seat) and so we will be working with the Gitcoin Foundation to formalize the ownership and board seat appointment.</p>\n<p>Passport currently drives the majority utility use case for GTC and we plan to keep GTC utility in the product for the foreseeable future. We do not have details on if/when Passport has its own token, but we want to ensure as Gitcoin will likely be a large token holder in Passport, there will be token use cases that extend utility for other ERC-20 (like GTC).</p>\n<p>We are aiming to have this spinout complete in July, and would expect the Passport team to start to use its own properties (ie, Passport.xyz for the website and app, its own discord server, its own email, etc.) on July 1. While Passport will be an independent entity, there will still be lots of areas of collaboration as those running grants programs often need Sybil protection (and those doing airdrops often want to seed a Grants program after TGE).</p>\n<p>As for the progress the team has been making, updates below outline both progress and the roadmap we have ahead.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tldr-on-the-next-6mos-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-on-the-next-6mos-1\"></a>TL;DR on the next 6mos</h2>\n<p>Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity and reputation management.

We now have a total of 1.4M unique all time passports. We also continued to drive strongly against our targets in GTC staking, hitting over 1.75M GTC staked.</p>\n<p>With a focus on onchain attestations, we have launched two new networks where Passport holders can attest to their unique humanity. This means, we now support attestations on Arbitrum, Optimism, Linea, and zkSync. Onchain attestations have started to unlock novel use cases where smartcontract interactions can now directly confirm a wallet‚Äôs humanity score, enabling truly permissionless and decentralized humanity confirmation.</p>\n<p>We have also done a lot of work to revamp the GTC staking experience to make the process more intuitive and informative. This has brought the creation of privacy policy details and user terms as the GTC staked can be slashed when users are acting in bad faith.</p>\n<p>And finally, our new Model Based Detection endpoint, and L2 coverage has continued to expand. We now can review wallets using our models across ARB, OP, zkSync, Polygon, Eth Mainnet, and NFT communities. This capability is incredibly helpful when engaging with other communities (new L2s) to help them understand who is likely a sybil actor and who is likely human on their network.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"milestone-report-for-past-season-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#milestone-report-for-past-season-4\"></a>Milestone Report for Past Season</h3>\n<p><strong>Legend:</strong> <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/green_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":green_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":green_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Success/Completed/Shipped <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">Incomplete, but partial success <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":red_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":red_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">Incomplete, Will Not Hit Goal <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/black_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":black_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":black_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Canceled</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n   <td><strong>Initiative/Project</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Key Results</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Value Delivered</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Ease\n   </td>\n   <td>üü¢Simplified Passport user experience\n   </td>\n   <td>Revamped Passport with fewer stamps, credentials, and simplified path to 20 score.\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Effectiveness\n   </td>\n   <td>üü°Updated score weights for all Passports based on previous 6 months of data\n<p>\nüü¢Aggregate L2 Models\n   </p></td>\n   <td>In addition the revamp of Passpot and the addition of the new models we‚Äôve made significant progress dropping the False positive rate under 16%, did not hit the target of &lt;10%.\n<p>\nWe‚Äôll have a working model by June 30th..\n   </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Adoption\n   </td>\n   <td>üü¢1.4M Passports\n<p>\nüü¢Scored 400k addresses with MDB \n   </p></td>\n   <td>Continued to drive top line growth of unique Passports by adding 255k new Passports exceeding our target of 1.3M driven by new partners Initia and zkLink.

This property is above all an exceptional site which brings a good quality of life and an atmosphere of authenticity with the most up-to-date comfort.</em></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/9/997bbf269308796566d6f445b041e7d7ca0e8911.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/997bbf269308796566d6f445b041e7d7ca0e8911\" title=\"EcoResort Property Images Biarritz 2\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/9/997bbf269308796566d6f445b041e7d7ca0e8911_2_680x500.jpeg\" alt=\"EcoResort Property Images Biarritz 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"lTMb6aakAzR8EzYBhqMLbdXxFWp\" width=\"680\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/9/997bbf269308796566d6f445b041e7d7ca0e8911_2_680x500.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/9/997bbf269308796566d6f445b041e7d7ca0e8911.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/9/997bbf269308796566d6f445b041e7d7ca0e8911.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"887963\"></a></div><br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/e/e7976576f1edcbf91a88f6060a1f9ca77ab6dd78.jpeg\" alt=\"EcoResort Property Images Table 1\" data-base62-sha1=\"x2KEYiWBWbZsr9xnb7aI1CDaF0Q\" width=\"648\" height=\"223\"><p></p>\n<p><strong>WHY France?</strong></p>\n<p>In homage to public goods and public goods funding, the properties that will be considered are properties that are of historical and/or cultural value that are in need of partial restoration.</p>\n<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>\n<p>The French government offers a <em>40% subsidy</em> for restoration and preservation costs for historical and/or cultural buildings. The country has a wealth of chateaux that are withering in neglect.</p>\n<p>With astute curation, a property can be purchased, restored with the help of the French government‚Äôs subsidies, thus providing needed work for regional artisans and craftsmen.  The final result is that of cultural preservation and public goods longevity while enhancing the personal wealth of the property owner.</p>\n<p><strong>USE CASE Example (Already Exists in Market)</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sushi.png?v=12\" title=\":sushi:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":sushi:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><em>Chateaushi</em> - This is an historical property development consortium that is crypto friendly. They offer fractional ownership of properties using a membership model. Their approach is one of luxury with strategic partnerships now in place with the former editor of the Michelin Guide, several celebrity chefs and other luxury travel tie-ins.</p>\n<p><strong>Tokenized Property As A Public Good</strong></p>\n<p>Here in this proposal, we seek to honor the Gitcoin Community‚Äôs dedication to public goods, ecosystem cultivation and growth, and shared, enriching experiences that offer sustainable outcomes.</p>\n<p>In this regard, we propose that we entertain strategic partnerships with Solar Punk, ReGen, Kundalini Yoga and clean energy communities and more like minded tribes‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Clean Energy Hubs: The really long vision is to build these RWA communities into clean energy hubs where solar energy, and one day, fusion energy, is farmed for our own use and the use of the surrounding communities. (More on that to come‚Ä¶).</p>\n<p><strong>Business Model</strong></p>\n<p>We are considering two business models, with an emphasis on the first:</p>\n<p>An <strong>EcoResort &amp;/or Co-Working Residence</strong> with suitable accommodations for multiples of groups, can be purchased outright by GitcoinDAO or the Gitcoin Foundation or a partnership between the two. The RWA is held in trust and maintained in the Treasury portfolio as a valuable, tradeable hard asset.</p>\n<p>This approach works for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>2024 is the \"year of RWAs‚Äô (BlockWorks)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gitcoin DAO is looking to be a ‚Äòproduct/ protocol‚Äô DAO with diverse offerings to the community</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Diversifying treasury holdings into something tangible and substantive such as real estate further strengthens the responsible fiscal position of the DAO</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Offering fractional Property Use Rights into RWA holdings for the larger Gitcoin community means that the community members can begin their own real estate fractional use  journey ( such as like Pacaso, Homebase, traditional timeshares);</p>\n<p>Community members and the different grantee orgs can continue building community and relationships within and among the Gitcoin Grantee ecosystems; Depending on the strategic property investments - agriculture yielding / winery/ EcoResort - the property could be self-sustaining and,  eventually, show revenue from local production in addition to revenue generated by accommodations use and appreciation of real value in real estate ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>Business Model <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span></strong></p>\n<p>Launch on Grant Stack as a funding round.  We approach capital investors who would then take the position of the holder of the RWA asset. In return, they would match fund in a QF round the Property Use Right fractional ownership purchases that the individual Gitcoin grantee community members and orgs raise.</p>\n<p>This would function as a traditional QF Round, except in this case the match funders would retain the deed to the property that is purchased using their capital. But they would share their capital investment by match funding using the QF formula. Each amount raised by community members, who seek to become fractional owners in the property by purchasing Property Use Rights as outlined above, would be match funded by said benefactor/ capital investor.</p>\n<p><strong>Monetization Models  -  Gitcoin Foundation Retains Property Deed, Fractionalizes Time Unit Purchases (TUP - see monetization break down above)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Property Example B:</strong></p>\n<p>Eco-Resort -  Former 4-star hotel property near Sarlat, Dordogne, France</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully Furnished, recently renovated</li>\n<li>Restaurant</li>\n<li>Lounge</li>\n<li>Reception</li>\n<li>Staff Accommodations (Four Bedroom/ Four Living Room Stone House)</li>\n<li>Barns and Outbuildings</li>\n<li>Suitable for Horses</li>\n<li>Guesthouse/Gite</li>\n<li>Swimming Pool</li>\n<li>Two estuaries</li>\n<li>Wooded Park, hundred year old trees</li>\n<li>Lake</li>\n<li>Wheelchair accessible</li>\n<li>Outdoor Terrace and Lounge</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd\" title=\"EcoResort Property Images 39 room 4 Star Resort\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd_2_690x473.jpeg\" alt=\"EcoResort Property Images 39 room 4 Star Resort\" data-base62-sha1=\"1GofNj5wX4Tm7k7z6lVBqAiJCBn\" width=\"690\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd_2_690x473.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"556541\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e\" title=\"EcoResort Property Images Table 2\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e_2_690x240.jpeg\" alt=\"EcoResort Property Images Table 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"u5pZYq1TzG7LmLq9bpucUZujv0G\" width=\"690\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e_2_690x240.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CAD1C7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>**35 Rooms - Time Unit 2 weeks =  Total  875 Units **</p>\n<p>**Each Unit sells for EURO 8000  =    EURO  7 Million **</p>\n<p>**Time Unit Purchase (TUP) entitles owner to: **</p>\n<p><strong>Use of 2 consecutive weeks of double occupancy room during the calendar year (of the 50 available weeks)</strong></p>\n<p>Duration of use is 5 years (i.e. 2 weeks per year for 5 years) at which time the holder has the option to renew at a highly favorable market price or to ‚Äòsell‚Äô back to the foundation or on the second market within the Gitcoin ecosystem.

To qualify, investors must have good credit and put down at least 10 percent of the property‚Äôs purchase price. The term of the loan can be up to 25 years, and interest rates can vary based on current market conditions and the applicant‚Äôs qualifications.</p>\n<p><strong>SBA 504</strong> loans are similar to their 7(a) counterparts; however, there is no limit to how much an investor can borrow. Investors must have good credit and provide a down payment of 10 percent of the purchase price. The term of the loan is typically 20 years, and the investor must occupy at least 51 percent of the property. Unlike SBA 7(a) loans, these mortgages are not funded entirely through a private lender. Instead, they are made available through Certified Development Companies (CDCs), nonprofit entities that promote economic development within their communities. Typically, a commercial lender funds 50 percent of the project, and a CDC finances up to 40 percent.</p>\n<p>Please post your thoughts, suggestions, feedback here <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pray/4.png?v=12\" title=\":pray:t4:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":pray:t4:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">.</p>\n<p>And feel free to reach out to Paige &amp;/or Alex on Telegram:<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/paigedao\">@PaigeDAO</a><br>\n<span class=\"mention\">@akim0x</span></p>\n            <p><small>14 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/community-owned-eco-resort-through-fractional-property-use-rights/18957\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/community-owned-eco-resort-through-fractional-property-use-rights/18957","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Jun 2024 17:40:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18957"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/community-owned-eco-resort-through-fractional-property-use-rights/18957.rss","#text":"Community Owned Eco-Resort Through Fractional Property Use Rights"}},{"title":"CCN Climate Solutions Round Retro","dc:creator":"jon-spark-eco","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa\" title=\"CCN Logo 2.0 Banner\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_345x153.png\" alt=\"CCN Logo 2.0 Banner\" data-base62-sha1=\"4Jwd2PiKluUHLVe83VyT9c4OOpQ\" width=\"345\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_345x153.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_517x229.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_690x306.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D1DADD\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"round-description-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-description-1\"></a>Round Description</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Climate Coordination Network</a> believes that Climate Action is the ultimate public good. Why? Because climate change increasingly impacts everyone worldwide.

The team is familiar with Gitcoin Grants round setup and management, and we divide up the many tasks based on skill set and availability. To set up the GG20 Climate Solutions round, we reviewed the <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/climate-solutions-round-eligibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">eligibility criteria</a>, updated the <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CCN Climate Solutions Portal</a>, started communications and outreach, created the new Climate Solutions Metrics Garden and updated grantee resources such as onboarding videos and review process documentation.</p>\n<p>Our main challenges for GG20 involved our Climate Grantee review process. Most of our projects are making IRL impact, which is difficult to evaluate as it tends to be qualitative vs. quantitative. We strive to improve this process each round and for GG20, we utilized Checker (<a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-checker/17292\">a new tool built by Gitcoin</a>) to help with the lengthy process of reviewing 173 diverse grantee applications. Unlike OSS rounds, Checkers AI features didn‚Äôt really help us review climate projects. In the future, the AI model could be trained to provide useful feedback but for now, it was not effective. In past rounds, we used spreadsheet tools for the evaluation process. Checker provided a nice interface that gathered the information needed to complete our reviews. We hope to see something like Checker integrated into Grants Stack, as the approvals and rejections are still manual. We experienced technical issues with Grants Stack which did not allow us to export our grantee contact information, which caused a breakdown in communication with our grantees for most of the round.</p>\n<p>Going forward, we are discussing a new process that will streamline, simplify, and clarify climate reviews by requiring dMRV for certain types of projects and impact reporting using tools such as Hypercerts and KarmaGAP. We will require all of our grantees to use KarmaGAP to provide 2-3 milestones they will accomplish with the funding received during GG20. This requirement will enable grantees to showcase their impact and significantly reduce our time during the review process in future rounds.</p>\n<p>The Climate Solutions Round‚Äôs unique feature/approach is that we cultivate a supportive community that results in ongoing productive relationships and collaborations. During our review of grant proposals from projects that have been in multiple rounds, we found clear examples of grantees helping each other and working together to accomplish goals and address challenges. For example, as we transition to clearer requirements for impact metrics, many grantees are working with a Silvi Protocol, a long-time trusted dMRV project with an amazing web3 tech stack. Another example of climate grantees supporting each other is Helpers Social Development Foundation, a community-led NGO in Nigeria that is developing solar-powered community centers in partnership with The Solar Foundation and is also working to pilot a IoT smart metering device built by Switch Electric (also a grantee based in Nigeria).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"outcomes-and-statistics-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outcomes-and-statistics-5\"></a>Outcomes and Statistics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/42161/29\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Report card</a></li>\n<li>129 Climate Solutions Grantees</li>\n<li>Total crowdfunding: $58k</li>\n<li>9,314 contributions</li>\n<li>2,262 unique donors</li>\n<li>Average contribution: $4.08</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Summary of the past three rounds shows growth round over round.<br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/714564dcaaeddfc1458f3be061ee1c51aeaeabe1.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ga2D47egHIife87SZQMWa5ES4xz\" width=\"572\" height=\"163\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"round-matching-results-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-matching-results-6\"></a>Round Matching Results</h2>\n<p>After the round, we evaluated the matching estimates using several different methods: COCM, QF, and Pairwise. We then had a long internal debate about the best way to calculate the results. While most, if not all, other rounds followed Gitcoins‚Äô lead and used COCM, we found it was not a good fit for our community. COCM looks at the interconnection between donors and their donation behavior and rewards projects with diverse donors who contribute to a variety of other projects and penalizes those that have donors who only contributed to one project. COCM produces a fairer outcome in many rounds and helps with sybil defense.</p>\n<p>The issue we found is that the climate round is a closely connected community. Most donors contribute to many projects in the round which we love to see. We are proud of the coordination we see within the community, but the issue we saw was the round results were flattened when using the COCM calculations. The projects that had received the most support and signal from the community would not receive a fair share of the matching pool.

Sharing here in case it is helpful for anyone else and so the Gitcoin community who has helped make Zuzalu possible can be included.</p>\n<p><strong>Process for choosing the manager for Continuous Innovation:</strong><br>\nBasically Janine called me up and asked if I wanted to do it and offered me $35/hr in pay and I tracked my time in ClickUp.</p>\n<p><strong>Process for choosing the manager for the Q1 rounds:</strong><br>\nI think a few people including Vitalik, Janine, Nicole etc. reached out to Chance who managed the round as a volunteer (Huge kudos for that and I wish I was working with him on the upcoming round.)</p>\n<p><strong>Process for choosing the managers/stewards for Q2 rounds</strong> (one event and one tech round):<br>\nSejal posted in the Zuzalu forum that people could self-nominate to be a steward, and voting was held where three stewards would be chosen for each round. Voters could choose their top three choices for each round and whichever 3 at the end who had the most were chosen yesterday. I‚Äôm one of the tech round stewards.<br>\n<strong>I think people should be able to form parties</strong> and have 3 people apply together. The reason is because otherwise individuals might end up being chosen who do not want to work together. (I‚Äôm happy with the people I‚Äôm working with in the tech round luckily but I see how this can go wrong) This should avoid getting locked into a 2-party system if we are using approval voting instead of first pas the post.</p>\n<p><strong>What I did for the first round:</strong><br>\n-Announcements about the round reminding people to apply<br>\n-DMing Zuzaluans with projects we thought should be included<br>\n-Messaging and calling with some applicants who I didn‚Äôt know to see if they were ligit<br>\n-Co-writing video calls during which people wrote up their projects and sharing tips on how to write it or use markdown such as how to include pictures<br>\nAnswering a bunch of community questions, mostly when people were having difficulty donating.</p>\n<p>Then for choosing which projects to accept in the end, there were a couple calls with Marine, Janine, and Nicole where we looked through the applicants, their twitters, websites, if we knew them, and if they matched the criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Donations:</strong><br>\nDuring donations, we received a lot of feedback that adding enough stamps to Gitcoin passport for many people was impossible for achieving a matching score and that the process was excruciating. I am very glad we have other options now.</p>\n<p>For the Q1 rounds, we ended up saying if anyone has a Zupass they would receive full matching, and after some discussion with Umar and others matching funds were disbursed half according to what Zupass holders donated to and half according to what others donated to.</p>\n<p>For these Q2 rounds, I made this <strong>suggestion of adding someone‚Äôs legal name as a proof of personhood</strong> deciding whether to match a donor‚Äôs contributions. That can be obtained with a credit card payment: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/10-000-donated-to-gitcoin-zuzalu-round-with-credit-card-pilot-project-proposal/18827\" class=\"inline-onebox\">$10,000 Donated to Gitcoin Zuzalu Round with Credit Card Pilot Project Proposal</a><br>\nConsidering someone could get matching with on-chain history using model based detection and/or this method, that means they could donate two times total using each method once and get more matching. This would allow a sort of 2x Sybil, but may also encourage more total donations and could allow donations for billions of non-crypto users. With that trade-off in mind, it depends on if the current Zuzalu round stewards decide to also accept this proof of personhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria:</strong><br>\n<strong>For the Continuous Innovation Round</strong> it was super broad basically saying if it supports the Zuzalu mission and values it can qualify (plus looking ligit), it‚Äôs open source, and noting that if you are a Zuzaluan then you are more likely to have the project accepted.<br>\nZuzalu mission (from a workshop I and Rachel and Dimi held during Zuzalu where we broke participants into small groups to answer a form with 10 questions, then a smaller team reviewed those answers and refined it into this) - to foster a global network of communities to advance humanity by creating playgrounds at the intersection of free and open technology, health, science and social innovation<br>\nValues: Authentic Kindness, Mutual Respect, Personal Growth, Freedom</p>\n<p><strong>For the Q1 rounds the criteria was:</strong><br>\n‚ÄúTechnology projects must be fully open-source, relevant to the needs of in-person Zuzalu events, and blockchain components must be maximally compatible with applicable Ethereum ecosystem standards.<br>\nEvents projects must be what is reasonably understood as a ‚ÄúZuzalu event‚Äù: roughly, a long-duration in-person gathering whose goal is to experiment with open frontier digital and social technologies.<br>\nContributions may be retroactive in intent, supporting events that have already happened! So eg. an event that takes place in Q1 is eligible for funding in both Q1 and Q2, just as an event that takes place in Q2 would be.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In the end, the events round was somewhat controversial considering it featured everything from a small retreat of several friends living together to hackerhouses to a single person‚Äôs efforts supporting an event to an entire team with a full on 8 week pop up village with 200 people.</p>\n<p>I am not an events round steward but made this suggestion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is at least 2 weeks in duration</li>\n<li>Has a topic focused on at least one of the original Zuzalu tracks</li>\n<li>Core team includes at least one resident of Zuzalu or participant in ZuConnect</li>\n<li>Includes aspects of co-living</li>\n<li>Includes a co-created schedule</li>\n<li>Includes coworking on meaningful projects</li>\n<li>Between 50-300 residents anticipated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There won‚Äôt be any perfect criteria but since we need to pick something it might be nice to add some minimum numbers for residents and how long it has to be. I figure if it is longer than 2 weeks without any limit for how long it can be maybe that even incentivizes some long-term projects, permanent village projects, etc. (without it just being another grouphouse, hackerhouse, or paid for vacation of friends) Also maybe it‚Äôs worth adding a cap to how many residents it can be (somewhere 150-300.) I think a lot of the magic of the original Zuzalu is that it was close to a Dunbar sized number and I wonder if it would lose that if it got too big</p>\n<p>For tech round I think there has not been much controversy, so perhaps we can stick to similar criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Matches the Zuzalu mission and values</li>\n<li>Open source</li>\n<li>Fits into one of the original Zuzalu topic tracks</li>\n<li>More likely to be chosen if there are Zuzalu or Zuconnect residents as team members</li>\n<li>Blockchain components must be maximally compatible with applicable Ethereum ecosystem standards</li>\n<li>Relevant to the needs of in-person Zuzalu events</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For what a Zuzalu event is, here‚Äôs the best I can think of on that: <a href=\"https://www.noahchonlee.com/post/what-is-a-zuzalu-style-event\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.noahchonlee.com/post/what-is-a-zuzalu-style-event</a></p>\n<p>I am writing this while in Zanzalu in Zanzibar.

We will reconsider our criteria for future rounds to ensure what we believe will be a more effective distribution of funds.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"crowdfunded-donations-over-9000-raised-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#crowdfunded-donations-over-9000-raised-5\"></a>Crowdfunded Donations: Over $9,000 Raised</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>VoiceDeck</strong>: Highest crowdfunding and total amount ($1,745)</li>\n<li><strong>Atlantis</strong>: Highest contributor count (113)</li>\n<li><strong>Spark | Deresy &amp; Hyperminter</strong>: Highest matching amount ($4,658)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Full results: <a href=\"https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/42161/28\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hypercerts Ecosystem Round | Gitcoin Round Report Card</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/b/bb0d10eea3892bf8cdceec7d3d7727d856223cf0.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/bb0d10eea3892bf8cdceec7d3d7727d856223cf0\" title=\"Distribution of funds in the Hypercerts Ecosystem Round\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb0d10eea3892bf8cdceec7d3d7727d856223cf0_2_690x288.png\" alt=\"Distribution of funds in the Hypercerts Ecosystem Round\" data-base62-sha1=\"qGJhqmIUgc7toVuvaJLNhk2YMMg\" width=\"690\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb0d10eea3892bf8cdceec7d3d7727d856223cf0_2_690x288.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb0d10eea3892bf8cdceec7d3d7727d856223cf0_2_1035x432.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb0d10eea3892bf8cdceec7d3d7727d856223cf0_2_1380x576.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CCCDC7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"thank-you-to-our-matching-funders-for-60000-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#thank-you-to-our-matching-funders-for-60000-6\"></a>Thank You to Our Matching Funders for $60,000</h1>\n<p>We are incredibly grateful to our matching funders‚ÄîGitcoin, Thank ARB, and Protocol Labs‚Äîfor their support in pushing the young Hypercerts Ecosystem forward.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/5/5be527b17f34ea427903036ffbea41160ccdd2ff.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/5be527b17f34ea427903036ffbea41160ccdd2ff\" title=\"matching funders\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/5be527b17f34ea427903036ffbea41160ccdd2ff_2_690x72.png\" alt=\"matching funders\" data-base62-sha1=\"d6WpyFI4Ut9VPPD01PFDi5wlr7F\" width=\"690\" height=\"72\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/5be527b17f34ea427903036ffbea41160ccdd2ff_2_690x72.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/5be527b17f34ea427903036ffbea41160ccdd2ff_2_1035x108.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/5be527b17f34ea427903036ffbea41160ccdd2ff_2_1380x144.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B9BABB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"excited-about-projects-progress-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#excited-about-projects-progress-7\"></a>Excited About Projects‚Äô Progress</h1>\n<p>We will follow up with all projects to provide support and understand further needs.

This indicates that these projects were able to leverage their donor base effectively to secure matching contributions. It suggests a high confidence level from matching funders in these projects‚Äô potential impact.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Top Fundraisers</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereal Forest</strong> stands out with the highest total amount received ($14,227.02). This project not only received the most substantial total funds but also had the highest number of donations (165), reflecting both broad and deep support. The high number of donations and matching funds indicates effective fundraising strategies and strong donor engagement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Potential for Increased Engagement</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects like <strong>Mycelial Civic Knowledge Networks</strong> and <strong>Exploring Post-Capitalist Crypto Pathways</strong> have moderate total funds and a relatively high number of donations. These projects could potentially increase their total funds by focusing on increasing the size of individual donations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Low Engagement with High Potential</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>VoiceDeck: A Marketplace for Journalism Impact Certificates</strong> and <strong>Moos: A Berlin hub for reimagining our cities</strong> received substantial total funds but have relatively low ratios of donations to total funds. This suggests that these projects received significant donations from fewer contributors. They may benefit from strategies aimed at broadening their donor base to enhance sustainability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Diverse Fundraising Success</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The diversity in donation patterns and matching fund success across projects indicates varied effectiveness in fundraising strategies. Projects with lower total amounts but high donation counts might explore methods to increase individual donation amounts. Conversely, projects with high total amounts but fewer donations could focus on broadening their engagement strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"round-operator-insights-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-operator-insights-3\"></a>Round Operator Insights</h1>\n<p>Overall, we learned that Quadratic Funding is unpredictable and, even by constraining some variables, the outcomes are very hard to sculpt or shape. We failed in our goal of ensuring each project walked away from the round with at least $3,000 - $5,000 USD, a goal driven by our first hand experience as grantees of extremely low returns of grant funding when compared with the time it takes grantees to promote their grants.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"limiting-grantees-hypothesis-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#limiting-grantees-hypothesis-4\"></a>Limiting Grantees Hypothesis</h2>\n<p>This round, we were experimenting with the hypothesis that reducing the total number of projects while increasing the matching pool would ensure that the minimum grant allocation would be large enough for all projects to create meaningful, documentable impacts created through the grant funding. We calculated the range of matching pool distributions based on our Genesis Round which reflected a 2-3x spread between the smallest matching amount and the largest. To achieve our goal of significant funding for each project, we chose to restrict the total number of projects to 16, a number derived from our analysis of the previous round‚Äôs outcomes and the volume of matching funds available for our second round.</p>\n<p>Our insights from this aspect of the round were twofold. First, the matching distribution for this round was far more extreme than anticipated. The range from the lowest matching amount to the highest amount was closer to 10x, a significant increase from our previous round. In one sense, this is a positive discovery because it shows that the Quadratic Funding mechanism is successfully allocating funds based on the preferences of the collective intelligence of donors. On the other hand, it means that the hypothesis we were testing failed to achieve our desired goals. Rather than seeing this as a failure, we see it as a learning opportunity that reveals the high variability of matching amounts and the impossibility of using the variables that <em>are</em> within our control to influence the outcome, even if our desired influence on the outcome is holistically considered and well intentioned. This feeds into the second insight from this aspect of the round. As round operators, we struggled to limit participation in the round to only 16 projects. There were many deserving projects who submitted applications whom we rejected simply based on the premise that we had an obligation to test our hypothesis that a smaller number of projects would yield significant funding for each project. Filling the final spots in the round was a painful process that required over a week of deliberation, weighing a number of variables like use of funds, project history and track record, and available grant size vs scope of the project.</p>\n<p>Based on the feedback and data generated by this round, we are unlikely to limit the number of projects in future rounds in the same way. This doesn‚Äôt solve the issue of unpredictable results and the potential for grantees to spend 10s or 100s of hours on project promotion only to receive a few hundred or a thousand dollars in matching funds, but it does embrace the philosophy of quadratic funding which places the entire allocation process in the hands of donors. Accepting and acknowledging this as a fundamental limitation and benefit of Quadratic Funding, we will encourage grantees to consider allocating only the number of hours they are willing to lose (without a guarantee of earning the value of that time back in donations) for their grant promotion.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"updates-to-gitcoin-passport-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#updates-to-gitcoin-passport-5\"></a>Updates To Gitcoin Passport</h2>\n<p>For those not familiar, Gitcoin Passport is a sybil resistance mechanism for Quadratic Funding rounds that attempts to ensure donors are unique human individuals and not bots or scammers attempting to rig the system for their benefit. Prior to this round, the Gitcoin Passport was based on Stamps, attestations of identity that included a number of different identity verification mechanisms like Google and GitHub accounts. This round, Gitcoin introduced Cluster Matching, an AI-enabled system that autonomously reviewed the on-chain transaction history of each donor to verify their ‚Äúproof of humanity.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Comparing the Gitcoin Passport Stamp-based matching results with the newly created Cluster Matching-based results, we were pleased to discover that the new Cluster Matching approach generated a more equitable and holistic distribution of funds. We believe this occurred because the Stamps system was an unwieldy user experience that took tremendous time and effort to reach a ‚Äúpassport score‚Äù that made a user eligible for matching funds. Even as web3 experts, it took us extensive time and energy to achieve a passing score and we imagine that the user experience was so challenging for most ordinary donors that they were discouraged from completing their passport or perhaps even donating to projects. Cluster matching reduces friction for donors and empowers non-web3 savvy individuals to make donations that qualify for matching funds.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"arbitrum-x-gitcoin-user-experience-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#arbitrum-x-gitcoin-user-experience-6\"></a>Arbitrum x Gitcoin User Experience</h2>\n<p>This was also our first round using Arbitrum, having run our previous round on a more obscure Layer 2 blockchain, the Public Goods Network. Overall, this was an incredibly positive experience. While the user interface for program managers is almost entirely the same other than a slightly different process for bridging and adding funds to the smart contract, as a donor, the experience of donating across multiple rounds on the same chain was incredibly streamlined and supported the cross-promotion of projects with grants in multiple rounds. Gas fees on Arbitrum are incredibly low which was another massive benefit for our grantees, donors and the round overall.</p>\n<p>With that said, many of our donors still expressed challenges with bridging funds from Ethereum mainnet to a Layer 2 blockchain. We look forward to a future in which the donor experience on Gitcoin can include fiat donations as well as some kind of inter-chain mechanism that makes it irrelevant to the front end donors which chain the rounds themselves choose to operate. These challenges are persistent across the web3 ecosystem and are not unique to Arbitrum or Gitcoin, but we look forward to collaborating with both teams to co-develop the underlying infrastructures that help Quadratic Funding enter the mainstream, a path that serves the entire public goods ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"looking-forward-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#looking-forward-7\"></a>Looking Forward</h1>\n<p>We‚Äôre excited to continue offering Gitcoin Grants rounds as a service to our members. We are well positioned to advocate on behalf of the entire Consortium of civic innovators we serve to raise matching funds and provide the support structures for funding rounds. We are currently exploring a large grant from ThankArb to develop a new funding mechanism for our members that distributes drips of funding to each project on an ongoing basis. This method, Streaming Quadratic Funding, will be developed by a new initiative called <em>Flow State</em> and we‚Äôre excited to collaborate with them to explore adding specific functionality that is custom-made for the OpenCivics Consortium. The platform will offer a token-gated environment where OpenCivics members can use Quadratic Voting to express their preferences on where the continuous drips of grant funding are allocated. This mechanism breaks fund allocation out of the time-locked grant round context into an ongoing stream of funding that supports the sustainability of projects over time.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we forged lasting bonds with the other community grant round operators who all expressed an interest in co-hosting a collaborative round in the future. As ever, Gitcoin is all about relationships and this round deeply strengthened the relationships between community round operators. There seemed to be a universal sentiment that the entire public goods funding space could benefit from a funding round tailored to synergistic collaboration between different impact sectors, working together as ephemeral DAOs to generate outputs based on the unique contributions of multiple projects. We‚Äôre excited to explore this possibility and to work with other community round operators to continue serving our grantees in innovative ways.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>We believe Quadratic Funding for public goods funding allocations is one of the most promising and useful contributions of web3 infrastructure to the social impact space. This round taught us an immense amount about the limitations and benefits of Quadratic Funding related to ways we can improve the donor experience, grantee experience, and overall impact of the grants themselves. We are currently engaging our grantees in a participatory process to identify and report on the milestones they achieve with the funds they‚Äôve received from our Consortium Round 02 which we will share with you here in a few months. Our grantees have already started to identify pathways to synergize their project efforts within the context of emerging collaborative initiatives within the Consortium and we can‚Äôt wait to see what we‚Äôre able to create together.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our donors, grantees, and members for supporting public goods and for funding the critical work of civic innovation.</p>\n<p>In Us We Trust,</p>\n<p>OpenCivics Stewards</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opencivics-consortium-round-02-insights-learnings/18879\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opencivics-consortium-round-02-insights-learnings/18879","pubDate":"Tue, 28 May 2024 21:24:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18879"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opencivics-consortium-round-02-insights-learnings/18879.rss","#text":"OpenCivics Consortium Round 02 Insights & Learnings"}}]}}}
