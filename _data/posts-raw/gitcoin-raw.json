Our plan is based on three lines of thought:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you can only look at donation data, complete Sybil Resistance is impossible in any QF mechanism, no matter how fancy.</li>\n<li>That being said, COCM has a large (though not complete) sybil-reducing effect.</li>\n<li>The passport team has recently introduced a new verification procedure called Passport model based detection, which reduces user burden and appears to be quite effective when combined with COCM.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore, the strategy is clear: use COCM and Passport’s model based detection for GG20, which will yield a smoother user experience and more sybil resistance.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"wait-whats-cocm-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#wait-whats-cocm-2\"></a>Wait, what’s COCM?</h1>\n<p>You can think of COCM (Connection-Oriented Cluster Match) as a tweak to the Pairwise Match algorithm suggested by Vitalik. Like Pairwise Match, COCM is based on standard QF and attenuates a project’s funding if many of its donors have similar donation patterns. However, COCM calculates similarity differently. See <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/wtf-is-cluster-matching-qf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this blog post</a> for a full explanation.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"sybil-resistance-is-at-odds-with-what-we-like-about-qf-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#sybil-resistance-is-at-odds-with-what-we-like-about-qf-3\"></a>Sybil resistance is at odds with what we like about QF</h1>\n<p>QF is commonly understood as a fairly democratic mechanism, in the sense that many small donors can out-class one large donor. It turns out that sybil resistance is at odds with this property.</p>\n<p>The community uses the term “sybil” in many ways, so let’s clarify what we mean. Imagine a person about to donate to Gitcoin Grants – say, $10 to project X, and $4 to project Y. Before checking out, they pause and ask, “what if I actually split my donations among two separate wallets? I could donate, say, $5 to X and $2 to Y from both wallets, instead of making one big donation.” If that person wouldn’t be better off splitting up their donation (regardless of the original donation amounts or the way they split it up), then I’ll say the QF mechanism is sybil resistant, since people are incentivized just to make their whole donation from one account.</p>\n<p>The problem is that any mechanism with this sybil resistance property degenerates into a direct donation mechanism where no matching funds are added. This is because you can apply the logic of the definition in reverse. Imagine that Alice and Bob are two donors to a QF round. Even if Alice and Bob are real people, a mechanism has no way of knowing that their donations aren’t really two sybil donations from a real user named Charlie, whose cart originally held all of Alice’s donations plus all of Bob’s.</p>\n<p>In fact, we could replace Alice and Bob’s donations with the donations from our hypothetical Charlie – and because of our Sybil resistance property, we still get the exact same funding results as before. But now our list of donors is one shorter. So what if we do the same thing again? We can pick two random users, combine their donations, and have a guarantee that our mechanism does the same thing before and after we squish them together.</p>\n<p>Now we’re in trouble, because we can keep “squishing” users together until our algorithm is just running on one donor who gave the sum of everybody’s individual donations. But we already know what QF mechanisms do when there’s only one donor – they don’t add any matching funds! So our sybil resistant “QF” mechanism is really just a plain old direct donation mechanism.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"in-experiments-cocm-is-much-less-vulnerable-to-sybil-attacks-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#in-experiments-cocm-is-much-less-vulnerable-to-sybil-attacks-4\"></a>In experiments, COCM is much less vulnerable to Sybil attacks</h1>\n<p>Given that sybil attacks are inevitable in any variation of QF (including COCM), the next step is to see how bad they get. To figure this out, we simulated a bunch of sybil attacks in the donation data for the Zuzalu tech round, which had just over 4,000 donors.</p>\n<p>For each project, we had the top 10 donors to that project make some number of sybils (5, 25, 75, or 100) each. We created these sybils by splitting up the real donations among the appropriate number of new wallets – so, no new money was added to the system. Then re-ran QF (or COCM) and saw how much the funding to that project changed. For each amount of sybils per user, we measured the average funding gain across all projects, and the maximum funding gain that any project got. Results are below:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/e/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1_2_475x355.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"x5C85qHCOEzyy0aPIiNVxw3u8vL\" width=\"475\" height=\"355\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1_2_475x355.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1_2_712x532.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1_2_950x710.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This chart makes it pretty clear that COCM is much more resilient to sybil attacks than standard QF.

It may be difficult to generate a large number of sybil accounts that look different enough to get past the attenuation imposed by COCM.</p>\n<p>But this leads to a caveat: there are many, many strategies for generating sybil accounts. I tried many of them, but we didn’t try all of them, and we certainly don’t consider ourselves better sybil attack strategists than every other person in the web3 ecosystem. Some attack strategies may be more effective than what we tried.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, these experiments suggest that Gitcoin’s sybil resistance strategy can be adjusted to have a lighter burden on the user. Next, we’ll describe a new approach to Passport that does just that.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"passports-model-based-detection-provides-lower-user-friction-and-greater-effectiveness-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#passports-model-based-detection-provides-lower-user-friction-and-greater-effectiveness-5\"></a>Passport’s Model-Based Detection Provides Lower User Friction and Greater Effectiveness</h1>\n<p>The Gitcoin Passport team has recently introduced a Model-Based Detection System. This system analyzes the on-chain history of addresses and compares it to the historical data of known human and sybil addresses. Based on this comparison, the model assigns each address a score ranging from 0 to 100, where a score closer to 0 indicates a higher likelihood of the address being a sybil, and a score closer to 100 suggests a higher probability of the address belonging to a genuine human user.</p>\n<p>This is a very different approach from the Stamp-Based System, in which users are prompted to connect with different identity providers to prove their personhood. In past rounds, we’ve heard many complaints that people find this manual system too difficult to achieve a high enough score for maximum matching.</p>\n<p>One of the advantages of the Model-Based system is that it requires minimum user interaction and could greatly reduce user frustration. The new user experience would be mostly hands-free. Users’ wallets will be automatically scanned in the background and assigned a score based on their history.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’re keen to understand if this newer system can provide a level of sybil defense that is at least as effective as Passport Stamps in GG19. We’ll investigate how it would have impacted the results if it had been used instead.</p>\n<p>One of the difficulties with the sybil resistance problem is that there is no answer sheet: we don’t have a list of confirmed humans and sybils and have to move forward with our best guesses.</p>\n<p>To determine if our solutions are protecting the matching pool from bad actors, we gut-check how our solutions affect which projects get funded. After investigating the projects in the round, a member of our team assigns each project a ‘Legitimacy Score,’ which is just a hand-wavey approximation. 5 means more legitimate, and 1 means less. When comparing COCM to normal QF, we’ve seen it take matching funds away from projects that have less legitimacy and shift them toward projects that have more.</p>\n<p>If we were to use Model-Based Detection instead of Stamp-Based, we’d want to see the matching going to the scammy projects be even less while there is an uptick in the matching going to legitimate projects. This is exactly what we see:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184_2_624x323.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"n67rnr4Mv2gtJ5BIeuJF2xCw2E\" width=\"624\" height=\"323\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184_2_624x323.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184_2_936x484.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184_2_1248x646.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EFEFE4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>1 and 2 scoring projects all see a slightly greater reduction in matching funding when switching from Stamps to the Model. This is a positive sign because it means the Model is removing voters from matching who are giving to these scammy projects. At the same time, we see a big increase in matching going to more legitimate projects indicating that the Model predicts most of their voters are human and should stay in the dataset. This is also a great sign!</p>\n<p>COCM alone redistributes 180,233.84 DAI of the matching fund compared to using normal quadratic funding and Gitcoin Passport. When combined with the Model, the redistribution increases to 227,453.29 DAI, representing a 20% increase in redistributed funds.</p>\n<p>Evaluating the impact of the Model without COCM, we find that it still redistributes 82,356.04 DAI. The redistribution shows a moderate to strong positive correlation (0.66) between the effects of COCM and Model on the results. This indicates that both strategies move results in the same direction and provide benefits when used separately. However, the strongest outcome is achieved by using them together.</p>\n<p>In GG19, Gitcoin Passport alone, without COCM, would have redistributed 9,643.46 DAI compared to not using Passport at all. The results show a weak negative correlation (-0.13) with COCM results.</p>\n<p>It is noteworthy that using the Model would lead to significantly improved funding outcomes, representing a substantial change in the effectiveness of sybil detection. Moreover, this can be achieved without requiring the voter to interact beyond sharing their wallet address, greatly reducing user friction.</p>\n<p>The Passport team has done an outstanding job with this model and we’re very happy to be working with them.</p>\n<p>However, we should make a caveat: the Model-Based system may look more effective today because no attacker has yet had a chance to game this system. On the other hand, people have had many rounds to try and game stamps. We’ll have to reevaluate our strategy as the attackers evolve continuously.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"path-forward-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#path-forward-6\"></a>Path Forward</h1>\n<p>Given these lines of analysis, we are planning for Gitcoin to use COCM and Passport Model-Based Detection as its sybil resistance tools for GG20. We believe this strategy will result in better funding outcomes for grantees and simultaneously reduce donor frustration.</p>\n<p>We also used COCM in GG19 and have since offered it in an extremely limited-beta to select partners. We’re happy to share that we’ll soon be rolling COCM out as an option for all our partners.</p>\n<p>As we’ve mentioned above, no sybil resistance strategy will be foolproof. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is clearly the best path forward with our current available tools.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524","pubDate":"Thu, 04 Apr 2024 10:50:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18524"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524.rss","#text":"Our Sybil Resistance Strategy for GG20"}},{"title":"Climate Coordination Network: Funding Proposal","dc:creator":"jon-spark-eco","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/c/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59\" title=\"CCN Logo Draft\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/c/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59_2_517x258.jpeg\" alt=\"CCN Logo Draft\" data-base62-sha1=\"s9Xjn3t90d09HuaQsClPTmxpDF7\" width=\"517\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/c/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59_2_517x258.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/c/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59_2_775x387.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/c/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59_2_1034x516.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CAD3D4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR</h1>\n<p>In October, the Climate Round “graduated” from the Gitcoin Grants Program and has since been managed by CCN.

This platform aims to build a registry atop Allo that will bring together details on the broad scope of grant programs within the EVM ecosystem, enabling grant program discovery and improving the application process for grantees and management for grantors while embodying Gitcoin’s open-source ethos.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#abstract-2\"></a><strong>Abstract:</strong></h3>\n<p>This project is designed to establish a comprehensive and accessible registry of EVM-compatible grant programs, capitalizing on the strengths of the Grantee Accountability Protocol (GAP).</p>\n<p>By developing an on-chain platform built atop Allo Protocol, we aim to streamline the discovery and management of grant programs, making it simpler for grantees to find relevant opportunities and for grantors to maintain up-to-date program information. The initiative focuses on delivering a user-centric interface for exploring grant listings integrated directly with GAP to ensure a seamless, transparent, and efficient process for all stakeholders.</p>\n<p>We are excited to collaborate with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov\">@Sov</a> for this project. Sov has vast experience collaborating with various grant programs and has managed grants program data in the past. His expertise will be crucial in driving the success of this project.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"benefits-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#benefits-motivation-3\"></a><strong>Benefits &amp; Motivation:</strong></h3>\n<p>Grants are crucial for ecosystem development, offering essential funding for projects and initiatives. However, the current grant landscape needs to be more cohesive and clear, which poses challenges. This platform addresses these by simplifying discovery, application, and management processes, fostering ecosystem growth, enhancing transparency, and encouraging community participation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"scope-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#scope-4\"></a><strong>Scope:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An onchain registry of EVM-aligned grant programs built on top of Allo Protocol</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration with Karma GAP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open-source development and community collaboration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"strategic-fit-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#strategic-fit-5\"></a><strong>Strategic Fit:</strong></h3>\n<p>The opportunity presented by this project is multifaceted and deeply aligned with Gitcoin’s overarching goals. Here’s a breakdown of the “why” behind its potential impact and value:</p>\n<p><strong>Aligns with Open-Source Development Goals</strong></p>\n<p>Gitcoin has long championed open-source development, recognizing it as a cornerstone of progress within Web3. The platform’s open-source nature ensures that the community can continuously improve, audit, and extend it, fostering a collective development and learning culture.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhances Transparency Across EVM Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>The project’s core objective is to create a transparent overview of EVM-aligned grant programs. In the current landscape, finding and applying to these programs can be opaque, with information scattered and processes varying significantly between programs. This platform centralizes and clarifies the available opportunities, making it easier for potential grantees to find relevant programs and for grantors to attract suitable applicants. Such transparency is crucial in building trust and accountability within the ecosystem, encouraging more participation and engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Facilitates Accessibility and Management</strong></p>\n<p>Grantors are empowered to keep their information up-to-date and reflect current opportunities and requirements by enabling the claiming and proactive management of program profiles on the platform. This feature benefits the grantors by ensuring that programs are represented and aids grantees in accessing the most relevant and current opportunities. The ease of access and the ability to directly manage these profiles democratize the grant application process, making it more inclusive and efficient for all parties involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Leverages the Allo Protocol</strong></p>\n<p>Allo’s design for facilitating on-chain actions and interactions makes it an ideal foundation for this aggregator platform. It offers scalability, security, and integration capabilities with existing Web3 infrastructure. This alignment with Allo harnesses its technical strengths and signifies a strategic collaboration within the Gitcoin ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Presents Broad EVM Ecosystem Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>While the immediate benefits to Gitcoin and its community are clear, this project also presents significant opportunities for the broader EVM ecosystem. By streamlining access to grant programs, the platform can stimulate more active participation across different projects, leading to increased innovation, collaboration, and growth. It catalyzes ecosystem-wide development, supporting projects at various stages and fostering a more interconnected and supportive Web3 community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"risk-assessment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#risk-assessment-6\"></a>Risk Assessment</h3>\n<p>The primary risks involve adoption by grant programs and applicants and the technical challenges of integration. To address these, we will leverage the relationships already built with existing programs along with our in-house development expertise. The work we have already done with Karma GAP demonstrates our ability to execute in both of these areas.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"budget-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#budget-7\"></a>Budget</h3>\n<p>The projected budget for developing and implementing Karma’s On-Chain Grant Aggregator platform is $40,000.

I loved the diversity of approaches toward their goals. It’s really important to keep improving impact verification in a way that is standardized across the board when it comes to several data verticals, which could allow communities to be future-proof and resilient to the ever-changing web3 landscape. - Wasabi</p>\n<p>First off, thank you to everyone who applied, it’s amazing to see so many different corners of our ecosystem working to help fund their communities. We saw 14 strong applications, yet in the end could only select 5 to move forward with receiving matching funds from Gitcoin. For myself, the perspective I used to rank the applications was as follows:</p>\n<p>I tried my best to use only the information provided in the application, however, I knew more about some communities than others, so took a bit of time to explore what I could for those that I did not have any previous touchpoints and felt I needed more context.</p>\n<p>When ranking impact I looked to evaluate both the impact in the specific community round they are looking to run, as well as the ripple impact the round could have on the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p>For experience, I looked at if they had run rounds before from a logistics perspective but if the operators/team/project executing this were capable of bringing in even more funding via donations. Again thinking of the ripple effects outside of the round, based on what I can see, how strongly can they activate their communities?</p>\n<p>Leverage was assessed considering the goals, number of projects expected, operator experience, and current matching fund amount, recognizing the potential impact even with small matching pools if communities can effectively engage larger networks.</p>\n<p>Despite limitations, the rubric used for the round was a practical choice due to time constraints, with plans for future expansion and refinement based on feedback from this round within the Council.</p>\n<p>My tips for those looking to apply in the next round: Write your application as if everyone reading it has absolutely no idea who you are, what your round is about, who is in your community or how much impact you’ve had in the past. When including your past rounds, link to the Gitcoin report cards (or other summaries if they weren’t Gitocin rounds) and give context and other metrics points if it is relevant. Explain what kind of projects will be in your round and how many, what kind of impact they will have/have already had, why that impact is important, and how this round will be a net positive for them and the broader community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Lana Dingwall</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you all for applying. I have provided feedback for each of you, independent of how well-known some applications were. I believe that I reviewed each application based on what was written and the applicants’ previous track records within the Gitcoin ecosystem, and also examined the impact they would have on the overall Ethereum community. I also evaluated how well applications considered eligibility criteria, objectives, and the leverage of matching rounds (how projects could benefit from being accepted).</p>\n<p>I think a point for reflection would be to add more requirements to the eligibility criteria that match the rubric we were given (impact, experience, leverage), as these are significant factors in the selection process. It would be easier to make them a requirement (e.g., must have run a Gitcoin round, matching should be comparable to the number of applicants accepted).</p>\n<p>For those applying, having a well-thought-out application is crucial. Think about your round objectives, clearly define how your project’s eligibility criteria play into that, and show a clearly defined impact assessment and reflection plan. Many missed this, which was one of the less detailed areas. If this is your first round, consider how your previous experience can lead to success as a Gitcoin Grants round operator. Another aspect I looked at was the selection of projects by round operators in previous rounds, something for future applicants to consider.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great experience, and I am looking forward to discussing it further with the council to make improvements. Thank you to all who voted for me. I evaluated each application fairly and to the best of my ability.</p>\n<p><em><strong>— Feems</strong></em></p>\n<p>We would like to give each round some direct feedback. You will hear from MathildaDV over the course of this week (please check gov forum DM’s if I’m not connected to you elsewhere) for some feedback on your applications. And just because you didn’t get in this round, don’t fret! There will be many more opportunities in the future. And anyone is still welcome to run their round during GG20 (there will be a GG20 round setup walkthrough posted on the forum shortly).</p>\n            <p><small>15 posts - 8 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-rounds-announced/18402\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-rounds-announced/18402","pubDate":"Mon, 25 Mar 2024 19:51:46 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18402"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-rounds-announced/18402.rss","#text":"GG20 Community Rounds Announced"}},{"title":"How to Find The Best Way To Fund Public Goods -

I ate Acai in Copacabana beach to my heart’s content, went hanggliding with a German friend, and raved in a discoteca out in a favela. People warned us we might get stabbed or robbed or drugged there, but that we had to visit because people in that area were the best dancers who knew how to have a good time.</p>\n<p>Then the next day, I walked through downtown and found the most extreme financial inequality I had ever witnessed. I had seen waves of tent encampments and shared meals under crowded bridges in the USA which is where I had seen the most inequality before this. The homeless in the USA are mostly immigrants saving up to send more funds to their kids back home, elderly who pushed away or were abandoned by their families, and drug addicts and the mentally ill. In Rio as I walked amongst the shining skyscrapers of the financial district, I saw families.</p>\n<p>I remember standing at one intersection and watching as waves of men in suits holding a phone to their ear with one hand and a laptop bag in the other rushed the marble floors lined with cardboard. On one patch of cardboard, a young mother and father were playing with their toddlers.</p>\n<p>I knew right then that I would relentlessly pursue every opportunity that I had the good fortune to come across. Now I run a tech company that provides an economic mechanism that I believe can empower people to support their families and one another and that this can scale up to neighborhoods, nations, and civilizations. Not only that, I have a network of friends who also are working for the same goals with their platforms.<br>\nLet’s test it and see if we can really make a difference.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf.webp\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf\" title=\"0d4508_c938af9808d94f0b8cad1851832c42da~mv2\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf_2_666x500.webp\" alt=\"0d4508_c938af9808d94f0b8cad1851832c42da~mv2\" data-base62-sha1=\"uJvs8523G7F9eOOkZTpJNWMNuub\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf_2_666x500.webp, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf_2_999x750.webp 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf_2_1332x1000.webp 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"8A7566\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>I would like to dedicate this idea in memory of my friend Antonio, who’s gentle smile and raucous laughter made my first time in Brazil a wonderful experience.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think I have some messages to send to see if there are people who wish to work together and help lead this initiative.

Bueno, el primer paso para desarrollar la inteligencia emocional es aprender a reconocer nuestras propias emociones y sentimientos para así poder comprender de dónde provienen y poder controlarlas.</p>\n<p>Además, la inteligencia emocional también nos puede ayudar a relacionarnos con los demás, partiendo principalmente desde nuestro lado empático. Ya que, una persona inteligente desde el punto de vista emocional no solo será capaz de comprender los sentimientos de los demás y ponerse en su lugar, sino que también podrá canalizar todas estas fuerzas de forma positiva. Pero, ¿Sabías que mediante el desarrollo de nuestra inteligencia emocional podemos lograr distintos aspectos positivos? A continuación, compartimos alguno de ellos:</p>\n<p>Percibir nuestras emociones y conocer sus efectos, aumenta nuestra autoconciencia emocional.</p>\n<p>Aprender a auto motivarse.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elpradopsicologos.es/timidez/habilidades-sociales/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mejorar nuestras relaciones</a>.</p>\n<p>Desarrollar la empatía (la capacidad para ponernos en el lugar del otro y comprender cómo se siente).</p>\n<p>Aumentar nuestro autocontrol.</p>\n<p>Regular nuestros estados emocionales.</p>\n<p>Es importante demostrar que todos tenemos la capacidad de aprender, fomentar y desarrollar la inteligencia emocional. Es importante que aprendamos a usarla en nuestra vida diaria porque es un factor de protección ante cualquier malestar psicológico que podamos tener. A continuación te contamos algunas claves que debes tener en cuenta para lograr desarrollar tu inteligencia emocional:</p>\n<h2><a name=\"un-ttulo-para-este-bloque-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#un-ttulo-para-este-bloque-2\"></a>Un título para este bloque</h2>\n<p><strong>5 claves para aumentar y desarrollar tu inteligencia emocional</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Date tiempo para reflexionar sobre lo que sientes e intenta averiguar siempre cuáles son las causas de esas emociones</li>\n<li>No niegues tus sentimientos, acéptalos. Recuerda que sentir rabia o ira es humano, lo que verdaderamente cuenta es cómo expresar esa emoción sin hacerle daño a los que te rodean</li>\n<li>Determina cuáles son tus potencialidades y límites, así fomentar la autoconfianza y el autoconocimiento.</li>\n<li>Los cambios son una parte intrínseca de la vida, acéptalos y aprende a adaptarte a ellos.

One very easy and clear change we could make is to introduce a fee switch to Allo protocol, allowing Gitcoin to take a percentage of that volume into its treasury.</p>\n<p>Uniswaps recent discussion on the <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">activation</a> of their fee switch provides some guidance about how this could happen, and the benefits of doing so.</p>\n<p>Although Gitcoin is a different protocol to uniswap, the foundation of these decisions should be same. Protocols cannot sustain being public goods indefinitely and leaning into value accrual as a protocol is important. There are however reasonable discussion points that this type of fee switch could damage Gitcoins public goods reputation, here’s how we feel that we can mitigate this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with making the checkout process have an <strong>optional</strong> donation/fee to Gitcoin DAO.</li>\n<li>Only enact the fee switch on the official Gitcoin frontend, and let others deploy their own frontends without fee switches.</li>\n<li>Provide ways to route around the fee switch through holding / staking GTC?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Allo has established itself as a credible tool for capital allocation, projects with large sums of capital have two incentives to use Allo with a fee switch.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It has pre-existing infrastructure which is easy to use, making the fee worthwhile.</li>\n<li>Using Allo (with a fee) also means that you also contributing to public goods inherently by contributing to the sustainability of public goods infrastructure.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2-passport-staking-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-2-passport-staking-2\"></a>2. Passport Staking</h2>\n<p>Gitcoin Passport has staked 1.5m of GTC so far <a href=\"https://dune.com/ivanmolto/gitcoin-identity-staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">(source)</a>.  This is roughly 1.5% of the total supply staked within Passport within the first 18 months of launch <strong>during a bear market.</strong></p>\n<p>Sybil resistance has continued to be at the forefront of protocol and airdrop design, with projects like Worldcoin having significant valuations solving the same problem in a different way. Being able to capture some of this value for GTC via Passport presents like an achievable and impactful goal.</p>\n<p>We encourage Gitcoin to continue to focus on identity staking and build more sybil resistance mechanisms into the Passport ecosystem, as well as more aggressively propagating passport throughout the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Ensuring GTC is the primary mechanism for passport staking and security longterm is also a high priority for the protocol.</p>\n<p>We see a possible next step of crafting a DAO wide strategy to further adoption of Gitcoin passport across the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-3-gtc-venture-fund-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-3-gtc-venture-fund-3\"></a>3. GTC Venture Fund</h2>\n<p>Gitcoin has delivered $60m value to over 3700 different grants over the past 5 years, a key contributor to Ethereum’s growth and success.</p>\n<p>These grant rounds have supported countless teams and projects from their earliest stages, with GTC being the key mechanism to enable this support through governance and infrastructure development.</p>\n<p>Gitcoin has an extensive track record of projects funded: Uniswap, WalletConnect, Yearn Finance, etc. If Gitcoin and GTC could have been distributed even a small fraction of ownership from these protocols to reinvest Gitcoin’s future it would have been immensely valuable.</p>\n<p>The main reason to create a “Gitcoin venture matching” fund is the dealflow that Gitcoin has access to, since many of these projects come to Gitcoin at inception it allows for the projects to be sufficiently supported, whilst allowing Gitcoin to share in their future upside.</p>\n<p>In practice this is likely a GTC matching pool managed by a <a href=\"https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hats</a> structure where an elected ‘GTC venture committee’ distributes additional GTC incentives to projects that are willing to share future ownership / token allocation back to the GTC DAO.</p>\n<p>Where a grants matching funds are doubled* (*open for discussion on this exact number) by the GTC venture committee in exchange for a future commitment of sharing any tokens, revenue or upside the project ends up accruing.</p>\n<p><strong>This effectively makes Gitcoin into an “Ethereum Emerging Market Fund” that has upside in each of the up &amp; coming projects coming through the grants funnel.</strong></p>\n<p>The ask behind this would be community feedback on how to best structure a ‘GTC Venture Committee’, create a new treasury for the venture arm and possible deal term templates to create efficiency in this area. <strong>We do not want Gitcoin to focus too hard on capturing the most value out of seeding projects but rather have some exposure to be able to reinvest in public goods longterm.</strong></p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-4\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>As Gitcoin grows, there will be a handful of different directions through which GTC value could accrue.  We welcome feedback from the Gitcoin community as to which directions we think could be most fruitful.</p>\n<p>We think the first step should be setting up a GTC Venture Committee because this is the most time sensitive value add and potentially holds the largest upside for GitcoinDAO.</p>\n<p>Allo and Passport are also high impact value adds, but would benefit from taking more time for the community to build out and iterate on the mechanisms and structure involved.</p>\n<p>We at FireEyes deeply believe in Gitcoin’s mission of expanding Ethereum’s ecosystem in a virtuous way, but we also want to be sensitive towards the sustainability of GTC and Gitcoin itself.</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback from the community would be very helpful, specifically on each of the three core proposals and how to best roll them out.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380","pubDate":"Wed, 20 Mar 2024 21:46:26 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18380"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380.rss","#text":"GTC Value Accrual Intro"}},{"title":"[UPDATED] DAO Financial Report - February 2024","dc:creator":"darwinmvr","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>February 2024 kicked off Season 21 for our organization, signaling a period of strategic reorganization and financial strength.

This suggested funding process could become a highly effective and scalable approach for Web3 ecosystems to more consistently generate impact.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to experiment with a contributor funding approach is better highlighted by understanding some of the problems that exist with idea based funding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For contributors, the proposal submission process can require a large amount of effort and time upfront for contributors to participate and then also handle the ongoing burden of proposal writing and budgeting complexities to get involved in an ecosystem. The structure and incentives of this funding process result in a reduced amount of contribution flexibility and income stability that can deter contributors from participating or limit their ability to easily generate high impact.</li>\n<li>For voters, it is often highly complex to compare and select ideas effectively. Many voters lack the sufficient context, skills and experience required to be well informed and effectively participate in these decisions. The selection process can be highly time consuming and complex for the voters. Voters can rarely express their exact preferences with their voting decisions and also do not have enough accountability or incentives to be expected to spend a meaningful amount of time on voting to make more optimal and well informed decisions.</li>\n<li>For Web3 ecosystems, ideas are often treated as ephemeral yes or no funding decisions rather than being a collaborative process that looks to discuss and explore different solution approaches. In larger funding processes it can also become easier for innovative ideas to be ignored due to being less well understood or known. The allocation of assets can also be more inefficient in situations where the allocated funds are not actively being used to generate contribution outcomes, this can increase the percentage of deadweight assets that are not being fully utilised at a given point in time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To understand these problems in more detail you can review our analysis on the current funding landscape - <a href=\"https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/current-funding-landscape\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Current funding landscape | Contributors</a></p>\n<p>The good news is that most of these problems can be either greatly reduced or fully resolved! An open source contributor funding process can help with resolving these problems and also could become a highly reliable and effective process for maintaining and improving Web3 ecosystems over the long term.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996\" title=\"web3-open-source-contributor-funding\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996_2_690x365.jpeg\" alt=\"web3-open-source-contributor-funding\" data-base62-sha1=\"dfVGL3faJmTg9b9msENXyJpbhnE\" width=\"690\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996_2_690x365.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996_2_1035x547.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996_2_1380x730.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D1DEE6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Our proposal outlines the suggestion of experimenting with directly funding a small number of open source developers that would help with developing any open source initiatives - this could include improving any existing pieces of software used in the ecosystem or creating entirely new tools and libraries.</p>\n<p>The advantages and long term opportunities for adopting a contributor funding approach are numerous. We’ve covered the advantages and opportunities of this suggested funding process in more detail in our proposal - <a href=\"https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/open-source-contributor-funding\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open source contributor funding | Contributors</a></p>\n<p>You can alternatively watch our videos that cover the same content from our proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZWo9qNm3mvs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/ZWo9qNm3mvs</a> - Current Web3 funding landscape</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/f3fP2bjf6rY\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/f3fP2bjf6rY</a> - Tech company comparison with Web3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/mQHqwHIDKMo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/mQHqwHIDKMo</a> - Open source contributor funding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The background analysis that helps to support this proposal can be found here - <a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://disbursement.treasuries.co</a></p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"experimentation-in-gitcoin-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#experimentation-in-gitcoin-1\"></a>Experimentation in Gitcoin</h1>\n<p>I’ve followed Gitcoin for a long time and have always been impressed with the amount of experimentation! From what I’ve seen so far in the Gitcoin stack I’ve not seen contributor based funding approach, I might have missed some previous experiments and if so please share any info below. I’ve seen a few Gitcoin grants historically where the project was to just to support an individual - which is trying to create a contributor process using the existing grants process to achieve the same outcome.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Citizen-Grants-6cf45c8501c3430eae3791434bcafb87?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin Citizens</a> seems like the closest thing I’ve seen to contributor based funding however even that seems to go down the path of idea based funding as the key part of the Gitcoin Citizen Proposals (GCPs).</p>\n<p>One question I have is whether a contributor funding model could be an experiment in the <a href=\"https://allo.gitcoin.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Allo protocol</a>? I’m not sure how flexible it is for handling a different structure that focuses more on contributors rather than ideas.</p>\n<p>If there’s experiments in contributor funding that I’ve missed from Gitcoin in the past then I’d love to hear about them and see what learnings were made. Even with the Gitcoin grants stack as it is currently a contributor funding process could be a great supplementary process, open source contributors could be funded to help with supporting the Gitcoin grants projects as well as other open source initiatives. It would be great to see what collaborations and initiatives emerge due to focussing on a flexible cohort of developers that can help with many initiatives at a time.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"experiment-facilitation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#experiment-facilitation-2\"></a>Experiment facilitation</h1>\n<p>If any ecosystem was interested in experimenting with this suggested funding process but doesn’t want to handle the process fully themselves I am eager to collaborate with them and help wherever I can with setting up and running any of these experiments that are focussed on contributor funding.</p>\n<p>In either event, contributor funding experiments across many ecosystems could be highly beneficial for the wider industry. The outcomes from these experiments can be analysed to better compare the strengths and weaknesses of this suggested approach against the widely adopted idea based funding approach that we see being more widely used across Web3 ecosystems today. Analysing and documenting these experiment outcomes is something that we intend to work on at the <a href=\"https://web3association.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Web3 Association</a>!</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"community-discussion-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-discussion-3\"></a>Community discussion</h1>\n<p><strong>General thoughts &amp; feedback</strong><br>\nThere’s likely going to be many opportunities and problems that could be better explored and addressed. If you have any immediate thoughts and feedback please share anything below in a comment!</p>\n<p><strong>Organising a wider discussion</strong><br>\nIf there are already weekly or monthly organised discussion events that happen internally or publicly I’d be delighted to join one to listen to peoples different perspective about this funding process suggestion to better understand any of the different viewpoints around this approach. Alternatively I could also help to facilitate a one off discussion instead. Please share below if you would be interested in having a dedicated discussion in the near future about this suggested experiment.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct communication</strong><br>\nIf anyone would prefer to chat about this funding process suggestion with me directly then please feel free to reach out to me on Discord - lovegrovegeorge or Telegram - <a href=\"https://t.me/georgelovegrove\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Telegram: Contact @georgelovegrove</a>.

We deliberately delayed our round to ensure a clear strategic direction and a comprehensive understanding of our needs. Following extensive organizational development and a series of DAO planning workshops, we have crystallized our vision for conducting a successful Gitcoin round.</p>\n<p>Our track record as a grantee in the past two rounds speaks to our capability and success in executing impactful projects. Specifically, we successfully utilized the funds to host our inaugural live film festival in New York City on May 7, 2024, and to support two months of weekly workshops that fostered creative envisioning and draft an initial whitepaper for the organizations future development plans.</p>\n<p><strong>How big is your team that will run this round? Who is your team?</strong></p>\n<p>The Psychedelic Puppet Show Non-Profit hosts a dedicated board of four members: Dr. Brad Necyk (Instagram/Twitter bradnecyk), Dr. Pam Kryskow, Aaron Munson (Instagram aamunson), and Scott Nelson. Additionally, we have strengthened our team by appointing Brad Necyk as Executive Director and Ona Praderas as our Community Engagement Officer.</p>\n<p>Our network extends to renowned figures in the field, including Paul Stamets (famed myscologist, Twitter/Instagram paulstamets), Rick Doblin (founder of MAPS), Jason Silva (TV personality, Twitter/Instagram jasonsilva), Alex and Allyson Grey (famed artists, Twitter/Instagram alexgreycosm), as well as key psychedelic organizations such as MAPS (Instagram maps_org), Psychedelic Assembly (Instagram psychedelic_assembly), Propeller (Instragram propeller.la, Psychedelic Association of Canada (Instagram psychedelicassociation), District216 (Instagram district216official), and Psychedelic SF Gallery (Instagram psychedelicsfgallery), among others.</p>\n<p>To ensure the integrity and alignment of our grant review process, our board members will serve as the primary reviewers. This approach guarantees that all proposals are evaluated thoroughly to align with our mission and values.</p>\n<p><strong>How does this round align with Gitcoin’s mission and essential intents?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, we do align with Gitcoin’s mission and essential interests, as our focus in this round is to lay the groundwork for a global, decentralized, and self-governed community that raises psychedelic awareness and adds the public good. We believe that cutting-edge technologies such as digital media, AI, and blockchain can enable this vision. We believe in a read, write, generate, and own platform that empowers and compensated creators and contributors.</p>\n<p>We are planning to contribute $10,000 USD in matching funds from a private Bitcoin donation we received in November of 2023.</p>\n<p>ETH address: 0xadaa3b0d9b96df7e338b6db62e7daa073e0e94a5</p>\n<p><strong>Who will be advisors for this round, if anyone?</strong></p>\n<p>Scott Nelson (long-term web3 investor), Shawn Anderson (blockchain engineer and founder of Long Tail Financial), Adam Szymanski (Art Consultant specializing in NFTs), and Ben West (Gitcoin).</p>\n<p><strong>Please describe the eligibility criteria you envision for this proposed round.</strong></p>\n<p>In a broad way, every project must enhance our core vision of creating a decentralized community that creates fun, educational, and accessible content around psychedelic science, therapy, cultural practices, historical uses, or spirituality.</p>\n<p>Each project must fit into one or more of these three areas: artist creations, live events, or DAO governance.</p>\n<p>Each project must be willing to collaborate with our organization for the realization and launch of each project.</p>\n<p><strong>How large is your community approximately?</strong></p>\n<p>We have a growing number of thought leaders in the psychedelic space but are very excited to begin including and empowering creators worldwide. With the help of our social media platforms and the amplification of content through Paul Stamets and Jason Silva, our current content has reached over a million people. We aim to bring more creators into this community and share their visions and stories.</p>\n<p><strong>What type of projects would you like to fund?</strong></p>\n<p>In our inaugural year as a non-profit, we achieved significant milestones, such as producing media with leading figures in the psychedelic field, launching our first psychedelic film festival in New York City, and securing funding through Gitcoin and a private Bitcoin donation, enabling us to hire two new team members and offer $10,000 in matching funds for this round.</p>\n<p>Collaborating with a web developer, a blockchain engineer, and a postdoctoral AI researcher, we are crafting a whitepaper focused on community networking, AI tooling, and blockchain integration.</p>\n<p>For the upcoming Gitcoin round, we are eager to attract innovative proposals that will help expand our organization in three key areas, consistent with our mission, values, and strategic growth plans:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Artistic Projects</strong>: We seek to fund projects that produce fun, educational, and accessible content related to psychedelic science, therapy, cultural practices, historical uses, and spirituality.</li>\n<li><strong>Live Events</strong>: We aim to support events that combine film, art, music, readings, and public discussions, with the potential for global hosting, to foster community engagement and idea exchange.</li>\n<li><strong>DAO Governance</strong>: We are committed to establishing and enhancing a community-governed DAO, focusing on strategic planning, infrastructure development, and launch.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Approximately how many grantees do you believe will be eligible to apply to this round?</strong></p>\n<p>We are committed to funding 6-8 outstanding projects that promise sustainable growth and long-term benefits for our organization and community. With five core contributors currently driving our vision forward, we are keen to welcome additional individuals and organizations. Their fresh perspectives and innovative approaches will undoubtedly enrich and expand our capabilities beyond what we could achieve independently. We are enthusiastic about the prospect of incorporating new voices into our project, enhancing its diversity and impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact Assessment: If and how do you intend to assess grantee impact over successive rounds? This could include, but is not limited to Hypercerts, GAP, Deresy, etc.</strong></p>\n<p>In collaboration with Shawn Anderson from Longtail Financial, we will explore the potential of Hypercerts and DeReSy to enhance our grant assessment process. Hypercerts could be used to create a transparent, verifiable record of a project’s impact, allowing us to track and reward achievements effectively. These tokens would enable us to retrospectively fund projects based on their proven impact, fostering a more dynamic and responsive funding model.</p>\n<p>With DeReSy, we could implement a robust system for on-chain project reviews, providing clear, immutable assessments of each project’s progress and outcomes. This would allow for transparent and objective evaluations, facilitating better decision-making for future grant allocations.</p>\n<p>By working with Longtail Financial, we aim to integrate these technologies into our grant-making process, ensuring that we fund projects that offer significant, verifiable impact. This strategic collaboration will help us leverage cutting-edge blockchain technology to make more informed and impactful funding decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there anything else that community members should consider when voting for which rounds to focus on in the upcoming GG20 grants round?</strong></p>\n<p>Our organization, dedicated to promoting public good, believes in the transformative power of psychedelics and the arts towards making a better world. We view artists as essential in shaping public perception and preparing society for the changes psychedelics can bring. Recognizing the value of their work, we advocate for fair compensation for artists. Through this funding round, we aim to support projects that establish enduring, sustainable contributions to our organization and vision, empowering artists to create and disseminate their work, thereby influencing global consciousness positively.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-proposal-psychedelic-community-round-the-creation-of-fun-educational-and-accessible-psychedelic-content-and-live-events-with-dao-governance/18354\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-proposal-psychedelic-community-round-the-creation-of-fun-educational-and-accessible-psychedelic-content-and-live-events-with-dao-governance/18354","pubDate":"Sun, 17 Mar 2024 23:24:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18354"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-proposal-psychedelic-community-round-the-creation-of-fun-educational-and-accessible-psychedelic-content-and-live-events-with-dao-governance/18354.rss","#text":"GG20 Proposal: Psychedelic Community Round: the creation of fun, educational, and accessible psychedelic content and live events with DAO governance"}},{"title":"GG20 Proposal: ethereum.org Contributors Roud","dc:creator":"isabella","category":"🤖 DAO Governance and Vision","description":"<p>gm folks!

Community Engagement Methodology</h3>\n<p>We’re a fan of <a href=\"https://orbit.love/model/introduction\">Orbit’s model</a> to help us better contextualize the relationship between Gitcoin and individuals interacting with us (and with each other).</p>\n<p>By modeling our community engagement strategy like this, we can communicate differently with individuals who are more/less engaged with Gitcoin while providing a clear path for individuals to deepen their relationship with us.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/8/824252e7cf5312340cf9c87a5fc4092cb871b5f8.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/824252e7cf5312340cf9c87a5fc4092cb871b5f8\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/8/824252e7cf5312340cf9c87a5fc4092cb871b5f8_2_589x232.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"iAkauZ3rBQMPxe6FQICgP2TkMNa\" width=\"589\" height=\"232\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/8/824252e7cf5312340cf9c87a5fc4092cb871b5f8_2_589x232.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/8/824252e7cf5312340cf9c87a5fc4092cb871b5f8_2_883x348.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/8/824252e7cf5312340cf9c87a5fc4092cb871b5f8_2_1178x464.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"18152D\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<p>Each of Gitcoin’s sub-communities will have its own set of levels with defining characteristics.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-3-quality-vs-quantity-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-3-quality-vs-quantity-4\"></a>3. Quality vs. Quantity</h2>\n<p>Generally we are finding a balance of optimizing our activities for two different results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deepening existing relationships</li>\n<li>Inviting net new individuals into our ‘orbit’</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All with the goal of growing the ecosystem and creating an <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/10-useful-maxims-about-dao-era-system-design/17727\">upward spiral of momentum</a> and positive output.</p>\n<p>Both of these elements will count toward a “successful” community engagement initiative. Whether one is more important than the other will come down to the individual goals of each sub-community, and will likely fluctuate over time depending on the results we are seeing (ex: if we are seeing tons of new individuals, but few individuals truly stepping up as community leaders, we will aim to start focusing on the latter).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-4-principles-of-belonging-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-4-principles-of-belonging-5\"></a>4.
