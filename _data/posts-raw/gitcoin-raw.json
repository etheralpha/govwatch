The introduction of a fee to Allo would create a new revenue stream which would be passed back into the DAO treasury.</p>\n<p>Uniswaps previous discussion on the activation of their fee switch provides some guidance around the process involved in making this change, and valuable insight into the wider community response to such a change.</p>\n<p>Although Gitcoin is a different protocol to Uniswap, the foundation of these decisions should follow the same logical course. <strong>Protocols cannot sustain being public goods indefinitely and leaning into value accrual as a protocol is important.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>This initial pre-proposal discussion centres around two decisions that need to be made before we move forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly (1.) if the fee is added to Gitcoin‚Äôs deployment of Allo protocol <strong>or</strong> (2.) to all deployments of Allo protocol.</li>\n<li>Secondly if this fee was to be added, what percentage of volume the fee would take.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Firstly:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The fee switch could added to the Allo Protocol but only be enacted via the official Gitcoin deployment, not at the overall contract level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This allows others to fork the contracts and deploy their own instance without the fee if they wish to.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The fee switch could be implemented at the contract level, meaning that all deployments would include the switch unless it was removed from the contract itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This more strongly encourages anyone using the allo contracts to contribute to the funding of public goods via GitcoinDAO.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Secondly:</strong> The fee level is an open question - we invite community feedback and discussion but envision the fee sitting at one of the following levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5%</li>\n<li>1%</li>\n<li>3%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For context, looking at these fee levels retroactively gives us an idea of how impactful a fee could be over time:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"gg20-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#gg20-5\"></a>GG20:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5% of total GG20 donations = $3165</li>\n<li>1% of total GG20 donations = $6330</li>\n<li>3% of total GG20 donations = $18,990</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"all-time-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#all-time-6\"></a>All time:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$300k</li>\n<li>1% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$600k</li>\n<li>3% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$1.8m</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These numbers show value flows that could be directed towards sustainability.</p>\n<p><strong>It is important to note that the proceeds of this fee will be deposited back into the Gitcoin DAO treasury,</strong> to be directed into funding both the development of Gitcoin infrastructure, and the commons more broadly. As such, it makes sense for the fee to be higher than average and that most users would be accepting of this given that the fee exists purely to sustain the provision of Allo and related public goods.</p>\n<p><em>FireEyes would recommend that the switch be implemented at the Allo contract level with a fee of 1%. This is because it provides a clear value proposition to GitcoinDAO‚Äôs sustainability whilst remaining reasonably unobtrusive to users donating via the Allo protocol. It is obviously still possible to remove or reduce this fee switch, but this would need to be an explicit decision to exclude by anyone deploying.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"drawbacks-risks-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#drawbacks-risks-7\"></a>Drawbacks / Risks</h2>\n<p>There are reasonable discussion points that this type of fee switch could damage Gitcoin‚Äôs public goods reputation, here‚Äôs how we feel that we could mitigate this if deemed necessary by the community:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with the checkout process having an optional donation/fee to Gitcoin DAO.</li>\n<li>Only enact the fee switch on the official Gitcoin frontend, and let others deploy their own frontends without fee switches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Allo has established itself as a credible tool for capital allocation, projects with large sums of capital have two incentives to use Allo with a fee switch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has pre-existing infrastructure which is easy to use, making the fee worthwhile.</li>\n<li>Using Allo (with a fee) also means that you are also contributing to public goods inherently by contributing to the sustainability of public goods infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We hope to foster community discussion around both the introduction of this mechanism and its finer details, as well as more broadly around sustainability for the GitcoinDAO and it‚Äôs infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We realise this is a controversial topic to introduce to a public goods focused community like Gitcoin however starting this conversation is an important step towards ensuring that we can continue sustainably building public goods infrastructure for years to come!</p>\n<p>Please share your thoughts and feedback in this forum post <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/robot.png?v=12\" title=\":robot:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":robot:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974","pubDate":"Mon, 10 Jun 2024 22:27:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18974"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974.rss","#text":"[Discussion] Allo Fee Switch Proposal"}},{"title":"Dark Matter, coin voting, bribes, transferable stake, etc","dc:creator":"skilesare","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>Hey all‚Ä¶I‚Äôve started a bit of discussion over on the DFINITY forums(i know, i know) about some issues we‚Äôre running into.

It has been a goal of mine and others on the team to graduate Passport from Gitcoin as Gitcoin has been focused on Grants and growing GMV for a while now. At the same time, the Passport team has been focused on identity and the emerging world of onchain reputation, with some support for Gitcoin, but largely prioritizing the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Creating separation from the two entities ensures Passport‚Äôs actions across the space are no longer associated with the Gitcoin brand, and while Gitcoin continues to focus on capital allocation, there will no longer be questions on why we have an identity solution in the portfolio.</p>\n<p>This budget request seeks funding to enable the spin out of Passport and fund the business for its initial six months. Here is what we are thinking. Passport has generated revenue on OP and Linea (by enabling onchain attestations of one‚Äôs unique humanity, and OP RPGF3). Together with this funding, and a six month budget, we would like to formally request a vote to spin out of Gitcoin DAO. In return for bootstrapping the business unit, we will ensure Gitcoin has equity ownership in the new entity, a token allocation if/when we launch a token and a board seat in the new entity. The details on how a DAO may participate are a little murky (ie, have equity, and a board seat) and so we will be working with the Gitcoin Foundation to formalize the ownership and board seat appointment.</p>\n<p>Passport currently drives the majority utility use case for GTC and we plan to keep GTC utility in the product for the foreseeable future. We do not have details on if/when Passport has its own token, but we want to ensure as Gitcoin will likely be a large token holder in Passport, there will be token use cases that extend utility for other ERC-20 (like GTC).</p>\n<p>We are aiming to have this spinout complete in July, and would expect the Passport team to start to use its own properties (ie, Passport.xyz for the website and app, its own discord server, its own email, etc.) on July 1. While Passport will be an independent entity, there will still be lots of areas of collaboration as those running grants programs often need Sybil protection (and those doing airdrops often want to seed a Grants program after TGE).</p>\n<p>As for the progress the team has been making, updates below outline both progress and the roadmap we have ahead.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tldr-on-the-next-6mos-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-on-the-next-6mos-1\"></a>TL;DR on the next 6mos</h2>\n<p>Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity and reputation management. We are continuing to focus on ways to build a reputational substrate that can be leveraged permissionlessly onchain:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Adoption</strong> - Continue to expand the number of real humans with a passport</li>\n<li><strong>Growth</strong> - Grow the number of onchain attestations</li>\n<li><strong>Sustainability</strong> - Ensure continued runway extension</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"outline-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outline-2\"></a>Outline</h2>\n<p>Passport is the premier web3 native offering that enables ecosystems to protect, understand and organically grow what matters most ‚Äì their communities. We see Passport at the confluence of a best in class identity solution, backed by the most relevant and comprehensive data analysis toolset that also offers communities the ability to ascribe reputation.</p>\n<p>Objectives for Seasons 23: This table lists the milestones and deliverables we plan to tackle.

We now have a total of 1.4M unique all time passports. We also continued to drive strongly against our targets in GTC staking, hitting over 1.75M GTC staked.</p>\n<p>With a focus on onchain attestations, we have launched two new networks where Passport holders can attest to their unique humanity. This means, we now support attestations on Arbitrum, Optimism, Linea, and zkSync. Onchain attestations have started to unlock novel use cases where smartcontract interactions can now directly confirm a wallet‚Äôs humanity score, enabling truly permissionless and decentralized humanity confirmation.</p>\n<p>We have also done a lot of work to revamp the GTC staking experience to make the process more intuitive and informative. This has brought the creation of privacy policy details and user terms as the GTC staked can be slashed when users are acting in bad faith.</p>\n<p>And finally, our new Model Based Detection endpoint, and L2 coverage has continued to expand. We now can review wallets using our models across ARB, OP, zkSync, Polygon, Eth Mainnet, and NFT communities. This capability is incredibly helpful when engaging with other communities (new L2s) to help them understand who is likely a sybil actor and who is likely human on their network.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"milestone-report-for-past-season-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#milestone-report-for-past-season-4\"></a>Milestone Report for Past Season</h3>\n<p><strong>Legend:</strong> <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/green_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":green_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":green_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Success/Completed/Shipped <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">Incomplete, but partial success <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":red_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":red_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">Incomplete, Will Not Hit Goal <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/black_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":black_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":black_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Canceled</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n   <td><strong>Initiative/Project</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Key Results</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Value Delivered</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Ease\n   </td>\n   <td>üü¢Simplified Passport user experience\n   </td>\n   <td>Revamped Passport with fewer stamps, credentials, and simplified path to 20 score.\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Effectiveness\n   </td>\n   <td>üü°Updated score weights for all Passports based on previous 6 months of data\n<p>\nüü¢Aggregate L2 Models\n   </p></td>\n   <td>In addition the revamp of Passpot and the addition of the new models we‚Äôve made significant progress dropping the False positive rate under 16%, did not hit the target of &lt;10%.\n<p>\nWe‚Äôll have a working model by June 30th..\n   </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Adoption\n   </td>\n   <td>üü¢1.4M Passports\n<p>\nüü¢Scored 400k addresses with MDB \n   </p></td>\n   <td>Continued to drive top line growth of unique Passports by adding 255k new Passports exceeding our target of 1.3M driven by new partners Initia and zkLink.

We propose a Gitcoin DAO managed investment in revenue yielding real estate such as a working Eco-resort, or co-working residence, where accommodation provides recurring revenue.</p>\n<p>The equally pragmatic reasoning behind this proposal is to provide the wider Gitcoin community/ecosystem anchor <em><strong>‚ÄòSchelling Points‚Äô</strong></em> that foster relationship building, work retreats and work-life balance. The property could also include a winery or agricultural holdings enhancing the resort‚Äôs self-sustainability and providing on-site community building diversions during staycations and work retreats.</p>\n<p>The fundamental model here is less one of ‚ÄòWooffing‚Äô and more one of Jimmy Buffett‚Äôs <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Buffett%27s_Margaritaville\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Margaritaville</a> style resorts (currently<a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/jimmy-buffett-death-margaritaville-net-worth-9d7b825c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> valued </a>at well over $1B)</p>\n<p><em>I</em>mportantly, property management and upkeep will be governed on-chain using a bespoke governance platform in order to decentralize property management and facilitate remote stewardship of logistics, staff, maintenance and upkeep.*</p>\n<p>The ownership of the RWA will be held by the GitcoinDAO and/or Gitcoin Foundation. The fractional Property Use Rights will be shared among the wider Gitcoin community with the <em>sole qualification for fractional property purchase</em> being that the purchaser must be a current or past Gitcoin grantee or matching funder.</p>\n<p>This basic model is built upon a synthesis of <a href=\"https://www.homebasedao.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">HomebaseDAO</a> and<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HCay0WwpWtpSSlKHI7kWBaf5WhxwlzHK/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> ChateauDAO</a> with advisory by Homebase.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>  <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/arrow_down.png?v=12\" title=\":arrow_down:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":arrow_down:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>RWA (real property) as Treasury Diversification</li>\n<li>RWA (real property) for co-working and remote site team building</li>\n<li>RWA as simplified, more accessible property accrual for wider Gitcoin Ecosystem orgs and QF Round participants</li>\n<li>Travel &amp; Luxury: an industry that will not be displaced by AI</li>\n<li>EcoResort / Remote Work &amp; Co-working Residency (more in the style of Buffett‚Äôs Margaritaville franchise, less in the style of Wooffing)</li>\n<li>Sustainable energy integration</li>\n<li>Historical Building Renovation in France - 40% subsidy provided by French government for qualifying properties</li>\n<li>DAO (or Gitcoin Foundation) retains Property Deed</li>\n<li>Property Rights Users - own, are free to sell or keep, their Property Use Rights</li>\n<li>Revenue generation model based on accommodation use and fractional, tokenized lease purchase</li>\n<li>Native dApp for calendar booking, property maintenance and property management governance</li>\n<li>Low cost SBA loans available for such purchases</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We propose that the property deed be held by the Gitcoin Foundation (or DAO) as a hard asset used for treasury diversification, fiscal conservation and as a potential revenue stream for the foundation and the DAO.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/seedling.png?v=12\" title=\":seedling:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":seedling:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">The Fractional Use shares that are offered for purchase to the wider community will be for designated time use. <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/seedling.png?v=12\" title=\":seedling:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":seedling:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>For example, in the case of an Eco-Resort that can accommodate up to 100 guests at a time in 50 double-occupancy rooms, the fractional shares will be made available in increments of <strong>2-weeks per year use time for a 5 year block</strong>. This means that a purchaser can pay $XX to use the property two weeks per year for a consecutive 5 year period.</p>\n<p>We propose that these Property Use Rights be represented by RWA digital asset (NFT) holdership. We propose that Property Use Rights have a 5-year duration before mandatory renewal or re-selling. We also suggest that each fractional Property Use Right ‚Äòowner‚Äô must hold the access token (RWA digital asset) for at least 12 months (to prevent flipping) prior to selling on the secondary market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/house_with_garden.png?v=12\" title=\":house_with_garden:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":house_with_garden:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sunflower.png?v=12\" title=\":sunflower:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":sunflower:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\nAn example of how this could break down for a 35 Room B/BA former 4-star resort in the South of France surrounded by 3 hectares of property, a small lake, a river.

This means that partners and contributors can earn and receive a Property Use Right RWA digital asset for their consistency in providing matching funds for QF rounds or other contributions. The Property Use Right RWA digital asset does not confer title to property or property ownership rights but does allow for 2 weeks annually of fractional property use rights (TUP = Time Unit Purchase) per RWA held for 5 years (total use per RWA token is 10 weeks over the course of 5 years).</p>\n<p><strong>2nd USE Case - Co-Working Residency</strong></p>\n<p>Property Example A</p>\n<p>Biarritz, France.</p>\n<p>‚Ç¨2,550,000 9 BD/BA Pool &amp; Pool House, 3 hectares, stables, private pontoon</p>\n<p>*Biarritz is a Web3 hub in France, is a beautiful coastal town on the Atlantic, just on the border of Spain.

The country has a wealth of chateaux that are withering in neglect.</p>\n<p>With astute curation, a property can be purchased, restored with the help of the French government‚Äôs subsidies, thus providing needed work for regional artisans and craftsmen.  The final result is that of cultural preservation and public goods longevity while enhancing the personal wealth of the property owner.</p>\n<p><strong>USE CASE Example (Already Exists in Market)</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sushi.png?v=12\" title=\":sushi:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":sushi:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><em>Chateaushi</em> - This is an historical property development consortium that is crypto friendly. They offer fractional ownership of properties using a membership model. Their approach is one of luxury with strategic partnerships now in place with the former editor of the Michelin Guide, several celebrity chefs and other luxury travel tie-ins.</p>\n<p><strong>Tokenized Property As A Public Good</strong></p>\n<p>Here in this proposal, we seek to honor the Gitcoin Community‚Äôs dedication to public goods, ecosystem cultivation and growth, and shared, enriching experiences that offer sustainable outcomes.</p>\n<p>In this regard, we propose that we entertain strategic partnerships with Solar Punk, ReGen, Kundalini Yoga and clean energy communities and more like minded tribes‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Clean Energy Hubs: The really long vision is to build these RWA communities into clean energy hubs where solar energy, and one day, fusion energy, is farmed for our own use and the use of the surrounding communities. (More on that to come‚Ä¶).</p>\n<p><strong>Business Model</strong></p>\n<p>We are considering two business models, with an emphasis on the first:</p>\n<p>An <strong>EcoResort &amp;/or Co-Working Residence</strong> with suitable accommodations for multiples of groups, can be purchased outright by GitcoinDAO or the Gitcoin Foundation or a partnership between the two. The RWA is held in trust and maintained in the Treasury portfolio as a valuable, tradeable hard asset.</p>\n<p>This approach works for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>2024 is the \"year of RWAs‚Äô (BlockWorks)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gitcoin DAO is looking to be a ‚Äòproduct/ protocol‚Äô DAO with diverse offerings to the community</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Diversifying treasury holdings into something tangible and substantive such as real estate further strengthens the responsible fiscal position of the DAO</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Offering fractional Property Use Rights into RWA holdings for the larger Gitcoin community means that the community members can begin their own real estate fractional use  journey ( such as like Pacaso, Homebase, traditional timeshares);</p>\n<p>Community members and the different grantee orgs can continue building community and relationships within and among the Gitcoin Grantee ecosystems; Depending on the strategic property investments - agriculture yielding / winery/ EcoResort - the property could be self-sustaining and,  eventually, show revenue from local production in addition to revenue generated by accommodations use and appreciation of real value in real estate ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>Business Model <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span></strong></p>\n<p>Launch on Grant Stack as a funding round.  We approach capital investors who would then take the position of the holder of the RWA asset. In return, they would match fund in a QF round the Property Use Right fractional ownership purchases that the individual Gitcoin grantee community members and orgs raise.</p>\n<p>This would function as a traditional QF Round, except in this case the match funders would retain the deed to the property that is purchased using their capital. But they would share their capital investment by match funding using the QF formula. Each amount raised by community members, who seek to become fractional owners in the property by purchasing Property Use Rights as outlined above, would be match funded by said benefactor/ capital investor.</p>\n<p><strong>Monetization Models  -  Gitcoin Foundation Retains Property Deed, Fractionalizes Time Unit Purchases (TUP - see monetization break down above)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Property Example B:</strong></p>\n<p>Eco-Resort -  Former 4-star hotel property near Sarlat, Dordogne, France</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully Furnished, recently renovated</li>\n<li>Restaurant</li>\n<li>Lounge</li>\n<li>Reception</li>\n<li>Staff Accommodations (Four Bedroom/ Four Living Room Stone House)</li>\n<li>Barns and Outbuildings</li>\n<li>Suitable for Horses</li>\n<li>Guesthouse/Gite</li>\n<li>Swimming Pool</li>\n<li>Two estuaries</li>\n<li>Wooded Park, hundred year old trees</li>\n<li>Lake</li>\n<li>Wheelchair accessible</li>\n<li>Outdoor Terrace and Lounge</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd\" title=\"EcoResort Property Images 39 room 4 Star Resort\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd_2_690x473.jpeg\" alt=\"EcoResort Property Images 39 room 4 Star Resort\" data-base62-sha1=\"1GofNj5wX4Tm7k7z6lVBqAiJCBn\" width=\"690\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd_2_690x473.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"556541\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e\" title=\"EcoResort Property Images Table 2\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e_2_690x240.jpeg\" alt=\"EcoResort Property Images Table 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"u5pZYq1TzG7LmLq9bpucUZujv0G\" width=\"690\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e_2_690x240.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CAD1C7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>**35 Rooms - Time Unit 2 weeks =  Total  875 Units **</p>\n<p>**Each Unit sells for EURO 8000  =    EURO  7 Million **</p>\n<p>**Time Unit Purchase (TUP) entitles owner to: **</p>\n<p><strong>Use of 2 consecutive weeks of double occupancy room during the calendar year (of the 50 available weeks)</strong></p>\n<p>Duration of use is 5 years (i.e. 2 weeks per year for 5 years) at which time the holder has the option to renew at a highly favorable market price or to ‚Äòsell‚Äô back to the foundation or on the second market within the Gitcoin ecosystem.

The term of the loan can be up to 25 years, and interest rates can vary based on current market conditions and the applicant‚Äôs qualifications.</p>\n<p><strong>SBA 504</strong> loans are similar to their 7(a) counterparts; however, there is no limit to how much an investor can borrow. Investors must have good credit and provide a down payment of 10 percent of the purchase price. The term of the loan is typically 20 years, and the investor must occupy at least 51 percent of the property. Unlike SBA 7(a) loans, these mortgages are not funded entirely through a private lender. Instead, they are made available through Certified Development Companies (CDCs), nonprofit entities that promote economic development within their communities. Typically, a commercial lender funds 50 percent of the project, and a CDC finances up to 40 percent.</p>\n<p>Please post your thoughts, suggestions, feedback here <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pray/4.png?v=12\" title=\":pray:t4:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":pray:t4:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">.</p>\n<p>And feel free to reach out to Paige &amp;/or Alex on Telegram:<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/paigedao\">@PaigeDAO</a><br>\n<span class=\"mention\">@akim0x</span></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/community-owned-eco-resort-through-fractional-property-use-rights/18957\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/community-owned-eco-resort-through-fractional-property-use-rights/18957","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Jun 2024 17:40:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18957"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/community-owned-eco-resort-through-fractional-property-use-rights/18957.rss","#text":"Community Owned Eco-Resort Through Fractional Property Use Rights"}},{"title":"CCN Climate Solutions Round Retro","dc:creator":"jon-spark-eco","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa\" title=\"CCN Logo 2.0 Banner\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_345x153.png\" alt=\"CCN Logo 2.0 Banner\" data-base62-sha1=\"4Jwd2PiKluUHLVe83VyT9c4OOpQ\" width=\"345\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_345x153.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_517x229.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_690x306.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D1DADD\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"round-description-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-description-1\"></a>Round Description</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Climate Coordination Network</a> believes that Climate Action is the ultimate public good. Why? Because climate change increasingly impacts everyone worldwide. Our mission is to accelerate community-supported climate solutions on a global scale, catalyzing diverse forms of climate action to create a sustainable and equitable future for all.</p>\n<p>The GG20 Climate Solutions Round provides strategic grant distribution to support global climate solutions projects.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"round-objectives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-objectives-2\"></a>Round Objectives</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>To empower climate projects that are dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and serve as core infrastructure for Web3 climate solutions.</li>\n<li>To build community and accelerate coordination to help grow the greater public goods for climate solutions worldwide.</li>\n<li>To test and improve impact metrics tools that enable climate projects to showcase their real-world impact for more effective and streamlined measurement and evaluation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"target-audience-and-participation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#target-audience-and-participation-3\"></a>Target Audience and Participation</h2>\n<p>The Climate Solutions Round focuses on supporting early-stage projects within the following 9 categories of climate solutions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Renewable Energy</li>\n<li>Oracles &amp; dMRV</li>\n<li>Carbon Accounting</li>\n<li>Climate Activism/Education</li>\n<li>Nature-Based Solutions</li>\n<li>Ocean-Based Solutions</li>\n<li>Climate Adaptation/Climate Resilience</li>\n<li>Supply Chain Solutions</li>\n<li>Built Environment/Transportation</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"climate-solution-round-implementation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#climate-solution-round-implementation-4\"></a>Climate Solution Round Implementation</h2>\n<p>The Climate Coordination Network (CCN) is a dedicated team of six people from around the world who have served for the past two years on the Gitcoin Climate Advisory team and have managed the decentralized climate round since GG19. The team is familiar with Gitcoin Grants round setup and management, and we divide up the many tasks based on skill set and availability. To set up the GG20 Climate Solutions round, we reviewed the <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/climate-solutions-round-eligibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">eligibility criteria</a>, updated the <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CCN Climate Solutions Portal</a>, started communications and outreach, created the new Climate Solutions Metrics Garden and updated grantee resources such as onboarding videos and review process documentation.</p>\n<p>Our main challenges for GG20 involved our Climate Grantee review process. Most of our projects are making IRL impact, which is difficult to evaluate as it tends to be qualitative vs. quantitative. We strive to improve this process each round and for GG20, we utilized Checker (<a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-checker/17292\">a new tool built by Gitcoin</a>) to help with the lengthy process of reviewing 173 diverse grantee applications. Unlike OSS rounds, Checkers AI features didn‚Äôt really help us review climate projects. In the future, the AI model could be trained to provide useful feedback but for now, it was not effective. In past rounds, we used spreadsheet tools for the evaluation process. Checker provided a nice interface that gathered the information needed to complete our reviews. We hope to see something like Checker integrated into Grants Stack, as the approvals and rejections are still manual. We experienced technical issues with Grants Stack which did not allow us to export our grantee contact information, which caused a breakdown in communication with our grantees for most of the round.</p>\n<p>Going forward, we are discussing a new process that will streamline, simplify, and clarify climate reviews by requiring dMRV for certain types of projects and impact reporting using tools such as Hypercerts and KarmaGAP. We will require all of our grantees to use KarmaGAP to provide 2-3 milestones they will accomplish with the funding received during GG20. This requirement will enable grantees to showcase their impact and significantly reduce our time during the review process in future rounds.</p>\n<p>The Climate Solutions Round‚Äôs unique feature/approach is that we cultivate a supportive community that results in ongoing productive relationships and collaborations. During our review of grant proposals from projects that have been in multiple rounds, we found clear examples of grantees helping each other and working together to accomplish goals and address challenges. For example, as we transition to clearer requirements for impact metrics, many grantees are working with a Silvi Protocol, a long-time trusted dMRV project with an amazing web3 tech stack. Another example of climate grantees supporting each other is Helpers Social Development Foundation, a community-led NGO in Nigeria that is developing solar-powered community centers in partnership with The Solar Foundation and is also working to pilot a IoT smart metering device built by Switch Electric (also a grantee based in Nigeria).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"outcomes-and-statistics-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outcomes-and-statistics-5\"></a>Outcomes and Statistics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/42161/29\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Report card</a></li>\n<li>129 Climate Solutions Grantees</li>\n<li>Total crowdfunding: $58k</li>\n<li>9,314 contributions</li>\n<li>2,262 unique donors</li>\n<li>Average contribution: $4.08</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Summary of the past three rounds shows growth round over round.<br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/714564dcaaeddfc1458f3be061ee1c51aeaeabe1.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ga2D47egHIife87SZQMWa5ES4xz\" width=\"572\" height=\"163\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"round-matching-results-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-matching-results-6\"></a>Round Matching Results</h2>\n<p>After the round, we evaluated the matching estimates using several different methods: COCM, QF, and Pairwise. We then had a long internal debate about the best way to calculate the results. While most, if not all, other rounds followed Gitcoins‚Äô lead and used COCM, we found it was not a good fit for our community. COCM looks at the interconnection between donors and their donation behavior and rewards projects with diverse donors who contribute to a variety of other projects and penalizes those that have donors who only contributed to one project. COCM produces a fairer outcome in many rounds and helps with sybil defense.</p>\n<p>The issue we found is that the climate round is a closely connected community. Most donors contribute to many projects in the round which we love to see. We are proud of the coordination we see within the community, but the issue we saw was the round results were flattened when using the COCM calculations. The projects that had received the most support and signal from the community would not receive a fair share of the matching pool. In some cases this was 60-70% less than they would receive using the QF calculations.</p>\n<p>If we had moved forward with COCM, we would have disincentivized some of our top grantees who had worked so hard in marketing during the round. Because of this, we decided to use the standard QF calculations.</p>\n<p>The round results can be found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n9N9hKp4S4M3DgSblEOuCAexjwl5xzTkdNq2cHdMJk4/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impact-assessment-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-7\"></a>Impact Assessment</h2>\n<p>In sum, the GG20 CCN Climate Solutions round impacted 129 climate solutions worldwide (see Climate Impact Map) reducing GHGe, building core infrastructure and‚Äîperhaps most importantly‚Äîfacilitating cooperation and coordination to accelerate climate action.

Sharing here in case it is helpful for anyone else and so the Gitcoin community who has helped make Zuzalu possible can be included.</p>\n<p><strong>Process for choosing the manager for Continuous Innovation:</strong><br>\nBasically Janine called me up and asked if I wanted to do it and offered me $35/hr in pay and I tracked my time in ClickUp.</p>\n<p><strong>Process for choosing the manager for the Q1 rounds:</strong><br>\nI think a few people including Vitalik, Janine, Nicole etc. reached out to Chance who managed the round as a volunteer (Huge kudos for that and I wish I was working with him on the upcoming round.)</p>\n<p><strong>Process for choosing the managers/stewards for Q2 rounds</strong> (one event and one tech round):<br>\nSejal posted in the Zuzalu forum that people could self-nominate to be a steward, and voting was held where three stewards would be chosen for each round. Voters could choose their top three choices for each round and whichever 3 at the end who had the most were chosen yesterday. I‚Äôm one of the tech round stewards.<br>\n<strong>I think people should be able to form parties</strong> and have 3 people apply together. The reason is because otherwise individuals might end up being chosen who do not want to work together. (I‚Äôm happy with the people I‚Äôm working with in the tech round luckily but I see how this can go wrong) This should avoid getting locked into a 2-party system if we are using approval voting instead of first pas the post.</p>\n<p><strong>What I did for the first round:</strong><br>\n-Announcements about the round reminding people to apply<br>\n-DMing Zuzaluans with projects we thought should be included<br>\n-Messaging and calling with some applicants who I didn‚Äôt know to see if they were ligit<br>\n-Co-writing video calls during which people wrote up their projects and sharing tips on how to write it or use markdown such as how to include pictures<br>\nAnswering a bunch of community questions, mostly when people were having difficulty donating.</p>\n<p>Then for choosing which projects to accept in the end, there were a couple calls with Marine, Janine, and Nicole where we looked through the applicants, their twitters, websites, if we knew them, and if they matched the criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Donations:</strong><br>\nDuring donations, we received a lot of feedback that adding enough stamps to Gitcoin passport for many people was impossible for achieving a matching score and that the process was excruciating. I am very glad we have other options now.</p>\n<p>For the Q1 rounds, we ended up saying if anyone has a Zupass they would receive full matching, and after some discussion with Umar and others matching funds were disbursed half according to what Zupass holders donated to and half according to what others donated to.</p>\n<p>For these Q2 rounds, I made this <strong>suggestion of adding someone‚Äôs legal name as a proof of personhood</strong> deciding whether to match a donor‚Äôs contributions. That can be obtained with a credit card payment: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/10-000-donated-to-gitcoin-zuzalu-round-with-credit-card-pilot-project-proposal/18827\" class=\"inline-onebox\">$10,000 Donated to Gitcoin Zuzalu Round with Credit Card Pilot Project Proposal</a><br>\nConsidering someone could get matching with on-chain history using model based detection and/or this method, that means they could donate two times total using each method once and get more matching. This would allow a sort of 2x Sybil, but may also encourage more total donations and could allow donations for billions of non-crypto users. With that trade-off in mind, it depends on if the current Zuzalu round stewards decide to also accept this proof of personhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria:</strong><br>\n<strong>For the Continuous Innovation Round</strong> it was super broad basically saying if it supports the Zuzalu mission and values it can qualify (plus looking ligit), it‚Äôs open source, and noting that if you are a Zuzaluan then you are more likely to have the project accepted.<br>\nZuzalu mission (from a workshop I and Rachel and Dimi held during Zuzalu where we broke participants into small groups to answer a form with 10 questions, then a smaller team reviewed those answers and refined it into this) - to foster a global network of communities to advance humanity by creating playgrounds at the intersection of free and open technology, health, science and social innovation<br>\nValues: Authentic Kindness, Mutual Respect, Personal Growth, Freedom</p>\n<p><strong>For the Q1 rounds the criteria was:</strong><br>\n‚ÄúTechnology projects must be fully open-source, relevant to the needs of in-person Zuzalu events, and blockchain components must be maximally compatible with applicable Ethereum ecosystem standards.<br>\nEvents projects must be what is reasonably understood as a ‚ÄúZuzalu event‚Äù: roughly, a long-duration in-person gathering whose goal is to experiment with open frontier digital and social technologies.<br>\nContributions may be retroactive in intent, supporting events that have already happened! So eg. an event that takes place in Q1 is eligible for funding in both Q1 and Q2, just as an event that takes place in Q2 would be.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In the end, the events round was somewhat controversial considering it featured everything from a small retreat of several friends living together to hackerhouses to a single person‚Äôs efforts supporting an event to an entire team with a full on 8 week pop up village with 200 people.</p>\n<p>I am not an events round steward but made this suggestion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is at least 2 weeks in duration</li>\n<li>Has a topic focused on at least one of the original Zuzalu tracks</li>\n<li>Core team includes at least one resident of Zuzalu or participant in ZuConnect</li>\n<li>Includes aspects of co-living</li>\n<li>Includes a co-created schedule</li>\n<li>Includes coworking on meaningful projects</li>\n<li>Between 50-300 residents anticipated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There won‚Äôt be any perfect criteria but since we need to pick something it might be nice to add some minimum numbers for residents and how long it has to be. I figure if it is longer than 2 weeks without any limit for how long it can be maybe that even incentivizes some long-term projects, permanent village projects, etc. (without it just being another grouphouse, hackerhouse, or paid for vacation of friends) Also maybe it‚Äôs worth adding a cap to how many residents it can be (somewhere 150-300.) I think a lot of the magic of the original Zuzalu is that it was close to a Dunbar sized number and I wonder if it would lose that if it got too big</p>\n<p>For tech round I think there has not been much controversy, so perhaps we can stick to similar criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Matches the Zuzalu mission and values</li>\n<li>Open source</li>\n<li>Fits into one of the original Zuzalu topic tracks</li>\n<li>More likely to be chosen if there are Zuzalu or Zuconnect residents as team members</li>\n<li>Blockchain components must be maximally compatible with applicable Ethereum ecosystem standards</li>\n<li>Relevant to the needs of in-person Zuzalu events</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For what a Zuzalu event is, here‚Äôs the best I can think of on that: <a href=\"https://www.noahchonlee.com/post/what-is-a-zuzalu-style-event\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.noahchonlee.com/post/what-is-a-zuzalu-style-event</a></p>\n<p>I am writing this while in Zanzalu in Zanzibar.

Overall, donors generated a <strong>7.4X multiplier</strong> of their donations in matching funds.</p>\n<p>Compared with our last round, the second iteration of OpenCivics Grants was the most successful round we‚Äôve run so far with <strong>40% more donors</strong>, <strong>20% more crowdfunding donations</strong>, and <strong>200% larger matching grants</strong> for the top grantees.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/42161/31\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Click here to view the automatically generated Gitcoin Report Card for the round.</a></p>\n<p><strong>For a detailed data analysis of the grant round results, check out <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Consortium-Grant-Round-02-Analytics-9f206f580d93462d80a55c3132a7c829?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Consortium Grant Round 02 Analytics</a> on our wiki.</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 2.49.58 PM\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888_2_511x499.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 2.49.58 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"2jCKprPC5rBsExEx4I3zcKOHRd6\" width=\"511\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888_2_511x499.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888_2_766x748.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888_2_1022x998.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F0F0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"overall-data-insights-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overall-data-insights-2\"></a>Overall Data Insights</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Significant Matching Contributions</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereal Forest</strong>, <strong>Urb√°nika‚Äôs bus</strong>, and <strong>Metagov</strong> received substantial matching funds. This indicates that these projects were able to leverage their donor base effectively to secure matching contributions. It suggests a high confidence level from matching funders in these projects‚Äô potential impact.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Top Fundraisers</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereal Forest</strong> stands out with the highest total amount received ($14,227.02). This project not only received the most substantial total funds but also had the highest number of donations (165), reflecting both broad and deep support. The high number of donations and matching funds indicates effective fundraising strategies and strong donor engagement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Potential for Increased Engagement</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects like <strong>Mycelial Civic Knowledge Networks</strong> and <strong>Exploring Post-Capitalist Crypto Pathways</strong> have moderate total funds and a relatively high number of donations. These projects could potentially increase their total funds by focusing on increasing the size of individual donations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Low Engagement with High Potential</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>VoiceDeck: A Marketplace for Journalism Impact Certificates</strong> and <strong>Moos: A Berlin hub for reimagining our cities</strong> received substantial total funds but have relatively low ratios of donations to total funds. This suggests that these projects received significant donations from fewer contributors. They may benefit from strategies aimed at broadening their donor base to enhance sustainability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Diverse Fundraising Success</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The diversity in donation patterns and matching fund success across projects indicates varied effectiveness in fundraising strategies. Projects with lower total amounts but high donation counts might explore methods to increase individual donation amounts. Conversely, projects with high total amounts but fewer donations could focus on broadening their engagement strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"round-operator-insights-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-operator-insights-3\"></a>Round Operator Insights</h1>\n<p>Overall, we learned that Quadratic Funding is unpredictable and, even by constraining some variables, the outcomes are very hard to sculpt or shape. We failed in our goal of ensuring each project walked away from the round with at least $3,000 - $5,000 USD, a goal driven by our first hand experience as grantees of extremely low returns of grant funding when compared with the time it takes grantees to promote their grants.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"limiting-grantees-hypothesis-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#limiting-grantees-hypothesis-4\"></a>Limiting Grantees Hypothesis</h2>\n<p>This round, we were experimenting with the hypothesis that reducing the total number of projects while increasing the matching pool would ensure that the minimum grant allocation would be large enough for all projects to create meaningful, documentable impacts created through the grant funding. We calculated the range of matching pool distributions based on our Genesis Round which reflected a 2-3x spread between the smallest matching amount and the largest. To achieve our goal of significant funding for each project, we chose to restrict the total number of projects to 16, a number derived from our analysis of the previous round‚Äôs outcomes and the volume of matching funds available for our second round.</p>\n<p>Our insights from this aspect of the round were twofold. First, the matching distribution for this round was far more extreme than anticipated. The range from the lowest matching amount to the highest amount was closer to 10x, a significant increase from our previous round. In one sense, this is a positive discovery because it shows that the Quadratic Funding mechanism is successfully allocating funds based on the preferences of the collective intelligence of donors. On the other hand, it means that the hypothesis we were testing failed to achieve our desired goals. Rather than seeing this as a failure, we see it as a learning opportunity that reveals the high variability of matching amounts and the impossibility of using the variables that <em>are</em> within our control to influence the outcome, even if our desired influence on the outcome is holistically considered and well intentioned. This feeds into the second insight from this aspect of the round. As round operators, we struggled to limit participation in the round to only 16 projects. There were many deserving projects who submitted applications whom we rejected simply based on the premise that we had an obligation to test our hypothesis that a smaller number of projects would yield significant funding for each project. Filling the final spots in the round was a painful process that required over a week of deliberation, weighing a number of variables like use of funds, project history and track record, and available grant size vs scope of the project.</p>\n<p>Based on the feedback and data generated by this round, we are unlikely to limit the number of projects in future rounds in the same way. This doesn‚Äôt solve the issue of unpredictable results and the potential for grantees to spend 10s or 100s of hours on project promotion only to receive a few hundred or a thousand dollars in matching funds, but it does embrace the philosophy of quadratic funding which places the entire allocation process in the hands of donors. Accepting and acknowledging this as a fundamental limitation and benefit of Quadratic Funding, we will encourage grantees to consider allocating only the number of hours they are willing to lose (without a guarantee of earning the value of that time back in donations) for their grant promotion.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"updates-to-gitcoin-passport-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#updates-to-gitcoin-passport-5\"></a>Updates To Gitcoin Passport</h2>\n<p>For those not familiar, Gitcoin Passport is a sybil resistance mechanism for Quadratic Funding rounds that attempts to ensure donors are unique human individuals and not bots or scammers attempting to rig the system for their benefit. Prior to this round, the Gitcoin Passport was based on Stamps, attestations of identity that included a number of different identity verification mechanisms like Google and GitHub accounts. This round, Gitcoin introduced Cluster Matching, an AI-enabled system that autonomously reviewed the on-chain transaction history of each donor to verify their ‚Äúproof of humanity.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Comparing the Gitcoin Passport Stamp-based matching results with the newly created Cluster Matching-based results, we were pleased to discover that the new Cluster Matching approach generated a more equitable and holistic distribution of funds. We believe this occurred because the Stamps system was an unwieldy user experience that took tremendous time and effort to reach a ‚Äúpassport score‚Äù that made a user eligible for matching funds. Even as web3 experts, it took us extensive time and energy to achieve a passing score and we imagine that the user experience was so challenging for most ordinary donors that they were discouraged from completing their passport or perhaps even donating to projects. Cluster matching reduces friction for donors and empowers non-web3 savvy individuals to make donations that qualify for matching funds.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"arbitrum-x-gitcoin-user-experience-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#arbitrum-x-gitcoin-user-experience-6\"></a>Arbitrum x Gitcoin User Experience</h2>\n<p>This was also our first round using Arbitrum, having run our previous round on a more obscure Layer 2 blockchain, the Public Goods Network. Overall, this was an incredibly positive experience. While the user interface for program managers is almost entirely the same other than a slightly different process for bridging and adding funds to the smart contract, as a donor, the experience of donating across multiple rounds on the same chain was incredibly streamlined and supported the cross-promotion of projects with grants in multiple rounds. Gas fees on Arbitrum are incredibly low which was another massive benefit for our grantees, donors and the round overall.</p>\n<p>With that said, many of our donors still expressed challenges with bridging funds from Ethereum mainnet to a Layer 2 blockchain. We look forward to a future in which the donor experience on Gitcoin can include fiat donations as well as some kind of inter-chain mechanism that makes it irrelevant to the front end donors which chain the rounds themselves choose to operate. These challenges are persistent across the web3 ecosystem and are not unique to Arbitrum or Gitcoin, but we look forward to collaborating with both teams to co-develop the underlying infrastructures that help Quadratic Funding enter the mainstream, a path that serves the entire public goods ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"looking-forward-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#looking-forward-7\"></a>Looking Forward</h1>\n<p>We‚Äôre excited to continue offering Gitcoin Grants rounds as a service to our members. We are well positioned to advocate on behalf of the entire Consortium of civic innovators we serve to raise matching funds and provide the support structures for funding rounds. We are currently exploring a large grant from ThankArb to develop a new funding mechanism for our members that distributes drips of funding to each project on an ongoing basis. This method, Streaming Quadratic Funding, will be developed by a new initiative called <em>Flow State</em> and we‚Äôre excited to collaborate with them to explore adding specific functionality that is custom-made for the OpenCivics Consortium. The platform will offer a token-gated environment where OpenCivics members can use Quadratic Voting to express their preferences on where the continuous drips of grant funding are allocated. This mechanism breaks fund allocation out of the time-locked grant round context into an ongoing stream of funding that supports the sustainability of projects over time.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we forged lasting bonds with the other community grant round operators who all expressed an interest in co-hosting a collaborative round in the future. As ever, Gitcoin is all about relationships and this round deeply strengthened the relationships between community round operators. There seemed to be a universal sentiment that the entire public goods funding space could benefit from a funding round tailored to synergistic collaboration between different impact sectors, working together as ephemeral DAOs to generate outputs based on the unique contributions of multiple projects. We‚Äôre excited to explore this possibility and to work with other community round operators to continue serving our grantees in innovative ways.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>We believe Quadratic Funding for public goods funding allocations is one of the most promising and useful contributions of web3 infrastructure to the social impact space. This round taught us an immense amount about the limitations and benefits of Quadratic Funding related to ways we can improve the donor experience, grantee experience, and overall impact of the grants themselves. We are currently engaging our grantees in a participatory process to identify and report on the milestones they achieve with the funds they‚Äôve received from our Consortium Round 02 which we will share with you here in a few months. Our grantees have already started to identify pathways to synergize their project efforts within the context of emerging collaborative initiatives within the Consortium and we can‚Äôt wait to see what we‚Äôre able to create together.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our donors, grantees, and members for supporting public goods and for funding the critical work of civic innovation.</p>\n<p>In Us We Trust,</p>\n<p>OpenCivics Stewards</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opencivics-consortium-round-02-insights-learnings/18879\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opencivics-consortium-round-02-insights-learnings/18879","pubDate":"Tue, 28 May 2024 21:24:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18879"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opencivics-consortium-round-02-insights-learnings/18879.rss","#text":"OpenCivics Consortium Round 02 Insights & Learnings"}},{"title":"Beyond QF quadratic funding: comments, suggestions, ideas üí°","dc:creator":"mars","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<h1><a name=\"beyond-qf-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#beyond-qf-1\"></a>Beyond QF</h1>\n<p>My personal view, exhibit <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/zero.png?v=12\" title=\":zero:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":zero:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It‚Äôs not the broader Web3 community vote.

We put up a matching pool of 35 ETH for 23 Regenerative Land Projects. This was our first time hosting a Gitcoin round.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Overall, the experience was great. The tools you‚Äôve created are impressive, and I think they are really important and impactful. And they keep getting better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I went through the ‚ÄúRound Managers Training Program‚Äù last year, which helped prepare me for operating the round. The training program was difficult to fully engage with from New Zealand timezones (recordings were crucial), but it successfully got me more confident with the Grants Manager interface. <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=12\" title=\":+1:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":+1:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having a consistent person from the Gitcoin community to communicate with during GG20 was super helpful. At first I was reaching out to different folks for support, but it wasn‚Äôt clear who was best for what, and response times varied. Once I locked in with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mathildadv\">@MathildaDV</a> things became a lot easier. It would be helpful for round operators to have clearer expectations upfront about how to get assistance from Gitcoin along the way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We applied to be a community round, but weren‚Äôt chosen this time. The transparency of the process and thoughtful feedback afterwards was really top-notch. Importantly, it supported us in thinking through how to structure the application and communication process for our own applicants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Over a third of the projects in Ma Earth‚Äôs round were completely new to web3. And given our focus on land projects, many of the donors were new to crypto as well. So we spent a lot of our time and energy around tutorials, tech support, walking people through wallets and bridging, etc. This was very much intentional and anticipated, as we believe/hope these communities will benefit from getting onchain.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I observed during these onboarding processes is simply how difficult the wallet UX still is for most people. Especially anything related to layer 2‚Äôs (some common issues: not understanding bridging to begin with, confusing USDC.e with USDC, struggling to bridge out of Base, and confusing ARB with Arbitrum). These UX challenges seem well recognized in the crypto community, and are mostly outside of Gitcoin‚Äôs control. I‚Äôm optimistic things like smart wallets and fiat payment flows will make things smoother in the future. But clearly, Ethereum is not ready for mainstream adoption with the current wallets and L2 UX.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Another adoption issue is getting organizations (not just individuals) onboarded into exchanges. It seems easier to get individuals signed up on Coinbase and Kraken, but there are more AML/KYC hurdles for organizations, at least outside the US.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We set a $5 minimum for matching threshold, and decided to use the new COCM model as our strategy for sybil resistance. We disabled Passport, out of fear of creating additional hurdles for our non-web3 audience. The $5 minimum skewed our results more than I expected, as we still received a lot of ~$1 donations during the round. Presumably this has become a learned behavior from the Gitcoin donor community who are used to making ‚Äòvonations‚Äô of ~$1. I felt like the COCM model improved results effectively, though it felt a bit black box. Generally speaking, COCM made the outcomes better for our grantees newer to web3, and it appropriately ticked down the matching for a couple outliers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My understanding is that Gitcoin is spinning out Passport and continuing to evolve these sybil-attack systems. Without knowing many details, this does seem like a good move. In the current GG20 incarnation, it almost feels like there are competing goals on Gitcoin around community crowdfunding versus web3 identity/fraud tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We benefitted from the guidance of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/omniharmonic\">@omniharmonic</a> at OpenCivic and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jon-spark-eco\">@jon-spark-eco</a> at Climate Coordination Network. There is value in linking the round operators together, and I‚Äôm grateful for their support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some specific UX suggestions/ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>More prominent indication on checkout if the donor‚Äôs contribution won‚Äôt unlock matching for some reason.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We had set up our round for 30 ETH matching (~100k USD at the time). Then ETH‚Äôs price declined, so we decided to fund the contract with 35 ETH. The Grants Manager interface explicitly said we could add more. What confused/surprised me is that the extra 5 ETH didn‚Äôt filter through to the matching pool, and basically all signs of it ‚Äòdisappeared‚Äô afterwards in the interface. I‚Äôm assuming we‚Äôll be able to reclaim these funds after the waiting period, but would suggest some improved messaging on Grants Manager around this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I understand this was a shared issue, but after the round was over we were stuck for about a week on distributing funds to grantees, as the interface wasn‚Äôt responding. More upfront/broadcast communication on this would‚Äôve helped, as we were in the dark on what the issue was, and wasted cycles and nerves trying to get to the bottom of it. <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/grimacing.png?v=12\" title=\":grimacing:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":grimacing:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Gitcoin interface had some slight inconsistencies between the report card versus the ‚Äúround stats‚Äù versus the CSV exports. The discrepancies were small and not enough to cause problems, but it‚Äôs just generally not a good feeling when numbers don‚Äôt match up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We had non-crypto people helping us field initial applications. It would be great to be able to export these applications from the interface in a cleaner way. As it stands, I could only get the text out in CSV format, so our other panelists weren‚Äôt able to see all the images submitted by the applicants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Probably a big ask, but it would be nice to have more real-time visibility into incoming donations in the Grants Manager interface. In particular, I could imagine donors having the optional ability to include their Twitter handles or email addresses with their contributions, and there being an easier way to give thanks/acknowledgements to donors. I think it‚Äôd increase sharing overall, and importantly, give projects a better opportunity to express their gratitude to those donors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When projects share their Explorer links on Twitter, the current preview is just a generic thumbnail and text. Given there are already logos/banners added to the project profiles, maybe those graphics could be included in the metadata to make the UX on Twitter more appealing and unique. Same for the round pages.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay those are the main points that come to mind, hope they‚Äôre helpful.

In essence, we would test this out with our front-end just being one more way to access Gitcoin projects so Gitcoin doesn‚Äôt need to make any big changes before seeing results. (To create an account, we use Privy which creates a wallet for a user with account abstraction with simply an OTC sent to an email, so web2 people can easily do this.) Then‚Ä¶</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user types in how much they are donating</li>\n<li>They sign permission for us to send that amount of an ERC-20 stablecoin from their wallet</li>\n<li>They are taken to a Stripe credit card checkout page which has that amount they are donating pre-filled so they just click send<br>\n(From the user‚Äôs perspective, they are done.

If I did that math right, then still <strong>2/3 of all attempts to onramp fail</strong> through Onramper which is an aggregator offering many onramps (btw Onramper is hard to work with and we honestly feel kinda scammed into spending money on them. Shoutout to Guardarian/ChangeNow for working well so far)<br>\nAnd that‚Äôs if the user is even willing to sit through the process of doing KYC if this is their first time buying crypto.<p></p>\n<p>Compare that with the proposal to: have users send fiat, then we convert that into crypto for them with a trusted solution that works consistently.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>At Zuzalu last year, I started testing out crowdfunded prizes as a concept with an MVP for viaPrize. (Details here: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-appreciations-thread/18332\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Gitcoin Appreciations Thread</a>)<br>\nSince then, a team of five has come together with 100% of our funding so far coming from Gitcoin donations.</p>\n<p>We made a tiny bit of revenue in January with some paying users, but to be honest have been slowed down since then spending months talking about how to make web3 easier to use. We think we may finally have found a strategy that addresses this (we already built USDC based contracts so it is a familiar currency, gasless transactions, and ability to send funds to usernames instead of public keys, full roadmap here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwtuuvofkaK1c-zHEgaplcOzVgg_TXCiPeLL-Bwg488/edit?usp=sharing\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">viaPrize Development Roadmap - Google Docs</a> )</p>\n<p>It is thanks to Gitcoin that we exist, and we would love to build something that gives back to the community and pioneers a way for many web3 platforms to be easier for web2 users to interact with.</p>\n<p><strong>Pilot Project</strong></p>\n<p>For this system to work immediately, we need a ‚Äúbuffer reserve‚Äù of funds (see ‚Äúdeep dive into issues‚Äù below for an explanation.)</p>\n<p>We are suggesting a pool of $10,000 be available in the upcoming Zuzalu Gitcoin round so that users may be able to donate up to $10,000 total to projects in that round with credit card.</p>\n<p>If this works well, we can expand this to more rounds, and perhaps viaPrize even creates vpfinance - a b2b saas consultancy that works with web3 platforms to make them easier for web2 users to interact with.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Dive into Issues (For Nerds Like Me)</strong></p>\n<p>To send fiat from Stripe to a minting service, a wire transfer will take around 3 business days. We are looking into sending from Stripe to a bank account (which adds a different few days wait unless we pay 1% fee for instant stripe withdrawal) then manually buying crypto in an exchange (there‚Äôs no APIs to automate this) or use CBIT transfers or Hong Kong‚Äôs special real time gross settlement (which would require opening a Hong Kong company.)</p>\n<p>But if those fall through, basically we need to have a ‚Äúbuffer reserve‚Äù so we can immediately send the crypto upon receiving the fiat, and that buffer is replenished once the fiat we received has finished turning into crypto.</p>\n<p>There are many more considerations, some of which we have simplified in this blog post: <a href=\"https://www.noahchonlee.com/post/how-to-bring-credit-card-payments-to-web3-crowdfunding-platforms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.noahchonlee.com/post/how-to-bring-credit-card-payments-to-web3-crowdfunding-platforms</a></p>\n<p>The most important tradeoff is that we COULD use dev-controlled wallets and do everything on behalf of the user at the cost of the user giving up sovereignty of their wallet (this would remove the need for users to click ‚Äúsign‚Äù with a wallet pop up which might confuse people unfamiliar with web3.)<br>\nWe would still keep the option for people to use their own self-sovereign/non-custodial wallet, but if someone just wants things to work easier they could select ‚Äúnormal account‚Äù instead of a ‚Äúweb3 account‚Äù when creating their profile.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding for This Project</strong></p>\n<p>We see 3 ways this could be funded:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A proposal and DAO vote to make a prize for someone to build in credit card payments to donate to Gitcoin campaigns (which we anticipate winning, but at least it‚Äôs an open invitation then and it is a results based reward system, and there‚Äôs another prize on our platform <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=12\" title=\":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">)</li>\n<li>The community appreciates our work and donates more to us during GG rounds (and maybe in the citizens round?)</li>\n<li>We make revenue through a platform fee (we are thinking 5% flat fee, 2.9% of which goes to the credit card fees and potentially 1% goes to Stripe instant payout fee which leaves 2.1%-1.1% for us)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We would prefer all three, and would love feedback from the community on what they think is reasonable.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Gitcoin is making big changes!</p>\n<p>Congrats to the switch to the new cluster based matching and model based detection strategy that removes the need for Gitcoin passport stamps!<br>\nSee <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a> great article on that and cheers to him encouraging me to write this: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Our Sybil Resistance Strategy for GG20</a></p>\n<p>This change combined with credit card payments may make it orders of magnitude easier to donate and receive matching.</p>\n<p>This could be the start of an even brighter era for Gitcoin, QF, and web3 crowdfunding at large.</p>\n<p>What do

To recap it briefly, we would continue to use COCM (Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching) as we had in GG19 and we would additionally introduce passport‚Äôs model-based detection system.</p>\n<p>As explained in the post, and the <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4311507\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">paper</a> which introduced this mechanism to the world, COCM is much less vulnerable to Sybil Attacks than ordinary QF because it reduces the matching of donors who look similar.</p>\n<p>In addition, testing Passport‚Äôs model-based detection system (PMBDS) on GG19 donor data yielded greater sybil resistance than the stamp-based system without any of the user friction. When used together, we believe these two tools produce the most sybil-resistant results we‚Äôve ever had.</p>\n<p>We also continue the precedent we began in GG19 of not doing any black-box squelching of donor accounts. All of the code we used to calculate results is <a href=\"http://github.com/gitcoinco/qf-calculator\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">available on GitHub</a>. Turning off squelching has allowed us to increase transparency of matching result calculations and reduced our time to payouts. In addition, it enabled us to scale the same sybil resistance methods we use to our partners through integrations with Grants Stack.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"recap-of-cocm-connection-oriented-cluster-matchinghttpspapersssrncomsol3paperscfmabstract_id4311507-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#recap-of-cocm-connection-oriented-cluster-matchinghttpspapersssrncomsol3paperscfmabstract_id4311507-7\"></a>Recap of COCM: <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4311507\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching</a></h2>\n<p>Quadratic Funding empowers a decentralized network to prioritize the public goods that need funding most. In doing so, it amplifies the voices of those with less money, ensuring bigger crowds receive more matching funds than larger wallets. However, it can be exploited by sybils or colluding groups who align their funding choices to unfairly influence matching fund distribution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/wtf-is-cluster-matching-qf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">COCM</a> is one of the tools we use to address this issue. It identifies projects with the most diverse bases of support and increases their matching funds. It offers a bridging bonus for projects that find common ground across different groups, rewarding cross-tribal support and broad reach. In this way, COCM values not only the number of voters supporting a project but also the diversity of tribes supporting it.</p>\n<p>Recently, Joel upgraded the mechanism further with a <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/nerd-post-updates-to-cluster-mapping-matching/18705\">Markov chain approach</a>, which assesses the likelihood of a user‚Äôs connection to a project based on intermediate connections. In experiments, this provided more sybil resistance by a large margin.</p>\n<p>As an unintended side effect, COCM also tends to distribute funding away from top projects and toward the long tail.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"passports-model-based-detection-system-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#passports-model-based-detection-system-8\"></a>Passport‚Äôs Model Based Detection System</h2>\n<p>The Gitcoin Passport team has recently introduced a Model-Based Detection System that analyzes the on-chain history of addresses, comparing them to known human and sybil addresses. The model assigns each address a probability of being a genuine human user.</p>\n<p>In GG20, this model detected 42.39% of participating wallets as very likely belonging to sybils, and these wallets were excluded from matching. The unmatched wallets accounted for 22.55% of all crowdfunded dollars.</p>\n<p>While the model isn‚Äôt perfect and sometimes mistakes new users or those with few mainnet transactions for sybils, the team is continuously improving the dataset and expanding the model to L2s. Overall, it effectively reduced the impact of sybil accounts on matching results.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"project-spotlight-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#project-spotlight-9\"></a><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/bulb.png?v=12\" title=\":bulb:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":bulb:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Project Spotlight</h1>\n<p>Here are the top five projects by total matching funding and per voter matching funding for each of our four rounds (gleaned from the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rZ9JPldY1AjzMdGgfqpfRfxlUyQdGLoVAZJ90Eamxq4/edit#gid=1546480797\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">overall matching results</a>).

Notably, both the Business Units and the Ecosystem Collective achieved significant improvements in their financial positions. Operational expenses for the month totaled $743,343, representing a commendable 21.28% reduction from budgeted expenses. This reduction underscores our unwavering commitment to financial prudence.</p>\n<p>As of the end of April 2024, the present value of the DAO treasury stands at $49,251,125. Throughout the month, there were fluctuations in prices, with an average of $1.311785 per unit. This decrease can be attributed primarily to the broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which experienced a decline from a total market cap of $2.7 trillion to $2.4 trillion over the past 30 days. Notably, both BTC and ETH, the two primary assets, saw declines of 8.5% and 9%, respectively. As an alternative coin, GTC token has experienced a decline in price of 35.74% since the last report.</p>\n<p>GTC saw a marginal price increase of 1.20% in the last 7 days. However, it is important to note that it underperformed against the backdrop of the global cryptocurrency market, which rose by 5.60% during the same period. Moreover, when compared to similar Ethereum ecosystem cryptocurrencies, Gitcoin lagged behind, with those cryptocurrencies experiencing a 12.70% increase.</p>\n<p>This report offers a comprehensive overview of our financial performance for April 2024, emphasizing key metrics and budget analysis.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overviewhttpsdunecomumarkhanethgitcoin-treasury-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overviewhttpsdunecomumarkhanethgitcoin-treasury-1\"></a><a href=\"https://dune.com/umarkhaneth/gitcoin-treasury\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Overview</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Last Month‚Äôs Treasury Holdings</strong>: $74,203,656</li>\n<li><strong>Current Month Treasury Holdings</strong>: $49,251,125</li>\n<li><strong>Variance</strong> ($24,952,531 - 33.63%): Primarily driven by the volatile price of the token, which experienced a downturn the past month, coupled with a the impact of our monthly operating expenses across all workstreams, totaling $743,343</li>\n<li><strong>Budget Variance</strong>: 21.28% lower than the budget across all Business Units and the Ecosystem Collective ($944,312).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"runway-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#runway-2\"></a>Runway</h2>\n<p>The decrease in the value of our treasury‚Äôs GTC holdings, primarily influenced by the performance of GTC, has impacted our Runway.

These reserves are managed to ensure stability and profitability.</li>\n<li>Through AutoPGF, the yield from GloDollars within the \"Web3 Public Goods‚Äù is allocated to various charitable causes which are: Gitcoin, Giveth and Protocol Guild. GloDollar holders can influence where this yield is directed via the GloDollar platform, choosing from a range of public goods and charities. Read more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/glodollar/status/1785670745089270259\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>The term ‚Äúdelegate‚Äù is used to describe the process whereby GloDollars are allocated to generate yield that is then directed towards funding public goods. Delegating GloDollars does not involve transferring ownership or voting rights. Instead, it involves directing the financial benefits (yield) generated by these stablecoins to support chosen causes, without the need to donate the tokens themselves. For more detailed insights, you can visit GloDollar‚Äôs recently published page: <a href=\"https://www.glodollar.org/articles/how-were-funding-public-goods\">How We‚Äôre Funding Public Goods</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upon approval, we will proceed to work with GloDollar to manually delegate the amount of GloDollars in the matching pool to fund public goods for a period of 12 months from the funds sitting in the multi-sig. At the end of this 12 month period, as per the initial agreement - we can choose to keep the funds or initiate the swap back for $100K USDC to the Matching Pool after the delegation period.</p>\n<p>We are committed to transparency and will keep the community informed about significant developments regarding our GloDollar activities.

While it didnt work the way we‚Äôd hoped, we learned a lot.  We are proud to be a place where bold new experiments are tried, even at the risk of failure.</li>\n<li>We are actively collaborating with partners to help users retrieve their funds. The PGN team is currently working to ensure that all assets will still be available and claimable post shut down.

I want to address any confusion about our lack of detailed rollout on the Gitcoin Foundation‚Äôs end. As we reflect on the Public Goods Network (PGN) journey, it‚Äôs essential to understand both the successes and challenges we‚Äôve encountered and why we‚Äôre not especially excited to hand over the keys given the community‚Äôs communication and the challenges we encountered. I want to reiterate notes that Kyle, Nicole, and Sophia have surfaced in their posts  <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/announcing-the-spin-down-of-pgn-eol-june-2024/17430\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-network-retrospective-recommendation-discussion/18772\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/pgn-technical-transparency-and-the-path-forward/17304\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The goal of PGN was to create a network dedicated to funding public goods through low transaction fees and innovative mechanisms like Contract Secured Revenue (CSR). Despite incredible community and partner support, we faced significant hurdles. Critical infrastructure was missing at launch, leading to high costs and a subpar user experience. Expensive bridging fees and the absence of essential tools like decentralized exchanges (DEX) made it difficult for users, particularly those with limited resources, to fully engage with the network. Some issues have been fixed, but the overall challenges remain relevant. I‚Äôve talked with partners who have done deep dives into the numbers, mechanisms, and apps to be built on PGN much more intelligently than I have, and ultimately, they also agree that keeping the network alive is not worth it.</p>\n<p>We still plan to shut down the network by June 2024.  In the interim, we are working diligently to ensure a smooth and affordable migration of user assets off the network. This experiment helped us establish meaningful partnerships with organizations like Zora, Base, and OP. It‚Äôs those partnerships now that will be helping us get funds back to the users of the network.</p>\n<p><strong>We encourage all users to bridge their assets off PGN</strong> and will provide detailed instructions and support throughout this process as well as double down on sending out comms.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"reiterating-important-learnings-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#reiterating-important-learnings-2\"></a>Reiterating important learnings</h2>\n<p>Many have taken the time to detail PGN‚Äôs shortcomings and the learnings we took from this experiment, and what would need to be true for it to be successful in the future. I‚Äôve summed up some of these + other takeaways below for transparency and for the benefit of us learning together:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We launched PGN without critical infrastructure, which led to high costs and a poor user experience.</li>\n<li>Expensive bridging fees and the lack of essential tools like decentralized exchanges (DEX) made it tough for users to fully engage with the network.</li>\n<li>We struggled to attract the necessary resources to compete with established networks.</li>\n<li>The costs of running PGN exceeded our initial estimates, and we couldn‚Äôt provide the high-quality, reliable, and affordable platform users deserved.</li>\n<li>Integrating Contract Secured Revenue (CSR) was harder than we thought, and attracting users without a fully functional network was a challenge.</li>\n<li>Missing essential components like improved wallet integration and a functional DEX created significant barriers for our users.</li>\n<li>Even with strong community and partner support, we couldn‚Äôt sustain the network due to these foundational issues.</li>\n<li>Running the experiment at the Foundation level allowed us to iterate quickly but left a bad taste in many mouths due to communication and execution issues.</li>\n<li>We learned that having a dedicated and well-resourced team is crucial to ensure consistent progress and user satisfaction.</li>\n<li>A lack of a detailed and transparent roadmap is essential for communicating shutdown plans led to mis-aligned communication w/ the community.</li>\n<li>This experience underscored the importance of decentralization and involving the community in decision-making processes for future projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite this, we haven‚Äôt seen substantial proposals submitted to our DAO that include a detailed approach to solve the challenges and meet the necessary qualifications. Key criteria include (as noted by Owocki) but aren‚Äôt limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Financial Backing:</strong> Who is going to pay for it?</li>\n<li><strong>Team:</strong> Who will make it successful? What combination of skillsets and time commitment?</li>\n<li><strong>Unique Selling Proposition (USP):</strong> Specifically, why will builders deploy here and why users will bridge?</li>\n<li><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Why will this succeed when the first PGN experiment failed?</li>\n<li><strong>Support from Gitcoin:</strong> What do you need from Gitcoin, and how will this ensure the successful separation from Gitcoin‚Äôs brand?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that the PGN shutdown was announced in January, and it is now May, we believe that we are unlikely to see any legitimate proposals.</p>\n<p>Given these gaps, we will not be planning to pass off any PGN assets in the near future. <strong><em>The future of public goods funding remains central to Gitcoin‚Äôs mission</em></strong>, and we must consider all aspects of the organization and its mission, including the pairing of Gitcoin‚Äôs name with any further work on the PGN network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"a-note-to-our-community-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#a-note-to-our-community-3\"></a>A note to our community</h2>\n<p>We appreciate the enthusiasm of our community and hear your calls to revive PGN. While we don‚Äôt always agree with the approach taken by some community members, we recognize the underlying passion for securing the future and funding of digital public goods.</p>\n<p>We deeply value our community‚Äôs role and acknowledge that our wind-down process, including a detailed roadmap of our plans, wasn‚Äôt thoroughly communicated. Moving forward, we are committed to decentralization and involving the community in more decision-making at the DAO level. We aim to be more transparent and inclusive in our processes, ensuring that the community has a voice in shaping the future of public goods funding.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Again, we are working with our team and partners to ensure everyone can get their funds off the network smoothly</em></strong>. We expect to have some updates in the next day or two regarding the migration process and will keep everyone informed through our official channels.</p>\n<p>While PGN itself is winding down, the vision of sustainable public goods funding continues to guide us. We are committed to supporting public goods through our core initiatives, and <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/capturing-value-like-a-slime-mold/17190\">likely other future experiments</a>. The lessons learned from PGN will inform future projects, ensuring that we build on this experience to create more robust and resilient funding mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Users can sign up to an email list here to stay updated on the latest: <a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1Pyt-MWlERGqdWPQNx_EUtQd0r2h\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Form</a></strong></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/pgn-shutdown-a-recap/18794\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/pgn-shutdown-a-recap/18794","pubDate":"Tue, 14 May 2024 14:34:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18794"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/pgn-shutdown-a-recap/18794.rss","#text":"PGN Shutdown - A Recap"}},{"title":"Public Goods Funding - generic category","dc:creator":"mars","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>A reflection about public goods funding.</p>\n<p>Currently it is separated by categories <em>(climate, tokens, ENS, hackathons, open civics, infra, tooling, apps, ‚Ä¶)</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-about-public-goods-funding-in-general-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-about-public-goods-funding-in-general-1\"></a>What about public goods funding in general?</h3>\n<p>Two use cases that come to mind, something that I‚Äôve experienced personally.</p>\n<p>Helping a homeless person: improves public safety.</p>\n<p>Reporting bugs to BigTech: saves time for billions of people.</p>\n<p>Real life example.

It was an honour to coordinate this undertaking and learn alongside everyone throughout the process.</p>\n<p>As a recap, the new governance process included enabling communities to upload proposals to our forum, and applying for extra matching funds from Gitcoin to run in a Gitcoin Grants round (GG20 was the first iteration). The Community Council then reviewed and voted on the proposals, with the top 5 being selected for matching funds. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with this process, read the following posts for further context: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-eligibility-criteria-community-rounds/17846\">GG20 Eligibility Criteria - Community Rounds</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-rounds-announced/18402\">GG20 Community Rounds Announced</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-council/17749\">GG20 Community Council</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-council-retro-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-council-retro-2\"></a>Community Council retro:</h3>\n<p>This being the first iteration of Gitcoin electing an external GG Community Council, I have been personally very pleased with the results and the council that was elected. The council‚Äôs diversity and experience put us in a strong position to govern GG20.</p>\n<p>A detailed survey was presented to the council gathering feedback on their experience and ways we could improve the process. They had to scale their overall experience from 1-5 (1 being ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and 5 being ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù). The results revealed that the average rating for the council‚Äôs overall experience was approximately 4.71 out of 5. This indicates a highly positive experience among the council members. <em>Each member also roughly spent 10 hours on this initiative, in line with what we set predicted.</em></p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúFor how fast everything moved and the care needed to effectively carry this out with a tight timeline I thought it was done as well as it could have been when you factor in everything. We were able to identify what needed to be changed in the future, without letting that affect our ability to get the current task done on time now. everything was handled in a way that gives me a lot of confidence for the foundation of what we‚Äôre building/Gitcoin is working towards helping create.‚Äù</em> - Lana</p>\n<h3><a name=\"retro-on-the-selection-criteria-learning-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#retro-on-the-selection-criteria-learning-3\"></a>Retro on the selection criteria, learning:</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"using-charmverse-as-a-platform-to-review-vote-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#using-charmverse-as-a-platform-to-review-vote-4\"></a>Using CharmVerse as a platform to review &amp; vote:</h4>\n<p>Other options we explored before selecting CharmVerse: Ranked Voting through Google Sheets, which tested unsuccessful due to the results needing more than 7 voters and reviewers. We also looked at manual reviews, which is labour intensive and not favourable. We wanted a platform where the council could easily review and comment on proposals as well as vote using a rubric, which was why CharmVerse was a great option.</p>\n<p>Within the same survey, the council was asked to rank their experience with the platform chosen on a scale of 1-5 (1 being ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and 5 being ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù). The average rating for using CharmVerse as a platform was 4.14 out of 5. This suggests a generally positive consensus towards continuing to use CharmVerse, with most members indicating satisfaction, though a couple of members saw room for improvement. We have given the CharmVerse team some feedback on how we would like the UI to be improved in the future, but with this outcome in the survey, we will most likely keep CharmVerse as the platform moving forward, making sure that the improvements are implemented by GG21, <em>barring any necessary changes due to adaptations of the rubric and eligibility criteria detailed below.</em></p>\n<h4><a name=\"improvements-to-the-rubric-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#improvements-to-the-rubric-5\"></a>Improvements to the Rubric:</h4>\n<p><em>Here are some suggestions that surfaced in the survey that we would like to implement in the rubric for future rounds. <strong>NOTE:</strong> these are not set in stone right now, as we will circle back with the council on this and ensure the rubrics are created in collaboration with what the council suggests.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include ‚Äòcommunity reach/impact‚Äô and details about community leaders‚Äô public/social impact.</li>\n<li>Introduce a rubric for round deliverables or milestones, possibly weighing the network effects.</li>\n<li>Expand and refine rubric definitions to ensure clarity, such as defining terms like ‚Äòleverage‚Äô more explicitly.\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of mechanics that determine the ratio of matching being received by a Community Round; this could be a subset of the rubric focused on the financial aspects of the application.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Add more measurement criteria tied to application questions for easier referencing.</li>\n<li>Incorporate individual or group sessions with applicants and add a measurement for more diversity of projects to prevent monopoly by well-known names and popular/ same projects getting funding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"changes-to-eligibility-criteria-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#changes-to-eligibility-criteria-6\"></a>Changes to Eligibility Criteria:</h4>\n<p><em>Strong eligibility criteria that are also closely linked to the rubrics used for evaluation can ensure high-quality, values-aligned funding rounds that serve the community well. The council‚Äôs input will set the eligibility criteria for future rounds.</em></p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider restrictions such as disallowing back-to-back funding rounds for previous recipients, with a potential reinstatement after a cycle or annually.</li>\n<li>Require previous recipients to provide impact tracking metrics and improvement plans for subsequent rounds.</li>\n<li>Standardize metrics more comprehensively to enhance comparability across different projects and rounds.</li>\n<li>To share progress, community size, and all other relevant stats</li>\n<li>Address transparency and conflict of interest concerns, such as disclosure of relationships between applicants and round participants.</li>\n<li>Disclose all forms of funding</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"those-not-selected-for-matching-felt-excluded-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#those-not-selected-for-matching-felt-excluded-7\"></a>Those not selected for matching felt ‚Äúexcluded‚Äù:</h4>\n<p>One thing that we picked up is the rounds not selected for matching funds felt excluded and disempowered to still continue and run a round during GG20. This is not something that we intentionally set up and one of the biggest pieces of this process I would like to change. How might we ensure each round that applies feels empowered, but still upholds the resources that Gitcoin can give community rounds during a round?</p>\n<p>For example, when it comes to marketing rounds outside of those selected for matching, there are many factors to consider: resources, vetting of the rounds, intentional coordination, etc. We are actively working on creating a system that is inclusive and impactful for all involved and making sure the process is fair, vetted, and well resourced.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"moving-forward-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#moving-forward-8\"></a>Moving forward:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of making the process more inclusive for all involved, I suggest the following:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The top 5 are still selected for matching through the same review and voting process, but the top [ X ] will be included in our marketing efforts. The exact number of rounds we can support and what this marketing support will look like will be discussed internally and fleshed out in another post leading up to GG21.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will update the rubrics and eligibility criteria with the council, as we would like to give them more autonomy in this regard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An updated Roles &amp; Responsibilities doc will be posted to the forum, outlining the new and updated responsibilities of the council as their roles will evolve moving forward.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>‚ÄúThe comms part by the Gitcoin team was excellent. On the whole, I‚Äôve taken this role pretty seriously and have felt that it was a big responsibility to make sound decisions with intentionality and countering bias that comes with decision making.
