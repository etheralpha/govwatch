We put up a matching pool of 35 ETH for 23 Regenerative Land Projects. This was our first time hosting a Gitcoin round.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Overall, the experience was great. The tools you‚Äôve created are impressive, and I think they are really important and impactful. And they keep getting better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I went through the ‚ÄúRound Managers Training Program‚Äù last year, which helped prepare me for operating the round. The training program was difficult to fully engage with from New Zealand timezones (recordings were crucial), but it successfully got me more confident with the Grants Manager interface. <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=12\" title=\":+1:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":+1:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having a consistent person from the Gitcoin community to communicate with during GG20 was super helpful. At first I was reaching out to different folks for support, but it wasn‚Äôt clear who was best for what, and response times varied. Once I locked in with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mathildadv\">@MathildaDV</a> things became a lot easier. It would be helpful for round operators to have clearer expectations upfront about how to get assistance from Gitcoin along the way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We applied to be a community round, but weren‚Äôt chosen this time. The transparency of the process and thoughtful feedback afterwards was really top-notch. Importantly, it supported us in thinking through how to structure the application and communication process for our own applicants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Over a third of the projects in Ma Earth‚Äôs round were completely new to web3. And given our focus on land projects, many of the donors were new to crypto as well. So we spent a lot of our time and energy around tutorials, tech support, walking people through wallets and bridging, etc. This was very much intentional and anticipated, as we believe/hope these communities will benefit from getting onchain.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I observed during these onboarding processes is simply how difficult the wallet UX still is for most people. Especially anything related to layer 2‚Äôs (some common issues: not understanding bridging to begin with, confusing USDC.e with USDC, struggling to bridge out of Base, and confusing ARB with Arbitrum). These UX challenges seem well recognized in the crypto community, and are mostly outside of Gitcoin‚Äôs control. I‚Äôm optimistic things like smart wallets and fiat payment flows will make things smoother in the future. But clearly, Ethereum is not ready for mainstream adoption with the current wallets and L2 UX.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Another adoption issue is getting organizations (not just individuals) onboarded into exchanges. It seems easier to get individuals signed up on Coinbase and Kraken, but there are more AML/KYC hurdles for organizations, at least outside the US.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We set a $5 minimum for matching threshold, and decided to use the new COCM model as our strategy for sybil resistance. We disabled Passport, out of fear of creating additional hurdles for our non-web3 audience. The $5 minimum skewed our results more than I expected, as we still received a lot of ~$1 donations during the round. Presumably this has become a learned behavior from the Gitcoin donor community who are used to making ‚Äòvonations‚Äô of ~$1. I felt like the COCM model improved results effectively, though it felt a bit black box. Generally speaking, COCM made the outcomes better for our grantees newer to web3, and it appropriately ticked down the matching for a couple outliers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My understanding is that Gitcoin is spinning out Passport and continuing to evolve these sybil-attack systems. Without knowing many details, this does seem like a good move. In the current GG20 incarnation, it almost feels like there are competing goals on Gitcoin around community crowdfunding versus web3 identity/fraud tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We benefitted from the guidance of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/omniharmonic\">@omniharmonic</a> at OpenCivic and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jon-spark-eco\">@jon-spark-eco</a> at Climate Coordination Network. There is value in linking the round operators together, and I‚Äôm grateful for their support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some specific UX suggestions/ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>More prominent indication on checkout if the donor‚Äôs contribution won‚Äôt unlock matching for some reason.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We had set up our round for 30 ETH matching (~100k USD at the time). Then ETH‚Äôs price declined, so we decided to fund the contract with 35 ETH. The Grants Manager interface explicitly said we could add more. What confused/surprised me is that the extra 5 ETH didn‚Äôt filter through to the matching pool, and basically all signs of it ‚Äòdisappeared‚Äô afterwards in the interface. I‚Äôm assuming we‚Äôll be able to reclaim these funds after the waiting period, but would suggest some improved messaging on Grants Manager around this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I understand this was a shared issue, but after the round was over we were stuck for about a week on distributing funds to grantees, as the interface wasn‚Äôt responding. More upfront/broadcast communication on this would‚Äôve helped, as we were in the dark on what the issue was, and wasted cycles and nerves trying to get to the bottom of it. <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/grimacing.png?v=12\" title=\":grimacing:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":grimacing:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Gitcoin interface had some slight inconsistencies between the report card versus the ‚Äúround stats‚Äù versus the CSV exports. The discrepancies were small and not enough to cause problems, but it‚Äôs just generally not a good feeling when numbers don‚Äôt match up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We had non-crypto people helping us field initial applications. It would be great to be able to export these applications from the interface in a cleaner way. As it stands, I could only get the text out in CSV format, so our other panelists weren‚Äôt able to see all the images submitted by the applicants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Probably a big ask, but it would be nice to have more real-time visibility into incoming donations in the Grants Manager interface. In particular, I could imagine donors having the optional ability to include their Twitter handles or email addresses with their contributions, and there being an easier way to give thanks/acknowledgements to donors. I think it‚Äôd increase sharing overall, and importantly, give projects a better opportunity to express their gratitude to those donors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When projects share their Explorer links on Twitter, the current preview is just a generic thumbnail and text. Given there are already logos/banners added to the project profiles, maybe those graphics could be included in the metadata to make the UX on Twitter more appealing and unique. Same for the round pages.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay those are the main points that come to mind, hope they‚Äôre helpful. I‚Äôll do a separate write-up for the Ma Earth community with tips for any other funders who might be considering running a QF round on Gitcoin in the future. I‚Äôll add a link to the comments below when that‚Äôs done.</p>\n<p>Also, we‚Äôd love to hear your feedback, and suggestions for how we build in the future!

If I did that math right, then still <strong>2/3 of all attempts to onramp fail</strong> through Onramper which is an aggregator offering many onramps (btw Onramper is hard to work with and we honestly feel kinda scammed into spending money on them. Shoutout to Guardarian/ChangeNow for working well so far)<br>\nAnd that‚Äôs if the user is even willing to sit through the process of doing KYC if this is their first time buying crypto.<p></p>\n<p>Compare that with the proposal to: have users send fiat, then we convert that into crypto for them with a trusted solution that works consistently.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>At Zuzalu last year, I started testing out crowdfunded prizes as a concept with an MVP for viaPrize. (Details here: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-appreciations-thread/18332\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Gitcoin Appreciations Thread</a>)<br>\nSince then, a team of five has come together with 100% of our funding so far coming from Gitcoin donations.</p>\n<p>We made a tiny bit of revenue in January with some paying users, but to be honest have been slowed down since then spending months talking about how to make web3 easier to use. We think we may finally have found a strategy that addresses this (we already built USDC based contracts so it is a familiar currency, gasless transactions, and ability to send funds to usernames instead of public keys, full roadmap here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwtuuvofkaK1c-zHEgaplcOzVgg_TXCiPeLL-Bwg488/edit?usp=sharing\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">viaPrize Development Roadmap - Google Docs</a> )</p>\n<p>It is thanks to Gitcoin that we exist, and we would love to build something that gives back to the community and pioneers a way for many web3 platforms to be easier for web2 users to interact with.</p>\n<p><strong>Pilot Project</strong></p>\n<p>For this system to work immediately, we need a ‚Äúbuffer reserve‚Äù of funds (see ‚Äúdeep dive into issues‚Äù below for an explanation.)</p>\n<p>We are suggesting a pool of $10,000 be available in the upcoming Zuzalu Gitcoin round so that users may be able to donate up to $10,000 total to projects in that round with credit card.</p>\n<p>If this works well, we can expand this to more rounds, and perhaps viaPrize even creates vpfinance - a b2b saas consultancy that works with web3 platforms to make them easier for web2 users to interact with.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Dive into Issues (For Nerds Like Me)</strong></p>\n<p>To send fiat from Stripe to a minting service, a wire transfer will take around 3 business days. We are looking into sending from Stripe to a bank account (which adds a different few days wait unless we pay 1% fee for instant stripe withdrawal) then manually buying crypto in an exchange (there‚Äôs no APIs to automate this) or use CBIT transfers or Hong Kong‚Äôs special real time gross settlement (which would require opening a Hong Kong company.)</p>\n<p>But if those fall through, basically we need to have a ‚Äúbuffer reserve‚Äù so we can immediately send the crypto upon receiving the fiat, and that buffer is replenished once the fiat we received has finished turning into crypto.</p>\n<p>There are many more considerations, some of which we have simplified in this blog post: <a href=\"https://www.noahchonlee.com/post/how-to-bring-credit-card-payments-to-web3-crowdfunding-platforms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.noahchonlee.com/post/how-to-bring-credit-card-payments-to-web3-crowdfunding-platforms</a></p>\n<p>The most important tradeoff is that we COULD use dev-controlled wallets and do everything on behalf of the user at the cost of the user giving up sovereignty of their wallet (this would remove the need for users to click ‚Äúsign‚Äù with a wallet pop up which might confuse people unfamiliar with web3.)<br>\nWe would still keep the option for people to use their own self-sovereign/non-custodial wallet, but if someone just wants things to work easier they could select ‚Äúnormal account‚Äù instead of a ‚Äúweb3 account‚Äù when creating their profile.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding for This Project</strong></p>\n<p>We see 3 ways this could be funded:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A proposal and DAO vote to make a prize for someone to build in credit card payments to donate to Gitcoin campaigns (which we anticipate winning, but at least it‚Äôs an open invitation then and it is a results based reward system, and there‚Äôs another prize on our platform <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=12\" title=\":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">)</li>\n<li>The community appreciates our work and donates more to us during GG rounds (and maybe in the citizens round?)</li>\n<li>We make revenue through a platform fee (we are thinking 5% flat fee, 2.9% of which goes to the credit card fees and potentially 1% goes to Stripe instant payout fee which leaves 2.1%-1.1% for us)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We would prefer all three, and would love feedback from the community on what they think is reasonable.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Gitcoin is making big changes!</p>\n<p>Congrats to the switch to the new cluster based matching and model based detection strategy that removes the need for Gitcoin passport stamps!<br>\nSee <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a> great article on that and cheers to him encouraging me to write this: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Our Sybil Resistance Strategy for GG20</a></p>\n<p>This change combined with credit card payments may make it orders of magnitude easier to donate and receive matching.</p>\n<p>This could be the start of an even brighter era for Gitcoin, QF, and web3 crowdfunding at large.</p>\n<p>What do

To recap it briefly, we would continue to use COCM (Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching) as we had in GG19 and we would additionally introduce passport‚Äôs model-based detection system.</p>\n<p>As explained in the post, and the <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4311507\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">paper</a> which introduced this mechanism to the world, COCM is much less vulnerable to Sybil Attacks than ordinary QF because it reduces the matching of donors who look similar.</p>\n<p>In addition, testing Passport‚Äôs model-based detection system (PMBDS) on GG19 donor data yielded greater sybil resistance than the stamp-based system without any of the user friction. When used together, we believe these two tools produce the most sybil-resistant results we‚Äôve ever had.</p>\n<p>We also continue the precedent we began in GG19 of not doing any black-box squelching of donor accounts. All of the code we used to calculate results is <a href=\"http://github.com/gitcoinco/qf-calculator\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">available on GitHub</a>. Turning off squelching has allowed us to increase transparency of matching result calculations and reduced our time to payouts. In addition, it enabled us to scale the same sybil resistance methods we use to our partners through integrations with Grants Stack.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"recap-of-cocm-connection-oriented-cluster-matchinghttpspapersssrncomsol3paperscfmabstract_id4311507-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#recap-of-cocm-connection-oriented-cluster-matchinghttpspapersssrncomsol3paperscfmabstract_id4311507-7\"></a>Recap of COCM: <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4311507\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching</a></h2>\n<p>Quadratic Funding empowers a decentralized network to prioritize the public goods that need funding most. In doing so, it amplifies the voices of those with less money, ensuring bigger crowds receive more matching funds than larger wallets. However, it can be exploited by sybils or colluding groups who align their funding choices to unfairly influence matching fund distribution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/wtf-is-cluster-matching-qf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">COCM</a> is one of the tools we use to address this issue. It identifies projects with the most diverse bases of support and increases their matching funds. It offers a bridging bonus for projects that find common ground across different groups, rewarding cross-tribal support and broad reach. In this way, COCM values not only the number of voters supporting a project but also the diversity of tribes supporting it.</p>\n<p>Recently, Joel upgraded the mechanism further with a <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/nerd-post-updates-to-cluster-mapping-matching/18705\">Markov chain approach</a>, which assesses the likelihood of a user‚Äôs connection to a project based on intermediate connections. In experiments, this provided more sybil resistance by a large margin.</p>\n<p>As an unintended side effect, COCM also tends to distribute funding away from top projects and toward the long tail.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"passports-model-based-detection-system-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#passports-model-based-detection-system-8\"></a>Passport‚Äôs Model Based Detection System</h2>\n<p>The Gitcoin Passport team has recently introduced a Model-Based Detection System that analyzes the on-chain history of addresses, comparing them to known human and sybil addresses. The model assigns each address a probability of being a genuine human user.</p>\n<p>In GG20, this model detected 42.39% of participating wallets as very likely belonging to sybils, and these wallets were excluded from matching. The unmatched wallets accounted for 22.55% of all crowdfunded dollars.</p>\n<p>While the model isn‚Äôt perfect and sometimes mistakes new users or those with few mainnet transactions for sybils, the team is continuously improving the dataset and expanding the model to L2s. Overall, it effectively reduced the impact of sybil accounts on matching results.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"project-spotlight-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#project-spotlight-9\"></a><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/bulb.png?v=12\" title=\":bulb:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":bulb:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Project Spotlight</h1>\n<p>Here are the top five projects by total matching funding and per voter matching funding for each of our four rounds (gleaned from the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rZ9JPldY1AjzMdGgfqpfRfxlUyQdGLoVAZJ90Eamxq4/edit#gid=1546480797\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">overall matching results</a>).

Notably, both the Business Units and the Ecosystem Collective achieved significant improvements in their financial positions. Operational expenses for the month totaled $743,343, representing a commendable 21.28% reduction from budgeted expenses. This reduction underscores our unwavering commitment to financial prudence.</p>\n<p>As of the end of April 2024, the present value of the DAO treasury stands at $49,251,125. Throughout the month, there were fluctuations in prices, with an average of $1.311785 per unit. This decrease can be attributed primarily to the broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which experienced a decline from a total market cap of $2.7 trillion to $2.4 trillion over the past 30 days. Notably, both BTC and ETH, the two primary assets, saw declines of 8.5% and 9%, respectively. As an alternative coin, GTC token has experienced a decline in price of 35.74% since the last report.</p>\n<p>GTC saw a marginal price increase of 1.20% in the last 7 days. However, it is important to note that it underperformed against the backdrop of the global cryptocurrency market, which rose by 5.60% during the same period. Moreover, when compared to similar Ethereum ecosystem cryptocurrencies, Gitcoin lagged behind, with those cryptocurrencies experiencing a 12.70% increase.</p>\n<p>This report offers a comprehensive overview of our financial performance for April 2024, emphasizing key metrics and budget analysis.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overviewhttpsdunecomumarkhanethgitcoin-treasury-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overviewhttpsdunecomumarkhanethgitcoin-treasury-1\"></a><a href=\"https://dune.com/umarkhaneth/gitcoin-treasury\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Overview</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Last Month‚Äôs Treasury Holdings</strong>: $74,203,656</li>\n<li><strong>Current Month Treasury Holdings</strong>: $49,251,125</li>\n<li><strong>Variance</strong> ($24,952,531 - 33.63%): Primarily driven by the volatile price of the token, which experienced a downturn the past month, coupled with a the impact of our monthly operating expenses across all workstreams, totaling $743,343</li>\n<li><strong>Budget Variance</strong>: 21.28% lower than the budget across all Business Units and the Ecosystem Collective ($944,312).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"runway-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#runway-2\"></a>Runway</h2>\n<p>The decrease in the value of our treasury‚Äôs GTC holdings, primarily influenced by the performance of GTC, has impacted our Runway.

As we reflect on the Public Goods Network (PGN) journey, it‚Äôs essential to understand both the successes and challenges we‚Äôve encountered and why we‚Äôre not especially excited to hand over the keys given the community‚Äôs communication and the challenges we encountered. I want to reiterate notes that Kyle, Nicole, and Sophia have surfaced in their posts  <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/announcing-the-spin-down-of-pgn-eol-june-2024/17430\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-network-retrospective-recommendation-discussion/18772\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/pgn-technical-transparency-and-the-path-forward/17304\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The goal of PGN was to create a network dedicated to funding public goods through low transaction fees and innovative mechanisms like Contract Secured Revenue (CSR). Despite incredible community and partner support, we faced significant hurdles. Critical infrastructure was missing at launch, leading to high costs and a subpar user experience. Expensive bridging fees and the absence of essential tools like decentralized exchanges (DEX) made it difficult for users, particularly those with limited resources, to fully engage with the network. Some issues have been fixed, but the overall challenges remain relevant. I‚Äôve talked with partners who have done deep dives into the numbers, mechanisms, and apps to be built on PGN much more intelligently than I have, and ultimately, they also agree that keeping the network alive is not worth it.</p>\n<p>We still plan to shut down the network by June 2024.  In the interim, we are working diligently to ensure a smooth and affordable migration of user assets off the network. This experiment helped us establish meaningful partnerships with organizations like Zora, Base, and OP. It‚Äôs those partnerships now that will be helping us get funds back to the users of the network.</p>\n<p><strong>We encourage all users to bridge their assets off PGN</strong> and will provide detailed instructions and support throughout this process as well as double down on sending out comms.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"reiterating-important-learnings-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#reiterating-important-learnings-2\"></a>Reiterating important learnings</h2>\n<p>Many have taken the time to detail PGN‚Äôs shortcomings and the learnings we took from this experiment, and what would need to be true for it to be successful in the future. I‚Äôve summed up some of these + other takeaways below for transparency and for the benefit of us learning together:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We launched PGN without critical infrastructure, which led to high costs and a poor user experience.</li>\n<li>Expensive bridging fees and the lack of essential tools like decentralized exchanges (DEX) made it tough for users to fully engage with the network.</li>\n<li>We struggled to attract the necessary resources to compete with established networks.</li>\n<li>The costs of running PGN exceeded our initial estimates, and we couldn‚Äôt provide the high-quality, reliable, and affordable platform users deserved.</li>\n<li>Integrating Contract Secured Revenue (CSR) was harder than we thought, and attracting users without a fully functional network was a challenge.</li>\n<li>Missing essential components like improved wallet integration and a functional DEX created significant barriers for our users.</li>\n<li>Even with strong community and partner support, we couldn‚Äôt sustain the network due to these foundational issues.</li>\n<li>Running the experiment at the Foundation level allowed us to iterate quickly but left a bad taste in many mouths due to communication and execution issues.</li>\n<li>We learned that having a dedicated and well-resourced team is crucial to ensure consistent progress and user satisfaction.</li>\n<li>A lack of a detailed and transparent roadmap is essential for communicating shutdown plans led to mis-aligned communication w/ the community.</li>\n<li>This experience underscored the importance of decentralization and involving the community in decision-making processes for future projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite this, we haven‚Äôt seen substantial proposals submitted to our DAO that include a detailed approach to solve the challenges and meet the necessary qualifications. Key criteria include (as noted by Owocki) but aren‚Äôt limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Financial Backing:</strong> Who is going to pay for it?</li>\n<li><strong>Team:</strong> Who will make it successful? What combination of skillsets and time commitment?</li>\n<li><strong>Unique Selling Proposition (USP):</strong> Specifically, why will builders deploy here and why users will bridge?</li>\n<li><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Why will this succeed when the first PGN experiment failed?</li>\n<li><strong>Support from Gitcoin:</strong> What do you need from Gitcoin, and how will this ensure the successful separation from Gitcoin‚Äôs brand?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that the PGN shutdown was announced in January, and it is now May, we believe that we are unlikely to see any legitimate proposals.</p>\n<p>Given these gaps, we will not be planning to pass off any PGN assets in the near future. <strong><em>The future of public goods funding remains central to Gitcoin‚Äôs mission</em></strong>, and we must consider all aspects of the organization and its mission, including the pairing of Gitcoin‚Äôs name with any further work on the PGN network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"a-note-to-our-community-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#a-note-to-our-community-3\"></a>A note to our community</h2>\n<p>We appreciate the enthusiasm of our community and hear your calls to revive PGN. While we don‚Äôt always agree with the approach taken by some community members, we recognize the underlying passion for securing the future and funding of digital public goods.</p>\n<p>We deeply value our community‚Äôs role and acknowledge that our wind-down process, including a detailed roadmap of our plans, wasn‚Äôt thoroughly communicated. Moving forward, we are committed to decentralization and involving the community in more decision-making at the DAO level. We aim to be more transparent and inclusive in our processes, ensuring that the community has a voice in shaping the future of public goods funding.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Again, we are working with our team and partners to ensure everyone can get their funds off the network smoothly</em></strong>. We expect to have some updates in the next day or two regarding the migration process and will keep everyone informed through our official channels.</p>\n<p>While PGN itself is winding down, the vision of sustainable public goods funding continues to guide us. We are committed to supporting public goods through our core initiatives, and <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/capturing-value-like-a-slime-mold/17190\">likely other future experiments</a>. The lessons learned from PGN will inform future projects, ensuring that we build on this experience to create more robust and resilient funding mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Users can sign up to an email list here to stay updated on the latest: <a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1Pyt-MWlERGqdWPQNx_EUtQd0r2h\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Form</a></strong></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/pgn-shutdown-a-recap/18794\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/pgn-shutdown-a-recap/18794","pubDate":"Tue, 14 May 2024 14:34:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18794"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/pgn-shutdown-a-recap/18794.rss","#text":"PGN Shutdown - A Recap"}},{"title":"Public Goods Funding - generic category","dc:creator":"mars","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>A reflection about public goods funding.</p>\n<p>Currently it is separated by categories <em>(climate, tokens, ENS, hackathons, open civics, infra, tooling, apps, ‚Ä¶)</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-about-public-goods-funding-in-general-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-about-public-goods-funding-in-general-1\"></a>What about public goods funding in general?</h3>\n<p>Two use cases that come to mind, something that I‚Äôve experienced personally.</p>\n<p>Helping a homeless person: improves public safety.</p>\n<p>Reporting bugs to BigTech: saves time for billions of people.</p>\n<p>Real life example.

I cannot stand behind the current shutdown date in good faith, knowing that ~$1.35 million worth of assets from our community is still stuck on our chain.</p>\n<p>The cost to pay Conduit, our RaaS provider, to extend PGN for another year is ~$70k ($36k for RaaS fees + $30k in DA fees in the bear case that we are not profitable). I‚Äôm amazed by the communities‚Äô abilities to rally together and come up with the funds to maintain the network.

These conversations are <em>still</em> occurring nearly 4 months later. It‚Äôs a waste of our time and energy to beat around the bush and slowly let this bleed. <strong>Let‚Äôs make a decision.</strong></p>\n<p>As it stands right now, there is an interested party with the funds and approval from Conduit to pay for/maintain the network for a guaranteed 12 months.

With GG20 wrapping up this week, I wanted to bring some learnings from this process to light. This post will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retro on Community Council and their experience</li>\n<li>Retro on the selection criteria, additional learnings and how we might move forward differently.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov\">@Sov</a> for spearheading the initial idea of the evolution of Community Rounds, and to the 7 members of the council, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mashal\">@mashal</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/thedevanshmehta\">@thedevanshmehta</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/azeem\">@azeem</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/zer8\">@ZER8</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lanzdingz\">@lanzdingz</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wasabi\">@wasabi</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/feems\">@feems</a>, who embarked on this experiment with us! It was an honour to coordinate this undertaking and learn alongside everyone throughout the process.</p>\n<p>As a recap, the new governance process included enabling communities to upload proposals to our forum, and applying for extra matching funds from Gitcoin to run in a Gitcoin Grants round (GG20 was the first iteration). The Community Council then reviewed and voted on the proposals, with the top 5 being selected for matching funds. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with this process, read the following posts for further context: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-eligibility-criteria-community-rounds/17846\">GG20 Eligibility Criteria - Community Rounds</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-rounds-announced/18402\">GG20 Community Rounds Announced</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-council/17749\">GG20 Community Council</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-council-retro-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-council-retro-2\"></a>Community Council retro:</h3>\n<p>This being the first iteration of Gitcoin electing an external GG Community Council, I have been personally very pleased with the results and the council that was elected. The council‚Äôs diversity and experience put us in a strong position to govern GG20.</p>\n<p>A detailed survey was presented to the council gathering feedback on their experience and ways we could improve the process. They had to scale their overall experience from 1-5 (1 being ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and 5 being ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù). The results revealed that the average rating for the council‚Äôs overall experience was approximately 4.71 out of 5. This indicates a highly positive experience among the council members. <em>Each member also roughly spent 10 hours on this initiative, in line with what we set predicted.</em></p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúFor how fast everything moved and the care needed to effectively carry this out with a tight timeline I thought it was done as well as it could have been when you factor in everything. We were able to identify what needed to be changed in the future, without letting that affect our ability to get the current task done on time now. everything was handled in a way that gives me a lot of confidence for the foundation of what we‚Äôre building/Gitcoin is working towards helping create.‚Äù</em> - Lana</p>\n<h3><a name=\"retro-on-the-selection-criteria-learning-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#retro-on-the-selection-criteria-learning-3\"></a>Retro on the selection criteria, learning:</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"using-charmverse-as-a-platform-to-review-vote-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#using-charmverse-as-a-platform-to-review-vote-4\"></a>Using CharmVerse as a platform to review &amp; vote:</h4>\n<p>Other options we explored before selecting CharmVerse: Ranked Voting through Google Sheets, which tested unsuccessful due to the results needing more than 7 voters and reviewers. We also looked at manual reviews, which is labour intensive and not favourable. We wanted a platform where the council could easily review and comment on proposals as well as vote using a rubric, which was why CharmVerse was a great option.</p>\n<p>Within the same survey, the council was asked to rank their experience with the platform chosen on a scale of 1-5 (1 being ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and 5 being ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù). The average rating for using CharmVerse as a platform was 4.14 out of 5. This suggests a generally positive consensus towards continuing to use CharmVerse, with most members indicating satisfaction, though a couple of members saw room for improvement. We have given the CharmVerse team some feedback on how we would like the UI to be improved in the future, but with this outcome in the survey, we will most likely keep CharmVerse as the platform moving forward, making sure that the improvements are implemented by GG21, <em>barring any necessary changes due to adaptations of the rubric and eligibility criteria detailed below.</em></p>\n<h4><a name=\"improvements-to-the-rubric-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#improvements-to-the-rubric-5\"></a>Improvements to the Rubric:</h4>\n<p><em>Here are some suggestions that surfaced in the survey that we would like to implement in the rubric for future rounds. <strong>NOTE:</strong> these are not set in stone right now, as we will circle back with the council on this and ensure the rubrics are created in collaboration with what the council suggests.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include ‚Äòcommunity reach/impact‚Äô and details about community leaders‚Äô public/social impact.</li>\n<li>Introduce a rubric for round deliverables or milestones, possibly weighing the network effects.</li>\n<li>Expand and refine rubric definitions to ensure clarity, such as defining terms like ‚Äòleverage‚Äô more explicitly.\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of mechanics that determine the ratio of matching being received by a Community Round; this could be a subset of the rubric focused on the financial aspects of the application.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Add more measurement criteria tied to application questions for easier referencing.</li>\n<li>Incorporate individual or group sessions with applicants and add a measurement for more diversity of projects to prevent monopoly by well-known names and popular/ same projects getting funding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"changes-to-eligibility-criteria-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#changes-to-eligibility-criteria-6\"></a>Changes to Eligibility Criteria:</h4>\n<p><em>Strong eligibility criteria that are also closely linked to the rubrics used for evaluation can ensure high-quality, values-aligned funding rounds that serve the community well. The council‚Äôs input will set the eligibility criteria for future rounds.</em></p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider restrictions such as disallowing back-to-back funding rounds for previous recipients, with a potential reinstatement after a cycle or annually.</li>\n<li>Require previous recipients to provide impact tracking metrics and improvement plans for subsequent rounds.</li>\n<li>Standardize metrics more comprehensively to enhance comparability across different projects and rounds.</li>\n<li>To share progress, community size, and all other relevant stats</li>\n<li>Address transparency and conflict of interest concerns, such as disclosure of relationships between applicants and round participants.</li>\n<li>Disclose all forms of funding</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"those-not-selected-for-matching-felt-excluded-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#those-not-selected-for-matching-felt-excluded-7\"></a>Those not selected for matching felt ‚Äúexcluded‚Äù:</h4>\n<p>One thing that we picked up is the rounds not selected for matching funds felt excluded and disempowered to still continue and run a round during GG20. This is not something that we intentionally set up and one of the biggest pieces of this process I would like to change. How might we ensure each round that applies feels empowered, but still upholds the resources that Gitcoin can give community rounds during a round?</p>\n<p>For example, when it comes to marketing rounds outside of those selected for matching, there are many factors to consider: resources, vetting of the rounds, intentional coordination, etc. We are actively working on creating a system that is inclusive and impactful for all involved and making sure the process is fair, vetted, and well resourced.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"moving-forward-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#moving-forward-8\"></a>Moving forward:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of making the process more inclusive for all involved, I suggest the following:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The top 5 are still selected for matching through the same review and voting process, but the top [ X ] will be included in our marketing efforts. The exact number of rounds we can support and what this marketing support will look like will be discussed internally and fleshed out in another post leading up to GG21.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will update the rubrics and eligibility criteria with the council, as we would like to give them more autonomy in this regard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An updated Roles &amp; Responsibilities doc will be posted to the forum, outlining the new and updated responsibilities of the council as their roles will evolve moving forward.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>‚ÄúThe comms part by the Gitcoin team was excellent. On the whole, I‚Äôve taken this role pretty seriously and have felt that it was a big responsibility to make sound decisions with intentionality and countering bias that comes with decision making. I‚Äôd love to stay updated re the results of each round, and to understand how they were run ++ learnings et al from them (would esp like to understand challenges and what went well + didn‚Äôt from each). This will help in improving decision making for the next one.‚Äù</em> - Mashal</p>\n<p>The goal of Community Rounds is for Gitcoin to continue empowering those within the ecosystem to fund what matters to them most, creating an inclusive and collaborative environment during GG, and further decentralizing our grants program.</p>\n<p>We have taken a great first step, and through these iterations and learnings, we can continue to improve over time.</p>\n            <p><small>13 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-round-governance-a-retrospective/18766\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-round-governance-a-retrospective/18766","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 22:22:11 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18766"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-round-governance-a-retrospective/18766.rss","#text":"GG20 Community Round Governance: A Retrospective"}},{"title":"Gitcoin's Continued Path to Decentralized - Executive Director Elections","dc:creator":"CoachJonathan","category":"ü§ñ DAO Governance and Vision","description":"<h3><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1\"></a>TLDR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gitcoin‚Äôs structure is about reinforcing the legitimacy of its governance through the GTC token</li>\n<li>Gitcoin‚Äôs structure has changed a bit since the launch of the DAO in 2021, but not by much (diagram of the current structure below)</li>\n<li>Starting in Jan 2025, Gitcoin will begin electing its Executive Director on its path to decentralization</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h3>\n<p>With the recent announcement of a<a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/another-passing-of-the-torch/18704/9\"> passing of the torch</a> for the Executive Director role at the Gitcoin Foundation, I wanted to take a moment to create some clarity on what I‚Äôm seeing as an emerging structure at the DAO.</p>\n<p>This post is intended to be a follow up to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a>‚Äôs <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778\"> Consent of the Governed post</a> that was released soon after the formation of the DAO.

In order to create the DAO, Gitcoin had to appoint an Executive Director for the Gitcoin Foundation. At that time, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle\">@kyle</a> was given that role and has owned that responsibility until recently.</p>\n<p>Soon after the launch of the DAO, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> created the aforementioned post that starts by defining the idea of the Consent of the Governed:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"owocki\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"9778\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/user_avatar/gov.gitcoin.co/owocki/48/12006_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778/1\">Consent of the Governed (and Legitimacy by Process) in GitcoinDAO</a></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p> the phrase consent of the governed refers to the idea that a government‚Äôs legitimacy and moral right to use state power is justified and lawful only when consented to by the people or society over which that political power is exercised. </p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>It then goes on to list differences between how an organization like Meta structures itself vs. how a DAO like Gitcoin structures itself to create legitimacy by empowering users and contributors to create bottoms-up buy-in.</p>\n<p>At the core of the post is a principle that still stands true at Gitcoin:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"owocki\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"9778\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/user_avatar/gov.gitcoin.co/owocki/48/12006_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778/1\">Consent of the Governed (and Legitimacy by Process) in GitcoinDAO</a></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p> Legitimacy should flow in circles, not just one way </p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>In order to minimize confusion, I will not repost any diagrams from the initial post‚Äîreaders can take a look at themselves to get a sense of what the initial vision for governing the DAO was at inception.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"shifting-structure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#shifting-structure-4\"></a>Shifting Structure</h3>\n<p>Though initial vision might have been a <em>bit</em> ambitious, the structure we‚Äôve landed on is not too far off from the ideal set in Jan 2022.</p>\n<p>Here is a shot at visualizing how (I am seeing) legitimacy currently flowing at Gitcoin:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45\" title=\"ConsentoftheGoverned\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45_2_324x500.jpeg\" alt=\"ConsentoftheGoverned\" data-base62-sha1=\"gS6KyFKY4145J8lWbfdVcmQQfDT\" width=\"324\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45_2_324x500.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45_2_486x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/76409a25b9e2c6c98567fec0e301ee1df34bcf45_2_648x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Users are airdropped tokens.

Passing/rejecting of token requests through a Token proposal</strong></p>\n<p>Stewards have the power to approve and withhold on DAO spending. This is one of the highest leverage points where Stewards have a say on how the DAO is operating and spending.</p>\n<p>Should Stewards be dissatisfied with the performance of a unit, they can vote against a budget proposal either until the proposal is amended to their satisfaction <em>or</em> until the unit winds down from a lack of funding.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Election/removal of the Executive Director through a Legal Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>Stewards also have the power to elect and remove the Executive Director of the Gitcoin Foundation. The intention of this mechanism is to create accountability for the Executive Director to properly guide the organization and ensure that all the right people are in the right seats.</p>\n<p>This is essentially a hierarchical structure with the ED at the top and all DAO contributors arranged below. This is a common structure in coops and is a structure (at this point in time) being used at Gitcoin to ensure that goals are being hit and that the DAO is successfully pursuing its mission while achieving financial sustainability.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"whats-next-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#whats-next-6\"></a>What‚Äôs Next</h3>\n<p>In the past, Executive Directors have been appointed but have not been elected. This has essentially taken away one of the Stewards‚Äô levers for affecting change at the DAO.</p>\n<p>With the most recent passing of the torch, Gitcoin is taking a large step on its path to decentralization.</p>\n<p>Stewards can expect that starting in January 2025, the Gitcoin Governance Team will kick off an election process and officially begin giving power to the Stewards to decide on who will lead the Gitcoin Foundation, creating more accountability, legitimacy in governance and, ultimately, a more sustainable Gitcoin in the long-term.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoins-continued-path-to-decentralized-executive-director-elections/18759\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoins-continued-path-to-decentralized-executive-director-elections/18759","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 07:27:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18759"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoins-continued-path-to-decentralized-executive-director-elections/18759.rss","#text":"Gitcoin's Continued Path to Decentralized - Executive Director Elections"}},{"title":"Greenpill Podcast Guest Seasons - Call for Proposals!","dc:creator":"owocki","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p><em>TLDR - I am going to step away from the Greenpill Podcast in Q3/Q4 2024 + am looking for ppl to guest cohost during that time.</em></p>\n<p>Hi all,</p>\n<p>For those of you who are unaware, I have been hosting the <a href=\"https://greenpill.network/\">Greenpill Podcast</a> for the last 2 years.

It allows for decentralized decision-making and management of resources.</p>\n<p>An alternative definition of DAOs: DAOs are how groups of humans coordinate around a shared objective.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of the 2nd definition, it is okay to treat the literal definition of DAOs as more of a spectrum. Some projects will be 100% decentralized, 100% autonomous, + an organization, some will only be partially so. Projects that are not 100% pure, I call ‚ÄúDAO-ey‚Äù - as in, they have some attributes of DAOs but not all.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-are-ephemeral-daos-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-are-ephemeral-daos-4\"></a>What are Ephemeral DAOs?</h1>\n<p>Ephemeral DAOs exist for a finite period of time to achieve specific goals or objectives.

Which enables more experimentation.</li>\n<li>without the burden of having to last forever, we can make more pragmatic decisions about what to do over a short period of time without worrying about entrenching power.</li>\n<li>without the burden of having to last forever, we can test/iterate with bold bets in the short term.</li>\n<li>we can learn from decentralized movements of the past, many of which ebbed and flowed, (Occupy Wall St or the Civil Rights movement are two examples) + transcribe their lessons into our ephemeral DAO experiments‚Ä¶</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"ephemeral-dao-design-space-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#ephemeral-dao-design-space-6\"></a>Ephemeral DAO Design Space</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"examples-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#examples-7\"></a>Examples</h2>\n<p>Examples of Ephemeral DAOs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pop up villages like Edge City or Zuzalu or Metacamp. <em>(weeks long)</em></li>\n<li><span class=\"mention\">@_SEAL_Org</span> or other ‚ÄúWhitehat group‚Äù style fund rescue operations <em>(several hours - several weeks long)</em></li>\n<li>Gitcoin style QF rounds.  <em>(weeks long)</em></li>\n<li>Optimism style Retro Funding Rounds <em>(weeks long)</em></li>\n<li>Accelerator cohorts go through an educational cohort together over an 8 week program (months long)</li>\n<li>Point in time fundraisers like ConstitutionDAO or <a href=\"https://juicebox.money/@free-pertsev-and-storm\">The Free Alexey &amp; Roman Legal Defense Fundraise</a> <em>(weeks long)</em></li>\n<li>Protocol Guild‚Äôs first cohort <em>(1 year long)</em></li>\n<li>Projects like Meta Cartel, which dissolved itself after transferring all their remaining assets to the lawyers of tornado cash devs. <em>(years long)</em></li>\n<li>Investment DAOs like those created by <a href=\"https://www.hydraventures.xyz/\">Hydra Ventures</a> last only as long as they have capital to deploy <em>(years long)</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"dao-purity-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#dao-purity-8\"></a>DAO-purity</h2>\n<p>Some definitions of DAOs out there have rigid adherence to the properties of autonomousness (emphasis on computer code doing most of the work), achieving very high levels of decentralization (e.g. no member can have more power than another) and being an organization (as opposed to a network).</p>\n<p>I find myself gravitating towards a more simple &amp; broad definition: DAOs are how groups of humans coordinate around a shared objective.</p>\n<p>Projects that are in between the more rigid definition of DAOs and the more simple/broad one can be said to be DAO-ey.</p>\n<p>I can hear the naysayers say to me ‚ÄúKevin those don‚Äôt count as DAOs. We shouldn‚Äôt be flexible in our interpretation of our design space and should be dogmatic about 100% decentralization + autonomy‚Äù. Well, I‚Äôm sorry I failed your purity test. But I disagree. We should choose the right amount of autonomy + decentralization for the job. For decentralized money (BTC, ETC), we need 100% purity.

Starting July 1st we‚Äôll move from the Seasons concept (made to align previously with Gitcoin Grants rounds) to traditional quarters (Q3 &amp; Q4) and request a budget for the 2nd half of the year, as needed, depending on the spinout. We want and encourage broader DAO feedback and find it crucial to optimize our roadmap.</p>\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity and reputation management. In the next partial season we‚Äôll concentrate on five key pillars:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ease:</strong> Improve ease of use for both end users and partners</li>\n<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Improve identity scoring models</li>\n<li><strong>Adoption:</strong> Grow to 1.5M passports</li>\n<li><strong>GTC Utility</strong>: Strengthen GTC-based identity and community ties</li>\n<li><strong>Partnerships:</strong> Increase both API and onchain partnerships</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Outline</h2>\n<p>Passport is the premier web3 native offering that enables ecosystems to protect, understand and organically grow what matters most ‚Äì their communities.

We continued to underperform against aggressive targets, but excited to see the growth as the markets are becoming more bullish. We have a total of 1.1M unique all time passports. We also continued to drive strongly against our targets in GTC staking, hitting over 1.5M GTC staked.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôve continued to expand our potential service offerings beyond the standard Passport &amp; onchain Passports to include our new Model Based Detection (MBD) system that is now in beta with the Eth activity model. This is proving to be highly effective at classifying Sybils (94% accurate) and enables scoring of addresses without requiring any user interaction. The Ethereum Activity model is the first model with additional models to be added to the MBD endpoint soon. Additions will include: NFT (Eth L1), zkSync (L2), OP (L2) and Polygon (L2) with more in the pipeline.</p>\n<h3>Milestone Report for Past Season</h3>\n<p><strong>Legend:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/green_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":green_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":green_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Success/Completed/Shipped<br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Incomplete, but partial success<br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":red_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":red_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Incomplete, Will Not Hit Goal<br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/black_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":black_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":black_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Canceled</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n   <td><strong>Initiative/Project</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Key Results</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Value Delivered</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Improve Effectiveness</strong> \n   </td>\n   <td>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/green_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":green_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":green_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> 95% accuracy with Eth Stamp</p>\n   </td>\n   <td>Launched new zkSync Activity stamp, NFT stamp, and revamped all credential weights to dramatically improve classification and reduce Sybils able to get a passing score of 20.\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Grow Adoption &amp; Usage</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> 1.15M Passports</p>\n   </td>\n   <td>Continued to drive top line growth of unique Passports by adding 279k brand new Passports, but were still short of our target of 1.5M\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>GTC Utility</strong> \n   </td>\n   <td>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> 1.65M GTC Staked</p>\n<p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> 22,100 Community staking addresses</p>\n   </td>\n   <td>Staking remains strong, having increased another 350k GTC staked, but unable to hit the 2M GTC target.

The reasoning behind this law involves several key ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Distortion of Incentives</strong>: When a particular metric is chosen as the target for policy or performance evaluation, it often leads to a change in behavior to optimize specifically for that metric. This change in behavior can lead to unintended consequences that distort the original purpose of the measure.</li>\n<li><strong>Overemphasis on Measurable Outcomes</strong>: People tend to focus on what can be easily measured and quantified. When a measure becomes a target, there is a risk that other important but less quantifiable aspects are neglected, leading to a narrower and potentially misleading evaluation of success or progress.</li>\n<li><strong>Manipulation and Gaming:</strong> There is a tendency for individuals or organizations to manipulate or game the system to achieve better scores on targeted metrics, regardless of whether this results in genuine improvements in the underlying objectives. For instance, schools might focus on teaching to the test rather than improving overall educational quality if test scores become the primary measure of educational success.</li>\n<li><strong>Reductionism</strong>: Goodhart‚Äôs Law highlights the dangers of reductionism in policy-making and management, where complex systems are reduced to simplistic numbers or targets. This reductionism can oversimplify reality and lead to decisions that might work well for the metric but poorly for the system as a whole.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The law serves as a caution against over-relying on any single measure or metric for decision-making, especially in complex systems where multiple factors should be considered. It underscores the importance of using a balanced set of measures and remaining vigilant about the ways that incentives can influence behavior.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"goodharts-law-public-goods-funding-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#goodharts-law-public-goods-funding-4\"></a>Goodhart‚Äôs Law <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/handshake.png?v=12\" title=\":handshake:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":handshake:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Public Goods Funding</h1>\n<p>In this post, I will argue that this has massive implications for how we fund public goods in the future.</p>\n<p>Why?

We have an evolutionary pressure insofar as the best ecosystems will be continuously evolving their measures forward, but in what ways can we do it?</p>\n<p>This is the frontier, and so unless you‚Äôve run dozens of PGF rounds, you probably don‚Äôt know the answer (yet). But we can reason about this. I think there are a couple ways we can think about it though.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>OODA Loop -</strong> Each PGF round is an OODA (Observe Orient Decide Act) loop by the mechanism designers. After each PGF round, mechanism designers will have to learn from that round, and figure out how the measure fared, and evolve it forward based on those learnings.</li>\n<li><strong>Algorithmic Randomness:</strong> Introduce elements of randomness in the reward or evaluation processes to reduce predictability and the effectiveness of gaming strategies. For example, random spot checks or audits can be used to ensure compliance without the system being entirely predictable.\n<ol>\n<li>In RetroPGF, the voting on metrics element of Round 4 design has a good amount of randomness built into it, as well as hard to predict game mechanisms like quorum rules and scoring formulas</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Community Feedback Mechanisms</strong>: Implement robust feedback systems that allow participants to report and address concerns about the integrity of the metrics or behaviors in the community. This feedback can be used to refine and improve the system continuously.</li>\n<li><strong>Hard to game metrics</strong> - metrics that are hard, or expensive, to game, will be resistant (but not immune) to goodharts law.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversified Metrics</strong>: Rather than relying on a single metric or indicator, use a diverse set of metrics to assess performance or impact. This helps ensure that different aspects of the desired outcomes are being captured and reduces the risk of any one metric becoming overly dominant.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic and Adaptive Metrics</strong>: Implement mechanisms that allow for metrics to be adjusted or replaced as the system evolves. This adaptability can help prevent the gaming of static metrics and ensure that measures continue to align with the underlying goals of the DAO. Metrics should also have counterbalancing forces, eg, new users vs retained users. It‚Äôs very hard to do both</li>\n<li><strong>Cap and Rotate Mechanisms</strong>: For critical metrics or roles within the system, consider using caps (limits on the maximum score or benefit) and rotating the focus among various metrics or areas. This can prevent over-optimization for any single metric and encourage broader contributions across different areas. An example of this policy in practice: one metric can never be more than 20% of the allocation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A feature in my view ‚Äî is that this is a competitive landscape. If lots of actors start trying to game a metric, then it‚Äôs value collapses. There will always be alpha in looking for areas where you have outsize impact in hard areas.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"immutable-evolutionary-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#immutable-evolutionary-7\"></a>Immutable =&gt; Evolutionary</h2>\n<p>In much of the history of the crypto ecosystem, we have placed a value on complete immutability of our protocols.</p>\n<p>Often, this is for good reason. Immutable protocols are incorruptible. We need this in our protocols for money - which according to crypto lore, should not be subject to the whims of any party. Because of this, we have uncensorable money, unprintable money, in BTC + ETH.</p>\n<p>But do we need immutability in every protocol for everything?</p>\n<p>Crypto-era Public Goods Funding has been born from this era of immutability, but it must also transcend it in order to be successful.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We can gain the benefits of immutability in some places (eg intra-round, we should depend on credibly neutral protocols where anyone can verify the vote count), while we partially deviate from it in between rounds (for good reasons, outlined above).</li>\n<li>We must recognize that our emphasis on immutability has often made us aim for the perfect solution and think less iteratively. Public Goods Funding experiments could and should take the opposite approach - iterate towards a local maxima over time. Have a bias towards action + have the courage to ship something imperfect soon over never shipping the (theoretically) perfect thing.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Goodhart‚Äôs Law, introduced by British economist Charles Goodhart in 1975, articulates that ‚ÄúWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.‚Äù This principle highlights how using a specific metric as a target for policy or performance can lead to behaviors aimed at optimizing that metric, often at the expense of the intended goal. This manipulation and overemphasis on measurable outcomes can distort the original purpose of the measure, reduce the complexity of systems to simplistic numbers, and potentially lead to misleading evaluations.</p>\n<p>We think this has massive implications on the funding of public goods in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), particularly through mechanisms like quadratic funding and badgeholder review.</p>\n<p>We suggest that the best public goods funding (PGF) systems would benefit from being evolutionary and adaptable, incorporating strategies such as diversified metrics, dynamic adjustments, and robust community feedback to stay effective and resistant to gaming.</p>\n<p>We advocate for a balance between immutable protocols and adaptable strategies to ensure long-term success in funding public goods.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-must-be-evolutionary/18728\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-must-be-evolutionary/18728","pubDate":"Fri, 03 May 2024 16:20:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18728"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-must-be-evolutionary/18728.rss","#text":"Public Goods Funding MUST be Evolutionary!"}},{"title":"Gitcoin Citizens Rounds - Value Generation Opportunities","dc:creator":"owocki","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>(Thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya\">@Viriya</a> for helping me review, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/krrisis\">@krrisis</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a> for their role in  pushing Citizens rounds forward.

This is a minor tweak, but I like sharing this type of thing with the community because transparency/ community consent for the algorithms we run is is good. I also always love feedback, positive or negative.</p>\n<p>Before I go further, <a href=\"https://github.com/Jmiller4/qf-variants\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">you can find the code here.</a> The function COCM (with the default inputs) is what I‚Äôll be explaining in this post.</p>\n<p>COCM (Connection Oriented Cluster Match) works in three steps.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, it takes in data about ‚Äúclusters‚Äù, which are just different (possibly overlapping) groups of users. You could generate cluster data from POAPs, twitter follower lists, or even the donation records (where if someone donates to project X, they‚Äôre put in project X‚Äôs cluster). Users can also have ‚Äúweights‚Äù in a cluster, denoting how strongly they belong to it. For example, you could use github repositories as clusters, where if I make <em>n</em> pull requests to that repository, I have a weight of <em>n</em> in that repository‚Äôs cluster. In general, round operators can choose what cluster data to use (or they can not use COCM at all, of course).</li>\n<li>COCM calculates ‚Äúsimilarity scores‚Äù between each user and each cluster.</li>\n<li>Finally, COCM runs QF, but then attenuates each project‚Äôs funding if many of its donors are similar according to the scores calculated in step 2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 2 is what we‚Äôll focus on here. First, here‚Äôs how we used to calculate similarity scores. Lets call the user U and call the cluster X. If a U is in X, their similarity score to X is 1. Otherwise, we look at all the other clusters that U is in, and look at all the people in all of those clusters. Then we ask, how many of <em>those</em> people are in X? We use that fraction as the similarity score.</p>\n<p>The issue with this method is that we don‚Äôt use any of that juicy weight information I mentioned above. Let‚Äôs say user U is in cluster Y, and everybody else in Y is also in X, with a really high weight. If we gave all those people a really low weight instead, it wouldn‚Äôt change the similarity score between U and X. But shouldn‚Äôt it?</p>\n<p>So our new way of calculating similarity scores essentially does exactly that. You can think of it as an adaptation of the old method but with a weighted average, instead of an unweighted average.</p>\n<p>You can also think of the new method as an analysis of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Markov process</a>, like what Google uses in their PageRank algorithm. We can think of a graph of all users and all clusters, where directed edges from users to clusters (and vice versa) are weighted according to that user‚Äôs weight in that cluster, and normalized so that all outgoing edges sum to 1 (thus forming a probability distribution). Then, we can start at user U‚Äôs node and randomly jump to a cluster that U is in according to the probabilities on their outgoing edges. Then we can randomly jump from that cluster to a user, with probabilities proportional to each user‚Äôs weight in that cluster. Then we can jump to another cluster from whatever user we wind up at.</p>\n<p>Now, here‚Äôs a question: what‚Äôs the probability that after all of that jumping, we wound up at cluster X? If user U is closely connected to X via many intermediate clusters and donors with high weights, the probability will be high. If U isn‚Äôt closely connected to X, the probability will be low. So this probability is precisely what we use for the similarity score between U and X.</p>\n<p>This new method of calculating similarity scores really improved the sybil resistance of the algorithm. All of the charts in <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a> 's <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524/1\">recent post</a> were calculated with this new version of COCM.<br>\n.<br>\nThat‚Äôs all for now.

The tl;dr is that I will be stepping out of all official interactions I have with Gitcoin and will be taking over as co-lead of the Passport Business Unit as we work to spin out the business unit. Read on for more details and sappy stories with lots of appreciation!</p>\n<p><strong>Gitcoin entering its endgame</strong></p>\n<p>As I posted a couple months ago, Gitcoin is entering its endgame, and I want to make sure the <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-dao-has-no-ceo/9852\">DAO doesn‚Äôt have a CEO</a>. As a result, much of the soft power that was accruing to me needed to be diffused in the new BUs, and Ecosystem Collective. At the same time, there are very real requirements that the Gitcoin Foundation both needs to meet, but then also advances for the DAO. <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet\">@deltajuliet</a> will be taking over as interim Executive Director (until such time a token vote can ratify the new Exec Director), and she will lead the Gitcoin Foundation. I will let her chime in with more on the details of her role shift, and the timing for an election/formalization of the new ED.</p>\n<p><strong>Passport Future</strong></p>\n<p>I have worked with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> for years to build out &amp; design a proof of personhood approach that was pluralistic by default. He believes in the power that anti-sybil technology creates, and I believe in the power that non-doxxing reputation can bring to the world. On this quest, we wanted to ensure any solution we built protected users‚Äô privacy while enabling them to prove they are unique humans. We launched Passport years ago after many hours were spent combing through usage data to prevent sybil attacks on our Grants Program.</p>\n<p>Today, Passport has evolved a bunch, and Passport.xyz is live (more updates coming soon!). I am excited to narrow my focus to this opportunity where Passport enables web3 citizens to build reputation and prove they are unique humans - combating the sybils and bad actors. I have internalized the need for Passport to decrease user friction, and for us to lead with more data analysis - your voices have been heard and we will keep improving this. Co-leading the Passport team is an honor and I am elated they will have me back (again, and again!).</p>\n<p><strong>The road behind and path ahead</strong></p>\n<p>I joined Gitcoin when we were a small team in Consensys. <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a>, Joe Lubin (and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kriak.eth\">@kriak.eth</a>) afforded me the opportunity to grow the Gitcoin team, and work to support our spinout and success. Three years later, I am immensely grateful and proud of what we have accomplished:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Spun out of Consensys</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fund raised to capitalize the organization that would launch the DAO and Protocol</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch $GTC and seed the DAO with a compelling purpose</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build the decentralized Gitcoin DAO with legal rails for longevity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complete the treasury diversification to ensure stability during the bear</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scaling the protocol and GMV (this is where we are now!)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My cup is full, and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with so many amazing leaders and team members, lots of whom are now off and leading other organizations too! The alumni network of Gitcoin is stronger than most. So many great people have contributed to Gitcoin and have helped grow this team, the magic of the mission, and this community have made Gitcoin a household name in Web3.</p>\n<p>I plan to stay connected and participate in the governance of Gitcoin. I also plan to advocate for Gitcoin‚Äôs continued decentralization (through the work the Ecosystem Collective is doing) and expansion of GTC utility.</p>\n<p>This community is one of the best in the space, and is generally interested in changing the world for the better. I will always be trying to green pill degens and turn them into regens with moonshot bots, comic books and trading card games.

Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved decision making</strong> - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Retaining top performers</strong> - Some ideas and teams won‚Äôt produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher self awareness &amp; accountability</strong> - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowers individual contributors</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.</li>\n<li><strong>Removed intermediaries</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone‚Äôs compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible information usage</strong> - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source contribution data</strong> - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Self sovereign identity adoption</strong> - Individual contribution logs can be tied to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust based networks</strong> - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they‚Äôve built and the common connections they share.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Read our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution verification and contribution logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/approaches/contribution-verification-approaches\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification approaches</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Experimentation in Gitcoin</strong></p>\n<p>Individual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants process or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to start building up their own reputation. Idea funding and contributor funding could both experiment with individual contribution logs.</p>\n<br> \n<p><strong>Further investigation</strong></p>\n<p>These is an opportunity to create more tooling that could enable individual contributors to easily record and present their contribution efforts. Contribution logs could become increasingly useful and reliable for contributors to build their reputation in the ecosystem and for voters when making funding decisions.</p>\n<p>In the comings months the Web3 Association is going to look at what tooling already exists that could be used and then explore what new tools could be created to make it easier to record and present contribution efforts.
