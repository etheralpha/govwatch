Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.</p>\n<p>Until a recent proposal, OETH was an LST aggregator that earned yield by tapping into blue-chip protocols while being collateralized by other LSTs. Over the next few weeks, OETH LST collateral will be divested back to ETH, as OETH will be transitioned into a full-fledged LST. OETH will soon become a superior LST with an extremely tight peg (1:1 redemptions to ETH thru Origin’s ARM) and high yields thanks to a combination of the OETH AMO and DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p.</p>\n<p>OETH is heavily audited by OpenZeppelin, with audits being conducted quarterly. Previous audits can be found in the OETH docs <a href=\"https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. OETH pricing can be determined using the OETH/ETH Chainlink, Dia, or Tellor oracles.</p>\n<p>wOETH is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OETH, you get back a fixed number of wOETH tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wOETH tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OETH tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wOETH earns yield at the same rate as standard OETH. The wOETH to OETH exchange rate can be read from the contract (function number 16), or via the OETH dapp.</p>\n<p>wOETH contract address: 0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192</p>\n<p>Current exchange rate as of 6/5/24: 1 wOETH = 1.09228118 OETH</p>\n<p>A frxETH/OETH Curve pool is currently available with $250k+ of available liquidity: <code>curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-353/deposit</code></p>\n<h2><a name=\"options-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#options-5\"></a>Options</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For: Deploy mentioned lending pair on Fraxlend in Ethereum mainnet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Against: Do nothing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-add-a-new-market-into-fraxlend-on-ethereum-woeth-frxeth/3090\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-add-a-new-market-into-fraxlend-on-ethereum-woeth-frxeth/3090","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 21:09:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3090"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-add-a-new-market-into-fraxlend-on-ethereum-woeth-frxeth/3090.rss","#text":"[FIP - 3XX] Add a new market into Fraxlend on Ethereum (wOETH/frxETH)"}},{"title":"[FIP - 363] Fraxlend Pilot Program with Oval on sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX","dc:creator":"Lee-UMA","category":"Fraxlend","description":"<h3><a name=\"simple-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#simple-summary-1\"></a>Simple Summary</h3>\n<p>This proposal seeks to implement Oval into the sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX Fraxlend markets as a pilot program. Oval will enable Fraxlend to recapture liquidation MEV that is currently lost to block builders and proposers. After evaluating Oval’s effectiveness, Fraxlend can consider whether to enable Oval on other markets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract:</h3>\n<p>This proposal seeks to implement Oval into the sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX markets as a pilot program.</p>\n<p>Oval is a liquidation MEV recapture tool composed of 2 parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A simple, audited smart contract that wraps an oracle price feed. This contract wrapper can not change or delay the price feed data. It only allows for new prices that create liquidation opportunities to be auctioned off to liquidators.</li>\n<li>Offchain infrastructure that executes the auction. This is built on top of Flashbot’s MEV-Share which is a trusted MEV infrastructure leader.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Integrating Oval will allow Frax to recapture a portion of the MEV that is currently being lost on liquidations. Frax can decide what to do with their portion of the recaptured MEV (ie. return to lenders or borrowers, protocol revenue).</p>\n<p>The sUSDe and USDe markets have been chosen as they use a single price feed that is mutable via governance and Chainlink has a USDe/USD price feed available. Oval already has pre-written and audited Chainlink adaptors, so only minor revisions are required to the Fraxlend smart oracle contract. The integration process is simple and will require minimal developer time from the Fraxlend. This pilot program will allow Frax to evaluate the effectiveness and potential scalability of Oval for broader application within its markets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation:</h3>\n<p>When a liquidation occurs on Fraxlend (and most other lending protocols), the liquidated user is charged a liquidation fee. These fees go to the 3rd party liquidator and ensure that it is profitable for liquidations to occur in market conditions that are unfavorable to liquidators. However, this often overpays for the liquidation. In these scenarios, liquidators participate in MEV by competitively bidding in an auction for first access to the profitable liquidation. The ultimate beneficiary of this is block proposers who can take up to 90% of the Liquidation Fee.</p>\n<p>By integrating Oval, Fraxlend can run a similar competitive auction where they are the main beneficiaries, thereby recapturing the value that would have gone to the block proposer through MEV. Frax is then free to decide what to do with their portion of the recaptured MEV (ie. return to lenders or borrowers, protocol revenue).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#specification-rationale-4\"></a>Specification &amp; Rationale:</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"what-is-oval-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#what-is-oval-5\"></a>What is Oval?</h4>\n<p>Oval enables liquidation MEV capture by wrapping oracle price updates as they are pushed onchain so that MEV cannot be extracted without the consent of the protocol.</p>\n<p>With Oval, when searchers perform a liquidation on Fraxlend an order flow auction is triggered using Flashbots’ MEV Share—a battle tested tool that allows MEV searchers to compete for MEV extraction offchain.</p>\n<p>To extract the liquidation MEV created by an update, searchers must submit a winning bid, most of which is paid to the protocol as revenue. The winner of the auction gets the right to backrun the oracle update transaction—performing the liquidation by adding their transaction to the block immediately after the price update.</p>\n<p>If no bid is received by the end of the auction window, the oracle price is automatically released and Fraxlend liquidations function as normal. This approach utilizes the solid foundation of Chainlink price feeds and MEV-Share to extract MEV from liquidations.</p>\n<p>The diagram below showcases, at a high level, a comparison between current liquidations and liquidations with Oval.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uBH1lqT5ZQ9ZxXF3q8T4NYYbWnO.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4_2_624x339.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uBH1lqT5ZQ9ZxXF3q8T4NYYbWnO\" width=\"624\" height=\"339\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4_2_624x339.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4_2_936x508.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4_2_1248x678.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECECEC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"oracles-oval-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#oracles-oval-6\"></a>Oracles &amp; Oval</h4>\n<p>Oval is not a price feed oracle</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oval wraps incoming prices from oracle price feeds, shielding them from MEV searchers.</li>\n<li>The Oval contract will use the Oracle price feed and initiate an auction for the MEV searchers to bid for access to liquidations.</li>\n<li>If no one participates in the auction, the price update will be released after 12 seconds (1 block).</li>\n<li>All Fraxlend logic checks on the price feed are downstream of Oval and can remain as is.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"implementation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#implementation-7\"></a>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Deploying Oval requires two simple steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deploy Oval smart contracts for the sUSDe and USDe markets</li>\n<li>Reference the Oval wrapped contracts in a new Fraxlend oracle smart contract</li>\n<li>Update the markets oracle addresses to the new Fraxlend oracle</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We recommend that Fraxlend receives their Oval revenue to a Frax treasury or governance controlled multi-sig for the pilot program.

We’ve been the major Oracle provider for Fraxtal since April 2024. Currently, our price feeds are integrated by Fraxlend, Glyph and Trinity on Fraxtal. The aim of this proposal is to help Fraxlend gain further market share and enhance its resiliency.</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n<p>RedStone is the major Oracle on Fraxtal. As the only price feeds provider, RedStone offers the two major oracle implementations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>RedStone Classic - Traditional Push model, supporting 5 major pairs at the time of writing (<a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/price-feeds\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Here</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-core\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RedStone Core</a> - Pull oracle model allowing for gas efficiency, and low-latency of price feed updates, based on attaching signed data packages to transaction call-data. The model that allowed i.e. Gearbox to grow its TVL by 10x, reaching over $400M.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our team would like to enhance Fraxlend’s resiliency by incorporating RedStone price feeds and enabling future expansions with new markets powered by RedStone (we are often the first Oracle to provide trending assets like with LRTs, Ethena, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT REDSTONE</strong></p>\n<p>RedStone is the quickest-growing Modular Oracle with clients including Venus, ListaDAO, Kinza, Pendle, Morpho, Ethena, Etherfi, Renzo, Puffer, Silo, Sommelier, Gearbox, Frax, Swell, Angle and 70+ other companies. Our Oracles are available on 50+ chains including Fraxtal, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Merlin Chain, BOB, Blast, TON, Mode and many more.</p>\n<p>RedStone’s mission is to enable DeFi protocols and dApp’s builders to reach their full potential with versatile, gas-optimized and robust price feeds delivered cross-chain. Our team consists of seasoned engineers with an average of 15+ years of dev experience and a hard-working BD &amp; Marketing team supporting partner protocols at every step: conferences, Twitter spaces, targeted intros, etc. Our technology has been acknowledged by the leading figures in the crypto space, we are proud to be backed by the most renowned Web3 Entrepreneurs such as Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon), Alex Gluchovski (zkSync), Emin Gün Sirer (Avalanche), Richard Ma (Quantstamp) and VCs like Lemniscap, Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain Capital, Maven11, Distributed Global, Lattice Fund and others.</p>\n<p>Our tech-first approach allows us to be a leader in LRT &amp; LST price feeds and provide Oracles for blue chip assets, LP and staked tokens and numerous trending tokens. We are the first oracle to create price feeds for weETH (Etherfi) and ezETH (Renzo), STONE (StakeStone) and numerous other assets.</p>\n<p><strong>PROPOSAL</strong></p>\n<p>Integrating <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd60c54115C19e0c6360AD4762B88BB8076D50a8#readProxyContract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sfrxETH / ETH</a> price feed on Ethereum mainnet into Fraxlend.

Any token with an approved data feed can be lent to borrowers or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.</p>\n<p>Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, Frax has deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.</p>\n<p>Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.</p>\n<p>Inverse Finance is the decentralized autonomous organization that develops and manages the FiRM fixed rate lending protocol, DOLA, its debt-backed, decentralized stablecoin, and sDOLA, the yield-bearing version of DOLA. Originally founded by Nour Haridy in late 2020, the protocol is governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, a collective of crypto enthusiasts. Our code base is open source and maintained by the community.</p>\n<p>sDOLA is a yield-bearing version of Inverse Finance’s DOLA stablecoin which currently generates a 30-day average yield of over 12.52% via revenues from its FiRM fixed rate lending market. sDOLA uses a custom price feed that utilizes the DOLA/FraxPyusd pool and Curve EMA to price DOLA. By adding it to Fraxlend, we can enable the minting and backing of even more FRAX and expand DOLA lending capacity against sFRAX on FiRM.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-3\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Authorize Fraxlend AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the mentioned Fraxlend pair with the mentioned max authorized allocation.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-360-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-a-new-pair-sdola-frax-variable-rate/3071\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-360-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-a-new-pair-sdola-frax-variable-rate/3071","pubDate":"Tue, 21 May 2024 19:54:24 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3071"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-360-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-a-new-pair-sdola-frax-variable-rate/3071.rss","#text":"[FIP - 360] Authorize Fraxlend AMO for a new pair (sDOLA/FRAX - Variable Rate)"}},{"title":"Frax DAO Grant for THE DEFI CLUB May 2024","dc:creator":"FraxGod.eth","category":"Miscellaneous","description":"<h3><a name=\"h-1-overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#h-1-overview-1\"></a>1.

Applicant Information</h3>\n<p>At THE DEFI CLUB, we are pioneering the creation of the first educational hub within the Fraxtal ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Similar to how major protocols like Chainlink dedicate an annual budget to education through various bootcamps, events, and hackathons, and run comprehensive ambassador programs, we recognize the power of these initiatives to increase crypto awareness and foster a strong sense of community belonging.</p>\n<p>By addressing the current educational void in the Frax ecosystem, we aim to leverage these proven strategies to enhance DeFi education and deepen community engagement, building on the foundation set by previous community outreach efforts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-project-description-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#h-3-project-description-3\"></a>3. Project Description</h3>\n<p>THE DEFI CLUB serves as a central point for learning and development, equipped with resources, tutorials, and interactive tools designed to simplify complex DeFi concepts. Our goal is to lower the entry barriers for newcomers, ensuring they can navigate and leverage the full potential of DeFi Protocols.</p>\n<p>Our first release will be a 14-week paid DeFi Bootcamp, built for those who want to master the art of investing in decentralized finance. In each 2 hour lesson, one of our instructors will comprehensively teach and demonstrate various DeFi protocols (Frax, Curve, Convex, f(x) Protocol, Stake DAO, Prisma Finance, EigenLayer, Wombat Exchange, PancakeSwap, Pendle Finance &amp; IQ.wiki). Each lesson will be interactive and allow for students to engage, ask questions, and learn functional training on how to use DeFi applications.</p>\n<p>At the end of the Bootcamp, each student will be evaluated through an on-chain exam built on Fraxtal, with stablecoin rewards for top performers funded by the revenue from the bootcamp sales, which are deployed in DeFi protocols used throughout the course.</p>\n<p>This is part of an EdTech primitive called Learn2Earn that FraxGod introduced with his previous LYTRYUM Academy, which successfully attracted talent to the Spanish-speaking community. The proof of concept, deployed on Polygon, can be viewed on Binance Live at this <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/es/live/video?roomId=2152116\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a>.</p>\n<p>Considering this concept and based on their scores, participants will receive an exclusive NFT Certification on Fraxtal, which demonstrates their completion of the program and validates their skills.</p>\n<p>All of the educational materials have already been made in Spanish by FraxGod &amp; Anicet0, and we are currently converting them for an English Audience. Some of the lessons taught live in Spanish can be found in this <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1VkJHj7XnZ5rWMGZ9Hdre1sNjWJV52SSZ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">folder</a>.</p>\n<p>THE DEFI CLUB will also serve as a community gathering.

In the ethos of Frax being positive-sum, I propose that we help projects that builds solutions on-top of our products to be integrated or featured directly on the relevant Frax-app site. This proposal was made to outline who can be eligible, in what way they can be integrated or informed about and lastly what information should be given to the users and in what way.</p>\n<p>Solve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helps grow the Frax ecosystem</li>\n<li>Shows in action Frax is positive sum</li>\n<li>Can help Frax grow TVL</li>\n<li>Users become more aware of their options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Proposal 1:<br>\nInform/market directly on the relevant product pages of third-party solutions, so that users can see they have more options. Include a disclaimer that third-party option can have more risk.</p>\n<p>Pros: Easy to implement<br>\nCons: Less alignment with other protocols and do not help in the same degree.</p>\n<p>Proposal 2:<br>\nDirectly integrate third-party solutions into the relevant product pages, strictly as a opt-in option. Each new project that wants to be integrated has to have a proposal with a discussion-phase where they answer out all requirements. Failure to fulfil all requirements leads to automatic disqualification.</p>\n<p>Requirements needed to be fulfilled to qualify for implementation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has to be relevant for the product site it wants to be integrated with.</li>\n<li>Protocol has to be over 2 years old.</li>\n<li>Core members of the protocol should be doxxed (At the minimum to our core team).</li>\n<li>They have audits for all contract upgrades/changes.</li>\n<li>A fee will be taken by the Frax protocol and put into a security fund in case of hacks. This fund will only be used towards users using the directly integrated solution, as a extra security. There is also an expectation that every protocol integrated have a plan in case a hack should happen, and already now take steps to mitigate damage. The fee taken has to reflect the protocols risk and economics. The fee % will be decided on a per-integration basis, and will be a crucial part of the integration proposal and discussion per project proposal.</li>\n<li>There has to be ELI5 explanations made by the protocol on how their system works, with clear pros and cons given to the user.

The Frax ecosystem has traditionally been associated with very serious defi plays and has not thus far drawn significant attention from meme coiners in the space.</p>\n<p>Simply waiting for a community led meme coin to grow to large, hype inducing valuations may take years to develop and will not help Fraxtal supercharge growth and adoption. To this end, the option of supporting meme coins, in a manner that befits a defi focused chain, exists to help in supercharging memes and gaining retail attention.</p>\n<p>The motivation for this FIP has emerged from discussions with some of the leading meme coins in the current FRAX space, namely FraxDOGE (first meme coin on Fraxtal). Notably, memes across Fraxtal have seen only modest growth but would benefit from LP support at greatly increased levels to supercharge their growth.</p>\n<p>Acknowledging that this would be good for any future meme launch and for protocols, the playing field must remain level and as such, the establishment of the Frax Meme collective should ensure that new meme coins that are properly vetted, can be included in the program to supercharge meme growth. Details of this proposal, membership etc, will be discussed below.</p>\n<p><strong>Kick start the OG</strong></p>\n<p>The first step of this proposal is to kick start the meme LP agenda through the allocation of 10,000 FXS to the first meme deployed on Fraxtal, namely FraxDOGE.</p>\n<p>fraxDOGE, has also distributed a full 1% of the total supply to the top 100veFXS holders.

This allocation can be renewed after the 2 months pending the decision of “the Frax Meme Collective” as described below.</p>\n<p>Notably, this allocation will need to go to pools where fraxDOGE has been paired with FXS to ensure additional utility. FXD will utilise RA exchange to allocate their rewards to a fraxDOGE/FXS LP. Any breach of the above or acts of bad faith will mean immediate disqualification from any further support on Frax. Ideally this serves the dual purposes of building our FXS liquidity in the near term.</p>\n<p><strong>Establish The Frax Meme Collective</strong></p>\n<p>The Frax meme collective is designed to be made up of interested community members who will be elected by FXS voters. The collective will initially consist of 5 volunteer members who will self nominate to join the collective. Notably, the Frax Meme Collective are under no obligation to continue to support any token (including FXD) once they are duly elected.</p>\n<p>The collective will establish their business rules, governance etc once they are duly elected.</p>\n<p>The goals of the collective are to:<br>\n-Request monthly funding for meme LP incentives</p>\n<p>-Review memes for user safety, ie burnt liquidity, non-rug, non-tax token type reviews.</p>\n<p>-Allocate meme funding to projects that have passed fair review</p>\n<p>-Publish monthly allocations and ensure compliance with the themes of good behaviour. (ie non FXS dumping to buy tokens etc)</p>\n<p><strong>Frax Collective Elections:</strong></p>\n<p>I propose that Collective members submit a short bio and reason for their desire to join the Collective on the FRAX forum for subsequent short listing and voting via FXS holders. This should occur no more than 2 weeks post the passing of this snapshot. As the authors, we are happy to coordinate this but notably, the authors will not be guaranteed a position.

Acting as a top of funnel to the ecosystem, we have been a one stop shop for everything related to Frax .</p>\n<p>It has been a worthy experiment to see how far an outside entity like Flywheel can support Frax, but it is obvious that there are limits to this model. Flywheel has done its best to amplify Frax and we have to an extent, but after reflecting on the past it is clear that the most effective way that Frax can execute marketing and communications going forward is shifting to an internal strategy.</p>\n<p>With this being said, I am requesting that the core team pause funding for Flywheel going forward. Flywheel will continue with its obligations for Frax until April 12th after which there will be no need to send any more payments. The core team has already started the process of shifting to creating internal positions that focus specifically on marketing/growth.</p>\n<p>Wr would like to thank everyone who has supported us in the past including all veFXS voters (whether you voted for or against) who participated in our funding votes. Some of the most participated votes in the history of Frax was over Flywheel and is a testament to the liveliness of the community as a whole.</p>\n<p>There are multiple tailwinds pushing Frax forward this cycle. The launch of Fraxtal and its push of being the M2 of crypto is positioning the ecosystem to being the easiest place to launch an L3.

This proposal aims to make governance more effective while establishing clear and transparent expectations, with fairness that does not differentiate.</p>\n<p>Solve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This proposal makes sure users who are unhappy with their position have a clear way to get their funds/LP position back with standardized costs.</li>\n<li>It makes future governance for FRAX more effective with less need for discussion and less proposals</li>\n<li>It protects the interest of our protocols liquidity system with a standardized fee which is intended to make it unattractive to ragequit</li>\n<li>It protects the protocol from lowering the collateralization ratio below 100% from ragequit proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal does not in any way or form talk about unlocks, which is another topic best judged from case to case in regards to situation.</p>\n<p>My proposal for a standardized ragequit is:<br>\n10% flat fee<br>\n0.5% fee per month left</p>\n<p>Example 1: 1 month left of lock<br>\n10.5% of LP</p>\n<p>Example 2: 36 months left of lock<br>\n28% of LP</p>\n<p>Due to people being able to claim rewards, it is hard to retract those. To make standardization more easy, the flat rate was increased to 10%. This is more similar with some earlier ragequit proposals. The variable rate of 0.5% per month also accounts for other proposals with higher lock times and with a usual 20% ragequit fee.</p>\n<p>There  is also the worry about the collateralization ratio (from now refrenced as CR) of Frax Finance, and how ragequits impact on our long term goal of 100% CR. I therefore propose that we utilize a oracle to check CR, and if its below 100% ragequitting is not permitted. In this way, we can protect Frax from systemic risk, while still allowing participants that want to ragequit the possibility when it does not unnecessary damage the protocols interests.</p>\n<p>I propose that all new gauges/locks have this option from start, so that this will be optional without going through governance. This means that contracts should have a easy to use front end for ragequitting, which may lead to more development work. The work for the front-end should be prioritized at the core teams discretion, to not distract for more short/mid term important matters. That may even mean a delay for new pairs to get the ragequit function.  For old pairs, one have go through governance to enable a ragequit function. It is important to clearify that this proposal will still be relevant, and the terms outlined in this proposal will still apply in ragequitting of those old pairs. The proposals for old pairs will simply be if one should activate the ragequit function or not.</p>\n<p>I propose LP the protocol takes in fees from the ragequit be added to the FLE, so that the protocol can continue operating the pair or in other ways increase our revenue and liquidity. The protocol  will then manage to keep the pair more stable, even during ragequits. It also benefits from the ragequit because it adds value to the balance sheet.</p>\n            <p><small>26 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/standardize-ragequit-proposals-and-make-it-a-feature-and-not-a-bug/3016\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/standardize-ragequit-proposals-and-make-it-a-feature-and-not-a-bug/3016","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 07:27:24 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3016"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/standardize-ragequit-proposals-and-make-it-a-feature-and-not-a-bug/3016.rss","#text":"Standardize ragequit proposals and make it a feature and not a bug"}},{"title":"[FIP - 348,349] Authorize Fraxlend AMO for new pairs ( sUSDe/FRAX, USDe/FRAX )","dc:creator":"amirnader","category":"AMOs","description":"<h2><a name=\"authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#authors-1\"></a>Authors</h2>\n<p>Frax Core Team</p>\n<h1><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>Authorize Fraxlend AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the following Fraxlend pairs with mentioned max authorized allocation.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Fraxlend Pair Name</th>\n<th>Chain</th>\n<th>Fraxlend Pair Address</th>\n<th>Max Authorized Allocation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>sUSDe/FRAX - Variable Rate V2</td>\n<td>Ethereum</td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n<td>125,000,000 FRAX</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDe/FRAX - Variable Rate V2</td>\n<td>Ethereum</td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n<td>125,000,000 FRAX</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h1><a name=\"background-and-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#background-and-motivation-3\"></a>Background and Motivation</h1>\n<p>Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens.
