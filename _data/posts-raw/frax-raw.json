To address this concern and provide a flexible solution, we propose an exchange option to migrate the locked liquidity to FXBs, specifically FXB2029. This provides immediate liquidity to exit LPs starting with the older gauges while also keeping TVL within the Frax &amp; Fraxtal ecosystem, an overall value add for all parties. FXB2029 tokens are liquid with high incentives for liquidity providers, massive FXTL points boosts, and migrators can exit these tokens should they want to leave the ecosystem for any reason by selling them on-chain in Curve pools and other venues and in no way required to hold them until maturity.</p>\n<p>FXB tokens are simple, trustless tokens that resemble a zero-coupon bond that converts to the FRAX stablecoin on maturity. FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXB tokens are only convertible to FRAX stablecoins; they do not guarantee FRAX peg, FRAX value, or yield/interest denominated in any other asset except FRAX.</p>\n<p>By migrating to FXBs, liquidity providers will have an alternative means to manage their deployed capital within the Frax ecosystem, providing them with the flexibility they have requested while ensuring the protocol maintains its needed locked liquidity.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#proposal-details-4\"></a>Proposal Details</h1>\n<p>This approach offers liquidity providers a way to exit their positions while maintaining their investment within the Frax ecosystem, ensuring the protocol’s stability and growth. The following points are important to note about this proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pricing Based on Underlying Assets:</strong> The pricing for the locked liquidity will be based on the current price of the underlying assets at the time of the exchange.</li>\n<li><strong>Exchange with FXB2029:</strong> Locked liquidity can only be exchanged for FXB2029 at the auction price prevailing at the time of the exchange. The auction price has a floor price of .794 at the time of this proposal &amp; it is expected to remain at this floor price. An LP that wishes to migrate can sign the migration transaction on the Ethereum mainnet and move their LP token/NFT to the protocol to receive FXB2029 tokens directly to the same address on the Fraxtal mainnet. They are then free to do whatever they wish with their FXB2029 tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Designated Locked Liquidity for Exchange:</strong> Only certain designated pools will be eligible for this exchange option, but this list can be expanded through the governance process.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pool</th>\n<th>Gauge Address</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/USDC</td>\n<td>0x3EF26504dbc8Dd7B7aa3E97Bc9f3813a9FC0B4B0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/DAI</td>\n<td>0xF22471AC2156B489CC4a59092c56713F813ff53e</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li><strong>Option to Retain LPs:</strong> Liquidity providers will have the option to either exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 or retain their current locked positions.</li>\n<li><strong>No Ragequit Fee:</strong> There will be no Ragequit fee for liquidity providers choosing this exchange method, ensuring a cost-effective transition.</li>\n<li><strong>FXTL points &amp; incentives:</strong> Migrators that receive FXB2029 for their positions will be entitled to all FXTL points multipliers &amp; yield opportunities that are available and upcoming for all FXB2029 holders, making it one of the most high-yield opportunities within the Frax ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-5\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Approve the option for liquidity providers to exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 at the auction price.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-locked-liquidity-standard-exit/3145\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-locked-liquidity-standard-exit/3145","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Jul 2024 23:28:44 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3145"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-locked-liquidity-standard-exit/3145.rss","#text":"[FIP - 3XX] Locked Liquidity Standard Exit"}},{"title":"[FIP - XXX] Change veFXS Reward Distribution Token","dc:creator":"C2tP-C2tP","category":"FIPs","description":"<h1><a name=\"authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#authors-1\"></a>Authors</h1>\n<p>C2tP<br>\nSam Kazemian</p>\n<h1><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>There has been long discussions on how veFXS rewards should be distributed. There is merit to both buying back and distributing FXS and distributing a stable coin such as sFrax or sfrxEth. In the end users can swap for the token they want (albeit liquidity can differ between the tokens).</p>\n<p>The token of choice should be one that “does work” for the protocol and user. The more work done, the better the token choice. For example on Curve the fee token was originally 3Crv LP token. This was because having deeper liquidity on 3Crv was a major source of protocol fees.  Curve has now switched to crvUSD as each crvUSD in distribution is equivalent to a crvUSD being lent out and creating fees.</p>\n<p>One possible choice for Frax could be sFrax. sFrax does a lot of work for the user, but not all that much is gained on the protocol level. This can be an okay tradeoff though if claiming continued to be on mainnet since gas costs are higher and thus times to claim could be much longer for most users.</p>\n<p>On Fraxtal however, gas costs are much less of an issue. Thus reward tokens should be more oriented for Protocol work. This is both good for the user in an indirect way, as well as users can withdraw and convert to something more oriented for their yield whenever they want.</p>\n<p>The best asset choice for the protocol to issue would thus be an FXB. The protocol makes revenue in the background while the frax is waiting to be matured. If users claim and convert the FXB on the market, the protocol still has the underlying working. FXBs themselves also are yield bearing for the user (albeit at probably a slower rate than sFrax).</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to change veFXS revenue to be distributed as a wrapped version of the FXB20291231 issued on Fraxtal. The FXS buyback as part of the FLE system will stay the same.</p>\n<p>The wrapper for this token will automatically use the underlying FXB as collateral in FraxLend and borrow frax for sFrax if interest rates are profitable. Users will gain compounded FXB tokens and can withdraw at any time.  FraxLend AMO will also gain some interest by lending to the FraxLend pair.</p>\n<p>Wrapper can be found here (<a href=\"https://github.com/convex-eth/frax-cvx-platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/fraxtal/cvxFXB.sol\" class=\"inline-onebox\">frax-cvx-platform/contracts/contracts/fraxtal/cvxFXB.sol at main · convex-eth/frax-cvx-platform · GitHub</a>) and is currently under audit. Audit must be cleared to satisfactory levels before being used as the veFXS reward token.</p>\n<p>As of note, the wrapper will contain a migration function to move underlying fxb to a different fxb type. The admin role for setting this migration will be held by the Frax comptroller multisig or Frax Governance.</p>\n<p>Also the current name of the token (cvxFXB) is subject to change if we or the Frax team decide on something better before deployment.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"fees-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#fees-3\"></a>Fees</h1>\n<p>There will be a standard market fee of 10% as a management fee.<br>\nThis fee is only applied to revenue gained via the borrowing aspect of the wrapper and in no way applies to underlying vefxs rewards.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-4\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<p>For: Change veFXS reward token distribution to the cvxFXB FXB wrapper.<br>\nAgainst: Do nothing.</p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-xxx-change-vefxs-reward-distribution-token/3137\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-xxx-change-vefxs-reward-distribution-token/3137","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 04:18:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3137"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-xxx-change-vefxs-reward-distribution-token/3137.rss","#text":"[FIP - XXX] Change veFXS Reward Distribution Token"}},{"title":"Use FXTL to redistribute Fraxtal revenue to users (v2)","dc:creator":"wolfehr","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/u/wolfehr\">@wolfehr</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraxtal is a new Frax product that will generate revenue via sequencer feeds and MEV.</li>\n<li>Frax will redistribute 20% of revenue back to users that add value to the ecosystem (as measured by flox blocksapce rewareds), with the remaining 80% going to veFXS and insurance (78/2 split).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Principals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The FXTL system should incentivize Fraxtal usage, Fraxtal TVL, and building/innovating on Fraxtal.</li>\n<li>Fraxtal’s revenue should be redistributed to users who add value to the ecosystem (as measured by FXTL).

I didn’t include that here because I (personally) don’t think it needs to be a core part of the FXTL system and can be a separate incentive stream that goes into the vault. However, if the majority feels emissions should be baked into the FXTL system long-term or we should include a short-term bootstrapping mechanism to kick start things included in this proposal, I can add it.

One initial conversion, then a ongoing FXTL conversion running theoretically forever.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Initial conversion.</strong><br>\nAt the one year mark of the launch of Fraxtal, have a opt-in event to convert the current FXTL points so far to FXS. The conversion will be weighted by amount of FXTL points opted in. Use 5 million FXS for this purpose. This will leave us with a market cap of 93 million FXS after the FPIS merger and the initial conversion is completed.</p>\n<p>The reason this event is opt-in is that there might be people who might want to try and game later weekly conversions, adding some game theory to the proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Ongoing FXTL conversion</strong><br>\nEvery year, earmark 1 million of FXS emissions for FXTL points conversion. Every week 19231 FXS is put into a pool. In the next week, people can deposit their FXTL points to redeem a percentage of this pool.</p>\n<p>1 million of yearly FXS emissions seems high. But it is important to remember that the FLE system if successful most likely will be able to absorb these emissions in the future. The proposal also gives ample runway (7 years), if the proposal does not prove successful. Hence new governance actions can be taken well before we reach the 100 million hardcap.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Extra</strong><br>\nAnother important discussion point is the introduction of a lock and multiplier system. This is my proposal for such a system.</p>\n<p>Min.

Shinchan</p>\n<p>Due to recent increases in ragequit proposals and people not being happy with their own action of being locked, we propose that Frax standardize the ragequit proposals for users who wants their funds back early. This proposal aims to make governance more effective while establishing clear and transparent expectations, with fairness that does not differentiate.</p>\n<p>Solve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This proposal makes sure users who are unhappy with their position have a clear way to get their funds/LP position back with standardized costs.</li>\n<li>It makes future governance for FRAX more effective with less need for discussion and less proposals</li>\n<li>It protects the interest of our protocols liquidity system with a standardized fee which is intended to make it unattractive to ragequit</li>\n<li>It protects the protocol from lowering the collateralization ratio below 100% from ragequit proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal does not in any way or form talk about unlocks, which is another topic best judged from case to case in regards to situation.</p>\n<p>We propose the following algorithmic solution for a standardized ragequit:<br>\n“USD value of LP position” × Multiplier = “virtual USD Value of Boosted Position”<br>\nL M B<br>\n“LP Staked + Boost [FraxStats]” × “LP Price [FraxStats]” = “virtual USD Value of entire Pool”<br>\nP A N<br>\nnote [FraxStats] refers to the value indicated by app.frax.finance for the equivalently named statistic of any given gauged LP pool during any given period.</p>\n<p>G = “virtual USD Value of Boosted Position” ÷ “virtual USD Value of entire Pool”<br>\nB N<br>\nG = decimal percentage (virtual) USD Value of position relative to (virtual) boosted value of entire pool<br>\nA = LP Price [FraxStats]<br>\nD = LP Amount Staked per position<br>\nL = USD Value of LP Position<br>\nL = A x D<br>\nM= (veFXS-stake-weight-boost + time-lock-boost)<br>\nM = Multiplier<br>\nP = “LP Staked + Boost”[FraxStats]<br>\nB = “virtual USD Value of Boosted Position”<br>\nB = L × M<br>\nP × A = “virtual USD Value of entire Pool”<br>\nP x A = N<br>\nG = (B ÷ N)<br>\nG = (L × M) ÷ (P × A)<br>\nR = FXS allocated to pool per epoch [FraxStats]<br>\nF = FXS Price per epoch [FraxStats]<br>\nF = cumulative avg FXS price of relative epochs (use 3 daily averages [morning/noon/night])<br>\nE = F^y × veFXS (user staked)<br>\nM = “FXS rewarded to LP Position per Epoch”<br>\nM = G × R<br>\nV = “USD Value of FXS rewarded to LP Position per Epoch”<br>\nV = M × F<br>\nV^n = M × F per epoch<br>\n^n = sequential numerical identity of epoch, NOT an exponent (used only as epoch identifier)<br>\n^y = most recent ^n<br>\nT = “Total USD Value of FXS received per (lifetime of) position”<br>\nT = (V^n) + (V^n) … + (V^y)<br>\nC = Function derived from<br>\nvalue of Collateral Ratio %<br>\nIf C=0 unlocks are not permitted.<br>\nC =<br>\n{ CR% ≥ 103% =1<br>\nCR% ≤ 103% = 0}</p>\n<p>Y = Days Remaining til unlock of LP Position<br>\nU = “USD Value of LP Position” – T<br>\nU = L – T<br>\nU = amount due to users after unlock, [post-fxs-repay, pre-fee] (no discount applied)</p>\n<p>D = USD fee discount for cvxFXS and veFXS stakers<br>\nD = (((days-since-veFXS(or cvxFXS)-lockup ÷ (365.25 × 4)) × 50)%) × E<br>\nD ≠ &gt;(50% × T)<br>\nX = Amount Owed minus Discount</p>\n<p>X= ((“Total USD Value of all FXS rewarded to LP” + “0.06844627% of (U) per Day of Lock Remaining[2.5% a year]”) minus D) × function of C</p>\n<p>X = ((T + ((((Y/1461)×10)%)U)) - D) × C<br>\nZ = L – X<br>\nZ = Amount received by User post fees + deductions</p>\n<p>Loop (Z - X) back through CR calculation to ensure CR% ≥ 103% before finalizing unlock</p>\n<p>We propose that all new gauges/locks have this option from start, so that this will be optional without going through governance. This means that contracts should have a easy to use front end for ragequitting, which may lead to more development work. The work for the front-end should be prioritized at the core teams discretion, to not distract for more short/mid term important matters. That may even mean a delay for new pairs to get the ragequit function. For old pairs, one have go through governance to enable a ragequit function. It is important to clearify that this proposal will still be relevant, and the terms outlined in this proposal will still apply in ragequitting of those old pairs. The proposals for old pairs will simply be if one should activate the ragequit function or not.</p>\n<p>We propose LP the protocol takes in fees from the ragequit be added to the FLE, so that the protocol can continue operating the pair or in other ways increase our revenue and liquidity. The protocol will then manage to keep the pair more stable, even during ragequits. It also benefits from the ragequit because it adds value to the balance sheet.</p>\n<p>For voting, the following voting suggestion is proposed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yes to algorithmic solution</li>\n<li>Alternative solution with new discussion phase</li>\n<li>No standardization of ragequit proposals.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As for other alternatives, the original discussion can be found in a link under. However the authors want to emphasize that we believe the current proposal is the most fair and best solution.

Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.</p>\n<p>Until a recent proposal, OETH was an LST aggregator that earned yield by tapping into blue-chip protocols while being collateralized by other LSTs. Over the next few weeks, OETH LST collateral will be divested back to ETH, as OETH will be transitioned into a full-fledged LST. OETH will soon become a superior LST with an extremely tight peg (1:1 redemptions to ETH thru Origin’s ARM) and high yields thanks to a combination of the OETH AMO and DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p.</p>\n<p>OETH is heavily audited by OpenZeppelin, with audits being conducted quarterly. Previous audits can be found in the OETH docs <a href=\"https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. OETH pricing can be determined using the OETH/ETH Chainlink, Dia, or Tellor oracles.</p>\n<p>wOETH is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OETH, you get back a fixed number of wOETH tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wOETH tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OETH tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wOETH earns yield at the same rate as standard OETH. The wOETH to OETH exchange rate can be read from the contract (function number 16), or via the OETH dapp.</p>\n<p>wOETH contract address: 0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192</p>\n<p>Current exchange rate as of 6/5/24: 1 wOETH = 1.09228118 OETH</p>\n<p>A frxETH/OETH Curve pool is currently available with $250k+ of available liquidity: <code>curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-353/deposit</code></p>\n<h2><a name=\"options-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#options-5\"></a>Options</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For: Deploy mentioned lending pair on Fraxlend in Ethereum mainnet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Against: Do nothing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-364-add-a-new-market-into-fraxlend-on-ethereum-woeth-frxeth/3090\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-364-add-a-new-market-into-fraxlend-on-ethereum-woeth-frxeth/3090","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 21:09:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3090"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-364-add-a-new-market-into-fraxlend-on-ethereum-woeth-frxeth/3090.rss","#text":"[FIP - 364] Add a new market into Fraxlend on Ethereum (wOETH/frxETH)"}},{"title":"[FIP - 363] Fraxlend Pilot Program with Oval on sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX","dc:creator":"Lee-UMA","category":"Fraxlend","description":"<h3><a name=\"simple-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#simple-summary-1\"></a>Simple Summary</h3>\n<p>This proposal seeks to implement Oval into the sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX Fraxlend markets as a pilot program. Oval will enable Fraxlend to recapture liquidation MEV that is currently lost to block builders and proposers. After evaluating Oval’s effectiveness, Fraxlend can consider whether to enable Oval on other markets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract:</h3>\n<p>This proposal seeks to implement Oval into the sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX markets as a pilot program.</p>\n<p>Oval is a liquidation MEV recapture tool composed of 2 parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A simple, audited smart contract that wraps an oracle price feed. This contract wrapper can not change or delay the price feed data. It only allows for new prices that create liquidation opportunities to be auctioned off to liquidators.</li>\n<li>Offchain infrastructure that executes the auction. This is built on top of Flashbot’s MEV-Share which is a trusted MEV infrastructure leader.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Integrating Oval will allow Frax to recapture a portion of the MEV that is currently being lost on liquidations. Frax can decide what to do with their portion of the recaptured MEV (ie. return to lenders or borrowers, protocol revenue).</p>\n<p>The sUSDe and USDe markets have been chosen as they use a single price feed that is mutable via governance and Chainlink has a USDe/USD price feed available. Oval already has pre-written and audited Chainlink adaptors, so only minor revisions are required to the Fraxlend smart oracle contract. The integration process is simple and will require minimal developer time from the Fraxlend. This pilot program will allow Frax to evaluate the effectiveness and potential scalability of Oval for broader application within its markets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation:</h3>\n<p>When a liquidation occurs on Fraxlend (and most other lending protocols), the liquidated user is charged a liquidation fee. These fees go to the 3rd party liquidator and ensure that it is profitable for liquidations to occur in market conditions that are unfavorable to liquidators. However, this often overpays for the liquidation. In these scenarios, liquidators participate in MEV by competitively bidding in an auction for first access to the profitable liquidation. The ultimate beneficiary of this is block proposers who can take up to 90% of the Liquidation Fee.</p>\n<p>By integrating Oval, Fraxlend can run a similar competitive auction where they are the main beneficiaries, thereby recapturing the value that would have gone to the block proposer through MEV. Frax is then free to decide what to do with their portion of the recaptured MEV (ie. return to lenders or borrowers, protocol revenue).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#specification-rationale-4\"></a>Specification &amp; Rationale:</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"what-is-oval-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#what-is-oval-5\"></a>What is Oval?</h4>\n<p>Oval enables liquidation MEV capture by wrapping oracle price updates as they are pushed onchain so that MEV cannot be extracted without the consent of the protocol.</p>\n<p>With Oval, when searchers perform a liquidation on Fraxlend an order flow auction is triggered using Flashbots’ MEV Share—a battle tested tool that allows MEV searchers to compete for MEV extraction offchain.</p>\n<p>To extract the liquidation MEV created by an update, searchers must submit a winning bid, most of which is paid to the protocol as revenue. The winner of the auction gets the right to backrun the oracle update transaction—performing the liquidation by adding their transaction to the block immediately after the price update.</p>\n<p>If no bid is received by the end of the auction window, the oracle price is automatically released and Fraxlend liquidations function as normal. This approach utilizes the solid foundation of Chainlink price feeds and MEV-Share to extract MEV from liquidations.</p>\n<p>The diagram below showcases, at a high level, a comparison between current liquidations and liquidations with Oval.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uBH1lqT5ZQ9ZxXF3q8T4NYYbWnO.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4_2_624x339.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uBH1lqT5ZQ9ZxXF3q8T4NYYbWnO\" width=\"624\" height=\"339\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4_2_624x339.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4_2_936x508.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4_2_1248x678.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECECEC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"oracles-oval-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#oracles-oval-6\"></a>Oracles &amp; Oval</h4>\n<p>Oval is not a price feed oracle</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oval wraps incoming prices from oracle price feeds, shielding them from MEV searchers.</li>\n<li>The Oval contract will use the Oracle price feed and initiate an auction for the MEV searchers to bid for access to liquidations.</li>\n<li>If no one participates in the auction, the price update will be released after 12 seconds (1 block).</li>\n<li>All Fraxlend logic checks on the price feed are downstream of Oval and can remain as is.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"implementation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#implementation-7\"></a>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Deploying Oval requires two simple steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deploy Oval smart contracts for the sUSDe and USDe markets</li>\n<li>Reference the Oval wrapped contracts in a new Fraxlend oracle smart contract</li>\n<li>Update the markets oracle addresses to the new Fraxlend oracle</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We recommend that Fraxlend receives their Oval revenue to a Frax treasury or governance controlled multi-sig for the pilot program.

Velodrome’s vision to expand the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-the-metadex-48e4af1ef9a4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MetaDEX</a> across the Superchain is an ideal fit for Fraxtal’s goals to rapidly grow its ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This proposal asks for $1M in incentives to build deep liquidity on strategic pools for Fraxtal. Liquidity incentives are critical for bootstrapping a new ecosystem, and getting emissions flowing early will kickstart the flywheel. Deep liquidity is essential for ecosystem development, and Velodrome has a proven track record of attracting users, boosting economic activity, and retaining TVL. From there, organic activity from new DApps, users, and protocol integrations will sustain Fraxtal network activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction to Velodrome and Superchain Vision</strong></p>\n<p>Velodrome’s MetaDEX design is a powerful tool for bootstrapping liquidity at both the protocol level and chain layer. By bringing multiple primitives under the same roof, Velodrome provides a seamless, interactive experience for traders, protocols, and governance participants.</p>\n<p>Velodrome has a unique flywheel design (<a href=\"https://velodrome.finance/docs#\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">docs</a>). veVELO holders vote each week to direct $VELO emissions to liquidity pools. In exchange, voters receive 100% of swap fees and protocol incentives from the pools they vote for, creating a self-balancing mechanism that drives $VELO rewards to the most productive pools. Protocols and chains can bootstrap liquidity for their pools by depositing voting incentives. The trading volume supported by the pools will attract additional $VELO by capturing fees for veVELO voters.</p>\n<p>Velodrome launched in June, 2022 on Optimism and has since attracted over $150M in TVL and <a href=\"https://dune.com/0xkhmer/velodrome\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">generated &gt;$9.2b</a> in trading volume.

Velodrome has one of the most engaged and educated DeFi communities, with over 13,000 veVELO addresses who participate in weekly governance.</p>\n<p>With its <a href=\"https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-superchain-30161eb0ad6b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Superchain</a> vision, Velodrome is developing the architecture to provide a liquidity layer for the interoperable, scalable Optimism stack ecosystem. Velodrome launched its first multichain implementation on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1787824312893993028\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mode</a>, reaching a TVL of ~$4.5m before VELO incentives are live.

The aim of this proposal is to help Fraxlend gain further market share and enhance its resiliency.</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n<p>RedStone is the major Oracle on Fraxtal. As the only price feeds provider, RedStone offers the two major oracle implementations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>RedStone Classic - Traditional Push model, supporting 5 major pairs at the time of writing (<a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/price-feeds\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Here</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-core\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RedStone Core</a> - Pull oracle model allowing for gas efficiency, and low-latency of price feed updates, based on attaching signed data packages to transaction call-data. The model that allowed i.e. Gearbox to grow its TVL by 10x, reaching over $400M.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our team would like to enhance Fraxlend’s resiliency by incorporating RedStone price feeds and enabling future expansions with new markets powered by RedStone (we are often the first Oracle to provide trending assets like with LRTs, Ethena, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT REDSTONE</strong></p>\n<p>RedStone is the quickest-growing Modular Oracle with clients including Venus, ListaDAO, Kinza, Pendle, Morpho, Ethena, Etherfi, Renzo, Puffer, Silo, Sommelier, Gearbox, Frax, Swell, Angle and 70+ other companies. Our Oracles are available on 50+ chains including Fraxtal, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Merlin Chain, BOB, Blast, TON, Mode and many more.</p>\n<p>RedStone’s mission is to enable DeFi protocols and dApp’s builders to reach their full potential with versatile, gas-optimized and robust price feeds delivered cross-chain. Our team consists of seasoned engineers with an average of 15+ years of dev experience and a hard-working BD &amp; Marketing team supporting partner protocols at every step: conferences, Twitter spaces, targeted intros, etc. Our technology has been acknowledged by the leading figures in the crypto space, we are proud to be backed by the most renowned Web3 Entrepreneurs such as Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon), Alex Gluchovski (zkSync), Emin Gün Sirer (Avalanche), Richard Ma (Quantstamp) and VCs like Lemniscap, Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain Capital, Maven11, Distributed Global, Lattice Fund and others.</p>\n<p>Our tech-first approach allows us to be a leader in LRT &amp; LST price feeds and provide Oracles for blue chip assets, LP and staked tokens and numerous trending tokens. We are the first oracle to create price feeds for weETH (Etherfi) and ezETH (Renzo), STONE (StakeStone) and numerous other assets.</p>\n<p><strong>PROPOSAL</strong></p>\n<p>Integrating <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd60c54115C19e0c6360AD4762B88BB8076D50a8#readProxyContract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sfrxETH / ETH</a> price feed on Ethereum mainnet into Fraxlend. The feed is configured with a 0.5% deviation threshold and 6 hours heartbeat. The price discovery is set by multiplying the frxETH / ETH market price by the sfrxETH / frxETH contract’s ratio provided by Frax.</p>\n<p><strong>BENEFITS TO FRAXLEND</strong></p>\n<p>By accepting the proposal Fraxlend is going to benefit in a number of ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrating the feed would increase Fraxlend’s oracle robustness (currently it uses only a single Curve AMM to derive the frxETH / ETH rate, whereas RedStone takes all reliable sources).</li>\n<li>RedStone would enable new markets as Fraxlend evolves.</li>\n<li>The RedStone team will support the further cross-chain expansion of Fraxlend.</li>\n<li>The integration would be a step for Frax DAO eligibility for the possible future RedStone rewards after TGE.</li>\n<li>Further supporting Fraxlend on the marketing and Go-To-Market front with new assets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The RedStone team is dedicated to continuing to help the Frax ecosystem in successful expansion horizontally (i.e support for Fraxtal and cross-chain deployments) and vertically (new assets at Fraxlend).</p>\n<p><strong>VOTE</strong><br>\nFor: Integrate RedStone sfrxETH / ETH Price Feed into Fraxlend on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>Against: Do nothing.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-361-integrate-redstone-sfrxeth-eth-price-feed-into-fraxlend-on-ethereum/3078\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-361-integrate-redstone-sfrxeth-eth-price-feed-into-fraxlend-on-ethereum/3078","pubDate":"Tue, 28 May 2024 16:48:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3078"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-361-integrate-redstone-sfrxeth-eth-price-feed-into-fraxlend-on-ethereum/3078.rss","#text":"[FIP - 361] Integrate RedStone sfrxETH / ETH Price Feed into Fraxlend on Ethereum"}},{"title":"Proposal to Frax - Enhancing Security and Trust with ChainPatrol","dc:creator":"DaveScalzo","category":"Miscellaneous","description":"<p>Date: 24.05.2024</p>\n<h3><a name=\"requested-amount-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#requested-amount-1\"></a>Requested Amount:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>36,000 USD ($3,000 USD/mo) for 1 Year Contract</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"objective-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#objective-2\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/clipboard.png?v=12\" title=\":clipboard:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":clipboard:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Objective:</h3>\n<hr>\n<p>ChainPatrol is a Real-Time Security Platform that aims to detect, block and manage takedowns of active malicious threats targeting Frax Finance, keeping the community and organization safe from bad actors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"description-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#description-3\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/clipboard.png?v=12\" title=\":clipboard:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":clipboard:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <strong>Description:</strong></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>As Frax continues to grow and scale, bad actors have an increasing incentive to target the community, organization, and staff members.

Any token with an approved data feed can be lent to borrowers or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.</p>\n<p>Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, Frax has deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.</p>\n<p>Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.</p>\n<p>Inverse Finance is the decentralized autonomous organization that develops and manages the FiRM fixed rate lending protocol, DOLA, its debt-backed, decentralized stablecoin, and sDOLA, the yield-bearing version of DOLA. Originally founded by Nour Haridy in late 2020, the protocol is governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, a collective of crypto enthusiasts. Our code base is open source and maintained by the community.</p>\n<p>sDOLA is a yield-bearing version of Inverse Finance’s DOLA stablecoin which currently generates a 30-day average yield of over 12.52% via revenues from its FiRM fixed rate lending market. sDOLA uses a custom price feed that utilizes the DOLA/FraxPyusd pool and Curve EMA to price DOLA. By adding it to Fraxlend, we can enable the minting and backing of even more FRAX and expand DOLA lending capacity against sFRAX on FiRM.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-3\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Authorize Fraxlend AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the mentioned Fraxlend pair with the mentioned max authorized allocation.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-360-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-a-new-pair-sdola-frax-variable-rate/3071\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-360-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-a-new-pair-sdola-frax-variable-rate/3071","pubDate":"Tue, 21 May 2024 19:54:24 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3071"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-360-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-a-new-pair-sdola-frax-variable-rate/3071.rss","#text":"[FIP - 360] Authorize Fraxlend AMO for a new pair (sDOLA/FRAX - Variable Rate)"}},{"title":"Frax DAO Grant for THE DEFI CLUB May 2024","dc:creator":"FraxGod.eth","category":"Miscellaneous","description":"<h3><a name=\"h-1-overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#h-1-overview-1\"></a>1.

FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXBs allow the formation of a yield curve to price the time value of lending FRAX back to the protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.</p>\n<p>Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.</p>\n<p>Adding new FXBs is beneficial as it expands the FRAX ecosystem’s offerings, enhances liquidity, and provides users with additional tools for managing risk and optimizing investment strategies. Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-4\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For: Authorize the issuance of FXBs with a 30 million cap for each bond and authorize Fraxlend AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the specified Fraxlend pairs with the mentioned max authorized allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Against: Do nothing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-355-357-launching-new-fxbs-and-authorizing-fraxlend-amo-for-new-pairs-fxb-20251231-fxb-20291231-fxb-20551231/3043\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-355-357-launching-new-fxbs-and-authorizing-fraxlend-amo-for-new-pairs-fxb-20251231-fxb-20291231-fxb-20551231/3043","pubDate":"Fri, 26 Apr 2024 19:40:00 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3043"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-355-357-launching-new-fxbs-and-authorizing-fraxlend-amo-for-new-pairs-fxb-20251231-fxb-20291231-fxb-20551231/3043.rss","#text":"[FIP - 355, ... ,357] Launching new FXBs and Authorizing Fraxlend AMO for new pairs ( FXB_20251231, FXB_20291231, FXB_20551231)"}},{"title":"[FIP - 358] Authorize Strategic POL frxETH/ETH L1 Allocation to YieldNest's ynETH 7x booster vault","dc:creator":"DeoBrands","category":"AMOs","description":"<h2><a name=\"authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#authors-1\"></a>Authors</h2>\n<p>YieldNest Core Team</p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal advocates for the allocation of Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) in frxETH/ETH L1 to the YieldNest <a href=\"https://docs.yieldnest.finance/protocol-design/yieldnests-nlrts-and-lrts/yneth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ynETH</a> (<a href=\"https://docs.yieldnest.finance/security/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Audited by Chain Security</a>) 7x boosted vault.
