Therefore, when lending sFRAX via AMO Frax Finance can be assured of profitability regardless of how much money it deposits in the pool.</p>\n<p><strong>Positives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guaranteed AMO Profitability:</strong> As long as there are no liquidations that take on bad debt, Frax AMO’s will need less managing because FRAX lent into the pool will always be earning more than Frax’s cost of capital</li>\n<li><strong>More liquidity:</strong> For lenders, the sFRAX pools can be thought of as restaking lending pools that allow them to return additional yield on-top of the existing yield they’re already generating from sFRAX. As a result, I’d expect a decent portion of the $47m to be deposited as liquidity.</li>\n<li><strong>Cheaper Borrowing:</strong> Lower borrowing rates because the borrower doesn’t need to subsidize the entire unlent portion of the pool. All unlent sFRAX is still appreciating in value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Negatives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Fraxlend Revenue:</strong> Fraxlend won’t profit off of the intrinsic borrowing cost associated with sFrax, so if the lending rate is functionally 8% Fraxlend will only earn fees on 8 – sFRAX Rate = 2%.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher Gas Fees:</strong> Borrowers will need to unwrap sFRAX for FRAX anytime they want to borrow money.</li>\n<li><strong>Less Clear Borrowing Cost:</strong> The real borrowing cost is abstracted from the user but this can be resolved in the future with a minor UI change.</li>\n<li><strong>No Frax AMO Support:</strong> Frax AMOs don’t directly support sFRAX but they are largely manually managed, so I don’t think the conversion should be problematic. If this is untrue, please let me know in the comments.</li>\n<li><strong>Frax AMO impact on sFRAX yield:</strong> The sFRAX contract does not have functionality to ignore a portion of minted sFRAX when distributing profits, so all AMO Minted sFRAX would receive a portion of profits reducing the underlying sFRAX yield. This could be offset on a 1-week behind basis by adding all profits held by unlent sFRAX back to the sFRAX contract.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Additional Details:</strong> The Fraxlend Fees for sFRAX pools can be raised to account for the lower revenue if we want.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Profile:</strong><br>\nsFRAX is always losslessly convertible to FRAX, so it shares it’s liquidity profile. The Max LTV is identical to that of the sfrxEth pool, so that shouldn’t be a concern.</p>\n<p><strong>Curve Details:</strong> To account for the underlying sFRAX yield, we’ll need to create a new significantly less step Curve. I would suggest a curve where the Borrow limit linearly increases from 0.5% to 4% until hitting 85% utilization, at which point if would mimic the behavior of the Variable 2 curve.</p>\n<p><strong>Closing Thoughts:</strong></p>\n<p>I believe that in the future a significant portion of debt will be denominated in term of the yield-generating primitive much like real-world loans are denominated in terms of SOFR, so we should try to get ahead of the curve.</p>\n<p><strong>Voting:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For:</strong> Approve the creation of the sfrxETH/sFRAX Fraxlend pair on Ethereum Mainnet with the specified max authorized allocation, new curve, and max LTV</li>\n<li><strong>Against:</strong> Do not approve the creation of the new Fraxlend pair.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-xxx-create-new-sfrxeth-sfrax-fraxlend-pair/3263\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-xxx-create-new-sfrxeth-sfrax-fraxlend-pair/3263","pubDate":"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 17:54:35 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3263"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-xxx-create-new-sfrxeth-sfrax-fraxlend-pair/3263.rss","#text":"[FIP - XXX] Create new sfrxEth/sFRAX Fraxlend Pair"}},{"title":"Define Head of Ecosystem for Frax","dc:creator":"boz_m","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>This is an open question to consolidate a better understanding of the Frax ecosystem for future proposers who are looking to contribute and be a value add to the community.</p>\n<p>Does Frax need an ecosystem lead?

I’m also currently a core member of the CVX5 and recognise the challenges that new protocols and DAOs face when integrating into the DeFi ecosystem. My first purchase of Frax share was just under $5 in October 2021. I have since then been following, voting on FXS snapshot proposals and keeping upto date with the changes and developments.</p>\n<p>As an early investor and active member of the Convex &amp; Frax community. Frax has been one of the frontrunners in the DeFi space. With the recent launch of Fraxtal, forging strategic partnerships to enhance liquidity and Total Value Locked (TVL) has become a top priority. I propose the creation of a Head of Ecosystem Development position.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>The Head of Ecosystem Development will involve engaging and fostering relationships with DeFi protocols and crypto companies, with a focus on GCC countries; Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with the potential to expand to ASEAN countries.</p>\n<p>Dubai is rapidly emerging as a leading hub for crypto enterprises, and continues to accelerate with many crypto firms from the UK and Europe relocating to the UAE. This is driven by a favourable regulatory environment led by Abu Dhabi, an established financial sector, and strong commitment to innovation.</p>\n<p>As Dubai continues in attracting top talent from around the globe, the GCC Ecosystem Lead will be instrumental in building strategic partnerships and ensuring Fraxtal Chain’s growth in this rapidly thriving market.</p>\n<p><strong>Duties:</strong></p>\n<p>Identify and Secure Partnerships: Engage with DeFi protocols, blockchain projects, and crypto companies within GCC countries to establish strategic partnerships.</p>\n<p>Conduct Market Research: Analyse the crypto and DeFi landscape in the GCC countries, identifying trends, opportunities, and potential risks to inform strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>Lead Face-to-Face Meetings: Organise and participate in direct meetings with key people, to discuss collaboration opportunities.</p>\n<p>Develop and Implement Business Strategies: Create and execute strategies to expand Fraxtal Chain’s presence in the UAE, targeting key industry players and positioning the platform for growth.</p>\n<p>Build Relationships with Relocating Companies: Focus on companies from the UK and Europe that are moving to Dubai, establishing Fraxtal Chain as a key partner in their transition.</p>\n<p>Enhance Brand Visibility: Represent Fraxtal Chain at industry events, conferences, and meetups in Dubai and the UAE to increase brand recognition and network with potential partners.</p>\n<p>Report on Progress: Provide regular updates to the executive team on the status of business development efforts, including partnership successes, challenges, and market insights. Also work closely with the Head of Community Development.</p>\n<p>Drive Ecosystem Growth: Work to integrate new DeFi protocols and applications onto Fraxtal Chain, by visiting the crypto hubs, expanding the ecosystem’s functionality and user base.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strategic Partnerships: Establish at least 3 key strategic partnerships with leading DeFi protocols and blockchain projects within the first 3 months that will use Fraxlend and pair with Frax pools on curve.</li>\n<li>Ecosystem Expansion: Onboard at least 3 new DeFi protocols onto Fraxtal Chain within the first 3 months, increasing the platform’s functionality and TVL.</li>\n<li>Brand Visibility: Represent Fraxtal Chain at a minimum of 3 industry events, focusing on networking and promotion to boost brand recognition. Secure media coverage and build relationships with key industry players to enhance the platform’s visibility and reputation.</li>\n<li>Growth Metrics: Achieve a 30% increase in Fraxtal Chain’s user base and a 20% increase in TVL within the first 3 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Previous Successes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CVX5 Group Leadership: As a core member of the CVX5 group, I have played a key role in driving strategic decisions that have led to significant growth in the Curve/Convex ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Frax Community Engagement: My early investment and active participation in the Frax community have provided me with deep insights into the DeFi space, allowing me to contribute to the platform’s success.</li>\n<li>Binance Affiliate Success: As an early user and referral affiliate member of Binance, I contributed to the platform’s rapid growth and adoption during its early stages by referring thousands of people to the exchange.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Salary</strong></p>\n<p>4K Frax distributed every two weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel Expenses</strong></p>\n<p>Travel expenses will be covered on an ad hoc basis for specific events and meetings that require in-person attendance.</p>\n<p>This includes:</p>\n<p>Flights: Economy class airfare will be covered for necessary travel to events, conferences, or partner meetings.</p>\n<p>Accommodation: Reasonable hotel expenses will be covered for the duration of approved trips.</p>\n<p>Ground transportation: Costs for taxis, ride-sharing services, or public transit to/from airports and event venues will be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Per diem: A daily allowance will be provided to cover meals and incidental expenses during approved travel.</p>\n<p>To request coverage of travel expenses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Submit a brief proposal outlining the event/meeting details and expected outcomes</li>\n<li>Obtain approval from the Frax Finance team prior to booking</li>\n<li>Submit receipts and an expense report for reimbursement after the trip expense report for reimbursement after the trip</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goal is to be judicious with travel expenses while ensuring in-person representation at key events that can drive meaningful partnerships and ecosystem growth. Virtual meetings will be utilised when possible to minimise costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Commitment</strong></p>\n<p>37.5 hours of dedicated time per week. Does not include additional time spent after hours meetings and if support ASEAN regions, which will require a lot of travel.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract Terms</strong></p>\n<p>Duration: A 3-month probationary period.</p>\n<p>Review: Re-apply directly with Frax Finance at the end of the term if the Frax Finance team is satisfied with the results.</p>\n<p><strong>Closing Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Today, I signed up for the Frax Governance Forum and am excited to make my first post here. Some of you may have seen my posts on X (Twitter), where I’ve been actively supporting Frax for years. I’ve been rallying votes for Snapshot from Convex and Clever lockers on Telegram, recently helping the latest [Frax] [FIP-398] reach quorum.</p>\n<p>This role differs from [Head of Community Development] as it involves visiting offices and traveling to meet with teams directly. My focus will be on understanding their projects firsthand and exploring how FRAX can benefit. It’s a more hands-on, on-the-ground role compared to an online presence.</p>\n<p>As a crypto enthusiast since 2017 and an early investor in Frax, I have closely followed the evolution of the DeFi space, particularly within the Curve, Convex and Frax ecosystem. My experience as a core member of CVX5 and my deep understanding of the challenges faced by new protocols and DAOs have equipped me with the insights necessary to drive growth and innovation within Frax.</p>\n<p>With Frax emerging as one of the leaders in DeFi and the recent launch of Fraxtal, I believe the creation of a Head of Ecosystem Development role is essential. My proposal focuses on engaging with DeFi protocols and crypto companies, particularly in the rapidly growing GCC region, with the potential to expand to ASEAN markets.</p>\n<p>As Dubai continues to attract top talent and crypto enterprises, the GCC Ecosystem Lead will play a pivotal role in forging strategic partnerships, enhancing liquidity, and driving the growth of Fraxtal Chain. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Frax’s success and look forward to working closely with the community to achieve our shared goals.</p>\n<p>I have taken feedback from some FRAX core team members before creating this proposal.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/MrKKhann\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@MrKKhann</a></p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/head-of-ecosystem-development/3257\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/head-of-ecosystem-development/3257","pubDate":"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 06:26:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3257"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/head-of-ecosystem-development/3257.rss","#text":"Head of Ecosystem Development"}},{"title":"[FIP - XXX] Create new ETH+ Fraxlend pairs","dc:creator":"MichaelHenry","category":"Fraxlend","description":"<p><strong>Authors:</strong><br>\nMichael Henry</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>\nPropose the creation of 2 new Fraxlend pairs on the Ethereum Mainnet: ETH+/FRAX and ETH+/WETH</p>\n<p><strong>Pair 1 Details:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fraxlend Pair Name 1:</strong> ETH+/WETH Variable Rate V2</li>\n<li><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum Mainnet</li>\n<li><strong>Max Loan-to-Value (LTV)</strong>: 90%</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pair 2 Details:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fraxlend Pair Name 1:</strong> ETH+/FRAX Variable Rate V2</li>\n<li><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum Mainnet</li>\n<li><strong>Max Authorized Allocation:</strong> $5,000,000 FRAX</li>\n<li><strong>Max Loan-to-Value (LTV)</strong>: 85% (consistent with existing sfrxETH/USDC pair)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Background and Motivation:</strong><br>\nETHPlus is diversified ETH LST currently backed by 1/3rd sfrxEth, 1/3 wstEth, and 1/3rd rEth.

The following points are important to note about this proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pricing Based on Underlying Assets:</strong> The pricing for the locked liquidity will be based on the current price of the underlying assets at the time of the exchange.</li>\n<li><strong>Exchange with LFXB2027:</strong> Locked liquidity can be exchanged for LFXB2027 at the auction price prevailing at the time of the exchange. An LP that wishes to migrate can sign the migration transaction on the Ethereum mainnet and move their LP token/NFT to the protocol to receive LFXB2027 tokens directly to the same address on the Fraxtal mainnet.</li>\n<li><strong>Extra Option Alongside FXB2029:</strong> It is important to emphasize that LFXB2027 is being introduced as an additional option. Liquidity providers still have the choice to exit their locked positions through FXB2029, ensuring that they can select the exit strategy that best suits their needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Designated Locked Liquidity for Exchange:</strong> Only certain designated pools will be eligible for this exchange option, but this list can be expanded through the governance process.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pool</th>\n<th>Gauge Address</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/USDC</td>\n<td>0x3EF26504dbc8Dd7B7aa3E97Bc9f3813a9FC0B4B0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/DAI</td>\n<td>0xF22471AC2156B489CC4a59092c56713F813ff53e</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li><strong>Option to Retain LPs:</strong> Liquidity providers will have the option to either exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 or LFXB2027 or retain their current locked positions.</li>\n<li>No Ragequit Fee: There will be no Ragequit fee for liquidity providers choosing this exchange method, ensuring a cost-effective transition.</li>\n<li><strong>FXTL points:</strong> Migrators that receive LFXB2027 for their positions will be entitled to all FXTL points multipliers for all LFXB2027 holders, making it a high-yield opportunity within the Frax ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>TimedLocker for FXBs:</strong> The TimedLocker allows liquidity providers to stake their FXB tokens in exchange for fixed-rate FXS rewards, with the total amount of FXB stakable being capped. Locked positions are transferable as vault tokens, enabling users to sell or transfer their stakes without waiting for the lock period to end. Once the set ending timestamp is reached, all positions become unlockable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-6941-voting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6941-voting-5\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Approve the option for liquidity providers to exchange their locked liquidity for LFXB2027 at the auction price.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-396-adding-lfxb2027-as-an-option-for-locked-liquidity-exit/3242\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-396-adding-lfxb2027-as-an-option-for-locked-liquidity-exit/3242","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:16:18 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3242"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-396-adding-lfxb2027-as-an-option-for-locked-liquidity-exit/3242.rss","#text":"[FIP - 396] Adding LFXB2027 as an Option for Locked Liquidity Exit"}},{"title":"[FIP - 397] Frax Finance Annual Budget Request (2024 - 2025)","dc:creator":"amirnader","category":"FIPs","description":"<h3><a name=\"p-6931-authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-authors-1\"></a>Authors</h3>\n<p>Frax Core Team</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6931-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-summary-2\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal seeks to authorize a revised maximum annual budget of <strong>4,100,000 FRAX</strong> for Frax Finance for the fiscal year 2024-2025. The revised budget reflects significant cuts across various categories to ensure financial prudence while continuing to support essential operations and initiatives. The budget is intended to cover four key categories: Development &amp; Operation, Security, Legal &amp; Compliance, and Fraxtal Growth under the Fraxtal Builders Program. Please note that this is a maximum cap, and it is highly likely that not all of it will be used, as we only spent 5,123,990 FRAX last year out of the 9,000,000 FRAX budget that we had during the last fiscal year.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6931-background-and-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-background-and-motivation-3\"></a>Background and motivation</h2>\n<p>As Frax Finance continues to grow and evolve, this budget supports our core operations while enabling strategic growth within the Fraxtal ecosystem. The allocation focuses on maintaining our development and operational capacity, ensuring security, managing legal and compliance obligations, and selectively supporting key initiatives within the Fraxtal ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6931-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-details-4\"></a>Details</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6931-budget-categories-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-budget-categories-5\"></a>Budget Categories</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Development and Operation:</strong> This budget will be used to cover the costs associated with the development and operation of the Frax Finance protocol. This could include salaries for developers, costs of new feature development, maintenance costs, infrastructure costs, and other operational expenses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security (Audits and Bug Bounty):</strong> This budget is allocated to maintaining the security of the Frax Finance protocol. This includes the costs of regular security audits by external firms, running a bug bounty program to incentivize the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities and other measures to ensure the safety and trust of our community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Legal and Compliance:</strong> This budget covers legal and compliance costs to ensure that Frax Finance operates within the legal framework. This could include fees for legal counsel, regulatory compliance costs, potential legal disputes, and other related expenses. Notably, Frax Finance has not encountered any significant legal issues to date, and last year, we spent less than 5% of the allotted legal budget. This allocation remains in place to ensure we are prepared for any unforeseen legal requirements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fraxtal Ecosystem Grants (Fraxtal Builders Program):</strong> This new budget category aims to support the growth of the Fraxtal ecosystem through the Fraxtal Builders Program. Although limited, this budget supports critical initiatives within the Fraxtal ecosystem, focusing on strategic growth and development. And it can be boosted by allocating Frax Finance grants from Superchain grant programs.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6931-budget-allocation-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-budget-allocation-6\"></a>Budget Allocation</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Budget Share Percentage</th>\n<th>Proposed Budget (2024 - 2025)</th>\n<th>Frax Finance Latest Annual Budget (2023 - 2024)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Development and Operation</td>\n<td>73.2%</td>\n<td>$3,000,000</td>\n<td>$3,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Security</td>\n<td>9.8%</td>\n<td>$400,000</td>\n<td>$1,400,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grants</td>\n<td>0.0%</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$600,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reserve Emergency Fund</td>\n<td>0.0%</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$1,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Legal and Compliance</td>\n<td>12.2%</td>\n<td>$500,000</td>\n<td>$3,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fraxtal Ecosystem Grants</td>\n<td>4.9%</td>\n<td>$200,000</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$4,100,000</td>\n<td>$9,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-6931-additional-notes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-additional-notes-7\"></a>Additional Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This proposal represents the maximum caps for each category, not necessarily the exact amounts that will be used.</li>\n<li>This proposal does not cover the costs of liquidity incentivization.

The goal is to provide sufficient liquidity for FRAX in order to overcome supply-side shortages in lending, thereby fostering growth on the borrowing side. By kickstarting the market for larger borrowers, we aim to create a more dynamic and robust lending environment for FRAX on Morpho and deeper connection in the short term with Usual. Oracle choice will be decided with the Frax team.</p>\n<p>Usual will incentivize the FRAX side with the same conditions as all other lending markets. (USD0++/USDC and CurveLP (USD0/USD0++)/USDC) Those pills will be given to the Frax Treasury. (1 pills per dollar + 5 bonus pills for each newly USD0++minted).</p>\n<p>The markets have not been created yet and will be established in collaboration with the Frax team. The default parameter applied is a maximum of 86% LTV. After the integration, Usual will also create a FRAX/USD0 pool on Curve to simplify the loops.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-6859-voting-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6859-voting-6\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<p>• For: Approve the Frax AMO integration with a max authorized allocation of 50,000,000 FRAX on MetaMorpho Vault.

The platform is designed to cater to both web2 and web3 users.</p>\n<p>It enables users to shop at over 2000+ supported web2 retailers including Walmart, Marriott, and eBay to earn in the crypto asset of their choice. Additionally, Moso offers a custom, white-labeled shopping experience for web3 brands where users can earn up to 100% cash back or more exclusively in the ecosystem’s native token. For <a href=\"https://shop.galxe.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Galxe Shop</a>, the rewards are partially funded by both the merchant and Galxe.</p>\n<p>Moso has seen <strong>$500,000+</strong> in purchases, registered <strong>100,000+</strong> sign-ups, and distributed <strong>$200,000+</strong> in crypto rewards back to users.</p>\n<p>Moso aims to work directly with Frax to provide $FXS cash-back rewards in a Frax Shop, powered By Moso.</p>\n<p>We’re thrilled about the opportunity to integrate deeply into the Frax ecosystem as the only retail shop to earn cash back experience fully distributed in $FXS.</p>\n<p><strong>How are the cash-back rewards distributed?</strong></p>\n<p>Moso requests a token allocation from Frax to boost cash back rates, on top of the fixed cash back rates paid to Moso by the Web2 merchants for driving purchases to these retailers.</p>\n<p>Increased rates will only sometimes be available. Boosted cash back rates of as much as 100% back in $FXS at selected merchants will be deployed from time to time allowing users to find amazing shopping deals that they otherwise would not have access to. In this scenario, the rewards are partially funded by both the merchant and Frax.</p>\n<p>When boosted rates are not being deployed, web2 merchants distribute cash back to Moso. Moso converts the fiat cash-back to tokens on the backend for distribution to eligible users. In this scenario, the merchant fully funds the rewards.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, users will always be earning cash back in $FXS.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/5MNjJpUDBHut3vVunb1SH6XxdGu.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.43\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926_2_690x290.jpeg\" alt=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.43\" data-base62-sha1=\"5MNjJpUDBHut3vVunb1SH6XxdGu\" width=\"690\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926_2_690x290.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926_2_1035x435.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"363C4C\"></a></div><br>\nScreenshot when boosted rates are available.<p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pS9idoEOL8JGuLSHC519MbuynJj.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.47\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445_2_690x353.jpeg\" alt=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.47\" data-base62-sha1=\"pS9idoEOL8JGuLSHC519MbuynJj\" width=\"690\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445_2_690x353.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445_2_1035x529.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"434750\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Screenshot when boosted rates are not available.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6843-how-can-a-white-labeled-shop-benefit-frax-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6843-how-can-a-white-labeled-shop-benefit-frax-2\"></a><strong>How can a white-labeled shop benefit Frax?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Powering Transactions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase user engagement and value.</li>\n<li>A great way to get new users onboarded to Frax and Fraxtal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fiat Integration:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seamless integration of fiat currency into tokens, enhancing token utility and value.

Throughout all of this, Frax can identify valuable, active ecosystem users with a real-world use case. This data can be leveraged in any marketing campaign Frax executes moving forward to continue to capture market share among users.</p>\n<p>Moso plans to distribute loyalty points to users in parallel with the higher cash-back rates in $FXS. Loyalty points can be earned by users continuing to visit the Frax Shop to Earn page daily. To include additional gamification methods, points will also be distributed from purchases at retailers and for engaging with different Frax ecosystem dapps/DeFi integrations.</p>\n<p>Moso also acts as a gateway for users to discover Frax’s best applications and DeFi integrations. Moso will work with the Frax team to understand which applications to highlight on the Frax Shop alongside retailers.</p>\n<p>By engaging with dapps and executing an on-chain action, the user will qualify for points and cash back. Cash-back rewards by engaging with Fraxtal dapps are TBD as that discussion will take place with the application since it revolves around the kickback the dapp can give in return for the conversion. This is the perfrect fit for dapps who already have a referral program in place or are in need of a referral program.</p>\n<p>Each shopping trip will power up to three on-chain transactions on Fraxtal for users engaging with the Frax Shop.

The absence of both stablecoin alternatives and USD yield-bearing assets on TRON presents a great opportunity for FRAX and sFRAX to shine in this market. FRAX can offer a stable, decentralized alternative to USDT, while sFRAX can meet the demand for yield-bearing assets, providing users with more options for earning returns on their holdings.</p>\n<p>Fraxferry aims to simplify the cross-chain bridging issue for assets, making it easier to deploy Frax-related tokens on other chains.

FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXBs allow the formation of a yield curve to price the time value of lending FRAX back to the protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.</p>\n<p>Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.</p>\n<p>Adding new FXBs is beneficial as it expands the FRAX ecosystem’s offerings, enhances liquidity, and provides users with additional tools for managing risk and optimizing investment strategies. Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-4\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For: Authorize the issuance of FXB20271231 with a 30 million cap and authorize Fraxlend AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the specified Fraxlend pair with the mentioned max authorized allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Against: Do nothing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-384-launching-new-fxb-and-authorizing-fraxlend-amo-for-a-new-pair-fxb20271231/3167\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-384-launching-new-fxb-and-authorizing-fraxlend-amo-for-a-new-pair-fxb20271231/3167","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 23:21:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3167"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-384-launching-new-fxb-and-authorizing-fraxlend-amo-for-a-new-pair-fxb20271231/3167.rss","#text":"[FIP - 384] Launching new FXB and Authorizing Fraxlend AMO for a new pair ( FXB20271231)"}}]}}}
