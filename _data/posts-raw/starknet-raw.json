In addition, we make some necessary adjustments in order to prepare for the transition to a Starknet p2p network between nodes that will happen in a later version. We proceed to describe the version highlights.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"sequencer-parallelization-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#sequencer-parallelization-2\"></a>Sequencer parallelization</h2>\n<p>We‚Äôre reintroducing optimistic parallelization to the new rust-based Starknet sequencer. The gist of optimistic parallelization is to execute transactions in parallel as long as we don‚Äôt find a dependency between them. You can read more about optimistic parallelization <a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/optimistic-parallelization-revived/114121#optimistic-parallelization-revived-1\">here</a>. The improvement factor obviously depends on the nature of the common txs on the network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"starknet-applicative-recursion-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#starknet-applicative-recursion-3\"></a>Starknet applicative recursion</h2>\n<p>SHARP works in the resolution of proof trains, each train consists of a tree whose leaves are jobs, each corresponding to a Cairo program that needs proving (in the case of Starknet, this is the Starknet OS). The final proof that reaches L1 is a recursive proof for all the leaves in the tree. Unlike verification of the proof on L1 which is shared among all the jobs in the train, there is a fixed cost per job for e.g. recording the associated fact, or publishing data which is done separately for each job. So far, each Starknet block was sent as a separate job. This limited our ability to squash state diffs over several blocks, and prevented us from having a short fixed-time block interval (since in the current architecture, each block publishes one blob, so short enough block times will lead to severe blob under-utilization). Even more importantly, this meant a high fixed cost per block (fact recording on-chain and state-update on the Core contract).</p>\n<p>To overcome the above issues, we want to have only one fact recorded on-chain, attesting to many Starknet blocks. We refer to this feature as ‚ÄúStarknet applicative recursion‚Äù. The idea is, to generate the recursive proof on the Starknet side, and only send one final job for SHARP. For each block, we‚Äôll ask SHARP for a proof of that block, but without the recording on-chain part. Given the proofs, we‚Äôll construct a final recursive job that attests to all the blocks, and squashes all the state diffs between them.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"new-block-hash-definition-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#new-block-hash-definition-4\"></a>New block hash definition</h2>\n<p>To prepare for the future transition to p2p communication (as opposed to relying on the centralized sequencer block publications), we‚Äôre making sure that the block hash structure is robust in the sense that it allows nodes to verify all the data given by peers without being susceptible to DOS.</p>\n<p>This change will affect full nodes, and will not be seen externally (past block hashes naturally remain unchanged). You can find a reference implementation to the new block hash calculation in the <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-api/tree/15219992b54b170dcf80fa5cceab56847ea2f7f0/src/block_hash\">starknet-api</a> crate.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"api-changes-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#api-changes-5\"></a>API Changes</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"fgw-requestresponse-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#fgw-requestresponse-6\"></a>FGW request/response</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Block hash definition will change as discussed above, this will affect all endpoints returning the block hash (the response structure remains the same)</li>\n<li>Fix bug where state diff hash used for signatures is affected by 0 length state diff.</li>\n<li>Receipts will get a new total_gas_consumed property, that will only appear in new transactions after 0.13.2.

To copy from the <a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-2024-roadmap-plan-of-intent/113006\">first 2024 roadmap post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Starknet v0.13.3 will feature a joint effort with <a href=\"https://www.nethermind.io/\">Nethermind </a> to integrate the state-of-the-art <a href=\"https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo_native\">Cairo-native </a> project by <a href=\"https://lambdaclass.com/\">LambdaClass </a> into the sequencer. This is some <s>next level @#$%</s> truly state-of-the-art technology. Here‚Äôs the story. Currently, the sequencer executes transactions using the <a href=\"https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-vm\">Cairo VM </a> (efficiently implemented in Rust by LambdaClass too). The VM effectively emulates another machine, which begs the question: can we circumvent any emulation to improve performance? Turns out the answer is ‚Äúvery very yes‚Äù if you‚Äôre blessed with a disturbing amount of brainpower. Enter Cairo-native, which lets the sequencer completely bypass the VM and execute native CPU opcodes. Dark magic, you say? Correct! Behind the scenes, Cairo-native is a Sierra‚ÜíMLIR compiler; the sequencer will use it to compile declared Cairo classes to native bytecode, and run the latter during transaction execution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only addition to make now about Cairo-native is to emphasize that faster execution will further improve confirmation times. Alongside it, we mention some more feature ideas that are on the cards for v0.13.3 but yet to be decided.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"v0140-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#v0140-3\"></a>v0.14.0</h1>\n<p>Everything here is TBD. It‚Äôs too early to decide now.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"summary-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#summary-4\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>Huge improvements to confirmation times are coming in v0.13.2, and more improvements to UX and devX are on the menu. Stay tuned and contribute! Got questions? Ask! Got ideas? Suggest! We would love feature ideas from you folks! It can be a cool use-case, a concrete feature, or a vague fantasy.

Similarly to Ethereum, Starknet‚Äôs json-rpc allows you to filter over event keys via the <code>starknet_getEvents</code> method.</p>\n<p>In this SNIP we suggest updating StarkGate‚Äôs ERC20s (including ETH, STRK, USDC <a href=\"https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-addresses/blob/master/bridged_tokens/mainnet.json\">and others</a>) to index more fields in the <code>Transfer</code> and <code>Approval</code> events in order to allow filtration over the sender or receiver.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Dapps, for example exchanges that operate on Starknet, need to track transfers from &amp; to specific addresses. At the moment, Starknet‚Äôs json-rpc only allows receiving all <code>Transfer</code> or <code>Approval</code> events from a given ERC20 in a particular block range. This SNIP would enable filtering those events, allowing filteration by <code>from</code> or <code>to</code> in <code>Transfer</code> events and by <code>owner</code> or <code>spender</code> in <code>Approval</code> events.</p>\n<p>This is already the case on Ethereum and other EVM chains. Due to limitations in early iterations of Cairo, events had only one key corresponding to the event name. This lead to only being able to filter over all transfer events, which is far from ideal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"backward-compatability-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#backward-compatability-3\"></a>Backward Compatability</h2>\n<p><strong>This change is NOT backward compatible</strong>.

Despite the decentralized nature of these organizations, there is a notable reluctance among community members to participate in governance. The primary issue stems from the transparency of voting actions on the blockchain, which can expose sensitive information and influence decision-making processes.</p>\n<p><em>Votes are conducted publicly, leaving voting systems vulnerable to collusion.</em></p>\n<p>Starknet Governance Hub, designed to facilitate transparent and efficient governance. However, despite these efforts, participation rates remain lower than desired. Our team, with extensive experience in building governance platforms like Frontinus House for Realm, has identified privacy concerns as a significant barrier to active engagement.</p>\n<p>ZK Governance provides a solution to this challenge by using zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that voting is private, secure, and verifiable without revealing voters‚Äô identities or choices. By integrating ZK Governance into Starknet‚Äôs existing governance platform, we can enhance privacy and security, thereby increasing participation rates and strengthening the overall governance of DAOs within the Starknet ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problems-with-current-solutions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#problems-with-current-solutions-2\"></a>Problems with Current Solutions</h2>\n<p><em>DAOs in the Starknet ecosystem currently face several challenges that hinder active participation in governance:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of Privacy: All voting actions are publicly visible on the blockchain, deterring individuals from participating due to concerns about exposing their decisions and holdings.</li>\n<li>Fear of Repercussions: Members may hesitate to vote on controversial issues for fear of social or financial backlash.</li>\n<li>Transparency vs. Confidentiality: The need for transparent governance conflicts with the desire to keep individual voting choices private.</li>\n<li>Influence and Bias: Public voting records can lead to undue influence or bias, where prominent members‚Äô votes sway community opinions.</li>\n<li>Low Participation Rates: The visibility of votes can discourage engagement, leading to low participation in governance processes.</li>\n<li>Data Sensitivity: Voters may not want their voting history and associated assets exposed, as this can reveal personal strategies and holdings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ZK Governance Solutions</strong></p>\n<p>ZK Governance offers a comprehensive solution to these challenges by balancing the need for transparency in governance with the privacy of individual voters. Key features of ZK Governance for Starknet DAOs include:</p>\n<p>A large-scale anonymous electronic voting scheme based on zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) offers unique value and significance in ensuring the <strong>anonymity, security, and reliability</strong> of voting. zk-SNARKs is a cryptographic technology that enables one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information other than the truth of the statement itself. Applying zk-SNARKs to electronic voting brings several key advantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Protection of Voter Identity Privacy</strong>: The connection between a voter‚Äôs choice and their personal identity is not disclosed; it‚Äôs impossible to identify from public information whether a specific voter has participated. This also enhances the fairness of the voting system.</li>\n<li><strong>Prevention of Vote Buying and Selling</strong>: Voters participate under pseudonyms and are unable to prove their own voting results. This means voters cannot sell their votes to third parties who may wish to purchase them.</li>\n<li><strong>Verifiable Voting Results</strong>: Everyone can verify the voting results based on the public counting proofs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"starknet-analysis-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#starknet-analysis-3\"></a>Starknet Analysis</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"participants-composition-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#participants-composition-4\"></a>Participants Composition</h2>\n<p>The electronic voting scheme involves the following five participants: Proposers, STRK Holders <span class=\"math\">IDs=\\{id_1,id_2, ...id_m\\}</span>, Cryptographic Coordinator, Pseudonym Registrar, and Counters <span class=\"math\">Ts=\\{T_1,T_2, ...T_m\\} </span> .

The result of this effort was the <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier\">blockifier</a>, Starknet‚Äôs new execution engine, which in turn relies on the Rust implementation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-vm\">cairo-vm</a> by Lambdaclass.</p>\n<p>Given that the transition from Python to Rust outweighed most of the potentiatal performance improvements, the first iterations of the blockifier did not contain optimistic parallelization. After a few Starknet versions that focused on stability and fee reduction, we return to parallelization in order to reach the full potential of the Starknet sequencer.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-is-optimistic-parallelization-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#what-is-optimistic-parallelization-4\"></a>What is optimistic parallelization?</h2>\n<p>Naively, executing a block of transactions in parallel is impossible as different transactions may be dependent. This is illustrated in the following example. Consider a block with three transactions from the same user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transaction A: swap USDC for ETH</li>\n<li>Transaction B: pay ETH for an NFT</li>\n<li>Transaction C: swap USDT for BTC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly, Tx A must happen before Tx B, but Tx C is entirely independent of both and can be executed in parallel. If each transaction requires 1 second to execute, then the block production time can be reduced from 3 seconds to 2 seconds by introducing parallelization.</p>\n<p>The crux of the problem is that we do not know the transaction dependencies in advance. In practice, only when we execute transaction B from our example do we see that it relies on changes made by transaction A. More formally, the dependency follows from the fact that transaction B reads from storage cells that transaction A has written to. We can think of the transactions as forming a dependency graph, where there is an edge from transaction A to transaction B iff A writes to a storage cell that is read by B, and thus has to be executed before B. The following figure shows an example of such a dependency graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/d/7/d7f32ac0707740d1b9bf477a66d3adee9cf03e1d.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"uOnDCsRQh5UPY3gnq32e8LlS3GB\" width=\"665\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<p>In the above example, each column can be executed in parallel, and this is the optimal arrangement (while naively, we would have executed transactions 1‚Äì9 sequentially).</p>\n<p>To overcome the fact that the dependency graph is not known in advance, we introduce optimistic parallelization, in the spirit of <a href=\"https://malkhi.com/posts/2022/04/block-stm/\">BLOCK-STM</a> developed by Aptos Labs, to the Starknet sequencer. Under this paradigm, we optimistically attempt to run transactions in parallel and re-execute upon finding a collision. For example, we may execute transactions 1‚Äì4 from figure 1 in parallel, only to find out afterward that Tx4 depends on Tx1. Hence, its execution was useless (we ran it relative to the same state we ran Tx1 against, while we should have run it against the state resulting from applying Tx1). In that case, we will re-execute Tx4.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"parallelization-in-the-blockifier-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#parallelization-in-the-blockifier-5\"></a>Parallelization in the blockifier</h2>\n<p>The entry point to the new parallelization infrastructure in the blockifier can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier/blob/df2799eafda4f575e71d63c839d14f5a38ca911d/crates/blockifier/src/concurrency.rs#L1\">concurrency.rs</a>. The Rust implementation follows the original BLOCK-STM paper more closely compared to the previous version of our optimistic parallelization. The scheduler tracks the tasks that remain to be done, these can be either validation tasks or execution tasks. Worker threads then query the scheduler for the next task, and communicate with a versioned state to obtain the latest known storage values. This is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/8/5/850099e3e8117db4bb9507e2b399e21e87007798.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/iYAN4uWEkZfIhfQknZ3UBA1S3ig.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/8/5/850099e3e8117db4bb9507e2b399e21e87007798_2_624x316.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"iYAN4uWEkZfIhfQknZ3UBA1S3ig\" width=\"624\" height=\"316\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/8/5/850099e3e8117db4bb9507e2b399e21e87007798_2_624x316.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/8/5/850099e3e8117db4bb9507e2b399e21e87007798_2_936x474.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/8/5/850099e3e8117db4bb9507e2b399e21e87007798_2_1248x632.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F6F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Diagram: worker threads request the next task, and work on a versioned state (version i contains the writes of tx i). The execution itself is handled by the same code that handled sequential execution.</p>\n<p>The blockifier‚Äôs implementation contains an additional commit phase that isn‚Äôt part of the original BLOCK-STM paper. The motivation for this phase is to delay fee transfers to the sequencer (which, if unhandled separately, leads any two transactions to collide due to reading &amp; writing the sequencer‚Äôs balance). If all transactions before transaction <code>i</code> are committed, then the fee transfer is applied alongside an additional check to see whether or not the transaction can fit into a block. If both tests pass, the i‚Äôth transaction is committed.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"whats-next-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#whats-next-6\"></a>What‚Äôs next</h2>\n<p>Several potential improvements to the blockifier‚Äôs implementation of BLOCK-STM will be added down the road. At the moment, accesses to VersionedState are mutually exclusive; this can be relaxed to locking only over the particular addresses that we want to read/write from.</p>\n<p>Another direction to explore is adding language features that will allow contract developers to write more ‚Äúparallelizable‚Äù code. For example, when performing a commutative operation on storage values today, one has to read the value, apply the operation, and write the new value. This means that although the underlying operation is commutative, any two transactions that perform it will have a read/write collision. If, however, the smart contract language has primitives that encapsulate ‚Äúatomic storage manipulation‚Äù, then these can be used to enhance parallelization. For example, consider u256 addition. If we want to add some value to a storage slot (as happens when updating the sequencer‚Äôs balance due to fee payments), we can call an ad-hoc <code>increment(storage_address, value)</code> operation that does not necessarily lead two transactions that apply increment to the same address to collide. Collision will only happen if the first operation results in an overflow. This direction was explored in more depth in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06117\">recent paper</a> by AptosLabs, where they introduce the notion of ‚Äúdeferred object‚Äù to the smart contract language.</p>\n<p>Finally, while mostly targeted for the sequencing layer, the parallelization infrastructure can be used by full nodes to optimize re-execution. The improvement is even more significant for nodes, since they can get the optimal ordering via the dependency graph produced by the original execution.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#summary-7\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>As of Starknet 0.13.2, parallelization is back on the menu. Parallelization, along with AOT compilation via the <a href=\"https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo_native\">cairo-native</a> project that is planned for 0.13.3, will unleash the full potential of Starknet, reaching throughput that is only possible on a validity rollup.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/optimistic-parallelization-revived/114121\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://community.starknet.io/t/optimistic-parallelization-revived/114121","pubDate":"Sun, 26 May 2024 16:51:38 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"community.starknet.io-topic-114121"},"source":{"@url":"https://community.starknet.io/t/optimistic-parallelization-revived/114121.rss","#text":"Optimistic parallelization revived"}},{"title":"SNIPs: process revival","dc:creator":"ilia","category":"üìú Development Proposals","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>SNIPs (Starknet Improvement Proposals) are the Starknet analogue of Ethereum EIPs. However, in the current state of affairs, there are aspects in which a SNIP differs from an EIP both in its purpose and in its (lack of) processing. As pointed out by the community, little attention has been devoted to the topic over the past few months. The purpose of this text is to revive the SNIP process and propose short-term improvements.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"eip-vs-snip-today-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#eip-vs-snip-today-2\"></a>EIP vs SNIP today</h1>\n<p>The fundamental difference is in handling protocol-level improvement proposals, i.e those which require protocol changes. Ethereum, being decentralized, requires ‚Äúmeta-consensus‚Äù on protocol changes among validators and subsequently among client teams. The Ethereum Foundation is a considerable driving force for EIPs, but it does not directly control block proposals. Starknet, in its currently centralized state, strictly requires involvement of the Starknet core teams in StarkWare to implement protocol changes.</p>\n<p>Since genesis, almost all protocol-level changes (e.g. version features) have not gone through the full SNIP route, having been decided internally instead. Overall we think this is sensible and justified by the need to move and add features much faster than in Ethereum. That being said, the long term objective is clear: when Starknet is decentralized and mature, the process will closely mirror the Ethereum EIP protocol.</p>\n<p>Thus we are left with the question of short-medium term: on the one hand, iterations and versions are still frequent compared to Ethereum. On the other hand, we want to step toward a SNIP process that approaches the ‚Äúreal thing‚Äù over time.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"short-medium-term-proposal-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#short-medium-term-proposal-3\"></a>Short-medium term proposal</h1>\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-1.md\">SNIP-1</a>, GitHub remains the place to submit SNIPs and is the source of truth for their documentation.

These problems led to many users departing from the ecosystem, looking for stability and reliability that were perceived as lacking.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Airdrop Using a New Unlock System:</strong></p>\n<p>To address these issues and incentivize users to rejoin and continue supporting the StarkNet ecosystem, I propose a new airdrop mechanism integrated with a sophisticated contract. This system will not only distribute tokens but will also encourage long-term engagement and investment in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Features of the Proposed Airdrop:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unlock Contract Integration:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Users will receive airdropped Strk and Eth which will unlock after 6 months within a specially designed smart contract on StarkNet.</li>\n<li>This contract will manage and store Stark, Eth and potentially other tokens with a clear and user-friendly unlock schedule.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Engagement Through Utility:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike traditional airdrops, users can actively use their airdropped tokens, from day 1 (meaning its still locked) within the StarkNet ecosystem to purchase other tokens (which will stay on the contract) or pay for gas fees. This utility ensures that tokens are more than just a passive reward ‚Äî they are a means to explore and grow within the platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Resetting Lock Through Activity:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When a user utilizes their airdropped tokens to acquire new tokens, the unlock period for these new tokens will automatically reset to 6 months (reset for that specific token, meaning that, for example, a user doesn‚Äôt interact with Strk but with Eth, the Strk unlock period wouldn‚Äôt change but the Eth would). This mechanism encourages ongoing interaction with the ecosystem and gradual integration of users into various services and offerings available on StarkNet.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Secure and Gradual Withdrawal:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Post-unlock, users can securely withdraw their tokens to their personal wallets, providing them with full control over their assets after they have engaged with the ecosystem over the lock period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Restores Trust:</strong> By addressing the shortcomings of the previous airdrop and providing a clear, user-centric approach.</li>\n<li><strong>Encourages Long-Term Engagement:</strong> Ensures that users are invested in the ecosystem for a longer period, enhancing stability and growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Promotes Active Participation:</strong> Encourages users to explore and use their tokens within the ecosystem, increasing transaction volume and liquidity.</li>\n<li><strong>Builds a Resilient User Base:</strong> Attracts and retains users who are genuinely interested in the development and success of the StarkNet platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>This new airdrop strategy is designed to rebuild trust and provide tangible benefits to our community. By leveraging a robust unlock system, we can ensure that the StarkNet ecosystem not only recovers but thrives, with an active and committed user base dedicated to its long-term success.<br>\nLet‚Äôs focus on community.

I feel that Starknet should be the home of autonomous worlds more than ever.</p>\n<p>Even after the storm of dissatisfaction over the Starknet airdrop on Twitter on February 20th (why so specific? It‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs birthday!) I‚Äôve been riding the high waves of builder confidence, fiery passion, and bold ambitions from the ETHDenver Dojo Ninja Cafe to ETHGlobal London‚Äôs AW Research‚Äôs Hacker House, and all the way to the Starknet Meetup at the HK Web3 Festival.</p>\n<p>But three weeks ago, I landed in Lisbon for the Autonomous Anonymous conference, and man, was I in for a ride! The game composability that I had been eagerly awaiting on Starknet unfolded dramatically right before my eyes during a whirlwind two-day hackathon. I even got my hands dirty and tweaked a game called ‚ÄòDownstream Utopia‚Äô using Playmint‚Äôs toolkit. Over those three days, despite the cool demos like ‚ÄòDope War‚Äô and ‚ÄòLoot Survivor,‚Äô perhaps due to a fear of the Cairo language or just unfamiliarity with Starknet‚Äôs gaming ecosystem, out of over 20 projects, iirc, only one took on ‚ÄòDope War.‚Äô As a builder who‚Äôs built modifications to spice up ‚ÄòLoot Survivor,‚Äô I felt a pinch of disappointment, and even caught a whiff of mockery in the tg group.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/2/0/20691a0fa8a85089997f28bb9a770c34ce2abfda.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/4CIsqXhoCrkgjjC0KShtbHqXG2e.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"WechatIMG4201\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/2/0/20691a0fa8a85089997f28bb9a770c34ce2abfda_2_338x500.jpeg\" alt=\"WechatIMG4201\" data-base62-sha1=\"4CIsqXhoCrkgjjC0KShtbHqXG2e\" width=\"338\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/2/0/20691a0fa8a85089997f28bb9a770c34ce2abfda_2_338x500.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/2/0/20691a0fa8a85089997f28bb9a770c34ce2abfda_2_507x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/2/0/20691a0fa8a85089997f28bb9a770c34ce2abfda_2_676x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"232B35\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Over the last year, we‚Äôve run some wild experiments in Starknet‚Äôs gaming ecosystem and even pulled in a bunch of game developers keen on Starknet by translating Dojo‚Äôs docs into Chinese. We even rewrote ‚ÄòCrypts &amp; Caverns‚Äô in Cairo‚Äîtwice, thanks to some fun updates. We deployed it onto Katana, aiming to mesh it perfectly with Eternum (big thanks to Loaf). At last year‚Äôs Starknet Istanbul Hacker House, we whipped up a product called ‚ÄòRyogae‚Äô to tackle the swap issues of non-token assets in the Autonomous World. We‚Äôve crafted character generation modules, game governance modules etc. I know I‚Äôm not alone in this, but we haven‚Äôt managed to rally a devoted troop of onchain game devs like Lattice did with Mud, without even dangling the carrot of airdrops!</p>\n<p>Just last weekend,  Redstone officially launched its mainnet, bombarded with games! The bull market is peeking around the corner‚Äîas Moody hinted in his proposal (<a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/second-third-fourth-user-airdrop-making-starknet-happen/113907\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Second (Third, Fourth, ‚Ä¶) User Airdrop - Making Starknet Happen</a>) ‚ÄúThe opportunity cost of building for Starknet vs. all-other-EVM-based-L2s is currently too great.‚Äù  - it‚Äôs tough getting devs to pick up a new programming language. But I‚Äôm betting more onchain gaming devs will come to Starknet to deploy games if  written in Solidity. Then, they can get a taste of Starknet‚Äôs slick tech, and dive into learning Cairo to craft even more intricate games.</p>\n<p>Back in EDCON 2023 <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io/u/eli\">@Eli</a> said and here I quote ‚ÄúTypically, you would write the first version of your software in Python, but when you want to scale, you need to use other highly efficient languages like C++, WASM, or Rust. I believe the same thing will happen with Cairo; you might deploy Solidity code on Kakarot, but that‚Äôs like using Python to write a high-frequency trading engine, which isn‚Äôt suitable. You would need to write in another language, and that other language will be Cairo.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I think that we should have an EVM-compatible gaming solution on Starknet and explore the interoperability and compatibility between Starknet and Redstone or any other fully onchain game. I hope we can see items crafted in This Cursed Machine then sold in Dope War, and adventurers in loot survivor show up in downstream or biome. This is how we started back in 2022, build worlds not walled gardens, however I am concerned about being left behind or even isolated because of the Cairolang barrier.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/3/e/3ecce48d2b56e9912645cac66995ad329b2d4287.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8XyAcB4gEBo5foGK48n4lYY80hF.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"WechatIMG4202\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/e/3ecce48d2b56e9912645cac66995ad329b2d4287_2_500x500.jpeg\" alt=\"WechatIMG4202\" data-base62-sha1=\"8XyAcB4gEBo5foGK48n4lYY80hF\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/e/3ecce48d2b56e9912645cac66995ad329b2d4287_2_500x500.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/e/3ecce48d2b56e9912645cac66995ad329b2d4287_2_750x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/e/3ecce48d2b56e9912645cac66995ad329b2d4287_2_1000x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"838383\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>I am passionate about permissionless and composable autonomous worlds.

None of them imply a second STRK airdrop (but it would help, of course). I‚Äôm not the only one who had this ideas for sure, but they have the power to make Starknet (at least) 5 times bigger in the span of 6 months. They aren‚Äôt meant to add $2B TVL each, but they would change the reputation of Starknet and turn it into ¬´ the cool kid ¬ª.

Bridge LRTs to Starknet to raise awareness</strong></p>\n<p>Sadly, it‚Äôs a little bit late since ETHFI#1 is done and REZ#1 is going to be distributed in early may, it would have been perfect 3 months ago (when LRTs were only avalaible on Ethereum and Arbitrum). But it still is a no brainer !</p>\n<p>LRTs is THE defi trend of 2024. People right now want to play with eETH (<a href=\"http://ether.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a>), ezETH (Renzo), rswETH (Swell) and many others. EigenLayer could be one of the biggest airdrop of all times, and a whole new field of innovation. ETHFI <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> (etherfi) itself airdropped ~$300M to users. So, hype is real for sure !</p>\n<p>Biggest LRTs (ezETH and eETH) ara available on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Mode, Base and Linea</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs talk about Mode. It‚Äôs another useless L2, who only exists to launch a token (users are aware about that). TVL right now is $325M, with no native Mode token. Out of these 325M, ezETH is $141M ! That‚Äôs a 43 % !! And we could add eETH and Stone‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Bridging LRTs right now would not incease Starknet TVL by $500M obviously (and it‚Äôs a bit late), but it would change people‚Äôs mind from ¬´ I have no airdrop, I hate you ¬ª to ¬´ okay, so I can farm 2 x Renzo (or whatever) + EigenLayer + Nostra (or whatever DeFi protocol) + Starknet <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span>, that‚Äôs cool ¬ª.</p>\n<p>Adding at least one top 4 LRT (etherfi, Renzo, Kelp, Swell) to Starknet would change people‚Äôs mind. Starknet wouldn‚Äôt look like this isolated pacific island, it would be like archipelago of Japan : independant, but close to Ethereum ecosystem</p>\n<p>Then, adding 1 or 2 exotic LRT would be cool, since it would be waaaay cheaper than on Ethereum. If peg is good, people will swap in order to farm something instead of just holding ETH on zkLend or whatever</p>\n<p>Exemple : Inception, Genesis, Claystak, Diva Staking</p>\n<p>(Since Starknet is not EVM, you‚Äôll probably need to negociate a little bit with teams in order to guarantee users would get their points/airdrop)</p>\n<p>I would personnaly farm LRTs on Starknet, instead of holding useless ETH.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/1/3/134445c2416eb039896c6d9a538574f9e71314eb.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/2KrlovtfhU0FGlmWBKQwZlXifov.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"eigenlayer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/1/3/134445c2416eb039896c6d9a538574f9e71314eb_2_690x382.jpeg\" alt=\"eigenlayer\" data-base62-sha1=\"2KrlovtfhU0FGlmWBKQwZlXifov\" width=\"690\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/1/3/134445c2416eb039896c6d9a538574f9e71314eb_2_690x382.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/1/3/134445c2416eb039896c6d9a538574f9e71314eb_2_1035x573.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/1/3/134445c2416eb039896c6d9a538574f9e71314eb_2_1380x764.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1F2023\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Who doesn‚Äôt love Eigen points ?</em><p></p>\n<p><strong>2. Add a Pendle-like protocol to make people happy</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, Starknet is supposed to be neutral so I might be wrong, but Abdel asked about ideas so here are mines.</p>\n<p>Pendle is the pinacle of 2024 DeFi : it‚Äôs super-powerfull, kind of hard to understand, but can change lives. That‚Äôs what people love !</p>\n<p>A whale can use Pendle to earn +6 % ETH in only 2 months. A shrimp (such a me) can use Pendle to earn +$10k airdrops in 6 months. That‚Äôs what is so incredible with yield markets.</p>\n<p>After bridging LRTs to Starknet, people would need to play with it. Providing liquidity/lending is cool, but it‚Äôs not hard enought for some people, we are not in 2021 anymore. So, people (including me) are using Pendle to farm 15 times faster. Others are making a juicy +40 % APR yield on eth (wich is incredible, it‚Äôs 10 times higher than staking rewards).</p>\n<p>Using a yield market can be tricky when you‚Äôre a newbie, so I would suggest to copy/paste the frontend of Pendle. It would reduce friction a lot</p>\n<p>PENDLE market cap is <span class=\"math\">600M right now, token made a 100x. So, buying PENDLE months ago was a juicy move. Having a yield market would directly increase Starknet attractiveness, since users would have a brand new (juicy?) airdrop to farm. Many people are affraid Ekubo/Nostra/Avnu airdrops will be disapointed (let say, 140</span> for 6 months lending/LP). From a marketing POV, we need a Jito-like airdrop : huge amounts, to not-so-many people. That‚Äôs exacty what Pendle is : huge amounts, not-so-many people.</p>\n<p>And, obviously, it would still be used after LRTs trend fade, in order to farm new things and new protocols (such as Ethena recently)</p>\n<p>DEX/money markets were 2021 DeFi essentials. Perp was 2022 DeFi bare minimum. Yield markets are 2024 must-have <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p><strong>3. Connect to Hyperlane for the HYPE</strong></p>\n<p>Not sure about this one, but Hyperlane is a thriving protocol. People are using it to farm HYPE airdrop, but bridging throught Hyperlane is also very quick (and not so expansive). Since it‚Äôs permissionless, you don‚Äôt need to pay in order to use it (as a protocol). And it‚Äôs chain agnostic, it can be used on an EVM chain, a Cosmos chain, etc. So why not a Cairo VM chain <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Connecting Starknet to Hyperlane would have 2 effects :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>1 : Starknet is more and more integrated to Ethereum and other chains (sorry, but native bridging and Orbiter bridging feel so bad for 99 % of users)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>2 : people farming Hyperlane airdrop are going from time to time on Starknet. Hyperlane is hyped now, but ¬´ we are still early ¬ª, so it‚Äôs not late at all.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>BONUS : more ideas to pump Starknet</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a ve(3,3) DEX with a nice frontend such as Aerodrome. Always a good idea to increase TVL/volume/reputation by making a 50x on one token, but I have to say I don‚Äôt really like them</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>an order-book DEX just as Mangrove Exchange. Way less hyped than a ve(3,3), but also more interesting from an innovation point of view</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>make ¬´ unruggable meme ¬ª looks more like Pinksale (<a href=\"https://www.pinksale.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.pinksale.finance/</a>). Unruggable is a great idea, but for now it doesn‚Äôt help degens buying memecoins with live-charts and all that stuff</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a leverage farming protocol and/or an autocompounder (such as Alpaca or Beefy). Not so usefull when fees are 1 cent, no hype about it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a delta-neutral stablecoin such as Ethena. I don‚Äôt really like it, stablecoins are not supposed to be degen. Probably not the first thing to create, but it could be a great extender when training wheel is already moving</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>create new things ! Way more difficult to talk about it because I‚Äôm not deep into tech, but things like Kakarot zkEVM or Madara could be very interesting from a user POV.

<a href=\"https://www.growthepie.xyz/fundamentals/daily-active-addresses\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Active Addresses - growthepie</a></em><p></p>\n<p>When I started building on Starknet in May, about a year ago, I took a bet on the impressive technology and I believed the airdrop would be the catalyst for more users to try Starknet. However after seeing the design of the user airdrop, I think the chances for Starknet to reach product market fit have diminished: many real users were neglected by this airdrop, and the successful sybils were heavily rewarded. I also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sendmoodz/status/1758219284625391864\">shared this opinion</a> before it went live.</p>\n<p>Since then, the user sentiment towards Starknet has been very negative‚Äìevery tweet about Starknet gets comments about the lack of community, tags for <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#scamnet</span>, references to the unfairness of the distribution, etc. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AttilaHun_eth/status/1777469833262641578\">This thread</a> is a good example. Meanwhile, the sybils who extracted millions have completely stopped using the chain and moved on to the next farm‚Äìas early as December around when the snapshot details were leaked‚Äìleaving Starknet‚Äôs user and activity numbers at a small fraction of the peak. Now, people even <a href=\"https://x.com/0xGoldenDegen/status/1779123902524039460\">genuinely believe</a> (or supposedly joke) that Starknet has 8 DAUs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/7/9/791f794cfd216df3f06a71a72d3c078861e96612.jpeg\" alt=\"8mjwik\" data-base62-sha1=\"hhvcN0b0r6jgfURXO3ZfWNrtLzQ\" width=\"666\" height=\"359\"><br>\n<em>- All of Crypto Twitter</em></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs clear we do not see many new users interested in trying out the chain, even when high quality innovative Dapps are available and incentives on the order of 1% per week are paid out to users. I expect experienced developers are reluctant to invest in Cairo because there is little reward to be had. I worry that eventually we will see divestment from Starknet as well if there is not an improvement in the narrative and the activity numbers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-does-it-affect-the-protocols-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#how-does-it-affect-the-protocols-2\"></a>How does it affect the protocols?</h3>\n<p>The low activity directly affects the success of protocols building on Starknet. E.g. for Ekubo Protocol, because of the low user activity, the volume numbers are so low that APRs inclusive of the Starknet DeFi Spring incentives are not much higher than on other chains, which means the products receiving these incentives today will not be sustainable when the incentives end later this year.</p>\n<p>Growing these products by increasing the amount of incentives is not be an efficient use of capital. We need a resolution to the perception problem so that users and developers feel that Starknet has a strong future and is a good place to deploy their assets. Otherwise Starknet will be irrelevant, and the technology will go under-utilized‚Äìat least until someone else decides to fork it and do a better job with marketing and distribution. It could take many years longer for Starknet‚Äôs vision to be achieved.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"stop-focusing-on-developers-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#stop-focusing-on-developers-3\"></a>Stop focusing on developers</h3>\n<p>The ecosystem is eager to play a big role here, but it‚Äôs a challenge to make big moves when the community is so small. It is also not realistic to expect the best developers, memecoiners to take on the challenge of building products on a new stack just for grants, which are small relative to the potential reward of deploying on another more popular chain‚Äìespecially while activity stats are going in the wrong direction and the sentiment is poor.</p>\n<p>The opportunity cost of building for Starknet vs. all-other-EVM-based-L2s is currently too great. If additional user airdrops succeed in changing the narrative, devs that chose to build on Starknet already will reap the rewards of their efforts. So for the short term, the growth of the developer ecosystem should not be prioritized.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposal-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#proposal-4\"></a>Proposal</h3>\n<p>We should define a framework for subsequent user airdrops that is aimed at diluting the issues in the first user airdrop. To meaningfully improve the distribution, the scale of the STRK distributed in these subsequent airdrops should be on par with the original user airdrop. It should be designed in public, subject to criticism and review from the community, and importantly be validated by a snapshot vote.

More than 3 blobs per SNAR tree means a single state update transaction consumes more than three blocks whence the subsequent Ethereum block will face a higher blob price. Hence by sending such transactions too frequently we are shooting ourselves in the foot by raising our own prices. There are many interesting strategies here, ranging from never exceeding 3 blobs per tree, to spacing out occasional uses of 6.</li>\n<li>What block times should we aim for? The natural reply may ‚Äúlow as you can go‚Äù, but there‚Äôs a trade-off: each proof of a block must prove execution of SNOS, which is a significant overhead.

Currently, the main goal of Starknet‚Äôs transaction fee design is to cover operating costs without any profit at users‚Äô expense. In this post we will explore the complexity around this design goal and how Starknet tackles it. For simplicity, we will focus on L1 costs throughout and disregard cloud costs.</p>\n<p>The post is divided as follows: part I explains the complexity, while part II gives concrete formulas for Starknet fees vs costs as a function of system parameters and demand.</p>\n<p>For the detailed cost structure and the formulas for costs vs fees, skip to part II.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"part-i-design-challenges-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#part-i-design-challenges-2\"></a>Part I: design challenges</h1>\n<p>Covering operating costs without any profit means we aim to be at net zero margin. To that end, the obvious proposal is to charge each transaction a fee equal to its operating cost. So let us begin with a fundamental question: if the operating cost of a transaction is X, why not just charge it a transaction fee of X?</p>\n<p>The answer is that some operating costs are not marginal: they are not derived from individual transactions. Instead these costs derive from Ethereum interaction, namely proof verification and state updates. Their key property is a fixed gas cost per action, independent of the very large number of Starknet transactions being compressed by Starknet. The proposal in the fundamental question covers marginal costs but neglects fixed costs, and is therefore refuted.</p>\n<p>We arrive at a new task: design transaction fees to cover both marginal and fixed costs at a net zero profit. But how to distribute fixed costs over transactions? The key observation is that every action incurring a fixed cost is triggered by hitting some limiting system parameter. For example, past Starknet blocks were always closed due to reaching a compute limit. How does this observation help? Well, if fixed costs are always triggered by a compute limit then we can associate the fixed cost with a certain amount of compute units. This leads to a natural price per compute unit that would perfectly cover fixed costs: the fixed cost divided by the limit amount of computation. For example, if the total fixed cost is 100 gas, and each block is closed at a limit of 10 compute steps, then the compute fee should be 10 gas/step. Generalizing, we find the following principle: the cost per unit of the limiting resource equals the fixed cost divided by its limit amount. Since we aim for net zero profit, the fee per unit of the limiting resource should equal its cost. In essence, a limiting resource returns us to the marginal setting: each transaction should cover its ‚Äúlimiting resource cost‚Äù.</p>\n<p>To summarize, we have arrived at the following proposal: the fee for a transaction should equal the sum of its marginal cost and its limiting resource cost. The journey appears complete: we have described a formula for transaction fees that covers operating costs at net zero profit. But alas, we come to a major hurdle:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The limit amounts of various limiting resources are system parameters that often increase between Starknet versions: if we can batch more Starknet transactions per L1 operation then there‚Äôs no reason to wait for the next version ‚Äì it‚Äôd just be a waste of resources. For example, increased block compute limits means that gas costs which are fixed per block are triggered after more computation than before.</li>\n<li>Such changes alter the cost per unit of the limiting resource.</li>\n<li>Transaction fee changes are coupled to Starknet versions, so the fee per unit cannot always match the cost per unit. Why the coupling? Because every fee change requires full node upgrades, and we want to minimize the resulting upgrade overhead.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The consequences of this disparity depend a lot on the demand for the limiting resources, which can lead to overcharging users or undercharging them (i.e operating losses).</p>\n<p>Let us illustrate by example. Consider an intermediate block step limit increase between two Starknet versions, as in the following picture. Certainly the fee per step should be somewhere between the costs per step C/L‚ÇÅ and C/L‚ÇÇ. But where? If most of the demand comes before the increase, then the cost is dominated by the higher cost per step, whence the fee should be around C/L‚ÇÅ. On the other hand, if most of the demand comes after the increase, then cost is dominated by the lower cost per step, whence the fee should be around C/L‚ÇÇ.</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/3/0/30675a523b7c5cdf045944a381334f4f619c5dcd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6UclL8i2pqdWAEPLvyBCbN54a3r.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/0/30675a523b7c5cdf045944a381334f4f619c5dcd_2_624x439.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"6UclL8i2pqdWAEPLvyBCbN54a3r\" width=\"624\" height=\"439\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/0/30675a523b7c5cdf045944a381334f4f619c5dcd_2_624x439.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/0/30675a523b7c5cdf045944a381334f4f619c5dcd_2_936x658.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/3/0/30675a523b7c5cdf045944a381334f4f619c5dcd.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1B1234\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>We have seen how frequent changes to limit amounts vs infrequent changes to transaction fees introduce risk of non-zero net margin due to unpredictable demand. From here on there are two approaches to take:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A conservative approach, where fees are set to cover the current operating costs until the next version. In this approach, intermediate cost reductions are not transmitted to users until the next version. Hence, the system may enter a positive profit margin upon any intermediate cost reduction. In other words: users overpay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A more user-oriented approach, where fees are set to cover the estimated operating costs until the next version, taking intermediate cost reductions into account. This approach has the drawback of incurring risk on the Starknet operator: misestimations result in losses, and these estimations are no science!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As we shall see in part II of the post, the unpredictability is exacerbated by the fact Starknet overcharges DA fees. We heuristically undercharge compute fees to counteract overcharging for DA.</li>\n<li>The misestimation risk is bounded by a very important dependence on demand: if resource limits are sufficiently high for full block fees to cover costs, then fees will cover costs given enough demand. In other words, assuming sufficiently high limits, enough TPS ensures transaction fees will cover operating costs.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Starknet takes the user-oriented approach.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"part-ii-fee-and-cost-formulas-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#part-ii-fee-and-cost-formulas-3\"></a>Part II: fee and cost formulas</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"structure-of-operating-costs-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#structure-of-operating-costs-4\"></a>Structure of operating costs</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"marginal-costs-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#marginal-costs-5\"></a>Marginal costs</h3>\n<p>Marginal, or per-tx costs, are clearly mapped to individual transactions. The canonical almost-example is DA (data availability) costs: if a Starknet transaction writes to a storage cell in the state, it incurs an operating cost of sending this update to Ethereum. Here, cost is in units of Ethereum gas. Why almost-example then? Because many writes to a particular storage cell within the same Starknet block will still result in just one update to Ethereum: the final new value.

There are two granularities of fixed costs in Starknet: fixed-per-block and fixed-per-train. Before recounting them, we should explain what a ‚Äòtrain‚Äô is?

Thus Starknet overcharges its DA fees. Note moreover that this margin increases with blocksize, since multiple writes to the same cells are more likely to occur in larger blocks. Note it is possible to resolve DA overcharging by implementing a ‚ÄúDA refund‚Äù feature, as in zkSync. In the category of DA fee reduction features, we have prioritized volition over refunds as we believe volition will reduce both fees and costs more significantly. Moreover, volition will also reduce operating costs, unlike DA refunds.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"some-numbers-and-break-even-conditions-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#some-numbers-and-break-even-conditions-10\"></a>Some numbers and break-even conditions</h2>\n<p>After the 4844 upgrade, Starknet incurred operating losses. In the first week they were substantial, with over 8 ETH lost per day and less than 20% of costs covered by fees. Ever since, a gradual and ongoing improvement process is bringing costs down. Over the last 5 days the average net loss is &lt;1.5 ETH per day, with fees covering over half the cost (82% on April 1). These improvements are underlain by two major factors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Block limits increase: the block step limit and blob data limit were both gradually increased. More resources per block increase the fees collected per block.\n<ul>\n<li>Demand is implicit here: in addition to step and data limits, blocks also have a time limit. If demand is insufficient, then blocks will close due to time limits without containing many resources. If demand is low then the fees collected per will be low regardless of its resource limits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Data gas price increase, which amplifies the DA margin explained above. On March 28 Starknet was already covering half of its operating costs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are some examples of fees vs costs with given parameters. The crucial factor is demand because it determines the amount of resources contained in a block. Resource prices are also crucial.</p>\n<p>First, the current limits are 45M steps, a blob‚Äôs worth of felts, and a lifespan of 6 minutes. Let‚Äôs start with the following parameters, which are the average data over roughly 20 hours in the last few days.</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\"> \\text{gp}=20\\text{ gwei},\\;\\text{dgp}=60\\text{ gwei},\\;\\text{block user steps}=22.5\\text{M},\\;\\text{block dg sold}=128\\text{K},\\;\\text{gas per block}=246\\text{K},\\;\\text{train size}=192 </span></p>\n<p>we find that fees cover 69% of costs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\"> \\begin{aligned}\\text{fee per block} &amp; = 8.8\\text{M gwei} \\\\ \\text{cost per block} &amp; =12.8\\text{M gwei} \\\\ \\text{fee/cost per block} &amp; = 0.69 \\end{aligned} </span></p>\n<p>In practice fees covered closer to 55% of costs, mainly because of a ‚Äúfutures‚Äù phenomenon: transaction fees are charged according to gas prices, but operating costs are only paid later at different gas prices. On this particular day, the fluctuations favored users, exacerbating losses.</p>\n<p>Greater demand brings more steps and storage writes per block, as represented by the following parameters.</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\"> \\text{gp}=20\\text{ gwei},\\;\\text{dgp}=60\\text{ gwei},\\;\\text{block user steps}=30\\text{M},\\;\\text{block dg sold}=200\\text{K},\\;\\text{gas per block}=246\\text{K},\\;\\text{train size}=192 </span><br>\nIn this case we find that fees cover costs with a 6% margin!</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\"> \\begin{aligned}\\text{fee per block} &amp; = 13.5\\text{M gwei}\n\\\\ \\text{cost per block} &amp; =12.8\\text{M gwei} \\\\ \\text{fee/cost per block} &amp; = 1.06\n\\end{aligned} </span></p>\n<p>By configuring a longer block time, we can drive block resources even higher, but that‚Äôs a UX trade-off we are constantly thinking about. As for gas and data gas prices, a ratio dgp/gp‚âà3 seems reasonable when comparing the cost of a (nonzero) byte as 16 gas vs 1 data gas. Indeed a ratio of 3 means that blobs make DA 16/3‚âà5 times cheaper ‚Äì similar to the folklore estimates that have been floating around for months.</p>\n<p>The tension between block frequency and L1 costs will be resolved by an upcoming feature called <span class=\"d-wrap\" data-wrap=\"color\" data-color=\"purple\" data-bgcolor=\"#\">applicative recursion</span>. It will both decouple block frequency from L1 costs and moreover reduce L1 costs further, allowing fees to cover costs.

Now very naively, I think I would have defined what this means based on the participants rather than the system. In the article, part 2.2, how can we maximize welfare is based on the system: users and operators are defined, and social welfare will be maximized based on this two-sided market. Of course, it is the most important part of the system, but I feel this narrows the scope of the analysis too much, as many other parts are included in the system. If I were to define what maximizing social welfare means for Starknet, it would be maximizing the value provided to the world (same as in the article), but applied to every community member, and this includes of course users &amp; operators, but also any other economic agent that can for instance just hold STRK, use it as collateral in DeFi, etc. This might not make a big difference right now, but in the later discussion it will.</p>\n<p>On the microeconomics part, it is very well detailed, and I would love to have more details on the path chosen to price fees on Starknet, as there are only hints on the different possibilities for now. I think detailing the MEV part would also make a lot of sense since it plays a huge part in the overall social welfare maximization.</p>\n<p>On the macroeconomics part, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm 100% convinced that inflation is the best way to cover the fixed cost of capital immobilization for validators. The assumption made at the beginning that the system is static is a big one. In a dynamic system, inflation doesn‚Äôt equally share the fixed costs of the infra on token holders, as we tend to understand in the article. In fact, it flows, and the people the closest to the new-minted money are the ones benefiting the most of it. It is a well-detailed matter in traditional economics, but to clarify in the case of Starknet, new STRK is created and sent to the validator, which can use it by buying blockspace for instance. The validator entering the blockspace market with this new supply of tokens will be able to buy it at the current price but will drive the price of it higher, as the demand increased. Thus token holders end up with a STRK less valuable, as it can buy less blockspace. With this solution, the users pay just the marginal cost (happy), the operators are the closest to the source of inflation (happy), and the token holders are the ones paying for the fixed costs, in a very unequal way because inflation in a dynamic system is flowing (somewhat unhappy). Now if we decide to make the user pay for the fixed cost, we just end up with a different set of happy/unhappy people, with users somewhat unhappy, operators happy, and token holders happy. That‚Äôs why I think defining the maximization of social welfare using only operators &amp; users might be misleading, as we end up finding the best solution that puts the burden on a third group of people, that wasn‚Äôt part of the initial equation. That being said, opting for the solution ‚Äúthe users are paying for the fixed costs‚Äù doesn‚Äôt justify the very existence of STRK, as ETH or USD could be used instead.</p>\n<p>I also think more details on the particular case of Starknet would be great. It is an L2, so there are now provers &amp; sequencers, which adds more layers to the basic analysis. There‚Äôs also maybe less decentralization needed since sequencers are only providing liveness and not trustlessness, so this would change the whole target of inflation, and maybe the subject of liquid staking and so on that would be very different from L1.</p>\n<p>I couldn‚Äôt tag Noam, he doesn‚Äôt look on the forum, hope to have him soon here!</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-token-economics/113827\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-token-economics/113827","pubDate":"Fri, 29 Mar 2024 15:32:16 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"community.starknet.io-topic-113827"},"source":{"@url":"https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-token-economics/113827.rss","#text":"Starknet (token)economics"}},{"title":"Blocking CairoZero Class Declarations","dc:creator":"ilia","category":"üÜô Versions Upgrade","description":"<p>Greetings and salutations!

However, as someone with a background in mathematics (and not in development) who understands the details of Rollup technology to some extent, I find this quite puzzling:<br>\nZK Rollups require proof verification on L1, where a large part of the gas consumption is due to computation rather than storage. The computational part should not benefit from the Blob‚Äôs advantages, especially since STARK proofs are larger than SNARK proofs. It seems a considerable portion of gas is spent on zkProof verification rather than state storage.<br>\nI roughly verified this by looking at the transaction records of StarkNet: Operator‚Äîthe gas limit for proofs did not significantly decrease after EIP-4844.</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x2c169dfe5fbba12957bdd0ba47d9cedbfe260ca7\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/f/b/fb733174240d667dcacf66b277d52c8ea59570b0.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"3D4A69\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x2c169dfe5fbba12957bdd0ba47d9cedbfe260ca7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:101/70;\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/f/2/f2f749f3cf6c87b6bcb38acca47ce440f17886bd.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"3D4A69\" width=\"101\" height=\"70\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x2c169dfe5fbba12957bdd0ba47d9cedbfe260ca7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">StarkNet: Operator | Address 0x2c169dfe5fbba12957bdd0ba47d9cedbfe260ca7 |...</a></h3>\n\n  <p>The Address 0x2c169dfe5fbba12957bdd0ba47d9cedbfe260ca7 page allows users to view transactions, balances, token holdings and transfers of ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 (NFT) tokens, and analytics.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>My guess is that the L1DA costs for zk might be higher than I imagined, so moving DA into Blobs resulted in sufficient cost reduction. I hope the community can provide more information:<br>\nQuestion 1: What is the approximate ratio of DA costs to proof verification costs (Before and After EIP-4844)?<br>\nQuestion 2: Is the data currently put into Blobs state diff? Only this approach would have a sufficient reason for the significant cost reduction.<br>\nQuestion 3: If the answer to question 2 is yes, it means that after the Blob expires, the data obtained on L1 cannot be used to reconstruct the L2 World state through Replay , Correct?</p>\n<p>Additionally, I discovered the SHARP system (Shared Proving and Verifying System), which seems to be a verification system shared by StarkNet mainnet and StarkEX. From what I observed, they perform four actions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Verify Merkle</li>\n<li>Verify FRI</li>\n<li>Register Continuous Memory Page every one to two minutes, which happens very frequently and seems like writing data needed for verification to L1, but it‚Äôs unclear if it‚Äôs related to state diff or state-related.</li>\n<li>Verify Proof And Register, which happens every ten minutes to a couple of hours, likely verifying a batch of transactions after accumulating them. <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x47312450b3ac8b5b8e247a6bb6d523e7605bdb60\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Starkware: SHARP Verifier | Address 0x47312450b3ac8b5b8e247a6bb6d523e7605bdb60 | Etherscan</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Among these, Register Continuous Memory Page seems the most likely way to write L2 STATE into L1.
