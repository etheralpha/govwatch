This is an important step in building the staking community and technology, offering new opportunities for users and developers.</p>\n<p>This SNIP aims for the first stage of staking to be live on Starknet mainnet in Q4 2024, featuring a permissionless on-chain staking protocol and stake delegation.</p>\n<p>In the following, we will describe in detail the staking proposal, its timeline, and its relation to future steps in decentralization.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The first stage of staking marks another crucial step in Starknet’s decentralized <a href=\"https://starkware.co/integrity-matters-blog/starknet-vision/\">vision</a>. Here are the key motivations for an incremental approach in Starknet’s decentralization process and for the proposed first step.</p>\n<p>In the future, as part of Starknet’s Consensus protocol, Stakers will be responsible for maintaining and securing the network by producing, attesting, and proving blocks. However, it’s not feasible to hand over these responsibilities all in one day. This is why an incremental approach is necessary, as it allows for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gradual Implementation:</strong> A PoS protocol is a complex structure that requires comprehensive testing and validation. By introducing its features in small, manageable milestones, we ensure that each step is carefully implemented and easily integrated. This approach also allows us to refine the process and address issues as they arise.</li>\n<li><strong>Stakers’ Preparation:</strong> Giving Stakers time to adapt to new responsibilities, ensuring they are ready for their critical roles, and maximizing network stability during the transition.</li>\n<li><strong>Proven Reliability:</strong> By the time Stakers perform the aforementioned roles, we aim to have a proven set of sequencers that reliably produce and attest blocks, ensuring the network’s stability and performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Specifically, in this proposed first stage, we will test the protocol’s economic incentive structure and some of its key smart contract components. The protocol reward structure must balance incentivizing participation with maintaining a sustainable inflation rate and allowing a sufficient amount of STRK to remain readily available for other network activity.</p>\n<p>By adopting this step-by-step approach, with the proposed first stage, we can gather valuable data, perform crucial tests, and thus refine the staking protocol as we implement it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"overview-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#overview-5\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>The proposed first stage protocol features permissionless staking of STRK on Starknet with two staking flavors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Staking:</strong> As a Staker, you can stake any amount of STRK greater than X STRK (X is between 10K-100K). Currently, Stakers are expected to run full nodes in preparation for the following stages. In the future, they will also need to run additional software that sequences and validates Starknet blocks and possibly perform additional network liveness and security tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Stake Delegation:</strong> Delegators choose a Staker to whom they delegate their Stake, sharing rewards with said Staker. Stake Delegators do not need to run any software, as their chosen Staker runs it for them. This makes participation accessible to a broader audience, allowing users to participate in the Staking protocol without the technical and capital limitations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both Stakers and Stake Delegators can unstake their funds, subject to protocol-defined latencies that ensure network stability and security. More details on these latencies can be found in the “Latencies” section.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"staking-rewards-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#staking-rewards-6\"></a>Staking Rewards</h3>\n<p>Staking rewards will be based on token minting. The rewards are calculated according to a minting curve, which follows Professor Noam Nisan’s <a href=\"https://starkware.co/a-token-minting-proposal-to-manage-inflation/\">proposal</a> (For more details on the minting curve, see the section below). Both Stakers and Stake Delegators earn rewards, depending on their respective stake and the reward-sharing constant (R) set by the Staker:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stakers:</strong> Earn rewards proportional to their own stake and the total stake delegated to them, adjusted by the reward-sharing constant. The formula is:</p>\n<p><code>({self_stake} + {total_stake_delegated} * (1 - R)) * {rewards_constant} * {time_interval}</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stake Delegators:</strong> Earn rewards proportional to their delegated stake and the reward-sharing constant. The formula is:</p>\n<p><code>{stake_delegated} * R * {rewards_constant} * {time_interval}</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>where <code>{rewards_constant}</code> is determined by the minting curve and depends on the total amount staked in the protocol. This reward structure incentivizes both staking, stake delegation, and competition among Stakers for delegators’ stake.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"minting-curve-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#minting-curve-7\"></a>Minting curve</h3>\n<p>The minting curve addresses two critical aspects of the staking protocol by making the rewards dependent on the amount of STRK locked in the protocol. Here’s how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Balancing Participation:</strong> The more STRK tokens locked in the staking protocol, the lower the rewards become. This design ensures that not all STRK tokens are staked, allowing the Starknet community to continue using STRK for transaction fees and other activities. Additionally, it prevents unnecessary dilution of the token supply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Encouraging Staking:</strong> When fewer STRK tokens are staked, the rewards get higher. This incentivizes participation in the staking protocol, guaranteeing a minimum level of economic security for the network by ensuring that a portion of STRK tokens is always staked.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the first stage, the minting curve will be based on Professor Noam Nisan’s <a href=\"https://starkware.co/a-token-minting-proposal-to-manage-inflation/\">proposal</a>, with a slight parameter variation. The minting curve is defined by the following formula:</p>\n<p><code>M = C/10 * √ S</code></p>\n<p>Where S is the staking rate in percent of the total supply of tokens, M is the annual minting rate, again in percent of the total supply of tokens and C is the maximal theoretical inflation, also in yearly percent. In Professor Nisan’s suggestion, C=4, assuming all 10B STRK tokens might participate in the staking protocol. For this first stage, we propose C be in the range of 1.8-2.5, considering the current circulating supply is much lower than 10B and not all STRK tokens will participate in the staking protocol.</p>\n<p>Deciding on a global inflation cap and exact minting curve parameters is a complex problem. Any decision made will likely require adjustments over time as market conditions change, such as the amount of circulating tokens. Given the sensitivity of this subject, we will recommend that the Starknet Foundation (SNF) hold a governance vote to decide on minting curve parameters and the processes to adjust those over time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"latencies-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#latencies-8\"></a>Latencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Today:</strong> Entering and exiting the staking protocol is immediate, meaning that users can join or leave the staking process without delay. However, after exiting, the staked funds are subject to a security lockup period of 21 days*. During this period, users will not earn rewards and cannot withdraw their funds. This mechanism ensures network security by preventing Stakers from suddenly withdrawing significant stake and potentially destabilizing the network.</li>\n<li><strong>Future Versions:</strong> In future versions, we would introduce the notion of epochs, which are granular measures of time on Starknet based on blocks. This means that the latency for entering or exiting the protocol will be determined by the remaining time in the current epoch plus the duration of one full epoch. The withdrawal lockup period will still apply after exiting the protocol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Although Stake Delegators are subject to a security lockup when withdrawing funds, they can move between Stakers without waiting the full lockup period, enhancing the delegation market’s competitiveness.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"stake-delegation-threshold-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#stake-delegation-threshold-9\"></a>Stake Delegation threshold</h3>\n<p>The ratio between a Staker’s own stake and the stake they receive from delegators is limited by a global Stake Delegation threshold (DT). The constraint is:</p>\n<p><code>{self_stake} + {delegated_stake} &lt; {self_stake} * DT</code></p>\n<p>This requirement ensures that Stakers have a sufficient stake in the network, aligning their interests with network stability and security.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"economical-parameters-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#economical-parameters-10\"></a>Economical parameters</h3>\n<p>Here is a table summarising the economic parameters proposed in this version:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Economical Parameter</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Proposed value</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Minimum STRK for Staking (X)</td>\n<td>10K-100K STRK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Withdrawal Security lock up (W)</td>\n<td>21 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minting curve yearly inflation cap (C)</td>\n<td>1.8-2.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Delegation threshold (DT)</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reward-sharing parameter (R)</td>\n<td>Set individually by the Staker (0-1)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>These values are our proposed starting points for this version of the protocol. As part of the rationale behind this version, they are subject to change and may be adjusted to better suit the protocol’s needs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"locked-token-participation-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#locked-token-participation-11\"></a>Locked Token Participation</h3>\n<p>Locked tokens will initially be excluded from staking. When Stakers begin validating and voting on blocks sequenced by the sequencer and their consensus is proved to L1, locked tokens will be allowed to participate in the staking protocol.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"general-points-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#general-points-12\"></a>General points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rewards are claimed by actively sending a transaction.</li>\n<li>Both Stakers and Stake Delegators can add to their stake.</li>\n<li>There is no partial unstaking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"security-considerations-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#security-considerations-13\"></a>Security Considerations</h3>\n<p>The staking protocol’s design includes several key security measures to ensure its integrity and user safety.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"modular-architecture-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#modular-architecture-14\"></a>Modular architecture</h4>\n<p>The proposed protocol will be implemented using a modular architecture, where different functionalities are separated into distinct contracts, such as staking, delegation, rewards supply, and more. This approach offers several advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simplifies Logic:</strong> Each contract has a clear and specific role, making the code easier to test, audit, and understand.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhances Access Control:</strong> By defining specific permissions for each contract, the risk of unauthorized access or misuse is reduced.</li>\n<li><strong>Allows Targeted Upgrades and Changes:</strong> Updating only the relevant contract minimizes the potential for introducing new vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"permissions-and-key-management-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#permissions-and-key-management-15\"></a>Permissions and Key Management</h4>\n<p>The Staking protocol allows users to define different addresses for different functionalities. Thus, cold addresses with minimal activity can control important functionalities, reducing exposure to threats and enhancing user security.</p>\n<p>Stakers register with three addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Staking and Unstaking Address:</strong> This address has permission to Stake, add Stake and unstake. This means that it handles large amounts of STRK tokens and is only needed when entering or exiting the protocol. Thus, it can be kept by a cold wallet (minimal activity) to maximize security.</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards Address:</strong> This is the address where rewards will be sent to. It can also be maintained with minimal activity, i.e., as a cold wallet.</li>\n<li><strong>Operational Address:</strong> This address represents the Staker for operational purposes (for example, block attestations in the future) and does not handle large amounts of funds. As it will be frequently used, it should be categorized as a hot address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stake Delegators register with two addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Entering/Exiting Address:</strong> This address has permission to Delegate Stake, add Stake and unstake. This means that it handles large amounts of STRK tokens and is only needed when entering or exiting the protocol. Thus, it can be kept by a cold wallet (minimal activity) to maximize security.</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards Address:</strong> This is the address where rewards will be sent to. It can also be maintained with minimal activity, i.e., as a cold wallet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Permissions:</strong> The protocol uses a hierarchical approach between user roles. Colder addresses, which control larger funds, can replace more active ones if compromised. Specifically, Staker and Stake Delegator addresses can replace the rewards address.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"security-lockup-period-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#security-lockup-period-16\"></a>Security lockup period</h4>\n<p>When exiting, users face a 21-day lockup, during which no rewards are earned, and funds cannot be withdrawn. This disincentivises sudden large withdrawals that could destabilize the network. Future versions will tie the exit process to epochs, maintaining the lockup period for a secure exit mechanism.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"milestones-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#milestones-17\"></a>Milestones</h2>\n<p>This SNIP aims for the first stage of staking to be live on Starknet mainnet in Q4 2024, you can track the implementation progress in the following <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-staking\">repo</a>.</p>\n<p>Future stages will include Stakers gradually assigned responsibilities, eventually validating and sequencing blocks.

This is the core idea behind STARK proofs and the concept of integrity: “do the right thing, even when no one is watching”. While this applies at the protocol level, i.e. for state transitions, it does not apply for actions that fall out of pure programmatic security: how the core smart contracts of the Starknet network get upgraded or who can intervene in case of a bug.</p>\n<p>Currently, Starkware operates the Starknet network and oversees its upgrades, as well as emergency processes in case of bug. The Starknet Foundation provides support through diverse “councils” (DeFi Council, Builder Council, etc.). While Starkware acts in good faith and aims to maximize transparency, it remains a single point of failure. Additionally, partly thanks to <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2Beats</a> spearheading the effort, the industry is moving towards common security standards.

It works in the following way: to deploy a piece of code that has never been deployed before, you must first <em>declare</em> it. You are effectively “declaring” a class to the Starknet network. From this point onward, one may instantiate this class by requesting the sequencer to deploy it at a certain address. The simple usecase goes: you declare a fungible token contract, the sequencer stores the code once; then, any number of deployments of the exact same smart contract will not further bloat the chain’s storage. This is different from the way Ethereum and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) works. In EVM world, if you deploy a hundred times an ERC20 contract, the chain will store a copy of the code a hundred times.

I think I have some personal opinions about your question. I spent 3 hours looking through various materials and websites, hoping to be read by you and receive your comments.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the first part: what should we make of this anger? How much of this anger comes from agriculture teams who are trying to rationally influence the standards of this and other rounds (Starknet and other projects)? How many of these represent a broad group of people (\" farmers “or” non-farmers \") who, under different distribution methods, would contribute to Starknet’s long-term success?</p>\n<p>As for how I view this anger, I think it needs to be analyzed from multiple perspectives:</p>\n<p>We will not discuss the failure to meet expectations. This is due to the excessive consumption of gas costs caused by the abnormal use of Starknet network by the farmer team. They got the airdrop but were not satisfied, or they took the Starknet airdrop as an investment. Expect returns of tens and hundreds of times.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about the cost to individuals who have invested time and gas costs but not received airdrops, leading them to feel that their contribution to Starknet is not being treated fairly, which may cause them to be angry, causing them to rationally influence airdrop distribution on Twitter, discord, etc.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the active users of Starknet airdrop. I saw through <a href=\"http://Starkscans.co\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Starkscans.co</a> that the daily active users almost doubled between August 2023 and November 2023, peaking at 200,000 users in a single day, and then the news of the November snapshot was released. This is also a point that makes many members of the community angry, Starknet’s snapshot time is even likely to be leaked or internal witch activities, when they know the rules, they will leave 0.005eth, so it is very unfair for community members.</p>\n<p>Next we talk about Starknet’s broad population, which we can understand as users, developers, farmers, investors, community members, partners, and so on, since this will include farmers. I think the best plan Starknet has done in this airdrop is for Github developers, ECMP, DP, Ethereum contributors, but there is not a good plan for Starknet users and early adopters, and for Straknet users, this is very broad. There are multiple groups of farmers, investors, users, and so on, but Starknet uses multiple scores for a different number of token airdrops, only to be denied a token airdrop because some real people in this broad group don’t meet one of the requirements, which is quite contradictory, to be honest.</p>\n<p>At this time, let us refer to Arbitrum’s airdrop, their airdrop is very successful, has won the support of a wide range of people, they will not because of the balance and thus do not allow the standard crowd to receive airdrop, this is only a deduction item, because the need to consider should be the correlation and homogenization of wallet address, not because of the lack of balance and no airdrop.</p>\n<p>That’s all I have to say, and I move on to the professor’s second part: “Are today’s STRK holders a broad and diverse group who will stay to improve, operate, and protect Starknet?”</p>\n<p>This is a question that I think requires us to analyze the current holders of STRK tokens. What we know is that ordinary users use STRK tokens because they get some equity or use the Starknet network. Community members such as developers, technical teams, governance participants, etc. wish to participate in the governance of the Starknet community by voting with STRK tokens, maintaining the community and participating in proposals for community development. But farmers and liquidity providers, who use STRK tokens to mine liquidity or make investments for income.</p>\n<p>At present, STRk airdrop has been completed, and the coin price will fall, which will increase the turnover rate and reduce the holding rate of farmers. Therefore, STRK holders should all want to invest in STRK or use STRK to pledge to participate in voting and other groups, and they need STRK tokens. Because we don’t need to know why they are buying and selling, they could be users, developers, governance participants, whatever it is, and I personally think that when this person owns STRK, he is part of the community, he may be bullish on STRK’s price or technology, or he may be involved in governance, so I think, Today’s STRK holders are broad, but they all protect Starknet in one direction or another.</p>\n<p>Next is my opinion on the second airdrop of the remaining 400 million STRK. I think the classification of STARK early adopters and Ethereum contributors can be eliminated, because early adopters can be classified as Starknet users, and Ethereum contributors should not get a second airdrop on Starknet.</p>\n<p>I think there are three groups that need to be distinguished: ECMP, Starknet developer members, and Starknet on-chain users.</p>\n<p>Of course, if there is a need for specific rules, I think ECMP and Starknet developers do not need to question, still follow the rules corresponding to the first round of airdrops.</p>\n<p>As for Starknet users, I don’t think one rule should be used to determine whether a user can get an airdrop, but rather a multidimensional decision, and I personally developed a solution: the data should be after the first airdrop snapshot and before the second airdrop snapshot.</p>\n<p>Cumulative bonus points:</p>\n<p>Daily active use: 30/60/120/180, 1 point for each completed item</p>\n<p>Monthly active use: 5/9/12/15, get 1 point for each completed item</p>\n<p>Tx Active: 30/60/120/180, 1 point for each completed item</p>\n<p>Different contract interactions: 10/30/60/90, 1 point for each completed item</p>\n<p>Single bonus points:</p>\n<p>Use STRK tokens as gas to interact Tx &gt;= 10 strokes and get 1 point</p>\n<p>Pledge the number of vSTRK tokens &gt;= 500 STRK tokens for 1 point</p>\n<p>Hold STRK different NFT sets &gt;= 5 sets for 1 point</p>\n<p>Deduction items:</p>\n<p>LP value + balance &lt;= 0.03 eth, minus 2 points</p>\n<p>Transaction volume &lt;= $1,000, deduct 2 points</p>\n<p>Use</p>\n<p>Rules:</p>\n<p>Tx interaction &gt;= 20 for the same contract in one day is not counted as Tx activity</p>\n<p>Different NFT collections Those parts of mint whose NFT number &gt;= 2 are created by the NFT platform are not counted as different NFT collections</p>\n<p>The total score is 19 points, the total score is less than 5 points will not get the airdrop, divided into 5/9/13/16/19 points five grades to get different numbers of STRK airdrops.</p>\n<p>The exact number will be further confirmed by Professor Sasson.</p>\n<p>Thank you Professor Sasson for watching and looking forward to your reply.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/about-my-thoughts-on-the-second-starknet-airdrop/114323\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://community.starknet.io/t/about-my-thoughts-on-the-second-starknet-airdrop/114323","pubDate":"Sat, 06 Jul 2024 08:57:46 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"community.starknet.io-topic-114323"},"source":{"@url":"https://community.starknet.io/t/about-my-thoughts-on-the-second-starknet-airdrop/114323.rss","#text":"About my thoughts on the second Starknet airdrop"}},{"title":"Here are my thoughts and suggestions on a possible re-airdrop","dc:creator":"nxs97","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io/u/elibensasson\">@elibensasson</a> My suggestion is that Starknet’s future airdrop rules can be improved in the following aspects to ensure that true supporters and long-term holders get the rewards they deserve:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Holding time and frequency of use</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Reward users who hold and actively use STRK tokens for a long time.

These users not only did not sell STRK during the market downturn, but also chose to continue holding STRK tokens and use them to participate in official activities. Such behavior undoubtedly deserves more recognition and rewards.

This meant, in part, that if a new version of Starknet.js was released, both wallets and Dapps were required to upgrade to the new version to stay compatible with the latest Starknet API and Starknet.js features.</p>\n<p>This coupling stifled progress and required redundant coordination overhead to move the ecosystem forward.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"new-starknetjs-stack-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#new-starknetjs-stack-3\"></a>New Starknet.js stack</h1>\n<p>Starting with the Starknet community forum discussion, Argent proposed decoupling wallets from Starknet.js by facilitating a message-based API between wallets and Dapps.</p>\n<p>Moving to an API-based communication means wallets and Dapps no longer need to support specific Starknet.js versions as long as they communicate with the same API.</p>\n<p>After many discussions and reviews of the new API <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PR</a>, the new official wallet&lt;&gt;Dapp API has been added to the Starknet-specs repository.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-is-the-new-api-all-about-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#what-is-the-new-api-all-about-4\"></a>What is the new API all about?</h3>\n<p>Instead of directly invoking <code>Account</code> methods, a PRC message is sent to the wallet. The API supports only methods that require the wallet.</p>\n<p>These methods provide, in part, the functionality to :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get account address information</li>\n<li>Send Invoke and Declare transactions</li>\n<li>Sign SNIP-12 typed data</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notably, the new API does not allow to send requests to the wallet that can be solely handled by a Starknet Provider. It is up to the Dapp to use either their own node or one of Starknet’s RPC providers to get information about the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The new API creates a clear separation of concerns between the Dapp, the wallet and the provider. For example, the API does not externalize any options for fee or transaction type selection, which are handled by the wallet. The Dapp should only be concerned with building the appropriate calls and sending them to the wallet for signing and broadcasting.</p>\n<p>Along with the new API, a new stack of repositories is released to make transitioning to the new API as seamless as possible.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"new-repositories-and-packages-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#new-repositories-and-packages-5\"></a>New repositories and packages</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"types-js-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#types-js-6\"></a>types-js</h3>\n<p>One of the benefits of a unified API is that we can now have a types package, standardizing the expected JS types on both ends.

The class is initiated with a Starknet Provider and a Starknet Wallet, which are provided by the wallet extensions.

First of all, the requirement for people to have 0.005 eth in their wallets in the first airdrop round was very unreasonable, I say this as someone whose web3 wallet has been hacked 3 times before. I don’t keep my balances in my cold wallet, my balances are usually in my stock market account and I withdraw and use them whenever I need. I can’t risk my money again. You will probably say that 0.005 eth is a very low riskable amount. However, this balance is enough for a hacker to steal any NFT assets in my wallet. You could have used different metrics instead. For example, instead of having at least 0.005 eth in the wallet, it is required to interact with at least 5 starknet dapps. Or you could issue NFTs to identify and mark real users at certain milestones since the Starknet network was established. In this way, on the day of the airdrop, you could choose a reward by looking at who followed the Starknet network and how many NFTs they had. It’s just a simple metric. If you think about it, many different and more comprehensive metrics can be obtained. Now let’s talk about the second or subsequent airdrops. From the very beginning, we told you to fix the first airdrop allocation first. But you constantly lashed out at the community, telling us that there would be second or third airdrops and that we should continue to use starknet. However, you are forgetting the important point that you do not think about but the users do. Personally, as a starknet user, I did not receive an airdrop allocation even though I had only one wallet in the first airdrop and used the starknet network constantly. That’s why I stopped using the starknet network. I am not an airdrop farmer. I enjoyed using the Starknet network organically. I got angry at you for the unfair distribution and stopped using your network.  Now, you have been saying for a long time that there will be a second airdrop to appease the community. But I’m so angry at you that I don’t even care about the 2nd airdrop. Because probably in the second airdrop, the majority of the beneficiaries are those who qualified for the first airdrop and received 100k stark. You distributed such large amounts of stark to many of them, at our expense, that it became almost impossible for us to compete with them for the 2nd airdrop. You did this. If you had listened to us and remixed the first distribution and distributed it to the entire starknet community. Almost half of the users would use the starks from the first airdrop on the starknet network again. For example, delegating. or like buying quality NFTs. However, you allocated the second airdrop allocation to the people to whom you distributed those high amounts of stark from the very beginning. I hope you understand me. People sold 1 Strk for almost $2 in the first airdrop. The person to whom you gave 100k strk suddenly earned $200k. From the very beginning, it was made impossible for users like us to compete with these people for the 2nd airdrop. If you distribute the second airdrop share to users you did not qualify in the first airdrop without any conditions, you can at least regain maybe 1/3 of the community you lost.

For a well organized and systematic presentation of the protocol, we invite you to read <a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-decentralized-protocol-i-introduction/2671\">Ilia Volokh’s series of posts</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-soft-inclusion-mechanisms-for-forced-staking-updates-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#h-1-soft-inclusion-mechanisms-for-forced-staking-updates-2\"></a><strong>1. Soft inclusion mechanisms for forced staking updates</strong></h3>\n<p><em><strong>Context:</strong></em> The L1 Staking Contract can enforce staking updates on L2 via L1 → L2 messages. These forced updates have a deadline (measured in L1 blocks, around 24h). In the current proposal, when a deadline is reached without L1 receiving a confirmation from L2 of the forced update, honest L2 nodes perform a <em>staker reset</em> (i.e., revert their state to the last accepted block on L1 and reconfigure their staking set to include the stale updates).</p>\n<p>Staker resets can affect the latency of the protocol and should be used as a last resort mechanism. Instead of optimistically hoping that forced updates will be included in proposals by altruistic nodes, some soft measures can be taken before the deadlines are reached. We identified two measures that are not mutually exclusive:</p>\n<p><strong>A) Decreasing rewards for blocks containing forced updates.</strong> Proposers who used some of their block space for including forced updates should get rewards for this. We propose a decreasing reward scheme in order to avoid the scenario in which proposers avoid including force updates in order to increase the rewards for them. Decreasing rewards can lead to faster inclusion of the forced updates into blocks.</p>\n<p><strong>B) Engage the consensus mechanism for including forced updates.</strong> Proposed blocks should contain forced updates if available. If a new proposal doesn’t contain a forced update (which has a deadline in some epsilon amount of time), during consensus, (honest) nodes will not vote for this proposal. One has to take into account the time it takes for nodes to sync their views of L1, so this mechanism can be engaged after an amount of time in which we are sure that all nodes learned about a new forced transaction.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-pool-of-proofs-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#h-2-pool-of-proofs-3\"></a>2. Pool of proofs</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Context:</strong></em> For a block to include txs, it must include a proof for some previous block(s). A block must contain a proof for the latest non-empty block and all intermediary empty blocks in its strand. A proposer is expected to have such a proof to be able to propose a block. Proposers learn in advance when they have to prepare proofs. A proposer can acquire a proof by computing it or by delegation. The protocol offers rewards for blocks and for proofs. The Starknet protocol is using Tendermint as a consensus protocol. We anticipate that proposers for rounds <code>0</code> for any height will be highly incentivized to acquire such proofs, but not proposers for rounds strictly greater than <code>0</code>.</p>\n<p>Nodes learn about a proof only when a proposer makes a proposal containing this proof. We identified some drawbacks around this mechanism. For example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The proposer who obtained a certain proof can be offline when they are supposed to propose a block, so the computation resources for that proof are wasted.</li>\n<li>Being a proposer for round <code>1</code> may be a privileged position when it comes to rewards. Suppose in round <code>0</code>, there is a proposal for a valid block <code>b</code> with proof <code>p</code> , <code>2f+1</code> nodes lock on this proposal, but not all nodes commit to it. In this case, the proposer in round <code>1</code> is lucky as they can make the same proposal, reusing the proof  <code>p</code>  and get the rewards.</li>\n<li>Similar with the above situation, (rational) nodes can steal the proofs exposed by previous proposers in order to get rewards. For example, at round <code>r</code> I receive a <code>PROPOSAL</code> message with block <code>b</code> and proof <code>p</code>. I can collude with others and decide not to lock on <code>b</code>. In the next round I am the proposer. As I don’t want to waste computing power to generate a proof, I propose again <code>(b,p)</code> to collect rewards. Note that such a scenario breaks the trust assumption of <code>2f+1</code> honest nodes of Tendermint.</li>\n<li>When the upper bound on empty blocks (in a strand) is reached, only a block containing a proof can be proposed. In this case, the consensus protocol will be stuck for a considerate amount of time on a certain height before consensus can be reached on a value, as proposers for rounds greater than <code>0</code> may not have had enough time to acquire the necessary proof for making a proposal. Moreover, leaders for rounds greater than <code>0</code> have no guarantee that they will get rewards if they acquire a proof, as previous leaders may have already exposed the proof before them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We think that making a proof a “public good” as soon as it is computed is a healthy alternative to avoid the above issues. Proofs should be added to a common <strong>pool of proofs</strong> available to all nodes and the entity posting the proof should receive the reward. One disadvantage for having a pool of proofs is that it introduces a new component into the protocol.</p>\n<p>One can start computing the proof of a block as soon as the block is committed to the L2 chain. Let us describe what the proof for block <code>H</code> looks like, depending on the type of block.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Block <code>H</code> is non-empty</strong></em>. The proof for <code>H</code> is the recursive proof of the followings:\n<ul>\n<li>the proof of the execution of the txs in <code>H</code></li>\n<li>the proof of the verification of the proof in <code>H</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em><strong>Block <code>H</code> is empty.</strong></em> The proof for <code>H</code> is the recursive proof of the followings:\n<ul>\n<li>the proof that block <code>H</code> is empty</li>\n<li>the proof of the previous block in its strand, i.e., block <code>H-k</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the above mechanism for computing a proof, a proposer for block <code>H+k</code> must include the proof for block <code>H</code>, independently of whether block <code>H</code> is empty or not.</p>\n<p>In terms of who is in charge of computing the proofs, we can think of several approaches. The simplest one is the current Proof Scheduling mechanism (i.e., the proposer for round <code>0</code> of height <code>H</code> is in charge for computing the proofs for the previous non-empty block <code>H-ik</code>with <code>i &gt; 0,</code> and all empty blocks <code>H-jk</code>, with <code>i &gt; j &gt; 0</code>, in the strand of block <code>H</code>); note that this approach doesn’t solve the above case 4.  Alternatively, one can allow a general race or a priority race (in which leaders for all rounds for height <code>H+k</code> have priority on proving block <code>H</code>) for computing proofs, enabling a faster access to proofs.</p>\n<p><strong>Unprovable blocks.</strong> One big concern around the Starknet protocol is due to unprovable blocks. Consensus can be reached on unprovable blocks due to, for example, inconsistencies between execution VMs and provers (e.g., an execution VM used during consensus for validating a block may output that the block is valid due to a bug, but the prover cannot actually prove the block). In such cases, a recovery mechanism must be triggered. In the current design, there is no mechanism for signaling that a block is unprovable. However, the system can recover by employing the reset mechanism used for forced staking updates which can take more than 24h.</p>\n<p>A pool of proofs can help dealing with unprovable blocks. The entity who is supposed to provide a proof for a block can submit instead a proof showing that the block is unprovable. For example, if a prover fails to prove the execution of the txs in a block, then the entity can run a prover in a zkVM building a proof showing that the prover failed (and consequently, that the block is unprovable). Even though this mechanism is extremely computational expensive, using it in extreme rare situations can improve the current mechanism for dealing with unprovable blocks.</p>\n<p>Resets can also be avoided when identifying an unprovable block. When there is a proof <code>P</code> in the pool showing that block <code>H</code> (already contained in the chain) is unprovable, nodes can treat block <code>H</code> as an empty block (i.e., a block that doesn’t change the state) and use the proof <code>P</code> in the recursive proof that will be needed in the next non-empty block.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-decrease-the-rewards-for-empty-blocks-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#h-3-decrease-the-rewards-for-empty-blocks-4\"></a><strong>3. Decrease the rewards for empty blocks</strong></h3>\n<p><em><strong>Context:</strong></em> When they are missing the expected proof for making a proposal, proposers can propose empty blocks.</p>\n<p>Even though having the option of proposing empty blocks helps in not slowing down the protocol while waiting for proofs to be computed, it raises other problems  For example, malicious/lazy nodes can propose only empty blocks for censoring transactions or for damaging the quality of the chain.</p>\n<p>The protocol should discourage nodes for proposing (only) empty blocks when not necessary. A solution around this would be to halve the rewards for consecutive empty blocks proposed by the same node.

We recently came out of stealth after quite some time spent at mechanism design. Eg we built an entirely novel market based on Bayesian Truth Serum to gauge the quality of opinion articles that we’re particularly proud of. We’re now investigating the various options of where to build and are very impressed with the Starknet ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We’re an app and want to focus on making it as successful as possible. The less we have to focus on building infrastructure, the more we can focus on that goal. So we’re trying to outsource as many things as possible to stuff that’s already built. We don’t want to build our own L1 or our own DID or PoP protocol, etc, etc. Not just from a development perspective but also from the perspective of having to get L1s supported by CEXs, etc, etc. These things take a lot of time and energy and they’re not core to what we’re trying to do. So long story, short, the likes of Starknet is a natural place to build.</p>\n<p>The revenue model of the app will rely heavily on micropayments so we’re an extremely fee sensitive app. From my research of Starknet, to achieve our goals under the assumption that usage of Starknet is going to be a lot higher than it is now in two years time, we’re either going to have to rely on volitions or spin up our own L3. The volitions integration timeline is a little uncertain but we’re not going to launch for some time so this is probably not going to be an issue.</p>\n<p>I have a few questions regarding both these possible routes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When volitions are implemented will contracts that use different DA solutions to each other lose syncrhonous composability on Starknet (this is not a big deal to us BTW I’m just curious)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we spin up our own L3 can we abstract it away from the user by either employing a bridge that permits synchronous composability (ZK Sync claims to allow this with ZK Porter shards) or at the wallet level using account abstraction and relayers? We really want to avoid having our users manually bridge across from Starknet as the UX of bridges is simply not suitable for the masses in our view.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Would anyone be able to provide a rough estimate of the TX fee differences between using a L3 over Starknet and volitions on Starknet directly assuming the same DA layer is used? Second part of this question if we were to use relayers from L2 to L3 for each TX (assuming this is even possible) do any cost advantages it might have evaporate?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If anyone had any insights here they’d be greatly appreciated.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/media-application/114279\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://community.starknet.io/t/media-application/114279","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 08:38:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"community.starknet.io-topic-114279"},"source":{"@url":"https://community.starknet.io/t/media-application/114279.rss","#text":"Media Application"}},{"title":"Zero Knowledge Governance for DAOs on Starknet","dc:creator":"Damian995","category":"📜 Development Proposals","description":"<p>By team: Verse</p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Modern digital identity systems, while enabling complex online interactions, have significant weaknesses due to centralized control, making them vulnerable to coercion, hacking, and misalignment with user interests. Decentralized, cryptographic mechanisms like zkSNARKs offer solutions by enabling credible claims without a trusted authority. This shift allows users to control their identity data, enhancing security and privacy. This has been our greatest inspiration to create the Zero Knowledge Governance Solution for Starknet.</p>\n<p>The Starknet ecosystem is home to several prominent projects like Realms and Ekubo, which are governed and managed by DAOs. These organizations are committed to the principles of transparency, decentralization, and community-driven governance. Despite these ideals, there remains a significant reluctance among community members to engage in governance. The primary concern is the visibility of their voting actions on the blockchain, which can expose sensitive information regarding their decisions and influence.</p>\n<p>While zkSNARKs inspire us to explore technology creating secure, privacy-preserving identity systems,vbuterin’s vision for minimal anti-collusion infrastructure (MACI) provides a foundational principle for our proposal. MACI focuses on offering collusion resistance with centralized trust while ensuring blockchain guarantees of correct execution and censorship resistance. By using a trusted operator to manage keys and actions, encrypting messages to maintain vote privacy and integrity, this method prevents bribery and ensures votes are counted accurately without exposing individual choices.</p>\n<p>Zero Knowledge (ZK) Governance building on MACI abstracts governance voting to ensure privacy and collusion resistance using encryption and zero-knowledge proofs. With a trusted coordinator managing key changes and actions, providing credible results without revealing individual votes. This approach ensures voting remains private, secure, and verifiable without exposing voters’ identities or their choices. This innovation encourages greater participation in DAO governance by safeguarding the anonymity and confidentiality of each vote, while still maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the voting process. When integrated into Starknet’s governance platform, this solution can significantly enhance participation rates and foster a more inclusive governance environment.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/c/8/c84b043fe7e66c31c5984ae2f1116d1727185b69.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/szSdpTAXCiac4zRrhWaUWxwKpkZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"WechatIMG5067\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/c/8/c84b043fe7e66c31c5984ae2f1116d1727185b69.png\" alt=\"WechatIMG5067\" data-base62-sha1=\"szSdpTAXCiac4zRrhWaUWxwKpkZ\" width=\"690\" height=\"372\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F3F3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: MACI Introduction. <a href=\"https://maci.pse.dev/docs/introduction#credits\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Introduction to MACI | MACI</a></p>\n<p><strong>Problems with Current On-Chain Governance</strong></p>\n<p>DAOs in the Starknet ecosystem currently face several challenges that hinder active participation in governance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Lack of Privacy: Voting actions are publicly visible on the blockchain, leading to concerns about exposing decisions and associated assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fear of Repercussions: Members may avoid voting on sensitive or controversial issues due to potential social or financial backlash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transparency vs. Confidentiality: There is a conflict between the need for transparent governance and the desire to keep individual voting choices private.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Influence and Bias: Public voting records can lead to undue influence, where the votes of prominent members sway the opinions of others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Low Participation Rates: The visibility of votes discourages engagement, leading to lower participation in governance processes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data Sensitivity: Voters prefer to keep their voting history and the details of their holdings confidential to avoid revealing personal strategies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Zero Knowledge Governance Solutions for Starknet</strong></p>\n<p>Zero Knowledge Governance (ZK Governance) offers a comprehensive solution to these challenges by balancing the need for transparency in governance with the privacy of individual voters. Key features of ZK Governance for Starknet DAOs include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Voting Privacy: Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to validate that a vote was cast by a legitimate wallet address and backed by real assets, without revealing the voter’s identity or choice. This ensures that voting is private and secure, fostering greater confidence in the voting process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anonymity in Participation: Ensures that whether a wallet has voted, the direction of the vote (yes or no), and the amount of voting power exercised remain confidential. This privacy encourages members to participate without fear of repercussions or undue influence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Snapshot-based Asset Validation: Assets are validated at the time of voting through a snapshot taken at a specific block height, ensuring the vote’s legitimacy without exposing details on the blockchain. This method ensures that votes are cast by eligible participants without compromising their privacy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encouraged Participation: By protecting voters from potential backlash or influence, ZK Governance promotes more active and diverse participation in governance decisions. This leads to a more robust and representative decision-making process within DAOs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Equal Voting Power: Maintains the principle of token-weighted voting without compromising voter privacy. This ensures that all stakeholders have a fair say in governance matters while protecting their anonymity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Secure and Verifiable: The integrity of the voting process is upheld through secure cryptographic methods, ensuring that all votes are counted accurately and fairly. This transparency helps build trust in the governance system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enhanced Community Trust: By safeguarding individual privacy, ZK Governance fosters a more trusting and open community environment where members feel safe to express their opinions. This trust is crucial for the healthy functioning of DAOs in the Starknet ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/2/5/258cd9f96d7296dee27ed0597dbcaf0a3fc85a68.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/5mbreyYafpn045gJr8p9u9vTE6Y.png?dl=1\" title=\"WechatIMG5069\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/2/5/258cd9f96d7296dee27ed0597dbcaf0a3fc85a68_2_666x500.png\" alt=\"WechatIMG5069\" data-base62-sha1=\"5mbreyYafpn045gJr8p9u9vTE6Y\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/2/5/258cd9f96d7296dee27ed0597dbcaf0a3fc85a68_2_666x500.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/2/5/258cd9f96d7296dee27ed0597dbcaf0a3fc85a68.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/2/5/258cd9f96d7296dee27ed0597dbcaf0a3fc85a68.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C3D5E5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>MACI on Starknet’s Governance</strong><br>\nDetailed Introduction to MACI in Starknet Governance</p>\n<p>Participants</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voters: Only holders and delegates of L1 (Ethereum) STRK and L2 (Starknet) vSTRK have the right to vote, referred to as voters. Voters need to register with MACI before they can cast their votes.</li>\n<li>Trusted Coordinators: Coordinators help set up and execute MACI voting. They are responsible for deploying the MACI smart contracts, initiating the voting, tallying the final results, and completing the voting process by publishing the final results on-chain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Codebase</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Circom Circuits:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MACI uses multiple circuits to ensure all off-chain computations are done correctly. These circuits generate zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) that prove the votes were tallied correctly. Specifically, they enforce that coordinators correctly executed message processing and vote counting. These proofs can then be verified by validator smart contracts on Starknet.</p>\n<p>These zero-knowledge proof circuits are written in Circom 2.0. The main circuits include processMessages.circom and tallyVotes.circom, while other utility templates support the main circuits’ proper functioning. These utilities include floating-point arithmetic, private key transformations, and Poseidon hash/encryption among others.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cairo Smart Contracts:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The MACI smart contracts handle the on-chain aspects of the voting system (functionality and storage). They provide functions for deploying votes, registering voters, and accepting votes. They also store and manage on-chain data from transactions, such as encrypted votes. Finally, they verify zk-SNARK circuit proofs so that everyone can validate the voting results.</p>\n<p>The MACI smart contracts are written in Cairo.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TypeScript Libraries:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The TypeScript libraries manage the business logic between the smart contracts and circuit code. They offer various functionalities such as encryption tools, utilities, and a CLI for interacting with MACI (for operations like registration, voting, tallying, and generating proofs).</p>\n<p>Voting Process Workflow</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registration:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before voting, voters must generate a MACI key pair and send their public key to the MACI smart contract. This MACI public key serves as their identity when voting. Voters can delegate their voting rights to themselves or another address, but the message must include a signature from the MACI public key. If the voter holds STRK, the voting address is an Ethereum address. If the voter holds vSTRK, the voting address is a Starknet address.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voting:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once registered, voters can cast their votes during the open voting period. Voters bundle variables such as the public key, voting options, and the number of votes into a “command” and sign it with the MACI public key used during registration. The signed command is then encrypted along with the signature to form a “message”. If the message is correctly signed by the MACI public key, it is valid and will be included in the final tally.</p>\n<p>Before sending the vote to Starknet, voters encrypt their votes using a shared key known only to themselves and the coordinator. This prevents anyone from viewing the vote content and allows the coordinator to decrypt the user’s vote for tallying.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Processing Messages:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once voting ends, coordinators prove they have correctly decrypted each message and updated the state tree. The state tree records all valid votes, without retaining outdated messages overridden by new ones. For example, if a user first voted for option A and later changed their vote to option B, only the vote for option B is counted.</p>\n<p>Coordinators process messages in batches to ensure on-chain proofs do not exceed data limits. A zk-SNARK proof is then created to show that the state tree contains only valid messages, providing the state tree’s hash and zk-SNARK proof.</p>\n<p>These proofs are sent to the verifier contract on Starknet, which validates the proof. If the verifier contract returns true, it indicates the messages were processed correctly. Coordinators repeat this process until all messages are processed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tallying Results:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After all messages are processed, coordinators tally the votes of valid messages offline. A zk-SNARK proof is created to show the sum of votes in the state tree and provide the correct tally result’s hash and zk-SNARK proof.</p>\n<p>Coordinators send these proofs to the verifier contract to ensure their validity. Once verified, users can trust that the votes were tallied correctly. Anyone can see the final tally results and proofs, but individual votes remain confidential, ensuring votes were correctly processed and counted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publishing Results:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After coordinators process all messages, tally the results, and publish zk-SNARK proofs, the voting is finalized.</p>\n<p>At this point, the final voting results can be announced, and anyone can verify that the results were processed and calculated correctly by the coordinators.</p>\n<p><strong>Integration with Starknet’s Governance Platform</strong><br>\nStarknet currently hosts a governance voting website designed to facilitate transparent decision-making within the ecosystem. Integrating ZK Governance to the existing governance platform, is to add a privacy layer to Starknet’s governance, lowering the barrier to participation and reducing the potential for collusion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Increased Participation: By enhancing privacy, ZK Governance will encourage more community members to engage in governance, leading to higher participation rates and more robust decision-making processes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved User Confidence: Addressing privacy concerns will make members feel more comfortable voting on sensitive issues without fear of exposure or backlash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enhanced Governance Quality: A more engaged community means more representative decisions that better reflect the collective interests of stakeholders.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key deliverables will be the followings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>An Anonymous Forum Section: Creating a forum section where users can discuss and deliberate without revealing their identities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anti-Censorship/Anonymous Voting: Implementing a voting mechanism that ensures anonymity and resistance to censorship, promoting fair and free participations.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Benefits to the Starknet Ecosystem</strong><br>\nImplementing Zero Knowledge Governance within the Starknet ecosystem will bring several advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Higher Participation Rates: By ensuring voter privacy, ZK Governance can significantly boost participation rates in governance processes, leading to more democratic and representative outcomes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stronger Community Engagement: Addressing privacy concerns will foster a more active and involved community, which is vital for the success of DAOs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved Decision-Making: With more members participating in governance, decisions will better reflect the community’s views and interests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enhanced Security: Zero-knowledge proofs provide a secure mechanism for voting, protecting the integrity of the governance process and reducing the risk of manipulation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The Starknet ecosystem, with its leading DAOs like Realms and Ekubo, stands to greatly benefit from the adoption of Zero Knowledge Governance. By addressing privacy concerns and encouraging active participatio</p>\n<p>n, ZK Governance will strengthen the governance framework of DAOs and contribute to a more vibrant and engaged community. We invite the Starknet community to consider this proposal and explore the potential of ZK Governance to enhance the governance processes within their DAOs.</p>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>vbuterin.

Despite repeated attempts to engage with the Seed Grant Program’s administration, referred to us by CEO Eli Ben-Sasson, we have faced consistent neglect and non-responsiveness.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"key-issues-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#key-issues-1\"></a>Key Issues</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unauthorized Use of IP and Licensed Code</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primis Protocol has been using our copyrighted material and licensed code without our consent. This constitutes a severe infringement of our intellectual property rights and poses significant security risks to public users who might interact with their platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fraudulent Claims and Metrics</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The project has deployed a non-functional testnet application using boilerplate templates and static, hard-coded values.

Additionally, he falsely claimed to have worked at Ender Labs for two months. Our investigation, backed by substantial evidence, disproves these claims. His social media presence as a rapper and musician during the same timeframe casts further doubt on his supposed technical engagements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"evidence-and-attempts-to-resolve-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#evidence-and-attempts-to-resolve-2\"></a>Evidence and Attempts to Resolve</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We have detailed video recordings and documentation of the IP and code theft.</li>\n<li>Despite numerous attempts to engage with the Seed Grant Program and its representatives, our concerns have been consistently ignored.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"whats-at-stake-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#whats-at-stake-3\"></a>What’s at Stake?</h3>\n<p>The unauthorized use of our code not only infringes on our intellectual property rights but poses a significant security risk to users. Primis Protocol has misrepresented itself through social media and testnet applications, displaying falsified metrics and functionality to attract unwarranted attention and potential investment. Their actions suggest a pattern of deceit, aimed at enriching themselves through fraudulent airdrops and promotions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-issue-with-due-diligence-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#the-issue-with-due-diligence-4\"></a>The Issue with Due Diligence</h3>\n<p>Alarmingly, Primis Protocol received a Seed Grant of up to $25,000 with apparently no thorough vetting of its team or founders. The founder, Khoubaieb Blili, has falsely claimed past affiliations with Meta, Blockfi, and Solana Labs—a claim we have found to be entirely unsubstantiated. Mr. Blili previously applied for a position at Ender Labs, and after we identified several red flags, we chose not to proceed. Regrettably, he then exploited this interaction to misappropriate our work and initiate a competing, illegitimate project.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"further-concerns-about-integrity-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#further-concerns-about-integrity-5\"></a>Further Concerns About Integrity</h3>\n<p>Mr. Blili’s professional background raises significant concerns. He claims to have been associated with well-known entities such as Meta, Blockfi, and Solana Labs. However, we have not found any references or concrete evidence to substantiate these claims. This lack of verification, combined with his verified false claim of employment at Ender Labs—where he reported working for two months, which is unequivocally untrue—casts serious doubts on the validity of his entire professional narrative. During the period he alleges to have been employed at these companies, his social media profiles prominently feature his activities as a rapper and musician, which contradicts the likelihood of simultaneous full-time employment at these companies.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"technical-inadequacies-of-primis-protocols-testnet-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#technical-inadequacies-of-primis-protocols-testnet-6\"></a>Technical Inadequacies of Primis Protocol’s Testnet</h3>\n<p>The concerns extend beyond just qualifications; they manifest starkly in the output of their projects. Primis Protocol has deployed a testnet application that is ostensibly non-functional. The application uses boilerplate templates and static, hard-coded values that simulate functionality which in actuality does not exist. This completely fake application lacks critical features that would be present in a genuinely developed protocol, such as the capability to claim rewards from bonds or stake these rewards. Since we are the real and original developers of the project and application, we can pinpoint exact and core functionalities that are completely missing, and they are just faking it by showing an incomplete product in hopes that nobody notices.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"negligent-due-diligence-process-use-of-foundation-funds-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#negligent-due-diligence-process-use-of-foundation-funds-7\"></a>Negligent Due Diligence Process &amp; Use of Foundation Funds</h3>\n<p>A critical aspect of this situation that must be underscored is the apparent negligence by the foundation overseeing the Seed Grant Program. The fact that Primis Protocol was able to secure up to $25,000 without adequate background checks on the team or the viability of their project is alarming.

In addition, we make some necessary adjustments in order to prepare for the transition to a Starknet p2p network between nodes that will happen in a later version. We proceed to describe the version highlights.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"sequencer-parallelization-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#sequencer-parallelization-2\"></a>Sequencer parallelization</h2>\n<p>We’re reintroducing optimistic parallelization to the new rust-based Starknet sequencer. The gist of optimistic parallelization is to execute transactions in parallel as long as we don’t find a dependency between them. You can read more about optimistic parallelization <a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/optimistic-parallelization-revived/114121#optimistic-parallelization-revived-1\">here</a>. The improvement factor obviously depends on the nature of the common txs on the network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"starknet-applicative-recursion-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#starknet-applicative-recursion-3\"></a>Starknet applicative recursion</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"what-do-we-mean-by-applicative-recursion-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#what-do-we-mean-by-applicative-recursion-4\"></a>What do we mean by “applicative recursion”</h3>\n<p>SHARP works in the resolution of proof trains, each train consists of a tree whose leaves are jobs, each corresponding to a Cairo program that needs proving (in the case of Starknet, this is the Starknet OS). The final proof that reaches L1 is a recursive proof for all the leaves in the tree. Unlike verification of the proof on L1 which is shared among all the jobs in the train, there is a fixed cost per job for e.g. recording the associated fact, or publishing data which is done separately for each job. So far, each Starknet block was sent as a separate job. This limited our ability to squash state diffs over several blocks, and prevented us from having a short fixed-time block interval (since in the current architecture, each block publishes one blob, so short enough block times will lead to severe blob under-utilization). Even more importantly, this meant a high fixed cost per block (fact recording on-chain and state-update on the Core contract).</p>\n<p>To overcome the above issues, we want to have only one fact recorded on-chain, attesting to many Starknet blocks. We refer to this feature as “Starknet applicative recursion”. The idea is, to generate the recursive proof on the Starknet side, and only send one final job for SHARP. For each block, we’ll ask SHARP for a proof of that block, but without the recording on-chain part. Given the proofs, we’ll construct a final recursive job that attests to all the blocks, and squashes all the state diffs between them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-actually-changes-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#what-actually-changes-5\"></a>What actually changes</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x47312450b3ac8b5b8e247a6bb6d523e7605bdb60\">L1 verifier contract</a> will change. Instead of verifying the execution of the <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/tree/master/src/starkware/cairo/bootloaders\">bootloader program</a>, it will verify a new program, called the “applicative bootloader”. The applicative bootloader relies on the existence of a “base program” and an aggregator program.</p>\n<p>To register a new “applicative fact” on-chain, the verifier contract must see a proof for the successful execution of the applicative bootloader with some base program P, and an aggregator program for P. The way the applicative bootloader works, is to verify (potentially several) proofs of the base program execution, and then use the outputs of the base program as input to the aggregator program. In the case of Starknet, the base program is the Starknet OS, and the aggregator program is a new cairo program that squashes the state diffs of several blocks. This way, we can take individual proofs of OS executions for some block range, and end up with a single program whose valid execution attests to the validity of all blocks within that range, and whose output is the squashed state diff. On Ethereum, the Starknet core contract will verify that an “applicative fact” was registered on chain, with the expected aggregator program, and that the base program hash (outputted by the aggregator) is that of the Starknet OS.</p>\n<p>We summarize the technical changes induced by the above here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Starknet Core contract now knows of both the aggregator program hash and the OS program hash.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/efa9648f57568aad8f8a13fbf027d2de7c63c2c0/src/starkware/starknet/solidity/Starknet.sol#L36\">LogStateUpdate</a> event for the Starknet core contract will be emitted once for every sequence of blocks, rather than for every block.</li>\n<li>The data published on L1 is now the output of the aggregator. While the format of the <a href=\"https://docs.starknet.io/architecture-and-concepts/network-architecture/data-availability/#v0.11.0_format\">state diffs</a>, the <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/efa9648f57568aad8f8a13fbf027d2de7c63c2c0/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/output.cairo#L25\">OsOutputHeader</a> changes. We’re adding four new fields to the header: <code>prev_block_number</code>, <code>prev_block_hash</code>, <code>os_program_hash</code>, <code>full_output</code>. This means that if you’re decoding Starknet onchain data from blobs, then you’ll need to start decoding statediffs after the first 10 felts rather than after the first 6.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new Cairo programs, namely the aggregator and applicative bootloader, will be published as part of the new <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang\">cairo-lang</a> release.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"new-block-hash-definition-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#new-block-hash-definition-6\"></a>New block hash definition</h2>\n<p>To prepare for the future transition to p2p communication (as opposed to relying on the centralized sequencer block publications), we’re making sure that the block hash structure is robust in the sense that it allows nodes to verify all the data given by peers without being susceptible to DOS.</p>\n<p>This change will affect full nodes, and will not be seen externally (past block hashes naturally remain unchanged).

The VM effectively emulates another machine, which begs the question: can we circumvent any emulation to improve performance? Turns out the answer is “very very yes” if you’re blessed with a disturbing amount of brainpower. Enter Cairo-native, which lets the sequencer completely bypass the VM and execute native CPU opcodes. Dark magic, you say? Correct! Behind the scenes, Cairo-native is a Sierra→MLIR compiler; the sequencer will use it to compile declared Cairo classes to native bytecode, and run the latter during transaction execution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only addition to make now about Cairo-native is to emphasize that faster execution will further improve confirmation times. Alongside it, we mention some more feature ideas that are on the cards for v0.13.3 but yet to be decided.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"v0140-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#v0140-3\"></a>v0.14.0</h1>\n<p>Everything here is TBD.

Similarly to Ethereum, Starknet’s json-rpc allows you to filter over event keys via the <code>starknet_getEvents</code> method.</p>\n<p>In this SNIP we suggest updating StarkGate’s ERC20s (including ETH, STRK, USDC <a href=\"https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-addresses/blob/master/bridged_tokens/mainnet.json\">and others</a>) to index more fields in the <code>Transfer</code> and <code>Approval</code> events in order to allow filtration over the sender or receiver.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Dapps, for example exchanges that operate on Starknet, need to track transfers from &amp; to specific addresses. At the moment, Starknet’s json-rpc only allows receiving all <code>Transfer</code> or <code>Approval</code> events from a given ERC20 in a particular block range. This SNIP would enable filtering those events, allowing filteration by <code>from</code> or <code>to</code> in <code>Transfer</code> events and by <code>owner</code> or <code>spender</code> in <code>Approval</code> events.</p>\n<p>This is already the case on Ethereum and other EVM chains. Due to limitations in early iterations of Cairo, events had only one key corresponding to the event name. This lead to only being able to filter over all transfer events, which is far from ideal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"backward-compatability-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#backward-compatability-3\"></a>Backward Compatability</h2>\n<p><strong>This change is NOT backward compatible</strong>. All DAPPs listenting to ERC20 transfer and approval events will have to adjust their events decoding, in order to look for fields in the <code>keys</code> array instead of in the <code>data</code> array.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>Starknet’s json-rpc <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/blob/76bdde23c7dae370a3340e40f7ca2ef2520e75b9/api/starknet_api_openrpc.json#L798\"><code>starknet_getEvents</code> method</a>, takes an <code>EventFilter</code> object, which contains a nested list of keys to be matched against. For example, if the user sent an event filter containing <span class=\"math\">\\big[[k_1, k_2], [\\;], [k_3]\\big]</span>, then the node should return events whose first key is <span class=\"math\">k_1</span> or <span class=\"math\">k_2</span>, and the third key is <span class=\"math\">k_3</span>, and the second key is unconstrained and can take any value. This functionality is supported by variuous Starknet SDKs, for example, see the following <a href=\"https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/guides/events#without-transaction-hash\">starknet.js tutorial</a> to see how to filter events.</p>\n<p>Currently, these are the <code>Transfer</code> and <code>Approval</code> events in all StarkGate’s ERC20s:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"rust\"><code class=\"lang-rust\">    /// Emitted when tokens are moved from address `from` to address `to`.\n    #[derive(Copy, Drop, PartialEq, starknet::Event)]\n    struct Transfer {\n        // #[key] - Not indexed, to maintain backward compatibility.\n        from: ContractAddress,\n        // #[key] - Not indexed, to maintain backward compatibility.\n        to: ContractAddress,\n        value: u256\n    }\n\n    /// Emitted when the allowance of a `spender` for an `owner` is set by a call\n    /// to [approve](approve). `value` is the new allowance.\n    #[derive(Copy, Drop, PartialEq, starknet::Event)]\n    struct Approval {\n        // #[key] - Not indexed, to maintain backward compatibility.\n        owner: ContractAddress,\n        // #[key] - Not indexed, to maintain backward compatibility.\n        spender: ContractAddress,\n        value: u256\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This SNIP basically suggests to uncomment the above <code>#[key]</code> annotations:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"rust\"><code class=\"lang-rust\">    /// Emitted when tokens are moved from address `from` to address `to`.\n    #[derive(Drop, PartialEq, starknet::Event)]\n    struct Transfer {\n        #[key]\n        from: ContractAddress,\n        #[key]\n        to: ContractAddress,\n        value: u256\n    }\n\n    /// Emitted when the allowance of a `spender` for an `owner` is set by a call\n    /// to `approve`. `value` is the new allowance.\n    #[derive(Drop, PartialEq, starknet::Event)]\n    struct Approval {\n        #[key]\n        owner: ContractAddress,\n        #[key]\n        spender: ContractAddress,\n        value: u256\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is, a transfer from 0x1 to 0x2 of 100 tokens, now emits:</p>\n<p><code>keys</code>: [selector(“Transfer”)]</p>\n<p><code>data</code>: [0x1, 0x2, 100, 0]</p>\n<p>The first two felts in the data array are the values of <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> correspondingly, and the last two felts are the low and high 128bits of the u256 of the amount.</p>\n<p>If this SNIP is accepted, the emitted event will change to:</p>\n<p><code>keys</code>: [selector(“Transfer”), 0x1, 0x2]</p>\n<p><code>data</code>: [100, 0]</p>\n<p>Where <code>selector(x)</code> is the <a href=\"https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Cryptography/hash-functions/#starknet_keccak\">sn_keccak</a> of <code>x</code>    .</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#security-considerations-5\"></a>Security Considerations</h2>\n<p>Dapps who did not change their code to parse events differently may break after the ERC20 contracts are upgraded.</p>\n<p>We considered whether or not the change suggested in this SNIP can be leveraged to cause more damage. The scenario we analyzed is the following: can an exchange that did not change its code be led to thinking that a transfer has been made to its account, thus crediting an account on the exchange, while in fact no such transaction took place.</p>\n<p>We claim that this is not possible. Currently, DAPPs take the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> values from the first and second members of the <code>data</code> array. After the change, the first and second members of the <code>data</code> array would be <code>amount_low</code> and <code>amount_high</code> correspondingly. Since both <code>amount_low</code> and <code>amount_high</code> are enforced to be 128bit numbers, and thus contain 124 leading zeros, these can not collide with an account address on Starknet, which is <a href=\"https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Smart_Contracts/contract-address/\">necessarily</a> the result of a hash computation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"copyright-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#copyright-6\"></a>Copyright</h2>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a>MIT</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-13-index-transfer-and-approval-events-in-erc20s/114212\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-13-index-transfer-and-approval-events-in-erc20s/114212","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Jun 2024 13:27:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"community.starknet.io-topic-114212"},"source":{"@url":"https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-13-index-transfer-and-approval-events-in-erc20s/114212.rss","#text":"SNIP 13 - Index `Transfer` and `Approval` events in ERC20s"}},{"title":"ZK Governance for Starknet","dc:creator":"Mirror-Tang","category":"Starknet Technical Development","description":"<h2><a name=\"overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#overview-1\"></a>Overview</h2>\n<p>The Starknet ecosystem hosts several prominent projects, of which many are governed and managed by DAOs, such as Realms and Ekubo. Despite the decentralized nature of these organizations, there is a notable reluctance among community members to participate in governance. The primary issue stems from the transparency of voting actions on the blockchain, which can expose sensitive information and influence decision-making processes.</p>\n<p><em>Votes are conducted publicly, leaving voting systems vulnerable to collusion.</em></p>\n<p>Starknet Governance Hub, designed to facilitate transparent and efficient governance. However, despite these efforts, participation rates remain lower than desired. Our team, with extensive experience in building governance platforms like Frontinus House for Realm, has identified privacy concerns as a significant barrier to active engagement.</p>\n<p>ZK Governance provides a solution to this challenge by using zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that voting is private, secure, and verifiable without revealing voters’ identities or choices. By integrating ZK Governance into Starknet’s existing governance platform, we can enhance privacy and security, thereby increasing participation rates and strengthening the overall governance of DAOs within the Starknet ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problems-with-current-solutions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#problems-with-current-solutions-2\"></a>Problems with Current Solutions</h2>\n<p><em>DAOs in the Starknet ecosystem currently face several challenges that hinder active participation in governance:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of Privacy: All voting actions are publicly visible on the blockchain, deterring individuals from participating due to concerns about exposing their decisions and holdings.</li>\n<li>Fear of Repercussions: Members may hesitate to vote on controversial issues for fear of social or financial backlash.</li>\n<li>Transparency vs. Confidentiality: The need for transparent governance conflicts with the desire to keep individual voting choices private.</li>\n<li>Influence and Bias: Public voting records can lead to undue influence or bias, where prominent members’ votes sway community opinions.</li>\n<li>Low Participation Rates: The visibility of votes can discourage engagement, leading to low participation in governance processes.</li>\n<li>Data Sensitivity: Voters may not want their voting history and associated assets exposed, as this can reveal personal strategies and holdings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ZK Governance Solutions</strong></p>\n<p>ZK Governance offers a comprehensive solution to these challenges by balancing the need for transparency in governance with the privacy of individual voters. Key features of ZK Governance for Starknet DAOs include:</p>\n<p>A large-scale anonymous electronic voting scheme based on zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) offers unique value and significance in ensuring the <strong>anonymity, security, and reliability</strong> of voting. zk-SNARKs is a cryptographic technology that enables one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information other than the truth of the statement itself. Applying zk-SNARKs to electronic voting brings several key advantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Protection of Voter Identity Privacy</strong>: The connection between a voter’s choice and their personal identity is not disclosed; it’s impossible to identify from public information whether a specific voter has participated. This also enhances the fairness of the voting system.</li>\n<li><strong>Prevention of Vote Buying and Selling</strong>: Voters participate under pseudonyms and are unable to prove their own voting results. This means voters cannot sell their votes to third parties who may wish to purchase them.</li>\n<li><strong>Verifiable Voting Results</strong>: Everyone can verify the voting results based on the public counting proofs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"starknet-analysis-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#starknet-analysis-3\"></a>Starknet Analysis</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"participants-composition-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#participants-composition-4\"></a>Participants Composition</h2>\n<p>The electronic voting scheme involves the following five participants: Proposers, STRK Holders <span class=\"math\">IDs=\\{id_1,id_2, ...id_m\\}</span>, Cryptographic Coordinator, Pseudonym Registrar, and Counters <span class=\"math\">Ts=\\{T_1,T_2, ...T_m\\} </span> .

They vote under pseudonyms to ensure anonymity. As shown in the figure below, <strong>the voting results published on snapshot will not display the on-chain addresses of STRK holders, but their pseudonyms instead.</strong></li>\n<li>Snapshot: Publishes proposal information, voting information, cryptographic public parameters, voting results, and proofs of correct counting.

The result of this effort was the <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier\">blockifier</a>, Starknet’s new execution engine, which in turn relies on the Rust implementation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-vm\">cairo-vm</a> by Lambdaclass.</p>\n<p>Given that the transition from Python to Rust outweighed most of the potentiatal performance improvements, the first iterations of the blockifier did not contain optimistic parallelization. After a few Starknet versions that focused on stability and fee reduction, we return to parallelization in order to reach the full potential of the Starknet sequencer.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-is-optimistic-parallelization-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#what-is-optimistic-parallelization-4\"></a>What is optimistic parallelization?</h2>\n<p>Naively, executing a block of transactions in parallel is impossible as different transactions may be dependent. This is illustrated in the following example. Consider a block with three transactions from the same user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transaction A: swap USDC for ETH</li>\n<li>Transaction B: pay ETH for an NFT</li>\n<li>Transaction C: swap USDT for BTC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly, Tx A must happen before Tx B, but Tx C is entirely independent of both and can be executed in parallel. If each transaction requires 1 second to execute, then the block production time can be reduced from 3 seconds to 2 seconds by introducing parallelization.</p>\n<p>The crux of the problem is that we do not know the transaction dependencies in advance. In practice, only when we execute transaction B from our example do we see that it relies on changes made by transaction A. More formally, the dependency follows from the fact that transaction B reads from storage cells that transaction A has written to. We can think of the transactions as forming a dependency graph, where there is an edge from transaction A to transaction B iff A writes to a storage cell that is read by B, and thus has to be executed before B. The following figure shows an example of such a dependency graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/d/7/d7f32ac0707740d1b9bf477a66d3adee9cf03e1d.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"uOnDCsRQh5UPY3gnq32e8LlS3GB\" width=\"665\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<p>In the above example, each column can be executed in parallel, and this is the optimal arrangement (while naively, we would have executed transactions 1–9 sequentially).</p>\n<p>To overcome the fact that the dependency graph is not known in advance, we introduce optimistic parallelization, in the spirit of <a href=\"https://malkhi.com/posts/2022/04/block-stm/\">BLOCK-STM</a> developed by Aptos Labs, to the Starknet sequencer. Under this paradigm, we optimistically attempt to run transactions in parallel and re-execute upon finding a collision. For example, we may execute transactions 1–4 from figure 1 in parallel, only to find out afterward that Tx4 depends on Tx1. Hence, its execution was useless (we ran it relative to the same state we ran Tx1 against, while we should have run it against the state resulting from applying Tx1). In that case, we will re-execute Tx4.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"parallelization-in-the-blockifier-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#parallelization-in-the-blockifier-5\"></a>Parallelization in the blockifier</h2>\n<p>The entry point to the new parallelization infrastructure in the blockifier can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier/blob/df2799eafda4f575e71d63c839d14f5a38ca911d/crates/blockifier/src/concurrency.rs#L1\">concurrency.rs</a>. The Rust implementation follows the original BLOCK-STM paper more closely compared to the previous version of our optimistic parallelization. The scheduler tracks the tasks that remain to be done, these can be either validation tasks or execution tasks. Worker threads then query the scheduler for the next task, and communicate with a versioned state to obtain the latest known storage values. This is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/8/5/850099e3e8117db4bb9507e2b399e21e87007798.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/iYAN4uWEkZfIhfQknZ3UBA1S3ig.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/8/5/850099e3e8117db4bb9507e2b399e21e87007798_2_624x316.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"iYAN4uWEkZfIhfQknZ3UBA1S3ig\" width=\"624\" height=\"316\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/8/5/850099e3e8117db4bb9507e2b399e21e87007798_2_624x316.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/8/5/850099e3e8117db4bb9507e2b399e21e87007798_2_936x474.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/8/5/850099e3e8117db4bb9507e2b399e21e87007798_2_1248x632.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F6F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Diagram: worker threads request the next task, and work on a versioned state (version i contains the writes of tx i). The execution itself is handled by the same code that handled sequential execution.</p>\n<p>The blockifier’s implementation contains an additional commit phase that isn’t part of the original BLOCK-STM paper. The motivation for this phase is to delay fee transfers to the sequencer (which, if unhandled separately, leads any two transactions to collide due to reading &amp; writing the sequencer’s balance). If all transactions before transaction <code>i</code> are committed, then the fee transfer is applied alongside an additional check to see whether or not the transaction can fit into a block. If both tests pass, the i’th transaction is committed.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"whats-next-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#whats-next-6\"></a>What’s next</h2>\n<p>Several potential improvements to the blockifier’s implementation of BLOCK-STM will be added down the road. At the moment, accesses to VersionedState are mutually exclusive; this can be relaxed to locking only over the particular addresses that we want to read/write from.</p>\n<p>Another direction to explore is adding language features that will allow contract developers to write more “parallelizable” code. For example, when performing a commutative operation on storage values today, one has to read the value, apply the operation, and write the new value. This means that although the underlying operation is commutative, any two transactions that perform it will have a read/write collision. If, however, the smart contract language has primitives that encapsulate “atomic storage manipulation”, then these can be used to enhance parallelization. For example, consider u256 addition. If we want to add some value to a storage slot (as happens when updating the sequencer’s balance due to fee payments), we can call an ad-hoc <code>increment(storage_address, value)</code> operation that does not necessarily lead two transactions that apply increment to the same address to collide. Collision will only happen if the first operation results in an overflow. This direction was explored in more depth in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06117\">recent paper</a> by AptosLabs, where they introduce the notion of “deferred object” to the smart contract language.</p>\n<p>Finally, while mostly targeted for the sequencing layer, the parallelization infrastructure can be used by full nodes to optimize re-execution. The improvement is even more significant for nodes, since they can get the optimal ordering via the dependency graph produced by the original execution.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#summary-7\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>As of Starknet 0.13.2, parallelization is back on the menu. Parallelization, along with AOT compilation via the <a href=\"https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo_native\">cairo-native</a> project that is planned for 0.13.3, will unleash the full potential of Starknet, reaching throughput that is only possible on a validity rollup.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/optimistic-parallelization-revived/114121\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://community.starknet.io/t/optimistic-parallelization-revived/114121","pubDate":"Sun, 26 May 2024 16:51:38 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"community.starknet.io-topic-114121"},"source":{"@url":"https://community.starknet.io/t/optimistic-parallelization-revived/114121.rss","#text":"Optimistic parallelization revived"}},{"title":"SNIPs: process revival","dc:creator":"ilia","category":"📜 Development Proposals","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>SNIPs (Starknet Improvement Proposals) are the Starknet analogue of Ethereum EIPs. However, in the current state of affairs, there are aspects in which a SNIP differs from an EIP both in its purpose and in its (lack of) processing. As pointed out by the community, little attention has been devoted to the topic over the past few months. The purpose of this text is to revive the SNIP process and propose short-term improvements.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"eip-vs-snip-today-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#eip-vs-snip-today-2\"></a>EIP vs SNIP today</h1>\n<p>The fundamental difference is in handling protocol-level improvement proposals, i.e those which require protocol changes. Ethereum, being decentralized, requires “meta-consensus” on protocol changes among validators and subsequently among client teams. The Ethereum Foundation is a considerable driving force for EIPs, but it does not directly control block proposals. Starknet, in its currently centralized state, strictly requires involvement of the Starknet core teams in StarkWare to implement protocol changes.</p>\n<p>Since genesis, almost all protocol-level changes (e.g. version features) have not gone through the full SNIP route, having been decided internally instead. Overall we think this is sensible and justified by the need to move and add features much faster than in Ethereum. That being said, the long term objective is clear: when Starknet is decentralized and mature, the process will closely mirror the Ethereum EIP protocol.</p>\n<p>Thus we are left with the question of short-medium term: on the one hand, iterations and versions are still frequent compared to Ethereum. On the other hand, we want to step toward a SNIP process that approaches the “real thing” over time.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"short-medium-term-proposal-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io#short-medium-term-proposal-3\"></a>Short-medium term proposal</h1>\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-1.md\">SNIP-1</a>, GitHub remains the place to submit SNIPs and is the source of truth for their documentation.

These problems led to many users departing from the ecosystem, looking for stability and reliability that were perceived as lacking.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Airdrop Using a New Unlock System:</strong></p>\n<p>To address these issues and incentivize users to rejoin and continue supporting the StarkNet ecosystem, I propose a new airdrop mechanism integrated with a sophisticated contract. This system will not only distribute tokens but will also encourage long-term engagement and investment in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Features of the Proposed Airdrop:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unlock Contract Integration:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Users will receive airdropped Strk and Eth which will unlock after 6 months within a specially designed smart contract on StarkNet.</li>\n<li>This contract will manage and store Stark, Eth and potentially other tokens with a clear and user-friendly unlock schedule.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Engagement Through Utility:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike traditional airdrops, users can actively use their airdropped tokens, from day 1 (meaning its still locked) within the StarkNet ecosystem to purchase other tokens (which will stay on the contract) or pay for gas fees. This utility ensures that tokens are more than just a passive reward — they are a means to explore and grow within the platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Resetting Lock Through Activity:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When a user utilizes their airdropped tokens to acquire new tokens, the unlock period for these new tokens will automatically reset to 6 months (reset for that specific token, meaning that, for example, a user doesn’t interact with Strk but with Eth, the Strk unlock period wouldn’t change but the Eth would).

And indeed, the community (you!) <a href=\"https://starkware.co/resource/unleashing-the-power-of-the-stone-prover/\">stepped to the challenge</a> and has since done truly astounding work to extend Stone’s capabilities, including two that are already available today:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Using Stone to Prove Cairo Programs:</strong> Stone has been in production since June 2020, playing a critical role in proving transactions from decentralized applications powered by StarkWare such as StarkEx and Starknet. Back in 2020, however, Cairo was a very different language, and as such Stone was built to prove an older version of it (<a href=\"https://starkware.co/resource/the-whats-what-of-the-cairo-world/\">now known as Cairo Zero</a>) – but no more! Thanks to the mighty <a href=\"https://lambdaclass.com/\">LambdaClass team</a>, Stone is now capable of proving both <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/stone-prover?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-and-verifying-a-proof-of-a-cairo-program\">Cairo</a>  and <a href=\"https://github.com/starkware-libs/stone-prover?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-and-verifying-a-proof-of-a-cairozero-program\">Cairo Zero</a> programs</li>\n<li><strong>Verifying Stone Proofs on Starknet:</strong> Obviously, generating proofs (either of Cairo or Cairo Zero programs) won’t get you far without verifying them. Moreover, the generated proofs are only as secure as the entity that verifies them – which is precisely why this verification needs to be onchain. So far, however, Stone proofs could only be verified offchain using the C++ verifier available in the Stone codebase – but no more! Thanks to the incredible <a href=\"https://herodotus.dev/\">Herodotus team</a>, you can now use the <a href=\"https://integrityverifier.com/\">Integrity verifier</a> to verify Stone proofs <a href=\"https://sepolia.starkscan.co/tx/0x2bdc63690e345a1511732ae00994bda30a66429876006ae704e54e229021b17\">on Starknet</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“What about <strong>using Stone to power</strong> <a href=\"https://starkware.co/resource/what-are-appchains/\"><strong>Starknet Appchains</strong></a>”, you say?

I feel that Starknet should be the home of <a href=\"https://www.starknet.io/blog/autonomous-worlds/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.starknet.io/blog/autonomous-worlds/)</a> more than ever.</p>\n<p>Even after the storm of dissatisfaction over the Starknet airdrop on Twitter on February 20th (why so specific? It’s my wife’s birthday!) I’ve been riding the high waves of builder confidence, fiery passion, and bold ambitions from the ETHDenver Dojo Ninja Cafe to ETHGlobal London’s AW Research’s Hacker House, and all the way to the Starknet Meetup at the HK Web3 Festival.</p>\n<p>But three weeks ago, I landed in Lisbon for the Autonomous Anonymous conference, and man, was I in for a ride! The game composability that I had been eagerly awaiting on Starknet unfolded dramatically right before my eyes during a whirlwind two-day hackathon. I even got my hands dirty and tweaked a game called ‘Downstream Utopia’ using Playmint’s toolkit. Over those three days, despite the cool demos like ‘Dope War’ and ‘Loot Survivor,’ perhaps due to a fear of the Cairo language or just unfamiliarity with Starknet’s gaming ecosystem, out of over 20 projects, iirc, only one took on ‘Dope War.’ As a builder who’s built modifications to spice up ‘Loot Survivor,’ I felt a pinch of disappointment, and even caught a whiff of mockery in the tg group.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/2/0/20691a0fa8a85089997f28bb9a770c34ce2abfda.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/4CIsqXhoCrkgjjC0KShtbHqXG2e.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"WechatIMG4201\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/2/0/20691a0fa8a85089997f28bb9a770c34ce2abfda_2_338x500.jpeg\" alt=\"WechatIMG4201\" data-base62-sha1=\"4CIsqXhoCrkgjjC0KShtbHqXG2e\" width=\"338\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/2/0/20691a0fa8a85089997f28bb9a770c34ce2abfda_2_338x500.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/2/0/20691a0fa8a85089997f28bb9a770c34ce2abfda_2_507x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/2/0/20691a0fa8a85089997f28bb9a770c34ce2abfda_2_676x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"232B35\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Over the last year, we’ve run some wild experiments in Starknet’s gaming ecosystem and even pulled in a bunch of game developers keen on Starknet by translating Dojo’s docs into Chinese. We even rewrote ‘Crypts &amp; Caverns’ in Cairo—twice, thanks to some fun updates. We deployed it onto Katana, aiming to mesh it perfectly with Eternum (big thanks to Loaf). At last year’s Starknet Istanbul Hacker House, we whipped up a product called ‘Ryogae’ to tackle the swap issues of non-token assets in the Autonomous World. We’ve crafted character generation modules, game governance modules etc. I know I’m not alone in this, but we haven’t managed to rally a devoted troop of <a href=\"https://www.starknet.io/blog/building-complex-fully-onchain-games-with-starknet/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">onchain game</a> devs like Lattice did with Mud, without even dangling the carrot of airdrops!</p>\n<p>Just last weekend,  Redstone officially launched its mainnet, bombarded with games! The bull market is peeking around the corner—as Moody hinted in his proposal (<a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/second-third-fourth-user-airdrop-making-starknet-happen/113907\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Second (Third, Fourth, …) User Airdrop - Making Starknet Happen</a>) “The opportunity cost of building for Starknet vs. all-other-EVM-based-L2s is currently too great.”  - it’s tough getting devs to pick up a new programming language. But I’m betting more onchain gaming devs will come to Starknet to deploy games if  written in Solidity. Then, they can get a taste of Starknet’s slick tech, and dive into learning Cairo to craft even more intricate games.</p>\n<p>Back in EDCON 2023 <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://community.starknet.io/u/eli\">@Eli</a> said and here I quote “Typically, you would write the first version of your software in Python, but when you want to scale, you need to use other highly efficient languages like C++, WASM, or Rust. I believe the same thing will happen with Cairo; you might deploy Solidity code on Kakarot, but that’s like using Python to write a high-frequency trading engine, which isn’t suitable. You would need to write in another language, and that other language will be Cairo.”</p>\n<p>I think that we should have an EVM-compatible gaming solution on Starknet and explore the interoperability and compatibility between Starknet and Redstone or any other fully onchain game. I hope we can see items crafted in This Cursed Machine then sold in Dope War, and adventurers in loot survivor show up in downstream or biome. This is how we started back in 2022, build worlds not walled gardens, however I am concerned about being left behind or even isolated because of the Cairolang barrier.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/3/e/3ecce48d2b56e9912645cac66995ad329b2d4287.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8XyAcB4gEBo5foGK48n4lYY80hF.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"WechatIMG4202\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/e/3ecce48d2b56e9912645cac66995ad329b2d4287_2_500x500.jpeg\" alt=\"WechatIMG4202\" data-base62-sha1=\"8XyAcB4gEBo5foGK48n4lYY80hF\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/e/3ecce48d2b56e9912645cac66995ad329b2d4287_2_500x500.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/e/3ecce48d2b56e9912645cac66995ad329b2d4287_2_750x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/3/e/3ecce48d2b56e9912645cac66995ad329b2d4287_2_1000x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"838383\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>I am passionate about permissionless and composable autonomous worlds.

None of them imply a second STRK airdrop (but it would help, of course). I’m not the only one who had this ideas for sure, but they have the power to make Starknet (at least) 5 times bigger in the span of 6 months. They aren’t meant to add $2B TVL each, but they would change the reputation of Starknet and turn it into « the cool kid ».

Bridge LRTs to Starknet to raise awareness</strong></p>\n<p>Sadly, it’s a little bit late since ETHFI#1 is done and REZ#1 is going to be distributed in early may, it would have been perfect 3 months ago (when LRTs were only avalaible on Ethereum and Arbitrum). But it still is a no brainer !</p>\n<p>LRTs is THE defi trend of 2024. People right now want to play with eETH (<a href=\"http://ether.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a>), ezETH (Renzo), rswETH (Swell) and many others. EigenLayer could be one of the biggest airdrop of all times, and a whole new field of innovation. ETHFI <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> (etherfi) itself airdropped ~$300M to users. So, hype is real for sure !</p>\n<p>Biggest LRTs (ezETH and eETH) ara available on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Mode, Base and Linea</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about Mode. It’s another useless L2, who only exists to launch a token (users are aware about that). TVL right now is $325M, with no native Mode token. Out of these 325M, ezETH is $141M ! That’s a 43 % !! And we could add eETH and Stone…</p>\n<p>Bridging LRTs right now would not incease Starknet TVL by $500M obviously (and it’s a bit late), but it would change people’s mind from « I have no airdrop, I hate you » to « okay, so I can farm 2 x Renzo (or whatever) + EigenLayer + Nostra (or whatever DeFi protocol) + Starknet <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span>, that’s cool ».</p>\n<p>Adding at least one top 4 LRT (etherfi, Renzo, Kelp, Swell) to Starknet would change people’s mind. Starknet wouldn’t look like this isolated pacific island, it would be like archipelago of Japan : independant, but close to Ethereum ecosystem</p>\n<p>Then, adding 1 or 2 exotic LRT would be cool, since it would be waaaay cheaper than on Ethereum. If peg is good, people will swap in order to farm something instead of just holding ETH on zkLend or whatever</p>\n<p>Exemple : Inception, Genesis, Claystak, Diva Staking</p>\n<p>(Since Starknet is not EVM, you’ll probably need to negociate a little bit with teams in order to guarantee users would get their points/airdrop)</p>\n<p>I would personnaly farm LRTs on Starknet, instead of holding useless ETH.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/1/3/134445c2416eb039896c6d9a538574f9e71314eb.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/2KrlovtfhU0FGlmWBKQwZlXifov.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"eigenlayer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/1/3/134445c2416eb039896c6d9a538574f9e71314eb_2_690x382.jpeg\" alt=\"eigenlayer\" data-base62-sha1=\"2KrlovtfhU0FGlmWBKQwZlXifov\" width=\"690\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/1/3/134445c2416eb039896c6d9a538574f9e71314eb_2_690x382.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/1/3/134445c2416eb039896c6d9a538574f9e71314eb_2_1035x573.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/1/3/134445c2416eb039896c6d9a538574f9e71314eb_2_1380x764.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1F2023\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Who doesn’t love Eigen points ?</em><p></p>\n<p><strong>2. Add a Pendle-like protocol to make people happy</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, Starknet is supposed to be neutral so I might be wrong, but Abdel asked about ideas so here are mines.</p>\n<p>Pendle is the pinacle of 2024 DeFi : it’s super-powerfull, kind of hard to understand, but can change lives. That’s what people love !</p>\n<p>A whale can use Pendle to earn +6 % ETH in only 2 months. A shrimp (such a me) can use Pendle to earn +$10k airdrops in 6 months. That’s what is so incredible with yield markets.</p>\n<p>After bridging LRTs to Starknet, people would need to play with it. Providing liquidity/lending is cool, but it’s not hard enought for some people, we are not in 2021 anymore. So, people (including me) are using Pendle to farm 15 times faster. Others are making a juicy +40 % APR yield on eth (wich is incredible, it’s 10 times higher than staking rewards).</p>\n<p>Using a yield market can be tricky when you’re a newbie, so I would suggest to copy/paste the frontend of Pendle. It would reduce friction a lot</p>\n<p>PENDLE market cap is <span class=\"math\">600M right now, token made a 100x. So, buying PENDLE months ago was a juicy move. Having a yield market would directly increase Starknet attractiveness, since users would have a brand new (juicy?) airdrop to farm. Many people are affraid Ekubo/Nostra/Avnu airdrops will be disapointed (let say, 140</span> for 6 months lending/LP). From a marketing POV, we need a Jito-like airdrop : huge amounts, to not-so-many people. That’s exacty what Pendle is : huge amounts, not-so-many people.</p>\n<p>And, obviously, it would still be used after LRTs trend fade, in order to farm new things and new protocols (such as Ethena recently)</p>\n<p>DEX/money markets were 2021 DeFi essentials.

Connect to Hyperlane for the HYPE</strong></p>\n<p>Not sure about this one, but Hyperlane is a thriving protocol. People are using it to farm HYPE airdrop, but bridging throught Hyperlane is also very quick (and not so expansive). Since it’s permissionless, you don’t need to pay in order to use it (as a protocol). And it’s chain agnostic, it can be used on an EVM chain, a Cosmos chain, etc. So why not a Cairo VM chain <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Connecting Starknet to Hyperlane would have 2 effects :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>1 : Starknet is more and more integrated to Ethereum and other chains (sorry, but native bridging and Orbiter bridging feel so bad for 99 % of users)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>2 : people farming Hyperlane airdrop are going from time to time on Starknet. Hyperlane is hyped now, but « we are still early », so it’s not late at all.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>BONUS : more ideas to pump Starknet</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a ve(3,3) DEX with a nice frontend such as Aerodrome. Always a good idea to increase TVL/volume/reputation by making a 50x on one token, but I have to say I don’t really like them</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>an order-book DEX just as Mangrove Exchange. Way less hyped than a ve(3,3), but also more interesting from an innovation point of view</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>make « unruggable meme » looks more like Pinksale (<a href=\"https://www.pinksale.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.pinksale.finance/</a>). Unruggable is a great idea, but for now it doesn’t help degens buying memecoins with live-charts and all that stuff</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a leverage farming protocol and/or an autocompounder (such as Alpaca or Beefy). Not so usefull when fees are 1 cent, no hype about it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a delta-neutral stablecoin such as Ethena. I don’t really like it, stablecoins are not supposed to be degen. Probably not the first thing to create, but it could be a great extender when training wheel is already moving</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>create new things ! Way more difficult to talk about it because I’m not deep into tech, but things like Kakarot zkEVM or Madara could be very interesting from a user POV. We don’t HAVE to make it about points/airdrop or whatever, but seeing new things being built make people happy <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, here are my ideas for Starknet, I hope it could help. I’m not a tech guy so I can’t build it, but I would love to beta test any of your work. I like Starknet and I hold my STRK airdrop, so I would love to see it thrive and reach $5 or $10 billions TVL</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/original/3X/a/0/a0ee40133e68549a88542e61721a5b4edfcf129d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/mXEQkZM9ZuVznzbpsMN6ujJBw9D.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Pararescue.training_exercise\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/a/0/a0ee40133e68549a88542e61721a5b4edfcf129d_2_690x492.jpeg\" alt=\"Pararescue.training_exercise\" data-base62-sha1=\"mXEQkZM9ZuVznzbpsMN6ujJBw9D\" width=\"690\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/a/0/a0ee40133e68549a88542e61721a5b4edfcf129d_2_690x492.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/a/0/a0ee40133e68549a88542e61721a5b4edfcf129d_2_1035x738.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/starknet1/optimized/3X/a/0/a0ee40133e68549a88542e61721a5b4edfcf129d_2_1380x984.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"8C9799\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Hostages are safe boss !</em><p></p>\n<p>Disclaimer : I’m a retail, I’m not part of any team.
