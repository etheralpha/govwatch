Another key concern is the overhead on nodes for verifying and importing the inclusion list, as well as the proposer’s need to update its block-building process to satisfy the inclusion list. These aspects require careful consideration and design to ensure efficiency and security.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-50013-open-questions-30\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-50013-open-questions-30\"></a>Open Questions</h1>\n<p>Based on the above, we outline several open questions that will influence how the specification is written:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Block Not Satisfying the Evaluation Function</strong>: How should a block that fails the inclusion list evaluation function be handled, and what design considerations come into play for such conditions?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should it be treated similarly to blobs and <strong>cannot be imported</strong>?</li>\n<li>Should it <strong>not be filtered</strong> by fork choice?</li>\n<li>Should it <strong>not be valid</strong> in the state transition function?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inclusion List Equivocations</strong>: If an inclusion list committee member sends different versions of the inclusion list to different nodes, and they are all propagated across the network, what are the consequences of this action? How could such behavior negatively impact the proposer building the next block?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proposer Already Building on a Different Head</strong>: If the proposer builds on a different head than the one sent by the inclusion list committee, and thus needs to change its head view, what are the consequences of this action for block validity and proposer behavior?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inclusion List Transactions Invalidations</strong>: Local inclusion list transactions can be invalidated in a few ways. Even if these transactions are invalidated, the block should still be able to satisfy the evaluation function. Transactions may be invalidated as multiple inclusion lists merge with each other or with transactions in the block. Besides typical nonce checking, account abstraction introduces new ways for transactions to be invalidated, as balance can be drained with a static nonce. How much additional simulation a block builder needs to perform due to transaction invalidation and how much this affects its CPU compute remains to be seen for both MEV-Boost actors and local builders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proposer’s Observation of the IL Committee Subnet</strong>: The proposer monitors the inclusion list committee subnet to know when it is ready to construct the aggregate. There are two design approaches here, and it’s worth considering them further. The first approach is a greedy proposer, where the proposer waits until <code>t=9</code>, gathers as many ILs as possible, sends them to the EL, and the EL updates its block. The second approach is a selective proposer, where the proposer waits until it has a sufficient inclusion list to satisfy the eval function, sends them to the EL, and can do this in less than <code>t=9s</code> or even earlier. The question is whether the second approach justifies the optimization to allow the proposer to release the inclusion list aggregate earlier. The second approach may only be well suited for an IL with its own dedicated gas limit.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/focil-resource-design-considerations/20457\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/focil-resource-design-considerations/20457","pubDate":"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 14:30:43 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-20457"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/focil-resource-design-considerations/20457.rss","#text":"FOCIL Resource Design Considerations"}},{"title":"Trusted Advantage in Slot Auction ePBS","dc:creator":"Julian","category":"Economics","description":"<p><em>Thanks to Thomas Thiery, Anders Elowsson and Barnabé Monnot for reviewing this post. Also, thanks to everyone in the <a href=\"https://rig.ethereum.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Robust Incentives Group</a> and the ePBS Breakout Call <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#9</span> attendees for discussions. This post’s argument was presented during the ePBS Breakout Call <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#9</span> (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/2BUsiUnUZYc?si=6pbGlXJ-nkRK2dh9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">recording</a>; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-MnAqDzR7JapIPpUEbScALEtY5axyRcPgJDpgaJ_qVI/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">slides</a>).</em></p>\n<p>ePBS facilitates the fair exchange between a beacon proposer and a block producer. A block producer is the party that constructs the execution payload, which could be a sophisticated builder or a proposer. The beacon proposer sells the rights to build an execution payload to a block producer in exchange for a bid. The <strong>Unconditional Payment</strong> and <strong>Honest Builder Safety</strong> <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@potuz/rJ9GCnT1C#Optional-changes\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">are two desiderata</a> of this fair exchange. The former means that a proposer must receive the bid’s value regardless of the block producer’s actions. The latter roughly implies the block producer must receive the execution payload rights if it paid for them. The final desideratum is that there is <strong>No Trusted Advantage.</strong> In this context, we define this final desideratum as follows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>(Definition) No Trusted Advantage</strong>: The beacon proposer is incentivized to use the in-protocol commitment to commit to the block producer whose in-protocol bid value maximizes the beacon proposer’s utility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://mevboost.pics/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">most beacon proposers run</a> MEV-Boost, it has become apparent that they want to outsource block building to sophisticated block producers. The No Trusted Advantage desideratum ensures that the commitment that beacon proposers use to outsource to block producers benefits from the Unconditional Payment and Honest Builder Safety guarantees that ePBS provides. Suppose an ePBS design does not satisfy No Trusted Advantage, then a rational beacon proposer may be incentivized to sell the execution payload construction rights or to receive payment for the sale via other commitments that do not have the trustless fair exchange properties of ePBS. The trust a rational beacon proposer must then pose in a third party hurts the credible neutrality of the network and defeats the purpose of ePBS.</p>\n<p>This post argues that the slot auction <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/payload-timeliness-committee-ptc-an-epbs-design/16054#proposer-initiated-splitting-18\">Payload-timeliness committee (PTC)</a> ePBS design does not satisfy No Trusted Advantage. We will present an informal model in which a rational proposer outsources execution payload construction via another commitment than the commitment facilitated via ePBS. In practice, this attack means that a proposer will not use ePBS as intended. Instead, the beacon proposer waits until the execution payload must be revealed and sells the execution payload construction rights via an out-of-protocol block auction, like how MEV-Boost currently works.</p>\n<p>In the slot auction Payload-timeliness committee (PTC) ePBS design, a beacon proposer commits to a block producer at the beginning of the slot (t = 0). The block producer must reveal its execution payload halfway into the slot (t = 6). This time difference exists because a block producer must be able to observe attestations for the beacon block so that it knows that the beacon block will likely become canonical, ensuring Honest Builder Safety.</p>\n<p>Consider a proposer that decides whether to sell the execution payload construction rights Early (t = 0) or Late (t = 6). The proposer must decide which auction it will use at time t = 0, and it can only choose one auction format. If the proposer is incentivized to sell Early, slot auction ePBS satisfies No Trusted Advantage. If the proposer is incentivized to sell Late, No Trusted Advantage is violated since the proposer would commit to itself in the beacon block and run a MEV-Boost-like auction just before t = 6. Assume the proposer maximizes its payoff.</p>\n<p>Builders also bid to maximize payoffs. At the beginning of the block, builders only know the distribution of values they could extract by building the execution payload. Just before t = 6, builders learn the precise value they could extract by building an execution payload called the realized value.</p>\n<p>If the proposer were to host an auction Early, builders would bid based on their distribution of values; specifically, risk-neutral builders would bid according to the expected value. If the proposer hosts an auction Late, builders bid based on their realized value. This post assumes bids are monotonically increasing in value. The critical insight is that the expected auction revenue is likely higher based on realized value than expected values under many circumstances. This is because only the highest-order statistics of realized values are relevant.</p>\n<p>Considering an ascending-bid first-price auction, the winning builder should pay the builder’s value with the second-highest valuation. Hence, if the second-highest expected value in the Early auction is lower than the expectation of the second-highest realized value, then the proposer will choose to sell via the Late auction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>(Main Result) Slot Auction ePBS does not satisfy No Trusted Advantage:</strong> In an ascending-bid first-price auction, a rational beacon proposer will auction the execution payload construction rights via the Late auction if the second-highest expected value (Early auction revenue) is lower than the expectation of the second-highest realized value (Late auction expected revenue). <strong>In this case, slot auction ePBS does not satisfy No Trusted Advantage.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This result relies on two key assumptions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The beacon proposer has access to a secondary market to sell the execution payload construction rights to block producers in the Late auction.</li>\n<li>Block producers have less access to a secondary market for selling the execution payload construction rights to other block producers in the Late auction than the beacon proposer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the first assumption does not hold, then the beacon proposer effectively has no option to sell in the Late auction. A secondary market will likely be available to the beacon proposer since this market already exists via MEV-Boost. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/874767108809031740/1284179164672426118\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Terence has argued</a> that ePBS makes same-slot unbundling attacks easier if a beacon proposer were to sell Late because a beacon proposer could release equivocation execution payloads without losing fork-choice weight or being slashed.</p>\n<p>The second assumption could be motivated by the complexity of facilitating trust between two sophisticated parties. Perhaps relays are less willing to facilitate fair exchange between two sophisticated parties. Perhaps block producers will continuously request bids from bidders in the secondary market, whereas today, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/bid-cancellations-considered-harmful/15500\">proposers do not</a>. Perhaps <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PXGPFFneMI\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">adverse selection</a> is worse if the auctioneer is sophisticated.</p>\n<p>Suppose the second assumption does not hold, and the beacon proposer and builders have equal access to the secondary market. In that case, the beacon proposer’s decision to sell in the Early or the Late auction is a risk-reward trade-off. This is because a block producer would then incorporate the value it could get by reselling the item in the secondary market in its bid, which would be equivalent to the value a beacon proposer could get. If the beacon proposer is less risk-averse than builders, it will sell in the Late auction; otherwise, it will sell in the Early auction.</p>\n<p>The key point is that whether ePBS is used—whether No Trusted Advantage is satisfied—depends on the risk appetite of beacon proposers and the state of the secondary market if ePBS were deployed with slot auctions. Yet it is entirely unclear what these proposers’ risk appetite or the secondary market’s state will be. In contrast, MEV-Boost has given the ecosystem <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10634354\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a</a> <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=XMBR5UEo3f\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">lot</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01329\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">of</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13931\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">information</a> on how block auctions work, providing confidence in it satisfying No Trusted Advantage.</p>\n<p>Satisfying No Trusted Advantage in slot auction ePBS is challenging. This desideratum could be achieved by forcing a sale in the early auction, for example, using MEV-Burn. <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/barnabe.eth/QJ6W0mmyOwjec-2zuH6lZb0iEI2aYFB9gE-LHWIMzjQ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Execution Auctions</a> use <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-burn-a-simple-design/15590\">MEV-Burn</a>. Whether MEV-Burn is sufficient to satisfy the No Trusted Advantage is still understudied.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This argument could be pivotal in whether ePBS is deployed with block or slot auctions.

However, different builders can have different amounts of resources. The interest of rational builders is to guarantee that data will be considered available while spending a minimal amount of resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Assumption 3) Validator Nodes (VNs) are the primary entities of DAS protocol:</strong> A single Validator Node (VN) performs only a single sampling operation (as one entity), independent of the number of validators it hosts.</p>\n<p><strong>Assumption 4) Dishonest Majority:</strong> A majority (or even supermajority) of VNs and builders can be malicious and, therefore, may not follow the protocol correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>Assumption 5) Sybil-resistance</strong> <strong>VNs</strong>: An honest VN can use a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ethresear.ch/t/proof-of-validator-a-simple-anonymous-credential-scheme-for-ethereums-dht/16454&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1726244230018106&amp;usg=AOvVaw2S4QQ8d0c8zadKQKbVBQ6W\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Proof-of-Validator</a> scheme to prove that it hosts at least one validator. If multiple nodes attempt to re-use the same proof, they can be blocklisted by other honest nodes and builders.</p>\n<p>Below are the objectives of PANDAS:</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 1)</strong> <strong>Tight fork choice:</strong> <em>Honest validator nodes (VNs) complete</em> <em>random sampling</em> <em>before voting for a block, even when the</em> <em>majority of VNs are malicious</em>*.* Therefore, we target the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ethresear.ch/t/das-fork-choice/19578&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1726244230019035&amp;usg=AOvVaw0jtQl6ICcsg9iqBiQh4Mst\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">tight fork choice model</a>, which means that honest VNs in a slot’s committee must complete random sampling before voting <em>within four seconds</em> into that slot.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 2)</strong> <strong>Flexible builder seeding strategies:</strong> Given that different builders can have different resources, our design allows the block builder the flexibility to implement different blob distribution strategies, each with a different trade-off between security and resource usage. For higher security, the builder can send more copies of the blob’s cells to validator nodes, ensuring higher availability. Conversely, to minimise resource usage, the builder can distribute a single copy of each cell at most, reducing bandwidth usage at the expense of lower security. This flexible approach allows the builder to navigate the trade-off between ensuring data availability and optimising bandwidth while under the incentive for the block to be deemed available by validator nodes to be accepted.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 3) Allowing Inconsistent Node Views:</strong> Our objective is to ensure that the VNs and the builders are not required to reach a consensus on the list of VNs. While we aim for the VNs and builders to generally agree on the set of VNs in the system, it is not necessary for the VNs to maintain strictly consistent views or for the builders’ and VNs’ views to be fully synchronised.</p>\n<p><strong>PANDAS Design</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Continuous Peer Discovery:</strong> To achieve Objective 3, the nodes in the system perform continuous peer discovery in parallel to the protocol phases below to maintain an up-to-date “view” containing other peers. <em>The builder</em> and the VNs aim to discover all the VNs with a valid <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ethresear.ch/t/proof-of-validator-a-simple-anonymous-credential-scheme-for-ethereums-dht/16454&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1726244230020521&amp;usg=AOvVaw1-IdEEIXKyEqrBkmFcpdG1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Proof-of-Validator</a>. We expect both the builder and VNs to have a close but not perfect view of all the VNs in the system.</p>\n<p>A membership service running the peer discovery protocol inserts new (verified) VNs to the view and eventually converges to a complete set of VNs. Peer discovery messages are piggybacked to sample request messages to reduce discovery overhead.</p>\n<p>PANDAS protocol has two (uncoordinated) phases, which repeat during each slot:</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>) Seeding,</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2)</strong> Row/Column Consolidation and Sampling</p>\n<p>In the seeding phase, the builder pushes subsets of row/columns directly to the VNs where row/column assignment is based on a deterministic function. Once a VN receives its samples from the builder, it consolidates the entire row/column it is assigned to (by requesting missing cells from other VNs assigned to the corresponding row/column) and simultaneously performs random sampling.</p>\n<p>VNs do not coordinate to start consolidating and sampling. Therefore, a node finishing phase 1 can begin phase 2 immediately without coordinating with other nodes. The VNs who are the committee members of a slot must complete seeding and random sampling within 4 seconds into the slot.</p>\n<p>Below, we explain the two phases of our protocol in detail.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1- Seeding</strong>: The builder assigns VNs to individual rows/columns using a deterministic function that uses a hashspace as we explain below. This mapping of VNs to individual rows/columns is dynamic and changes in each slot. The mapping allows nodes to locally and deterministically map nodes to rows/columns without requiring the number or full list of nodes to be known.</p>\n<p>The Builder prepares and distributes seed samples to the VNs as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>1.a) <em>Mapping Rows/Columns to static regions in the hashspace:</em></strong> The individual rows and columns are assigned static regions in the hashspace as shown in the upper portion of Figure 1.</p>\n<p><strong>1.b)</strong> <em><strong>Mapping VNs to a hashspace</strong></em> <em>:</em> The builder uses a sortition function F<sub>NODE</sub>(NodeID, epoch, slot, R) to assign each VN to a key in the hashspace. The function takes parameters such as NodeID, which is the identifier of the node (i.e., peer ID), epoch and slot numbers, and a random value R derived from the header of the block header from the previous slot.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/8/48bcaeee1eef51ab1128caf78e0d29d6d54dbe7e.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/48bcaeee1eef51ab1128caf78e0d29d6d54dbe7e\" title=\"image3\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/8/48bcaeee1eef51ab1128caf78e0d29d6d54dbe7e_2_690x352.png\" alt=\"image3\" data-base62-sha1=\"ansD3O8cW25kAkyM9W3uKgBEvXE\" width=\"690\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/8/48bcaeee1eef51ab1128caf78e0d29d6d54dbe7e_2_690x352.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/8/48bcaeee1eef51ab1128caf78e0d29d6d54dbe7e.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/8/48bcaeee1eef51ab1128caf78e0d29d6d54dbe7e.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E4E7E3\"></a></div><br>\n<strong>Figure 1:</strong> Assignment of Row samples to VNs.

A trade-off between resource usage and data availability exists for different distribution strategies. Consider the example in Figure 2 for distributing two rows. In one extreme case (on the left), the builder distributes the entire row 1 to each VN in the row’s region for improved data availability at the expense of higher resource usage. In another extreme case, the builder sends non-overlapping row pieces of row 6 to each VN in that row’s region, which requires fewer resources but results in less availability of individual cells.</p>\n<p>We are currently evaluating different distribution strategies, including ones that can deterministically map individual cells of rows/columns to individual VNs in the row/column’s region.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The builder is only involved in the Seeding phase.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/d/2d447780eca05e1064f2f780b7a1dcaad92a386e.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/2d447780eca05e1064f2f780b7a1dcaad92a386e\" title=\"image1\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/d/2d447780eca05e1064f2f780b7a1dcaad92a386e_2_690x374.png\" alt=\"image1\" data-base62-sha1=\"6ssaT91AfZVDaylQxsVU0XoLR82\" width=\"690\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/d/2d447780eca05e1064f2f780b7a1dcaad92a386e_2_690x374.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/d/2d447780eca05e1064f2f780b7a1dcaad92a386e.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/d/2d447780eca05e1064f2f780b7a1dcaad92a386e.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEAED\"></a></div><br>\n<strong>Figure 2:</strong> Two (extreme) strategies to distribute row samples to the VNs in the corresponding row’s region.<p></p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2- Row/Column Consolidation and Sampling</strong>: VNs that are part of the current slot’s committee aim to complete random sampling within the slot’s first four seconds (i.e., voting deadline).

VN14 knows to send a request to VN78 to retrieve cell one based on the knowledge of the mapping F<sub>NODE</sub>.<p></p>\n<p>At the same time, sending requests to all peers holding copies will lead to an explosion of messages in the network and bear the risk of congestion. Fetching must, therefore, seek a tradeoff between the use of parallel and redundant requests on the one hand and latency constraints on the other hand. Our approach employs an adaptive cell-fetching strategy using direct communication between nodes through a UDP-based (connectionless) protocol. The fetching algorithm can tolerate losses and offline nodes.</p>\n<p><strong>2.b) VN Row/Column Consolidation:</strong> If a VN receives less than half of the cells of its assigned row or column from the builder (as a consequence of the builder’s chosen distribution strategy), it requests the missing cells from other VNs. A VN requests cells from only the VNs assigned to the same row/column’s region during row/column consolidation. When a VN has half of the cells of a row or column, it can locally reconstruct the entire row or column.</p>\n<p><em>The Rationale for Consolidating Row/Column:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Reconstructing missing cells</em>: while performing row/column sampling, VNs reconstruct missing cells.</li>\n<li><em>To boost the availability of cells</em>: Given the deterministic mapping (F<sub>NODE</sub>), the builder can choose any distribution strategy to send subsets of rows and columns to the VNs. Row/Column consolidation aims to improve the availability of samples so that random sampling can be completed on time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ideally, the builder should select a seed sample distribution strategy that enables VNs to consolidate rows and columns efficiently. To facilitate this, the builder can push each VN a map (together with the seed samples) that details how individual cells of a row/column are assigned to VNs within that row/column’s region as part of the builder’s distribution strategy. With this map, VNs can quickly identify and retrieve missing cells to reconstruct a complete row, thereby improving the availability of the data.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In some DAS approaches, the term ‘row/column sampling’ refers to nodes retrieving multiple rows and columns before voting on the availability of the blob. In our approach, nodes retrieve rows and columns to enhance data availability, supporting validators who must perform random sampling before they vote.</p>\n<p>We refer to this as ‘row/column consolidation’ instead of ‘row/column sampling’ because in PANDAS, committee members vote based on random sampling, and they do not directly sample entire rows or columns.</p>\n<p><strong>What about Regular Nodes (RNs)?</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike VNs, RNs do not obtain seed row/column samples from the builder. The builder sends initial seed samples to a Sybil-resistant group of VNs that use the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ethresear.ch/t/proof-of-validator-a-simple-anonymous-credential-scheme-for-ethereums-dht/16454&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1726244230030492&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FE6AN3DjFuibklaNwyDPO\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Proof-of-Validator</a> scheme. There is currently no mechanism for RNs to prove that they are not Sybils; therefore, the initial distribution of samples from the builder only uses VNs.</p>\n<p>Using the public deterministic function F<sub>NODE</sub>, RNs can be similarly mapped to individual row/column regions. Once mapped to a region, RNs can (optionally) perform row/column consolidation to retrieve entire rows and columns and respond to queries for cells within their assigned region.</p>\n<p>Like other nodes, RNs must perform peer discovery. In general, RNs aim to discover all the VNs and can also seek to discover other RNs. Given the knowledge of other peers through peer discovery, RNs can perform random sampling through direct communication.

The protocol design leverages two key components: (i) an input list creation mechanism allowing committee members to pick non-overlapping transactions while maximizing their fees, and (ii) an auction mechanism allowing parties to ensure most of these input lists are included in the final output inclusion list. The former ensures many censored transactions are considered for inclusion, and the latter employs competition where including as many of the input lists as possible is incentivized to produce the output inclusion list.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49946-introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>The centralized builder ecosystem of Ethereum today has led to ~2 builders with the power to decide <em>which</em> transactions are posted on Ethereum. This centralization leads to censorship concerns since the builders have complete authority over which transactions are included. The current solution proposed (and rejected) by Ethereum (<a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7547\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP 7547</a>) requires the current proposer to determine the <em>inclusion list</em> (or the set of censored transactions) to be included by the next proposer. Such a proposer also acts as a single point of failure, which can easily be bribed to exclude transactions. This has led to proposals such as <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-more-the-less-censored-introducing-committee-enforced-inclusion-sets-comis-on-ethereum/18835\">COMIS</a> and <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870\">FOCIL</a> that require inputs from multiple proposers to be aggregated to form the inclusion list.</p>\n<p>Intuitively, using multiple proposers implies the need to bribe multiple parties for a transaction to be excluded. However, do all parties include the transaction in the first place? Since the resulting inclusion list is finite (limited to block size), <em>how do each of these parties decide which transactions to include in their local list such that maximizing the utility also increases the system’s throughput?</em> Moreover, when aggregating the transactions to produce the inclusion list, how many points of failure can be bribed to exclude transactions? This post introduces a multi-proposer design called AUCIL to address these questions.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49946-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Let’s first motivate the first part as to how the inclusion lists should be created. For existing inclusion list designs, the intricate assumption is that an IL Proposer can include as many transactions as it sees. While <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870\">FOCIL</a> or <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-more-the-less-censored-introducing-committee-enforced-inclusion-sets-comis-on-ethereum/18835\">COMIS</a>, leave the proposal of transactions in Local Inclusion List underspecified, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13321\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Fox et al.</a> assumes that there is no network congestion. However, including all the transactions could lead to a scenario where the size of the inclusion list is larger than the block size. In such a scenario, the builder (constrained by transactions in the Inclusion List) would add as many transactions as possible, dropping any leftover transactions in the inclusion list.</p>\n<p>The first thing to note above is that for an IL Proposer, it never makes sense to add more transactions than the block size, and thus, there could be an implicit block space size constraint (<span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{L}</span>) on the Local Inclusion List (We would refer to these as Input Lists).</p>\n<p>Now, consider that the proposer is passive (i.e., rational but does not accept a bribe). Since each input could be size <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{L}</span>, the resulting union of lists could be of size <span class=\"math\">\\geq \\mathcal{L}</span>. Now, the builder (or proposer without the PBS) is constrained to pick transactions from the Inclusion List; it would pick the top <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{L}</span> paying transactions, and the rest would not execute. Thus, the inclusion list proposers would only want to include the top <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{L}</span> transactions. Thus, all the previous analysis made for inclusion lists with a scale factor of the number of inclusion list proposers holds in this case (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13321\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Fox et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870\">FOCIL</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-more-the-less-censored-introducing-committee-enforced-inclusion-sets-comis-on-ethereum/18835\">COMIS</a>).</p>\n<p>However, things look very different in the presence of a bribing adversary. Consider that one party is bribed enough (we will quantify this at the end of paragraph) to exclude a top <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{L}</span> paying transaction and instead replace it with <span class=\"math\">(\\mathcal{L}+1)^{th}</span> transaction. The builder now receives an inclusion list with <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{L}+1</span> transactions and can choose any transaction to exclude. The adversary can further bribe the builder to exclude the target transaction. Since there is one extra transaction in the list, the block can be formed without violating the properties of an inclusion list (All transactions are executed, or the block space is full). Coming back to the incentives for the party, if it is the only party that deviates from picking top <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{L}</span> transactions, then it would be the only recipient of the fee from <span class=\"math\">(\\mathcal{L}+1)^{th}</span> transaction. This may be larger than the utility received (if <span class=\"math\">f_t</span> for the target transaction is not <span class=\"math\">n</span> times larger than <span class=\"math\">f_{\\mathcal{L}+1}</span> for the inserted transaction). Even in the worst case, the bribe required would be slightly larger than <span class=\"math\">f_t/n</span>.</p>\n<p>All in all, the property of inclusion list that allows the transaction to be excluded if the block is full is a property the design in this post wishes to avoid. Thus, we would restrict the size of input lists to less than <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{L}/n</span> such that even if all parties propose unique transactions, the size of the inclusion list is less than the available block size.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#footnote-49946-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-49946-1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>There could exist other solutions to this problem like cumulative non-expiring inclusion list and unconditional inclusion lists, however, these require additional state support, where parties would have to keep track of previous inclusion lists.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#footnote-49946-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-49946-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>As for the other question of how many points of failure exist while using multi-proposer designs, aggregation of lists from all parties is the most critical point of failure, which hasn’t yet been adequately studied. Fox et al. sidestep this by never truly aggregating and assuming that the proposer’s inputs would be included without truly analyzing the problem. In COMIS, the aggregator role is formalized, and they assume that this role is trusted for their analysis. FOCIL removes this assumption by using the proposer of the next block and keeping the point of failure in check with the committee of attesters. However, relying on attesters comes with its share of problems. Attesters are not incentivized to verify; as long as they vote with other attesters, they receive rewards without the risk of a penalty. Using attesters to compute is thus more unreliable than relying on the attesters to confirm the existence of the block or verify a proof as used in this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49946-model-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-model-4\"></a>Model</h1>\n<p>In this post, we consider all parties involved in consensus as rational, i.e., trying to maximize the value they receive through transaction fees, consensus, or bribery. We will call each party collectively proposing the inclusion list as an IL Proposer and their input as an input list. We will refer to the aggregator as the party that computes a union of these input lists to create an inclusion list. Differing from previous proposals, we assume that the input list size of each party is constrained. The size of an input list can be at most <span class=\"math\">k \\leq \\mathcal{L}/n</span>, as mentioned in the previous section. The total number of IL proposers is considered to be <span class=\"math\">n</span>. Each transaction <span class=\"math\">tx_i</span> pays a fee of <span class=\"math\">f_i</span> for inclusion in the inclusion list, which is paid to the IL Proposer(s) that include it (chosen by the user independently from the base fee and Ethereum transaction fee). If the transaction repeats across multiple input lists, the fee is equally divided amongst all the IL Proposers that included it tracably on-chain.</p>\n<p>We assume an external adversary with a budget such that it can bribe parties to take adversarial actions.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49946-problem-statement-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-problem-statement-5\"></a>Problem Statement</h1>\n<p>The problem setting consists of <span class=\"math\">n</span> rational parties who locally have access to a set of censored transactions (<span class=\"math\">M_i</span>) that are continually updated (their mempool). Let <span class=\"math\">M = \\cap_i M_i</span>. The problem is to create a list of <em>valid</em> transactions with each party contributing a share of transactions it observes. </p>\n<p><strong>Adversarial model.</strong> We assume each of the <span class=\"math\">n</span> parties is rational, i.e., they maximize their utility. We assume a bribing adversary will bribe these parties to censor one or more transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Definition (<span class=\"math\">(b,p,T)</span>-Censorship Resistance.)</strong> We say that a protocol is <em><span class=\"math\">(b,p,T)</span>-censorship resistant</em> if given a budget <span class=\"math\">b</span> to an external adversary for bribing parties, for all transactions <span class=\"math\">t \\in T(M)</span> at least <span class=\"math\">p</span> parties output a list which contains all the transactions in <span class=\"math\">T(M)</span>.</p>\n<p>The protocol design aims to maximize <span class=\"math\">b</span> for a fixed <span class=\"math\">p</span> and <span class=\"math\">|T(M)|</span>. More concretely, in non-multi-proposer inclusion list design schemes, <span class=\"math\">b</span> is typically <span class=\"math\">O(f)</span>, but our protocol aims to obtain <span class=\"math\">b = O(n\\cdot f)</span>.</p>\n<p>To facilitate understanding of the goal, <span class=\"math\">T(M)</span> can be considered the “feasible” subset of transactions in <span class=\"math\">M</span>, e.g., those paying sufficiently high fees subject to a space limit. The definition of <span class=\"math\">T</span> depends on the protocol we implement, and it is justified why such a <span class=\"math\">T</span> is used.</p>\n<p>In our protocol, we assume that <span class=\"math\">M_i = M</span>. When <span class=\"math\">M_i \\neq M</span>, our protocol does not satisfy the definition since it may output a higher paying transaction that appears in some <span class=\"math\">M_i</span> at the expense of some lower paying transaction in the intersection</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49946-input-list-creation-mechanism-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-input-list-creation-mechanism-6\"></a>Input List Creation Mechanism</h1>\n<p>The first question we address is how IL Proposers select transactions for their input lists. A simple approach is for IL Proposers to naively choose the transactions that pay the highest fees, regardless of the actions of others. However, this greedy approach is not a Nash equilibrium. If all other IL Proposers are greedily selecting transactions, the rational choice for any IL Proposer might not be to do the same. <strong>Table 1</strong> illustrates this point.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Strategy</th>\n<th>Objects Picked</th>\n<th>Utility</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Pick Top Paying</td>\n<td><span class=\"math\">(o_1,o_2)</span></td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alternate</td>\n<td><span class=\"math\">(o_3,o_4)</span></td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Table 1</strong>: Picking top-paying objects is not a Nash equilibrium. Consider transactions <span class=\"math\">(\\{o_1,o_2,o_3,o_4,o_5,o_6\\})</span> with utilities <span class=\"math\">(\\{11, 10, 9, 6, 4, 3\\})</span> respectively and three players with max size input list of 2. Other players are assumed to follow the strategy of picking the top-paying transaction.</p>\n<p>A more viable approach is to use mixed strategies, where each party selects transactions based on a predefined probability distribution. Deviating from this distribution would result in lower expected revenue. However, a mixed Nash equilibrium may not be sufficient, especially in games where players can wait to observe others’ actions before deciding. Thus, this post explores a correlated equilibrium instead.</p>\n<p>A correlated equilibrium is a situation where each player is suggested specific actions, and deviating from these suggestions leads to lower utility, assuming others follow the suggestions. To prevent centralization (by asking a single known party to send recommendations), we propose a well-known algorithm that each party can run locally to simulate these suggested actions. Deviating from the algorithm would result in lower utility for the deviating party.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49946-algorithm-1-a-greedy-algorithm-for-transaction-inclusion-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-algorithm-1-a-greedy-algorithm-for-transaction-inclusion-7\"></a>Algorithm 1: A Greedy Algorithm for Transaction Inclusion</h3>\n<p><strong>Input</strong>: <span class=\"math\">( n \\geq 0 )</span>, <span class=\"math\">( m \\geq 0 )</span>, <span class=\"math\">( k \\geq 0 )</span>  (number of players, transactions, input list size)</p>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>: <span class=\"math\">( L_i )</span> arrays for all <span class=\"math\">( i \\in P )</span> (final inclusion lists for each player)</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"math\">P \\gets [1,\\dots,n]</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">U \\gets [u_1,\\dots, u_m]</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">N \\gets [1,\\dots,1]</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">\\forall i \\in P: L_i \\gets [1,\\dots,1]</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">l \\gets 0</span></li>\n<li><strong>while</strong> <span class=\"math\">l &lt; k</span>  <strong>do</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"math\">i \\gets 0</span></li>\n<li><strong>while</strong> <span class=\"math\">i &lt; n</span> <strong>do</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"math\">U_{curr} \\gets (U \\otimes L_i) \\oslash N</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">s \\gets argmax(U_{curr})</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">L_{i}[s] \\gets 0</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">N[s] \\gets N[s] + 1</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">i \\gets i + 1</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>end while</strong></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">l \\gets l + 1</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>end while</strong></li>\n<li><strong>return</strong> <span class=\"math\">\\forall i \\in P: L_i</span></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>This algorithm iteratively updates each player’s transaction inclusion status.

All parties are first numbered randomly. Since the randomness needs to be the same across all parties, a random seed is agreed upon before the start of the protocol. All parties are assigned items greedily, one at a time. Each party picks the item that gives the maximum utility at that instant. To do so, it computes the current utility of all objects yet to be chosen <span class=\"math\">\\left((U \\otimes L_i) \\oslash N\\right)</span>. The first <span class=\"math\">(U \\otimes L_i)</span> makes the utility of all objects already chosen by <span class=\"math\">i</span> as 0, and then <span class=\"math\">\\oslash N</span> divides by the number of parties sharing the object if party <span class=\"math\">i</span> decides to pick that object. The list of objects the party picks is updated (0 implies the object is chosen), and the number of parties picking the object is also updated. The procedure is repeated <span class=\"math\">k</span> times such that each party picks <span class=\"math\">k</span> objects. This protocol achieves a correlated equilibrium. Note that while the protocol assigns objects to parties one at a time, in practice, the output recommends all transactions to the parties at once.</p>\n<p>This protocol provably achieves a correlated equilibrium while also achieving a notion of game-theoretic-fairness properties (almost equal distribution of fee) (Paper to follow soon). The set of all transactions chosen by the input list creation algorithm is <span class=\"math\">T(M)</span>, for which we achieve <span class=\"math\">(b,p, T)</span>-censorship resistance through AUCIL, which follows.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49946-aggregation-of-input-lists-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-aggregation-of-input-lists-9\"></a>Aggregation of input lists</h1>\n<p>After creating input lists, the next step is to aggregate the lists to create an inclusion list for the next block. If a transaction appears in the inclusion list, it is constrained to appear in the next block. Since the space occupied by the input list is fixed, it cannot suffer from spam transactions since each transaction is confirmed valid (with an adequate base fee) right before the block that includes it.</p>\n<p>A standard way to approach this problem is to assign a party the role of an <em>aggregator</em>. This aggregator would compute the union of all the input lists and add it to the inclusion list. However, this aggregator is now a single point of failure. For instance, it may be the case that the aggregator may not receive input lists from all IL proposers and thus cannot be expected to add all input lists. However, if we consider this and only require it to include some threshold number of input lists, then the aggregator can strategically omit specific input lists and significantly reduce the required budget to censor transactions.</p>\n<p>So, what can be done in this case? <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870\">FOCIL</a> requires the proposer of the following block to include an inclusion list, a superset of local input lists. However, it still allows for some transactions to not be on the inclusion list (due to the threshold). Instead, we look at a different way to deal with this problem. We auction off the role of the aggregator; however, instead of paying a bid to win the role of the aggregator, the bids are the size of the inclusion list. Thus, if a party <span class=\"math\">P</span> proposes a larger inclusion list than all other parties, then <span class=\"math\">P</span> would be rewarded with the aggregator role and reward.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49946-algorithm-aucil-outline-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-algorithm-aucil-outline-10\"></a>Algorithm: AUCIL Outline</h3>\n<p><strong>Participants:</strong> All IL proposers <span class=\"math\">P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_n</span></p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-49946-step-1-il-proposers-broadcast-input-lists-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-step-1-il-proposers-broadcast-input-lists-11\"></a>Step 1: IL Proposers Broadcast Input Lists</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For each proposer <span class=\"math\">P_i</span>:\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"math\">P_i \\rightarrow_B</span> (broadcasts to all parties): <span class=\"math\">\\text{inpL}_i</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-49946-step-2-parties-aggregate-input-lists-into-an-inclusion-list-and-broadcast-it-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-step-2-parties-aggregate-input-lists-into-an-inclusion-list-and-broadcast-it-12\"></a>Step 2: Parties Aggregate Input Lists into an Inclusion List and Broadcast It</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For each party <span class=\"math\">P_j</span>:\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"math\">\\text{incL}_j = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \\text{inpL}_i</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">P_j \\rightarrow_B</span> (broadcasts to all parties):<span class=\"math\">\\left(\\text{incL}_j, \\ell_j = \\text{size}(\\text{incL}_j)\\right)</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-49946-step-3-proposer-selects-the-highest-bid-inclusion-list-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-step-3-proposer-selects-the-highest-bid-inclusion-list-13\"></a>Step 3: Proposer Selects the Highest Bid Inclusion List</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposer receives: <span class=\"math\">\\{(\\text{incL}_1, \\ell_1), (\\text{incL}_2,\\ell_2), \\ldots, (\\text{incL}_n,\\ell_n)\\}</span></li>\n<li>Proposer selects the highest bid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While <strong>Step 2</strong> has its incentives clear by introducing aggregation rewards (<span class=\"math\">u_a</span>), <strong>Step 1</strong> and <strong>Step 3</strong> are not incentive compatible.

Thus, <strong>Step 1</strong> is not incentive-compatible. Similarly, the proposer is not incentivized to pick the largest bid. Censorship in auctions (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13321\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Fox et al.</a>) has been studied and is easily applicable here. Thus, <strong>Step 3</strong> is also not incentive-compatible.</p>\n<p>Recall the definition of censorship resistance. If some protocol satisfies the definition of <span class=\"math\">(b,p, T)</span>-censorship resistance, then at least <span class=\"math\">p</span> parties output a non-censored inclusion list. Thus, we require the proposer to include proof of the included bid being greater than <span class=\"math\">n-p</span> other bids (e.g., including <span class=\"math\">n-p</span> bids). If the proposer fails to add such proof, the block would be considered invalid, thus making <strong>Step 3</strong> incentive compatible.</p>\n<p>We make the auction biased to deal with the problem of not broadcasting. First, observe that if no party is broadcasting its input list, then the probability of winning the auction for any party is very low; thus, broadcasting its input list at least yields the rewards from including the input list in making the inclusion list. Thus, if more people believe that keeping its input list private does not lead to a significant increase in the probability of winning, then parties would be incentivized to broadcast its input list.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/5/d5699e95fe4dfa9c4562533d720b3400e0a1805b.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/d5699e95fe4dfa9c4562533d720b3400e0a1805b\" title=\"AUCIL-Outline\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/5/d5699e95fe4dfa9c4562533d720b3400e0a1805b_2_690x420.png\" alt=\"AUCIL-Outline\" data-base62-sha1=\"urVZn8ssuyhGX2txzZdlFCvIevh\" width=\"690\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/5/d5699e95fe4dfa9c4562533d720b3400e0a1805b_2_690x420.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/5/d5699e95fe4dfa9c4562533d720b3400e0a1805b_2_1035x630.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/5/d5699e95fe4dfa9c4562533d720b3400e0a1805b_2_1380x840.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EFEFF0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49946-algorithm-aucil-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-algorithm-aucil-14\"></a>Algorithm: AUCIL</h3>\n<p><strong>Participants:</strong> All IL proposers <span class=\"math\">P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_n</span></p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-49946-step-0-il-proposers-generate-their-auction-bias-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-step-0-il-proposers-generate-their-auction-bias-15\"></a>Step 0: IL Proposers Generate Their Auction Bias</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For each proposer <span class=\"math\">P_i</span>:\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"math\">P_i</span> generates a random bias: <span class=\"math\">\\text{bias} \\gets \\text{VRF}(P_i, \\text{biasmax})</span></li>\n<li><em>(The bias is uniformly distributed between 0 and <span class=\"math\">\\text{biasmax}</span> and is added to the bid.)</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-49946-step-1-il-proposers-broadcast-input-lists-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-step-1-il-proposers-broadcast-input-lists-16\"></a>Step 1: IL Proposers Broadcast Input Lists</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For each proposer <span class=\"math\">P_i</span>:\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"math\">P_i \\rightarrow_B</span> (broadcasts to all parties): <span class=\"math\">\\text{inpL}_i</span></li>\n<li><em>(Proposers broadcast their input lists to all parties.)</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-49946-step-2-parties-aggregate-input-lists-into-an-inclusion-list-and-broadcast-it-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-step-2-parties-aggregate-input-lists-into-an-inclusion-list-and-broadcast-it-17\"></a>Step 2: Parties Aggregate Input Lists into an Inclusion List and Broadcast It</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For each party <span class=\"math\">P_j</span>:\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"math\">\\text{incL}_j = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{y_j} \\text{inpL}_i</span>\n<ul>\n<li><em>(where <span class=\"math\">y_j</span> is the number of input lists party <span class=\"math\">P_j</span> receives.)</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">P_j \\rightarrow_B</span> (broadcasts to all parties): <span class=\"math\">\\left(\\text{incL}_j, \\ell_j = y_j + \\text{bias}\\right)</span></li>\n<li><em>(Parties declare their bid with the added bias.)</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-49946-step-3-proposer-selects-the-highest-bid-inclusion-list-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-step-3-proposer-selects-the-highest-bid-inclusion-list-18\"></a>Step 3: Proposer Selects the Highest Bid Inclusion List</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposer receives: <span class=\"math\">\\{(\\text{incL}_1, \\ell_1), (\\text{incL}_2,\\ell_2), \\ldots, (\\text{incL}_n,\\ell_n)\\}</span></li>\n<li>Proposer selects the highest bid and adds it to the block <span class=\"math\">(\\text{incL},\\ell)</span>.</li>\n<li>Proposer adds proof that the highest bid is greater than <span class=\"math\">n-p</span> other bids.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-49946-step-4-attesters-vote-on-the-validity-of-the-block-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-step-4-attesters-vote-on-the-validity-of-the-block-19\"></a>Step 4: Attesters Vote on the Validity of the Block</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For each attester:\n<ul>\n<li>Attester receives: <span class=\"math\">\\{(\\text{incL}_1, \\ell_1), (\\text{incL}_2,\\ell_2), \\ldots, (\\text{incL}_n,\\ell_n)\\}</span> and <span class=\"math\">(\\text{incL},\\ell)</span></li>\n<li>Attester verifies the attached proof and votes only if the proof is correct.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Block is considered valid if it receives more than a threshold of votes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the above algorithm, we claim that the party is incentivized to broadcast the input list unless the bias drawn is greater than <span class=\"math\">\\text{biasmax} -1</span>.

For this, assume that a bribe is given to those IL Proposers who are assigned to include the target transaction. This bribe should be enough to ensure that the target transaction is excluded from each input list with probability 1. It is assumed (for now) that each of these IL Proposers would compute the union of all observed input lists in <strong>Step 3</strong>.</p>\n<p>Fox et al. analyze the bribe required for a multi-proposer scenario. In their case, it is assumed that the transaction repeats across all proposers. If a transaction pays a fee (higher fee for them) of <span class=\"math\">f_i</span>, then the adversary would have to pay <span class=\"math\">n</span> times the fee to censor the transaction.</p>\n<p>In our case, the analysis is similar. If the transaction repeats across <span class=\"math\">\\kappa_i</span> input lists, then the expected bribe required is <span class=\"math\">\\kappa_i f_i</span>. The parameter <span class=\"math\">\\kappa_i</span> is directly proportional to <span class=\"math\">\\frac{n\\cdot f_i\\cdot k}{\\sum f_i}</span>, where <span class=\"math\">\\sum f_i</span> is the sum of fees paid by all transactions chosen by the protocol. As an intuition for this number, one of our results ensures that the revenue distribution from each transaction is <em>fair</em>, and thus, assumes that each transaction gives the same utility. (Let’s say there exist two transactions paying a fee of 15 and 5, respectively, then the former transaction would be included in thrice as many input lists as the latter transaction. Thus, revenue is the same). <span class=\"math\">n\\cdot k</span> represents the total available slots out of which a transaction with fee <span class=\"math\">f_i</span> would occupy <span class=\"math\">\\frac{f_i}{\\sum f_i}</span> off the total space to maintain the same revenue assumption. Thus, if bribing the IL Proposers to exclude the transaction from the input list is the dominant action (as compared to bribery by aggregator we will mention next), then the protocol would be <span class=\"math\">(b=O(\\frac{nkf_i^2}{\\sum f_i}),n, T</span>)-censorship resistant.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49946-censorship-by-bribery-to-aggregator-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49946-censorship-by-bribery-to-aggregator-22\"></a>Censorship by bribery to aggregator</h3>\n<p>In an alternate bribery attack, the adversary could bribe a party to reduce its bid by excluding all input lists that contain the target transaction. Thus, the bid for each party decreases by <span class=\"math\">\\kappa_i</span>. This would be the same as drawing a bias <span class=\"math\">\\kappa_i</span> less than what is drawn. A bias of <span class=\"math\">\\text{biasmax}-1</span> is supposed to have almost <span class=\"math\">0</span> probability of winning, and thus, reduction of a party bias to <span class=\"math\">\\text{biasmax}-\\kappa_i</span>, essentially means the adversary is bribing the party to not participate in the auction. From our analysis, the adversary would have to pay in expectation <span class=\"math\">\\frac{\\kappa_i n}{biasmax}</span> parties (Each with a bias greater than <span class=\"math\">n-\\kappa_i</span>) a bribe of <span class=\"math\">u_a</span> each in order for them not to include the input lists containing the target transaction.

Working within the confines of limited-size inclusion lists, we achieve significant censorship resistance guarantees (proportional to the number of parties, including the transaction). Then, we looked at an aggregation scheme, AUCIL, that utilizes auctions to incentivize parties to include the largest inclusion list. AUCIL ensures that the aggregator is incentivized to add all input lists to the transaction. We are also analyzing how coalition affects the censorship resistance guarantees and will publish the results soon. Meanwhile, it would be amazing to hear thoughts on AUCIL and the inclusion list building mechanism.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"footnote-49946-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Note that with <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-1559</a>, the cost to fill the block scales when the block space is full.

These instruments may be similar in nature or expected to exhibit similar behaviors over time - they can be priced with models or priced using dynamic replication (such as options replicated through dynamic hedging).</p>\n<p>One such arb is statistical arbitrage (‘stat arb’) that frequently employs mean reversion models to capitalize on short-term pricing inefficiencies. Another one is latency arbitrage that takes advantage of minute price variations across different trading venues. In the cryptocurrency, a common form of arbitrage is known as CEX/DEX arb, a type of latency arbitrage where decentralized exchanges (DEXs) respond more slowly to market changes than centralized exchanges (CEXs), largely due to differing block or settlement times. In such scenarios, traders engage in relative-value or pairs trading between centralized exchanges (such as Binance and OKX) and decentralized exchanges (such as Uniswap and Curve).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49938-the-network-as-a-financial-instrument-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49938-the-network-as-a-financial-instrument-4\"></a>The Network As a Financial Instrument</h3>\n<p>In this article, we look to delineate, and quantify such an arbitrage trade between two seemingly different instruments: the Vol markets on CEX vs the Ethereum Blockchain itself (i.e. the Network, not DEXs).</p>\n<p>The purpose of this article is to introduce a closed-form solution to price a floor price for Ethereum Blocks drawing a direct relationship between Vol markets and the minimum price one should pay for Ethereum Blocks. More specifically, we will look at the effect of selling Strangles on ETH (and other tokens) in CEX, while buying Blockspace Commitments (or Preconfirmations) on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>While this type of relationship may exist with limited effect today for 12 seconds, the burgeoning space of preconfirmations and validator commitments will enable this to exist for much longer periods turning what may be a theoretical exercise today into a practical exercise tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Through this exercise, we position the Blockchain or Network itself as a financial instrument that can be used for macro hedging or relative value trading purposes.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49938-what-is-a-strangle-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49938-what-is-a-strangle-5\"></a>What is a Strangle?</h3>\n<p>The building blocks of options markets or ‘Vol’ markets are ‘vanilla’ options known as calls and puts. Combining such vanilla options together at the same strike produces a ‘V-shaped’ payoff known as a ‘Straddle’. A Straddle will always have a positive intrinsic value or payoff enabling the buyer to monetize any movement of the underlying instrument.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/7/1/71515733c74792ef64bb5afa1456f44c8a078678.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/71515733c74792ef64bb5afa1456f44c8a078678\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/1/71515733c74792ef64bb5afa1456f44c8a078678_2_690x399.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"gasdZshCZ95459up6h7kPEGPIkE\" width=\"690\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/1/71515733c74792ef64bb5afa1456f44c8a078678_2_690x399.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/1/71515733c74792ef64bb5afa1456f44c8a078678_2_1035x598.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/7/1/71515733c74792ef64bb5afa1456f44c8a078678.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F9F9\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Figure 1: Straddles vs Strangles</em><p></p>\n<p>When the strikes are apart from one another, in the above example by a distance of ‘z’, they are called a ‘Strangle’.

For example, there are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inclusion Preconfirmations: Where Proposers issue guarantees to include transactions within a specified block, anywhere in the block</li>\n<li>Execution Preconfirmations: Where Proposers issue guarantees to include transactions within a specific block, with a specific state or result</li>\n<li>Whole Block Sales which may be called Entire Blocks or Execution Tickets: Where Proposers sell their block en masse to an intermediary who then engages in some form of pseudo block building consisting perhaps of a mix of their own trades, Inclusion Preconfirmations, Execution Preconfirmations, private order flow, and public order flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the purposes of this paper, we will be referring to Whole Block Sales by Proposers, but may refer to them generically as Preconfirmations or Preconfs for ease of reading and consistency with some current nomenclature.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49938-current-preconf-and-blockspace-pricing-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49938-current-preconf-and-blockspace-pricing-7\"></a>Current Preconf and Blockspace Pricing</h3>\n<p>The value of Ethereum blocks are often associated with the Maximum Extractable Value (MEV), that is, the largest amount of value that one could extract or monetize within a 12 second period. This may include a mix of the public’s willingness to pay for transactions (financial and non-financial), private order flow, as well as other MEV trades including sandwich attacks, atomic arbitrage, CEX/DEX arb, or other.</p>\n<p>Extending into the Multi-block MEV (MMEV) or Consecutive Block valuation, MMEV valuation is often performed in the context of TWAP oracle manipulation attacks producing forced liquidations by price manipulation. While there is an intersection between longer-term CEX/DEX arb captured in single-block pricing discussions vs the relative value vol markets, we prefer the simplicity and forward-looking nature of the vol markets for the purpose of our pricing exercise.</p>\n<p>Putting this together, there are multiple ways to value a single or multiple set of Ethereum blocks. From our analysis, we present a floor price for Ethereum blocks driven by non-arbitrage pricing and the Vol markets in CeFi. From this floor price one may additionally then consider encompassing other forms of value capture to arrive at a true mid-market price of an Ethereum Block.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49938-the-trade-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49938-the-trade-8\"></a>The Trade</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49938-historical-background-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49938-historical-background-9\"></a>Historical Background</h3>\n<p>Buying a block, or multiple blocks of Ethereum enables one more control over order execution and states. Simply, if it were possible to buy 12.8 minutes of Ethereum (i.e. 64 blocks or two epoch) one could watch prices as they move in CEX during this time, and at any time during this 12 minute period, one could put on a relative value trade capturing the difference in prices between the CEXs and DEXs. If, for example, prices rose 5% in CEX during this time, one could sell assets in CEX, and buy those same assets in DEX (where the prices haven’t moved) earning 5% in the process. While this may not be currently feasible, it is the starting point for discussion.</p>\n<p>Historically, we can look at these dynamics measuring the maximum price movements over 12 secs, 1 min, or more. We can then take into account the liquidity on DEXs and calculate a historical breakeven between the profitability of such transactions with the number of blocks for a given period. For more on this see this article: <a href=\"https://greenfield.xyz/2024/09/10/statistical-arbitrage-on-amms-and-block-building-on-ethereum-part-1/\" class=\"inline-onebox\">| Greenfield</a></p>\n<p>While possible to calculate, we’re more interested in looking forward, not backward.

In the example immediately above, we bump the Vol downward to adjust for this but in reality, we would need more order book information. Looking forward, this market could also be illiquid because there was never another market to trade it against, e.g. Preconfs. We furthermore would need to run the analysis considering tokens other than ETH.</p>\n<p>Everyday there is a 12-minute direct overlap where a set of option expiries for BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP on Deribit (and other exchanges) roughly match the time-frame for preconfs enabling one to recalibrate and reconcile any intraday Vol positions vs the actual Preconf markets with more accuracy. For the rest of the day, traders would need to run basis-risk between the Vol positions on their books, with their Preconf positions accordingly. As such, execution in the Vol markets and direct one-for-one pairs trading may be limited on a regular basis and only possible sporadically.</p>\n<p>As an alternative to directly offsetting the Short Strangle positions with Long Preconfs, a trader may approach this on a portfolio basis and trade the greeks. In this instance, a preconf buyer may consider selling longer-dated, more liquid straddles, and buying them back up to 12 mins later or whenever the preconf is exercised. The gamma profile there is much less sharp meaning any moves in Spot will have a lesser impact on option price. There is additional Vol/Vega to consider (although less impactful for a short-dated option) and the time decay (which is in the arbitrageur’s favor here as they would be Short the options and theta decays faster closer to expiry). If one could seemingly buy Vol 5-10% cheaper via Preconfs over time, then this would indeed be attractive to options traders.</p>\n<p>On the DEX side, liquidity across ETH, and other tokens is limited to about $4-5mm at the time of this article. Taking into account the total volume on major DEXs, we’d additionally expect about $200k of additional demand every block from general order flow. Although most of this typically may not be seen in the public mempool, over 32 blocks this would be $6.4mm which one could either use to estimate option expiration liquidity and/or capture via other conventional MEV approaches (i.e. front/back-runs).</p>\n<p>More research on liquidity, and execution is warranted.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49938-inventory-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49938-inventory-24\"></a>Inventory</h3>\n<p>To execute trades on two different venues, traders will need to hold sufficient inventory on both locations. For this reason, an additional cost of capital is not considered in this exercise.</p>\n<p>For example, if the Call part of the Strangle ends up in-the-money (ITM), when the Preconf is exercised, the user will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy, let’s say, ETH in the DEX and sell it in the CEX. That is, the user needs USDT/C inventory onchain, and ETH inventory in the CEX, to avoid any transfer lag.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Larger market makers should have sufficient liquidity on both sides making this lesser of an issue.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49938-european-vs-american-options-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49938-european-vs-american-options-25\"></a>European vs American Options</h3>\n<p>The CEX Strangle (i.e. where the Arbitrageur is ‘Short’) is a European Option unlike the Preconfirmation (i.e. where the Arbitrageur is ‘Long’) which is more an American Option. This gives the Arbitrageur positive basis such that the instrument they are ‘Long’ has more optionality or upside built into it. If the Preconf is early exercised, the trader receives the intrinsic value while the Strangle still has some time value (although minimal), therefore, the PNL is equal to the Net Premium minus the time value difference.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49938-what-about-other-mev-and-mmev-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49938-what-about-other-mev-and-mmev-26\"></a>What About Other MEV and MMEV?</h3>\n<p>While there is some intersection between conventional MEV and the Strangle strategy as highlighted above, there is still the value to the everyday deal-flow, alongside significant other forms of MEV that are not captured. Monetization of such flows would be separate to, and in addition to, that of the Floor price.</p>\n<p>The Strangle exercise above suggests that some types of single-block MEV may currently be constrained by transaction costs which would indicate a non-linear MMEV for when multi-block purchases are possible (at least within the first few blocks).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49938-conclusions-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49938-conclusions-27\"></a>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>The purpose of this paper is to open up a discussion and illustrate a novel approach for the pricing of preconfs - one that importantly responds in real-time to prevailing market conditions. While the execution of such a strategy is difficult, it is not insurmountable for sophisticated players to automate.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important consideration is that the Price of the Preconfs is a function of the Size of the Markets. If both the Options markets on Deribit and DEX liquidity are 10x larger than they are today, the Preconf Price Floors would be 10x those indicated above. Financial markets often look for inflection points where trades that were almost-possible suddenly become mainstream. With Gas Markets opening up, Macro traders now able to hedge Vol with Preconfs, Based Rollups increasing liquidity, and a trend towards lower transaction fees, this is indeed an interesting area of research.</p>\n<p>We believe that highlighting a seemingly odd relationship between token Vol and the Ethereum Blockchain itself will help to further the study of risk-neutral block pricing and are excited to discuss and explore this, and other approaches, with any other parties who may be interested.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49938-references-28\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49938-references-28\"></a>References</h1>\n<p>[ 1 ] Pascal Stichler, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/does-multi-block-mev-exist-analysis-of-2-years-of-mev-data/20345\">Does multi-block MEV exist?

We took Plookup technique as a starting point and then made some practical improvements for writing large PLONK circuits with a complex logic.</p>\n<p>Lookup argument allows prover to prove that some table over prime field (hereafter assignment table) satisfies specific constraints: some cells computed from assignment table (lookup input) belong to list of values that is also computed from the assignment table (lookup table).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49919-join-and-split-algorithm-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49919-join-and-split-algorithm-1\"></a>Join-and-split algorithm</h2>\n<p>The core of Plookup techinque is a sorting algorithm. We call it <strong>join-and-split</strong> because it includes two steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>join</strong> — lookup table columns are joined together with input columns into single large vector using special reordering algorithm.</li>\n<li><strong>split</strong> — constructed vector is split again into original size parts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The case with the single lookup table and single input column is described in the Plookup paper in detail. But it wasn’t enough for our use-cases. We needed lots of efficiently packed lookup tables and lookup constraints applied to arbitrary rows and columns, and we didn’t want to repeat lookup argument for each <code>(input, table)</code> pair.</p>\n<p>So, we modified join-and-split algorithm to be able to join more than two columns. It allows us to use multiple lookup constraints even if they are applied on same rows and use a large lookup table, even if its size is greater than the whole assignment table rows amount by appending columns to assignment table instead of rows. Balance between assignment table rows and columns amounts helps to find a perfect balance for the best prover performance and verification cost.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49919-selector-columns-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49919-selector-columns-2\"></a>Selector columns</h2>\n<p>Original article contains technique to lookup tuples of values that are placed in the same or neighboring rows. It constructs linear combinations of columns with a random factor. Combining this approach with polynomial expressions usage for lookup tables and input columns both we achieved selector columns full support. Circuit designer now can manage which rows exactly are constrained and what rows are reserved for lookup tables storing.</p>\n<p>Plookup paper also describes technique for multiple lookup tables support. They propose to associate each lookup table with its unique identifier and fill tag column to mark what rows contains lookup tables with which identifier. Tag column for input helps to mark what constraints are applied to marked row. Tag columns should be a part of the random linear combination constructed for the lookup table and input columns respectively. This approach is obviously limited. Sum of lookup tables sizes should be less than the whole table rows amount.</p>\n<p>We combined lookup table identifier usage with our selector columns construction and algorithms for large lookup tables. These modifications allow lookup tables to be stored and used without regard to lookup argument restrictions, but according to the best circuit design. It made our lookup argument into a universal and flexible tool.</p>\n<p>Detailed description of our modifications can be found on our <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@nil-research/rkjJFAtiC\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">HackMD</a> page.

For instance, if everyone were to be a staker, the yield observed would be <em>effectively</em> 0%. As the new issuance is split evenly among all participants, the ownership of the circulating supply experienced by each staker would not change. Pre-taxes and other associated costs this situation resembles more a token re-denomination or a fractional stock split. So we would expect the effective yield to progressively reach 0% as stake rates grow to 100%.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, non-staking holders are being diluted by the newly minted issuance. This causes holders to experience a negative effective yield due to issuance. We would expect this effect to be more and more acute as stake rates grow closer and closer to 100%.</p>\n<p>These ideas can be put very simply in math terms.</p>\n<p>Let’s call <span class=\"math\">s</span> the amount of ETH held by stakers, <span class=\"math\">h</span> the amount of ETH held by non-stakers (holders), and <span class=\"math\">t</span> the total circulating supply.

A staker must acquire a consumer-grade PC, it must pay some amount (albeit small) for electricity, it must have a high-speed internet connection. And they also must put their own labor and time to maintain the system operational and secure, or must pay someone to do that job for them. Stakers also observe other forms of costs that eat away from the nominal yield they observe, e.g. taxes. We would like to model this net yield observed after all forms of costs, because it can give us valuable information on how different stakers are impacted by changes in the nominal stake yield.</p>\n<p>To model this we will introduce two types of costs; costs that scale with the nominal yield (e.g. taxes or fees charged by an LST would fit under this umbrella), and costs that do not (i.e. HW, electricity, internet, labor…).</p>\n<p>With our definitions, after staking for a reference period stakers would have earned <span class=\"math\">s' = y_s s = s + s(y_s - 1)</span></p>\n<p>But if we introduce costs that eat away from the nominal yield (let’s call them <span class=\"math\">k</span>), and costs that eat away from the principal (let’s call them <span class=\"math\">c</span>). We arrive to the following formula for the net stake:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">s' = s(1-c) + s(y_s - 1) - \\max(0, sk(y_s - 1))</span></p>\n<p>NOTE: The max simply prevents that a cost that scales with yield becomes a profit if yield goes negative. For instance, if yield goes negative it’s unlikely that an LST will pay the LST holders 10%. Or if yield goes negative you may not be able to recoup in taxes as if it were negative income. In those cases we set it to 0. This will become useful later on when we explore issuance curves with negative issuance regimes.</p>\n<p>This represents the net stake our stakers observe after all forms of costs have been taken into account. To be noted that this formula can be easily modified to take into account other types of effects like validator effectiveness (acts as multiplicative factor on the terms <span class=\"math\">(y_s - 1)</span>) or correlation/anti-correlation incentives (which alter <span class=\"math\">y_s</span>).</p>\n<p>To fix ideas, let’s estimate the net yield observed by 3 different types of stakers. A home staker, an LST holder, and an institutional large-scale operator. The values proposed are only orientative and should be tuned to best reflect the realities of each stakeholder.</p>\n<p>A home staker will have to pay for a PC that they amortize over 5 years and costs around 1000 USD, so 200 USD/year. Pay for Internet, 50 USD per month, for around 600 USD/year. Something extra for electricity, less than 100 USD/year for a typical NUC. Let’s assume they are a hobbyist and decide to do this with their spare time, valuing their time at 0 USD/year. This would mean that his staking operation has a cost of around 1000 USD/year for them. If they have 32 ETH, with current ETH prices we can round that at ~100K USD. This would mean that for this staker, <span class=\"math\">c = \\frac{1}{1000}</span>. As their costs represent around 1 over 1000 their stake value.</p>\n<p>Now for the costs that scale with the yield. They will have to pay taxes, these are highly dependent on their tax jurisdiction, but may vary between 20% and 50% in most developed countries. Let’s pick 35% as an intermediate value. In that case, their stake after costs looks like:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">s' = s\\left(1-\\frac{1}{1000}\\right) + s(1-0.35)(y_s - 1)</span></p>\n<p>We can do the same exercise for a staker using an LST. In this case, <span class=\"math\">c=0</span> and <span class=\"math\">k</span> is composed of staking fees (10-15%) and taxes (20-50%) which depend on the tax treatment. Rebasing tokens have the advantage of postponing the realization of capital gains. If we assume a 5 year holding period, equivalent to the amortization time we assumed for solo staking, it could look something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed costs: 0</li>\n<li>Staking fees: 10%</li>\n<li>Capital gains tax: 20%</li>\n<li>Holding period: 5 years</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"math\">s' = s(1-0) + s(1-0.14)(y_s - 1)</span></p>\n<p>Finally, for a large scale operator. They have higher fixed costs, they will have to pay for labor, etc… But also will run much higher amount of validators. In that case, c can get much smaller as it’s a proportion of s. Perhaps 1 or 2 orders of magnitude smaller. And taxes will be typical of corporate tax rates (20-30%).</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">s' = s\\left(1-\\frac{1}{10000}\\right) + s(1-0.25)(y_s - 1)</span></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49913-net-effective-yield-aka-real-yield-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49913-net-effective-yield-aka-real-yield-3\"></a>Net Effective Yield (a.k.a Real Yield)</h2>\n<p>Finally, we can blend the two concepts together to understand what’s the real yield a staker or holder obtains net of all forms of costs and after supply changes dilution.

Around 70M ETH staked solo validators start to earn negative real yield. At around 90M ETH institutional stakers start to earn negative real yield.

This term is affected by economies of scale, and small operators will suffer larger <span class=\"math\">c</span>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49913-implications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49913-implications-6\"></a>Implications</h3>\n<p><strong>Observation 0</strong> and <strong>Observation 1</strong> imply that as the gap between real yields becomes sufficiently small, participating in the network as some of those subsets may become economically irrational. For example, solo staking may be economically irrational given the operational risks, liquidity risks, slashing risks if the yield premium becomes sufficiently small vs holding. In that case solo stakers may become holders or switch to other forms of staking (e.g. LSTs) where the premium still satisfies the risk.</p>\n<p>Together with <strong>Observation 2</strong> and <strong>Observation 4</strong> implies that as stake rates become higher and higher the chain is at risk of becoming more centralized, as solo stakers (which are the most uncorrelated staking set) must continue staking when it may be economically irrational to do so. Given the above assumptions LSTs will always observe at least 1% real yield higher than holding even at extreme stake rates (~100%), this may mean that there is always an incentive to hold an LST instead of ETH. Furthermore, when solo stakers cross to negative real yield but other stakers do not, other stakers are slowly but steadily gaining greater weight.</p>\n<p>From <strong>Observation 3</strong> we know that the very high stake rate regime, where everyone is observing a negative real yield, is costly for everyone. Everyone observes dilution. The money is going to the costs that were included in the real yield calculation (tax, ISPs, HW, electricity, labor…).</p>\n<p><strong>Observation 5</strong> implies that nominal yield reductions need to be applied with care and certainly not in isolation without introducing uncorrelation incentives at the same time. As they risk penalizing home solo stakers disproportionately.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49913-recommendations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49913-recommendations-7\"></a>Recommendations</h3>\n<p>Given the above analysis, we can put forward a few recommended properties the yield curve (respectively the issuance curve) should have. The idea of establishing these properties is that we should be able to discuss them individually and agree or disagree on their desirability. Once agreed they constrain the set of functions we should consider. At a minimum, it will make the discussion about issuance changes more structured.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Property 0</strong>: Although this property is already satisfied with the current issuance curve, it is worth stating explicitly. The protocol should incentivize some minimum amount of stake, to ensure the network is secure and the cost to attack much larger than the potential economic reward of doing so. This is achieved by defining a yield curve that ramps up the nominal yield as the total proportion of stake (<span class=\"math\">s_n</span>) is reduced.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Property 1</strong>: The yield curve should contain uncorrelation incentives such that stakers are incentivized to spin-up uncorrelated nodes and to stake independently, instead of joining large-scale operators. From a protocol perspective the marginal value gained from another ETH staked through a large staking operation is much smaller than if that same ETH does so through an uncorrelated node. The protocol should reward uncorrelation as that’s what allows the network to achieve the extreme levels of censorship resistance, liveness/availability and credible neutrality the protocol expects to obtain from its validator set. The economic incentives must be aligned with the expected outcomes, therefore the yield curve must contain uncorrelation incentives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Property 2</strong>: The issuance curve (resp. yield curve) should have a regime where holding is strictly more economically beneficial than staking, at sufficiently high stake rates. This means that the real yield of holding is greater than the real yield of staking if the stake rate is sufficiently high. As explained above it’s the real yield gap the defining characteristic that establishes the economically rational choice to join one subset or another. If the holding real yield can be greater than the staking real yield at sufficiently high stake rates there is an economic incentive to hold instead of continue staking. To be noted, up to here we are not making an argument at what stake rate this should be set. It suffices to agree that 99.9% stake rate is unhealthy for the protocol (it’s a cost for everyone, LSTs will displace ETH as pristine collateral, etc…). If that’s the case, then we can prevent this outcome by setting the holding real yield to be higher than staking at that level. Unhealthy levels are likely found at much lower values of stake rate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Property 3</strong>: To prevent centralization forces, the stake rates at which uncorrelated validators vs correlated validators cross to negative real yield should be small, as small as possible. A large gap between the thresholds to negative real yields of uncorrelated (e.g. home stakers) and correlated sets (e.g. large operators) creates a regime where the validator set can become more and more centralized. To make the case more clear, if uncorrelated validators reach 0 real yield at 30M ETH staked, while holding an LST composed of large operators (e.g. cbETH, wstETH) does so at 100M ETH. The regime where the stake ranges between 30M and 100M is such that solo stakers will tend to disappear, either quickly (they stop staking) or slowly (they become more and more diluted), the outcome in either case is a more centralized validator set.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Property 4</strong>: The yield curve should taper down relatively quick to enter the regime of negative real yields. From <strong>Property 2</strong> and <strong>Property 3</strong> we know we should build-in a regime where the real yield from issuance goes negative, but we want this regime to occur approximately at the same stake rate for the different types of stakers, to prevent centralization forces. <strong>Observation 5</strong> implies that if the slope of this nominal yield reduction is slow, stakers with different cost structures will be pushed out at much different stake rates. Hence, we need to make this yield reduction quick.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Property 5</strong>: The issuance yield curve should be continuous. It’s tempting to play with discontinuous yield curves, but yield is the main incentive to regulate the total stake of the network. We would like that the changes induced to the total stake <span class=\"math\">s</span> are continuous, therefore the economic incentive should be a continuous function.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49913-exploring-other-issuance-curves-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49913-exploring-other-issuance-curves-8\"></a>Exploring Other Issuance Curves</h2>\n<p>The desired properties can be summarized very succinctly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The yield curve should be continuous.</li>\n<li>The yield curve should go up as stake rate goes to 0.</li>\n<li>The yield curve should go to 0 as the stake rate goes up, crossing 0 at some point that bounds from above the desired stake rate equilibrium.</li>\n<li>The yield curve should have uncorrelation incentives such that spinning up uncorrelated validators is rewarded and incentivized over correlated validators.</li>\n<li>The real yield curves of correlated and uncorrelated stakers should become negative relatively close to each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A very simple solution to meet the above is to introduce a negative term to Ethereum’s issuance yield and uncorrelation incentives.</p>\n<p>The negative term should grow faster than the issuance yield as the stake grows, so that it eventually overcompensates issuance and makes the yield go negative quickly at sufficiently high stake rates. This negative term can be thought of as a stake burn, and should be applied on a slot or epoch basis such that it’s unavoidable (thanks to A. Elowsson for this observation).</p>\n<p>Uncorrelation incentives are being explored in other posts. We will simply leave here the recommendation of adopting them as part of any issuance tweaks.

There is complete freedom deciding where this threshold occurs, by simply tweaking the constant pre-factors. In this particular case, the parameters have been chosen so they are rounded in powers of 2 and so that the negative issuance regime roughly happens around 50% stake rate.</p>\n<p>This negative issuance regime induces a positive effective yield on holders, which provides the protocol with an economic incentive to limit the stake rate. As the real yield will eventually be greater holding ETH than staking. It also serves to protect the network from overloading its consensus layer, as it provides the protocol with a mechanism to charge exogenous sources of yield that occur on top of it. If priority fees, MEV, or restaking provide additional yield that would push stake rates above the desired limit, the protocol would start charging those extra sources of yield by making issuance go negative.

As illustrated above, by simply applying a multiplicative factor we can keep the same curve shape but make yields be higher or lower as wished.</p>\n<p>In this section we will provide some heuristic properties to address this problem and be able to specify the prefactors that allow us to define a concrete yield curve.</p>\n<p>These heuristic properties are orientative. There is no hard science behind them, just some soft arguments that provide reasonable justification for these choices.</p>\n<p><strong>Heuristic 0</strong>: The nominal issuance yield should become negative at 50% stake rate or lower. Higher stake rates start to become problematic, above those levels the majority of circulating supply is staking. In case of supermajority bug the majority of ETH holders could be incentivized to break the consensus rules. The negative yield regime can be seen as a protection mechanism from the protocol to prevent this type of situations from happening, it sets an economic incentive to align the social layer with the protocol interests.</p>\n<p><strong>Heuristic 1</strong>: Target 3% yield at 25% stake rate. When PoS was released there was no idea what would be the expected staking yield the market would consider appetizing. Would 5% be enough? Or 3%?</p>\n<p>Now we have data points, current staking yield is 3% as measured by <a href=\"https://beaconcha.in\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://beaconcha.in</a> (issuance, MEV, and priority fees included). So we know the market certainly has appetite for ETH yield at 3%. There is also some soft-arguments by V. Buterin, J. Drake et al. that 25% stake rate should provide enough security.</p>\n<p>And finally, the current issuance curve happens to provide 3% yield at 25% stake rate. So by fixing the new curve to meet that same yield at 25% we anchor the same yield (and issuance) at the target rate. But any extra amount of stake will be met with a reduction in yield and issuance that makes it go to 0 before hitting 50%.</p>\n<p>As current stake rate is a tad over 25% the proposed change to the issuance curve would imply a bit of issuance reduction, nothing very significant. But most importantly it avoids the ever growing issuance increase as stake rates become higher.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with well designed uncorrelation incentives it could help the protocol ensure it does not overpay for security, stake rates are self-limiting, and the validator set very uncorrelated.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49913-final-words-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49913-final-words-12\"></a>Final Words</h2>\n<p>The analytic form of the yield curve or the issuance curve matter much less than we may think. It might be tempting to spend time tinkering with its concrete analytic form but for all it matters it could be equally defined with a piece-wise continuous function.</p>\n<p>Its purpose is to provide an economic incentive to get stake rates where the protocol needs them to be (not too high, not too low) and maintaining a large uncorrelated validator set.</p>\n<p>This post is an invitation to steer the discussion towards said properties instead of getting lost with the fine details. If we nail down the properties we will constrain the solution space enough so that almost any function we choose will do the job.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-shape-of-issuance-curves-to-come/20405\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-shape-of-issuance-curves-to-come/20405","pubDate":"Tue, 10 Sep 2024 21:11:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-20405"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-shape-of-issuance-curves-to-come/20405.rss","#text":"The Shape of Issuance Curves to Come"}},{"title":"Introducing CCTP Express: a faster and cheaper way to use CCTP","dc:creator":"0xwels","category":"Applications","description":"<p>By <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wels_eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Wel</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alau1218\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Alan</a> on behalf of CCTP Express<br>\n<em>For most recent information about CCTP Express, please visit <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cctpexpress\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our X</a>.</em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49895-motivation-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49895-motivation-1\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>We recognize the vital role stablecoins play in the Web3 ecosystem, especially within DeFi. Among them, USDC stands out for its high transparency and regulatory compliance. Circle, the issuer of USDC, introduced the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to securely transfer USDC across chains using a native burn-and-mint mechanism.</p>\n<p>CCTP is a game-changing tool that drives USDC adoption in the multichain world, allowing developers to create applications that offer secure, 1:1 USDC transfers across blockchains. This eliminates the added risks of using bridges.</p>\n<p>However, CCTP has a key limitation: wait time. Its off-chain attestation service requires block confirmations on the source chain to ensure finality before minting USDC on the destination chain. This process can take anywhere from 20 seconds to 13 minutes, which is not ideal for users needing instant transfers. To address this, CCTP Express was designed to provide instant USDC bridging while leveraging CCTP.

All fund rebalancing must be done exclusively through CCTP to avoid exposure to potential risks associated with other bridges.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Users gain a faster and more cost-effective experience, fillers receive satisfactory rewards while their funds are safeguarded, and CCTP grows stronger through the support of CCTP Express.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49895-key-concepts-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49895-key-concepts-4\"></a>Key concepts</h1>\n<p>CCTP Express is an intent based cross-chain bridging system built upon CCTP. The key to speed up the transaction is the adoption of the “Filler-pay-first” mechanism.</p>\n<p>When a user submits a bridging intent, fillers initiate an order on the origin chain, then immediately call a fillOrder on the destination chain and transfer funds to the user accordingly.</p>\n<p>The system periodically validates the payments and repays to fillers in batches. Rebalancing across domains is done across CCTP if needed. This settlement process is out of the scene of the users, the repayments and rebalancing are bundled to save costs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49895-dive-deeper-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49895-dive-deeper-5\"></a>Dive Deeper</h1>\n<p>CCTP Express adopts a Hub-and-Spoke architecture, it can be broken down into a 3-layered system: a request for quote mechanism to obtain users’ bridging intent, enabling a filler network to claim and fill those orders, and lastly a settlement layer periodically repay fillers through CCTP and utilizing attestation service from Iris (Circle’s off-chain attestation service).</p>\n<p>Our design adheres to ERC-7683, emphasizing the importance of aligning with industry standards. This ensures that cross-chain intent systems can interoperate and share infrastructure like order dissemination services and filler networks. By fostering this interoperability, we enhance the end-user experience by increasing competition for fulfilling user intents.

What does it mean to the end user?</strong><br>\nWhen using CCTP Express’s front end or applications integrated with CCTP Express, users benefit from a significantly faster and cheaper way to bridge USDC across chains. By leveraging CCTP as the underlying asset bridge, the system enhances user experience while maintaining robust security.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Possible use cases included-</p>\n<p><em>USDC-denominated dApps</em><br>\nUSDC is widely adopted in various dApps, e.g. dYdX and Polymarket. dApps can integrate CCTP Express SDK to offer their users instant transfer in and out from all CCTP supported chains without the usual waiting time.</p>\n<p><em>Payment Network</em><br>\nCCTP Express can offer instant settled transaction experience for users across chains, enabling them to pay their USDC for a coffee from any CCTP supported chain.</p>\n<p><em>Money Lego</em><br>\nArbitragers and Solvers can utilize CCTP Express to be the backbone of their cross chain actions. It’s highly undesirable for arbitragers or solvers to wait for long in the high speed crypto world, CCTP Express can offer them superior speed without worrying about security as CCTP Express is using CCTP as the underlying bridge.</p>\n<p><strong>3. With a similar idea of providing cross chain bridging powered by off chain agents, how is CCTP Express different from other intent-based bridges, say Across?</strong></p>\n<p>The primary distinction between CCTP Express and Across are: positioning and settlement mechanism.</p>\n<p><em>Positioning -</em></p>\n<p>While both protocols are intent-based bridges powered by fillers/relayers, CCTP Express is positioned to be a booster tool to use CCTP.</p>\n<p>Given this focus, CCTP Express is closely integrated with CCTP and evolves in tandem with it. For instance, if CCTP supports EURC, CCTP Express will promptly support it as well.</p>\n<p>And this alignment also applies to the choice of picking which chain CCTP Express supports. CCTP Express aims to cover all EVM and non-EVM chains CCTP operates. And like<a href=\"https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/docs/message-format#message-header\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> CCTP</a>, CCTP Express adopts the bytes32 address format, instead of the 20 byte address used in EVM, to handle 32 byte addresses in many non-EVM chains.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Across is limited to EVM chains only, as it has a<a href=\"https://docs.across.to/resources/new-chain-requests\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> hard requirement</a> to support EVM- chains only.</p>\n<p><em>Settlement mechanism -</em></p>\n<p>In CCTP Express, the Hub Pool smart contract utilizes the Iris attestation service used in CCTP to relay and verify messages.

It is widely adopted in internet systems, which explains its myriad use cases in platforms such as TLS, DNSSEC, Apple’s Secure Enclave, Passkeys, Android Keystore, and Yubikey. The key operation in elliptic curves based cryptography is the scalar multiplication. When the curve is equipped with an efficient endomorphism it is possible to speed up this operation through the well-known <a href=\"https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2001/21390189.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GLV</a> algorithm. P-256 does unfortunately not have an efficient endomorphism (see <a href=\"https://neuromancer.sk/std/nist/P-256#\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">parameters</a>) to enjoy this speedup.</p>\n<p>Verifying ECDSA signatures on Ethereum through precompiled contracts, i.e. smart contracts built into the Ethereum protocol (there are only 9) is only possible with the <em>secp256k1</em> curve and not the P-256.<br>\nVerifying ECDSA signatures on P-256 requires computing scalar multiplications in Solidity and is especially useful for smart-contract wallets, enabling hardware-based signing keys and safer, easier self-custody. Different solutions can bring P-256 signatures on-chain. There are primarily three interesting approaches: (zk)-SNARK based verifiers, smart contract verifiers (e.g. <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/939.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[Dubois23]</a>, <a>Ledger/FCL</a> (deprecated), <a href=\"https://github.com/get-smooth/crypto-lib\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">smoo.th/SCL</a> and <a href=\"https://daimo.com/blog/p256verifier\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">daimo/p256verifier</a>), and native protocol precompiles (<a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/196f28d2164f30333b503481e7da954d4bf32ea3/RIPS/rip-7212.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP/RIP 7212</a>).</p>\n<p>Using SNARK (succinctness) properties, provides a great way to reduce gas cost for computation on Ethereum (e.g. ~232k gas for <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Groth16</a>, ~285k gas for <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PLONK</a> and ~185k gas for <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1167\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">FFLONK</a>). This is very competitive with (and sometimes better that) the currently gas-optimal smart contract verifier. Moreover one can batch many ECDSA verifications in a single proof, amortizing thus the gas cost. However verifying P-256 signatures in a SNARK circuit can be very expensive i.e. long proving time. This is because the field where the points on the P-256 curve lie is different than the field where the SNARK computation is usually expressed. To be able to verify the proof onchain through the procompile the SNARK field needs to be the <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@jpw/bn254\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BN254</a> scalar field.

This creates an asymmetry of information between the bundlers and the user, as the user doesn’t know how many transactions will be included in the bundle. This leads to a zero-sum game where the user is at a clear disadvantage.</p>\n<p>This research aims to explore methods to improve the UX by ensuring that users do not need to overpay for inclusion in the next bundle. Instead, users should be able to pay a fee based on the actual market demand for inclusion.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49870-current-state-of-erc-4337-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49870-current-state-of-erc-4337-2\"></a>Current state of ERC-4337</h2>\n<p>In today’s market, the P2P mempool is not live on mainnet and it’s being tested on the Sepolia testnet. Companies building on ERC-4337 are currently operating in a private mode, the users connect via an RPC to a private bundler which will than work with a buidler to publish onchain your useroperation. <a href=\"https://www.bundlebear.com/overview/all\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bundle Bear app</a>, developed by Kofi, provides some intriguing statistics on the current state of ERC-4337.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.bundlebear.com/bundlers/all\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Weekly % Multi-UserOp Bundles</a> metric, we observe the percentage of bundlers creating bundles that include multiple userops. From the beginning of 2024 to June 2024, this percentage has not exceeded 6.6%. This data becomes even more interesting when considering that many bundlers run their own paymasters, entities that sponsor transactions on behalf of users. Notably, the two largest bundlers who also operate as a paymaster, in terms of user operations published, <a href=\"https://www.bundlebear.com/paymasters/all\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sponsored 97%</a> of the user operations using their services. The paymaster pays for some parts of the useroperation and the rest is paid by the dapps or other <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/en-de/developer-platform/solutions/account-abstraction-kit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">entity</a>.</p>\n<p>The question that arises is why paymasters, dApps, etc., are paying for the user operations. Will the user pay them back in the future? We can’t be sure what will happen, but my personal guess is that currently, dApps are covering the fees to increase usage and adoption of their apps. Once adoption is high, users will likely have to pay for the transactions themselves. It’s worth mentioning that for the user to pay for a user operation with the current model is not the best option, since a basic ERC-4337 operation costs ~42,000 gas, while a normal transaction costs ~21,000 gas.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49870-variations-on-erc-4337-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49870-variations-on-erc-4337-3\"></a>Variations on ERC-4337</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49870-overview-of-erc-4337-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49870-overview-of-erc-4337-4\"></a>Overview of ERC-4337</h3>\n<p>The mempool is still in a testing phase on Sepolia and is not live on the mainnet. Without the mempool, users have limited options for using account abstraction. Users interact with an RPC, which may be offered by a bundler that bundles UserOps, or with an RPC service that doesn’t bundle, similar to services like Alchemy or Infura, which receive and propagate transactions to other bundlers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/5/c/5cfa750fc581f313b031ca060a05d21cc3379214.jpeg\" alt=\"High level of a transaction in ERC-4337 without the mempool\" data-base62-sha1=\"dgwwPrr5FpfQXtBASfeKFOe2axu\" width=\"497\" height=\"111\"></p>\n<p>Once the mempool is live, the transaction flow will resemble the diagram below, which is similar to the current transaction flow. A mempool enhances censorship resistance for users because, unlike the RPC model, it reduces the chances of a transaction being excluded. However, even with a mempool, there is still a risk that an RPC provider might not forward the transaction, but the mempool model is particularly beneficial for users who prefer to run their own nodes, as it mitigates this risk.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/7/7/779c484a5068fcd2a4df86e24c5ede85cb6af781.png\" alt=\"High level of a normal transaction using an EOA\" data-base62-sha1=\"h47Es0l8Qd2k5fWqkt78p0R1QSl\" width=\"631\" height=\"136\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/9/f9ab02c182e4af4e72324eddfc31b93c5555f115.jpeg\" alt=\"High level of an userop type of transaction\" data-base62-sha1=\"zCFhixsTDhXkA8qiud2kSbXHce9\" width=\"621\" height=\"126\"></p>\n<p>While bundlers have the potential to act as builders, we prefer to keep the roles separate due to the competitive landscape. Bundlers would face significant competition from existing, sophisticated builders, making building less attractive and potentially less profitable. As a result, bundlers are more incentivized to collaborate with established builders rather than building independently and risking losses.</p>\n<p>Combining the roles of bundler and builder into a single entity implies significant changes to the current system. Bundlers would need to compete with existing <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/dashboards/block-producers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sophisticated builders</a>, or alternatively, current builders will need to horizontally integrate and assume the bundler role as well. The latter scenario, while more plausible, raises concerns about market concentration and the potential negative impact on censorship resistance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49870-bundlers-and-builders-as-two-different-entities-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49870-bundlers-and-builders-as-two-different-entities-5\"></a>Bundlers and builders as two different entities</h3>\n<p>With the users connecting directly to an RPC, everything runs in a more private environment, which doesn’t help with market competition. In the near future the mempool will be on the mainnet increasing competition.</p>\n<p>Using a mempool, in which userops are public to different bundlers increases competition, in the case of non native account abstraction having a separation between bundler and builder is needed, in the case of native account abstraction the separation might not be needed since the builder can interpret the userops as normal transactions.</p>\n<p>For our model we believe that having a separation between the bundler and the builder also offers some advantages, especially in terms of competition and censorship resistance. Imagine a scenario where all the bundlers are offering a cost <span class=\"math\">\\textbf{v}</span> for getting included in their bundle. There will be a bundler who wants to attract more users to achieve higher profits, so they will offer a cost <span class=\"math\">\\textbf{v’}</span>  where <span class=\"math\">\\textbf{v’} &lt; \\textbf{v}</span>  with enough competition among bundlers, <span class=\"math\">\\textbf{v'}</span> will get close to <span class=\"math\">\\omega</span>, the aggregation cost for the bundle. In this case, the bundlers who can search more efficiently and have better hardware to include more transactions in a bundle will earn higher fees and in return makes the useroperation for the user cheaper.</p>\n<p>This could lead to the following outcome: In a <strong>competitive environment</strong>, bundlers will lower their prices to be selected by users, who will, in turn, seek the lowest price for the inclusion of their user operation in a bundle. This competition will create a system where the bundler who offers the best price will be selected more often than the bundler who is only trying to maximize their profit by creating smaller bundles. Separating the roles of the bundler and builder can also enhance censorship resistance. A bundler can create a bundle of aggregated user operations and send it to different builders. If the bundle includes operations that could be censored, a non-censoring builder can accept it and proceed with construction. However, it’s worth noting that from a user’s perspective, this setup could increase costs, as the introduction of a bundler adds an additional party, leading to higher expenses.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49870-rip-7560-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49870-rip-7560-6\"></a>RIP-7560</h3>\n<p>Native account abstraction isn’t a novel concept; it’s been under research for years. While ERC-4337 is gaining traction, its implementation outside the protocol offers distinct advantages alongside trade-offs. Notably, existing EOAs can’t seamlessly transition to SCWs, and various types of censorship-resistant lists are harder to utilize. As previously mentioned, the gas overhead of a userOp cost escalates significantly compared to a normal transaction. <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/196f28d2164f30333b503481e7da954d4bf32ea3/RIPS/rip-7560.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RIP-7560</a> won’t inherently resolve the ongoing issue concerning off-chain costs, but it substantially reduce transaction expenses. From the initial ~42000 gas, it’s possible to reduce the cost by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sZ1UO4VN1GI?si=x7Tu22Oqxr7x-KAb&amp;t=554\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">~20000 gas</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/a/fadf929aca9a2378a70f5456501dedf5da00358b.jpeg\" alt=\"High level of a type4 transaction with RIP-7560\" data-base62-sha1=\"zNkmVJxsXQbEGsZrX0lP1xZskI3\" width=\"491\" height=\"136\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49870-layer2s-account-abstraction-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49870-layer2s-account-abstraction-7\"></a>Layer2s Account Abstraction</h3>\n<p>Account abstraction can be utilized in Layer 2 (L2) solutions. Some L2s already implement it natively, while others follow the L1 approach and are waiting for a new proposal similar to RIP-7560. In L2, the L1 is used for data availability to inherit security, while most of the computation occurs off-chain on the L2, providing cheaper transactions and scalability.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/2/b2a8d1ebfceef37ab62f0db834e7ee6135441741.jpeg\" alt=\"High level of Account abstraction in Layer 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"puuGsTGTMlLuTCy4cbcIUrqc9hv\" width=\"611\" height=\"136\"></p>\n<p>In scenarios where computation on L2 is significantly cheaper than the cost of calldata for data availability (DA) on the mainchain, the use of signature aggregation proves highly beneficial. For instance, pairing for BLS on the mainnet is facilitated by the <a href=\"https://www.evm.codes/precompiled\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>0x08</em></a> precompile from the EVM, which costs approximately ~45000k gas. Consequently, using BLS on L1 is more expensive than traditional transactions.</p>\n<p>Compression techniques on L2s are already being used, such as 0-byte compression, which reduces the cost from ~188 bytes to ~154 bytes for an ERC20 transfer. With signature aggregation, the compression efficiency can be further enhanced by using a single signature, reducing the size to ~128 bytes.</p>\n<p>In Layer 2s, signature aggregation is a crucial innovation that enhances both transaction efficiency and cost-effectiveness. By combining multiple signatures into a single one, the overall data payload is significantly reduced, which lowers the costs associated with data availability on Layer 1. This advancement not only improves scalability but also reduces transaction costs for users, making the system more economical and efficient.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49870-signature-aggregation-economics-in-layer2s-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49870-signature-aggregation-economics-in-layer2s-8\"></a>Signature Aggregation economics in Layer2s</h2>\n<p>When using an L2 service, the user incurs several costs, including a fee for the L2 operator, a cost based on network congestion, and the cost of data availability on L1.</p>\n<p>From a previous research on ”<a href=\"https://barnabe.substack.com/p/understanding-rollup-economics-from#footnote-3-48535841\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><strong>Understanding rollup economics from first principles</strong></a>”, we can outline the costs a user faces when using L2 services as follows:</p>\n<p>When a user interatcs with a layer 2 he has some costs that we can define as follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User fee</strong> = L1 data publication fee + L2 operator fee + L2 congestion fee</li>\n<li><strong>Operator cost</strong> = L2 operator cost + L1 data publication cost</li>\n<li><strong>Operator revenue =</strong> User fees + MEV</li>\n<li><strong>Operator profit = Operator revenue - Operator cost</strong> = L2 congestion fee + MEV</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the case of non-native account abstraction, an additional entity, the bundler, may introduce a fee for creating bundles of userops.</p>\n<p>Considering the bundler, the costs and profits are extended as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User fee</strong> = L1 data publication fee + L2 operator fee + L2 congestion fee + Bundler Fee</li>\n<li><strong>Bundler Cost</strong> = Quoted(L1 data publication fee + L2 operator fee + L2 congestion fee)</li>\n<li><strong>Bundler Revenue</strong> = User fee</li>\n<li><strong>Bundler profit</strong> = Bundler Revenue - Bundler cost = Difference between L1 and L2 costs and quoted prices from the bundler + Bundler fee</li>\n<li><strong>Operator Cost</strong> = L1 data publication fee + L2 operator fee</li>\n<li><strong>Operator profit = Operator revenue - Operator cost</strong> = L2 congestion fee + MEV</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bundler earns its fee from the user for their services, while the remainder of the user’s payment covers the L2 operator’s costs. If the user is unaware of the bundle size, estimating the actual cost of sending userops becomes challenging, potentially leading to the bundler charging higher fees than the one necessary to cover the operator cost.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49870-incentive-alignment-in-l2-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49870-incentive-alignment-in-l2-9\"></a>Incentive Alignment in L2</h3>\n<p>The interaction between the bundler and L2 helps address this issue, as L2s are incentivized to keep user costs low due to competition. Overcharging users can drive them to switch to other L2s offering fairer prices.</p>\n<p>Let’s redefine our model by introducing the operator. The user bids to the bundler for inclusion in the next L2 block by bidding a value <span class=\"math\">V</span>. The user aims to minimize the data publication fee, while the bundler seeks to maximize their fee or gain a surplus from L2 interaction costs and user fees.</p>\n<p>The costs associated with creating a bundle and publishing it on-chain can be divided into two parts:</p>\n<p><strong>On-chain cost function:</strong> A bundler issuing bundle <span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{B}</span> when the base fee is <span class=\"math\">r</span> expends a cost:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nC_\\text{on-chain}(\\mathbf{B}, r) = F \\times r + n \\times S \\times r\n</div>\n<p><strong>Aggregated cost function:</strong> The bundler has a cost function for aggregating <span class=\"math\">n</span> transactions in a single bundle <strong><span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{B}</span></strong> with base fee of <span class=\"math\">r</span>:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nC_\\text{agg}(\\mathbf{B}, r) = F' \\times r + n \\times S' \\times r + n \\times \\omega\n</div>\n<p>with  <span class=\"math\">S' &lt; S</span> the reduced size of a transaction and the pre-verification gas use <span class=\"math\">F' &gt; F</span>, which contains the publication and verification of the single on-chain aggregated signature.</p>\n<p>If the user can obtain a reliable estimate for <span class=\"math\">n</span>, they can calculate their cost using the <code>estimateGas</code> function, available in most L2 solutions. Having a good estimation can make the user bid accordingly without having to overestimate their bid for inclusion. This function determines the necessary cost to ensure inclusion. Having a good estimate for <span class=\"math\">n</span> and the <code>estimateGas</code> function can avoid the user to pay for a higher <code>preVerificationGas</code>. In the next section, we will explore various mechanisms to ensure a reliable estimation of <span class=\"math\">n</span>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49870-layer2s-operate-an-oracle-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49870-layer2s-operate-an-oracle-10\"></a>Layer2s operate an oracle</h3>\n<p>The oracle’s role is to monitor the mempool and estimate the number of transactions present.

This enables the user to estimate their bid for inclusion in a bundle. The Layer 2 can request the bundler to include at least a specified number of transactions (<span class=\"math\">n</span>) in a bundle, or else the bundle will be rejected.

At regular intervals, these networks check the number of user operations (userops) in the shared mempool. The shared sequencer helps synchronize and aggregate data from these networks.

Firstly, it provides a decentralized method to determine the number of userops in the mempool, enhancing resistance to collusion. Secondly, it eliminates the single point of failure that could occur if only one system were managing the communication between the user and the mempool.

We then discussed why signature aggregation is more likely to occur on Layer 2 solutions rather than directly on Layer 1. We demonstrated how Layer 2 solutions could address the asymmetric knowledge that users experience in different ways. The first one is to use oracles to signal to the user how many transactions are present in the mempool, with this approach the users knows how much they should bid and can force the bundler to make larger bundles. The third approach which is the simplest is that the L2 acts as a bundler and outsources the aggregation to a third party and lets the users pay a fee for it.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/embedded-fee-markets-and-erc-4337-part-2/20384\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/embedded-fee-markets-and-erc-4337-part-2/20384","pubDate":"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 10:23:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-20384"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/embedded-fee-markets-and-erc-4337-part-2/20384.rss","#text":"Embedded fee markets and ERC-4337 (part 2)"}},{"title":"Timestamp Ordering in MCP for Timing Games","dc:creator":"saguillo2000","category":"Block proposer","description":"<blockquote>\n<p>Thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/julian\">@Julian</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_ddiaconescu_\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@denisa</a> for the corrections, suggestions and discussions!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Multiple Concurrent Proposers (MCP) has recently become a significant topic of discussion within the community, particularly following the introduction of the <a href=\"https://x.com/danrobinson/status/1820506643739615624\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BRAID protocol</a> and the rise of DAG consensus. Max’s argument in favor of MCP for Ethereum centers on the monopoly created by leader-based <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/execution-consensus-separation/19964\">consensus mechanisms</a>, where the leader for a given slot is granted substantial monopolistic power. This concentration of power leads to issues such as short censorship for some transactions.</p>\n<p>In leader-based consensus, the designated leader for each slot has the exclusive authority to propose blocks, which allows them to exploit their position for profit maximization, such as through transaction reordering or frontrunning. MCP aims to mitigate these issues by decentralizing the block proposal process, reducing the influence any single proposer can exert over the network during a given slot.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49846-multiple-concurrent-proposers-economic-order-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49846-multiple-concurrent-proposers-economic-order-1\"></a>Multiple Concurrent Proposers Economic Order</h1>\n<p>Let <span class=\"math\">n</span> represent the number of validators in the network.

We acknowledge that there exists an inherent delay and processing time required to propose this block. Specifically, the protocol permits a maximum allowable delay of <span class=\"math\">\\Delta</span> time units before <span class=\"math\">p</span> incurs penalties.</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">p</span> may strategically opt to delay their block proposal until <span class=\"math\">\\Delta - \\epsilon</span> (where <span class=\"math\">\\epsilon &gt; 0 </span>) time units.

This situation underscores the need for an effective mechanism.

It remains uncertain how the sequence and the underlying criteria for ordering will be established, as well as how the influence of clients will be exercised—whether through mechanisms such as auctions, latency considerations, or the risk of spam attacks, as highlighted by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOGdofF4u8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Phil at SBC '24</a>.</p>\n<p>The team of Common Prefix has conducted a thorough <a href=\"https://www.commonprefix.com/static/clients/flashbots/flashbots_report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">analysis of various consensus protocols</a>, including leader-based, inclusion list, and leaderless consensus models, with a focus on their resistance to censorship. As a result of their research, they developed the concept of a Partially Ordered Dataset. In this model, the order of transactions is determined by the timestamps recorded by the clients, which may lead to a lack of strict ordering when two transactions are recorded simultaneously.

While this approach necessitates handling cases where multiple transactions share the same timestamp—or evaluating the likelihood of such occurrences—it fundamentally alters the dynamics of the fronturunning incentive of timing games previously described against other proposers block transactions.</p>\n<p>Consider a scenario in slot <span class=\"math\">m</span> where a malicious proposer attempts to front-run or sandwich another transaction. Under the previous deterministic ordering, which was based on auctions and priority fees, such attacks were feasible because proposers could manipulate their position in the ordering by outbidding others or exploiting latency. However, with timestamp-based ordering as implemented in PODs, this strategy changes significantly. An open question is still to know which strategies can be applied with PODs or timestamp ordering to extract MEV and if they are worse in wellfare of the network compared with the described game.</p>\n<p>In this new setup, being the last proposer in a slot would actually place that proposer in the final position within the transaction order, limiting their ability to engage in front-running or sandwiching assuming honesty in all nodes. Instead, they would only be able to perform back-running, which is generally considered less harmful than front-running or sandwiching. This shift in ordering strategy could effectively reduce the risk of these more dangerous forms of MEV exploitation.</p>\n<p>If a malicious validator attempts to manipulate the order of transactions by bribing proposers, slashing should be applied to the validator. By imposing such penalties, the protocol discourages malicious behavior and ensures that the integrity of the transaction ordering process is maintained. One of the future next questions it’s how can we detect a bad behaviour in the transaction record, maybe applying Turkey’s Method it’s a posible option and assume that outliers are malicious records.</p>\n<p>However, the situation is more complex than it appears. The shift to a new game for validators, where transaction ordering is influenced by latency, introduces additional challenges. Validators may now engage in latency games, where geographical proximity to other validators or network nodes becomes a crucial factor in gaining an advantage. To mitigate this, it is essential to ensure that validators are well decentralized across different regions.</p>\n<p>Decentralizing validators geographically helps reduce the impact of latency-based advantages. Validators clustered in the same location could lead to centralization risks, where a few validators might dominate the network due to their low-latency connections. This centralization could undermine the fairness of transaction ordering and potentially reintroduce the risk of censorship.</p>\n<p>Moreover, validators are incentivized to avoid sharing the same location because doing so decreases the uniqueness of the transactions they can access for a possible backrunning and taking such opportunities. The more validators operate from the same region, the fewer unique transactions each can capture, leading to lower profits from transaction fees, as these would have to be split among more validators. This dynamic encourages validators to spread out, fostering a more decentralized and resilient network that is better protected against latency-based games and the centralization of power. However, the current incentive is still weak and future work will reside in how to provide better incentives for non-centralization.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/timestamp-ordering-in-mcp-for-timing-games/20372\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/timestamp-ordering-in-mcp-for-timing-games/20372","pubDate":"Tue, 03 Sep 2024 08:17:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-20372"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/timestamp-ordering-in-mcp-for-timing-games/20372.rss","#text":"Timestamp Ordering in MCP for Timing Games"}},{"title":"Interpreting MPT branch node values","dc:creator":"josephjohnston","category":"Data Structure","description":"<p>Consider a branch node for an MPT.<br>\nSuppose the 17’th item in the branch node list is supposed to be NULL, because the branch node is not a “terminator” node.

This tick rate is soft-enforced by the consensus protocol: blocks and attestations produced too early or too late will not be considered valid. But what should we do in order to achieve a granularity lower than 12 seconds? Do we always require a consensus protocol to keep track of time?</p>\n<p>We want to explore these questions in the context of untrusted L2 sequencers, who don’t have any incentive to follow the L2 block schedule that is currently maintained by trusted L2 sequencers, and will likely play various forms of timing games in order to maximize their revenue.</p>\n<p>In this article, we introduce mechanisms to enforce the timeliness, safety and non-extractive ordering of sequencers in a decentralized rollup featuring a <strong>rotating leader mechanism</strong>, without relying on additional consensus, honest majority assumptions or altruism. To do so, we use three key primitives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Client-side ordering preferences,</li>\n<li>Ethereum as a global 12s-tick clock,</li>\n<li>Verifiable Delay Functions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lastly, we show the case study of MR-MEV-Boost, a modification of MEV-Boost that enables a variation of based preconfirmations, where the same construction explored can be applied to reduce the timing games of the proposer.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49826-rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49826-rationale-2\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Rollup sequencers are entities responsible for ordering (and in most cases, executing) L2 transactions and occasionally updating the L2 state root on the L1. Currently, centralized sequencers benefit from the reputational collateral of the teams building them to maintain five properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Responsiveness</strong>: responding to user transactions with soft commitments / preconfirmations in a <em>timely</em> manner. We want to highlight that this definition includes the timely broadcast of unsafe heads on the rollup peer-to-peer network.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-equivocation (safety)</strong>: adhering to preconfirmation promises when submitting the ordered batch on the L1, which is what will ultimately determine the total ordering of transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-extractive ordering</strong>: not extracting MEV from users by front-running or sandwiching, or by accepting bribes for front-running privileges.</li>\n<li><strong>Liveness</strong>: posting batches to L1 and updating the canonical rollup state regularly.</li>\n<li><strong>Censorship-resistance:</strong> ensuring that no valid transactions are deliberately excluded by the sequencer regardless of the sender, content, or any external factors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this piece we are concerned with how the first four properties can be maintained in a permissionless, untrusted setting. Note that censorship-resistance is ensured by construction: by introducing multiple organizationally distinct sequencers in different geographies and jurisdictions we have a strong guarantee that any transaction will be accepted eventually.</p>\n<p>Consider a decentralized sequencer set <span class=\"math\">S := \\{S_1,\\dots,S_n\\}</span>  with a predictable leader rotation mechanism and a sequencing window corresponding to a known amount of L1 slots. For simplicity, let’s assume <span class=\"math\">S_{i}</span> is the current leader and <span class=\"math\">S_{i+1}</span> is the next one. At any point in time, only one sequencer is active and has a lock over the rollup state.</p>\n<p>Here are two strategies that sequencer <span class=\"math\">S_i</span> can explore to maximize its expected value:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Delaying the inclusion of transactions</strong></p>\n<p>Suppose a user sends a transaction to <span class=\"math\">S_i</span> at a certain L2 slot. Then, the sequencer could wait some time before inserting the transaction into a block in order to extract more MEV with sandwich attacks in collaboration with searchers or by directly front-running the user. In particular, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01dnINiLhAk&amp;t=287s\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">since MEV grows superlinearly with time</a>, it’s not in the sequencer’s best interest to commit early to a transaction. The worst case scenario would be the sequencer delaying inclusion until the sequencer rotation <span class=\"math\">^1</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Not publishing unsafe heads in the rollup peer-to-peer network</strong></p>\n<p>In this setting the sequencer has low incentives to publish the unsafe heads in the rollup network: since L2 blocks are signed by the sequencer (e.g. in <a href=\"https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/configuration/consensus-config#p2psequencerkey\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism</a>), they act as a binding commitment which can be used by users to slash it in case of equivocations.</p>\n<p>This has a major downstream consequence on the UX of the rollup: both the next sequencer and users need to wait until a batch is included to see the latest transactions. For users it means they won’t know the status of their transactions in a timely manner, while the next sequencers risks building blocks on invalid state.</p>\n<p>We will now explore mechanisms to mitigate these behaviours and introduce slashing conditions for sequencers.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49826-primitive-1-transaction-deadlines-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49826-primitive-1-transaction-deadlines-3\"></a>Primitive 1: Transaction Deadlines</h2>\n<p>We introduce a new EIP-2718 transaction type with an additional field:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>deadline</code> - <code>uint256</code> indicating the last L2 block number for which the transaction is considered valid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This idea is not entirely new. For instance, the <a href=\"https://limechain.tech/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">LimeChain</a> team has explored this in their <a href=\"https://github.com/LimeChain/based-preconfirmations-research/blob/cfc3830c685965fad5e5843533c5586dcb92e873/docs/preconfirmations-for-vanilla-based-rollups.md#preconfirmation-deadline\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vanilla Based Sequencing</a> article. However, in our variant the <code>deadline</code> field is signed as part of the transaction payload and it is not expressed in L1 slots.</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind it is that the sequencer cannot tamper with either the <code>deadline</code> field or <code>block.number</code> (because it is a monotonically increasing counter), and therefore it is easy to modify the L2 derivation pipeline to attribute a fault in case the sequencer inserts the user transaction in a block where <code>block.number &gt; deadline</code>.</p>\n<p>This approach mitigates problem <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span>. However, it does not in any way solve the <em>responsiveness</em> issue, since sequencers can still delay proposing the block in order to extract more MEV.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49826-primitive-2-ethereum-as-a-global-clock-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49826-primitive-2-ethereum-as-a-global-clock-4\"></a>Primitive 2: Ethereum as a Global Clock</h2>\n<p>A simple rotating sequencer design would be one where <span class=\"math\">S_i</span> loses the power to settle batches after the end of its sequencing window <span class=\"math\">W_i</span>, which is dictated by an L1 smart contract. However, the sequencer still needs some time to post the batch with the latest L2 blocks. We therefore introduce an <em>inclusion window</em> that is shifted <span class=\"math\">n \\geq 1</span> slots ahead of <span class=\"math\">W_i</span>, where <span class=\"math\">S_i</span> still has time to land rollup batches on L1 with the last L2 blocks, even if the responsibility of sequencing has shifted to <span class=\"math\">S_{i+1}</span>.</p>\n<p>In case of any safety fault, the sequencer should be slashed. If the sequencer has not managed to post all their assigned L2 blocks by the end of its inclusion window, it will forego all associated rewards. Optionally, there could also be penalties for liveness faults. This also helps with the problem of collaboration with the next sequencer, by ensuring that the latest blocks will be known to it within <span class=\"math\">n\\cdot12</span> seconds. Ideally, we’d like to keep <span class=\"math\">n</span> as small as possible with a value of <span class=\"math\">1</span>.</p>\n<p>There are still some potential issues here: getting a transaction included on Ethereum is probabilistic, meaning that you can’t be sure that a transaction you send will actually be included in time. In this context it means that the last batch sent by an honest leader may not be included in the L1 by the end of its inclusion window. This can be helped with two approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A “based” setup, where the sequencer is also the L1 block proposer and can include any transactions right up to the point they have to propose, or</li>\n<li>Using proposer commitments with a protocol like <a href=\"https://boltprotocol.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bolt</a>. We expand more on this in the <em>”Further work”</em> section below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that we assume there is a registry smart contract that can be consulted for the currently active sequencer, i.e. it implements some leader election mechanism and takes care of sequencer bonds along with rewards and penalties.

What does this give us in the sequencer context? If we remember that a sequencer has a certain deadline by which it has to post batches set by the L1 slot schedule, we can have the L1 enforce that <em>at least</em> some number of L2 blocks need to be settled. This has two downstream results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The sequencer <em>must</em> start producing and sealing blocks as soon as their sequencing window starts. Pairing this with the transaction deadline property results in an upper bound of time for when a transaction can be confirmed. If they don’t follow the block schedule set by the VDF and the L1, they risk not being able to post <em>any</em> batch.</li>\n<li>We mitigate problem <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span> by taking away the incentive to withhold data (not considering pure griefing attacks): this is because the sequencer cannot tamper with an existing VDF chain, which would require recomputing all the subsequent VDFs and result in an invalid batch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, for the sake of this post we will consider a generic VDF, provided as a “black box” while keeping the hash chain example in mind which currently has stronger guarantees against ad-hoc hardware such ASICs. See <em>“Security Considerations”</em> below for more insights.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49826-proving-correct-vdfs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49826-proving-correct-vdfs-7\"></a>Proving correct VDFs</h3>\n<p>If a sequencer provides an invalid VDF in an L2 block header it should be slashed, and ideally we’d like to ensure this at settlement time. However, recalculating a long hash chain on the EVM is simply unfeasible due to gas costs.</p>\n<p>How to show then that the number of iterations of the VDF is invalid? One way could be to enforce it optimistically (or at settlement, in case of ZK-rollups) by requiring a valid VDF chain output in the derivation pipeline of the rollup. In case of equivocation in an optimistic rollup the sequencer can be challenged using fraud proofs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49826-hardware-requirements-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49826-hardware-requirements-8\"></a>Hardware requirements</h3>\n<p>Since by definition VDFs cannot be sped up using parallelism, it follows that computing a VDF can be done by only using a single core of a CPU, and so it does in our block production algorithm.</p>\n<p>This makes it different and way more lightweight compared to most Proof-of-Work consensus algorithms such as Bitcoin’s which requires scanning for a value such that, when hashed with SHA-256, the hash begins with a certain number of zero bits.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth to note that modern CPUs are optimized to compute the SHA-256 hash function. Since 2016 Intel, starting with the <em>Goldmount</em> family of chips, is offering <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sha-extensions.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SHA Extensions</a> in the <em>Core</em> and <em>Xeon</em> line-ups on selected models which introduces three new instructions specialized in computing different steps of the hash function algorithm more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Lastly, <a href=\"https://www.man.com/single-core-stagnation-and-the-cloud\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">single-core performance has stagnated over the years</a> indicating that there is a minor benefit in investing in the latest generation of CPUs, thus lowering down the requirements of the system.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49826-case-study-mr-mev-boost-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49826-case-study-mr-mev-boost-9\"></a>Case Study: MR-MEV-Boost</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations-with-multi-round-mev-boost/20091\">Multi-Round-MEV-Boost</a>, is a modification of MEV-Boost that enables based preconfirmations by running multiple rounds of MEV-Boost auctions within a single L1 slot. The usage of this primitive is to output after each round a based rollup block built by L2 block builders. As shown in the article, this approach inherits the L1 PBS pipeline and mitigates some of the negative externalities of based preconfirmations as a result.</p>\n<p>Like MEV-Boost, this fork relies on the opted-in proposer to be an auctioneer which ends the sealed auction by calling the <code>getHeader</code> (<a href=\"https://ethereum.github.io/builder-specs/#/Builder/getHeader\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Builder-API</a>) endpoint of the relays. After having signed the sealed bid, the <code>getPayload</code> (<a href=\"https://ethereum.github.io/builder-specs/#/Builder/submitBlindedBlock\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Builder-API</a>) is called by the proposer to receive the actual content of the winning bid and to publish the block in the based rollup network.</p>\n<p>In the original protocol, the end of the auction usually coincides with the end of the L1 slot (more precisely, <a href=\"https://mevboost.pics/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">near one second after it</a>); delaying it results in a high risk of not being able to broadcast the block in time to gather all the needed attestation and forgo all its associated rewards. As such, a block time is proposed every twelve seconds with consistency, enforced by Ethereum consensus.</p>\n<p>In contrast, given it consists of multiple rounds happening <em>during</em> the slot, in MR-MEV-Boost an <em>untrusted proposer is incentivized to end the auction seconds later or earlier <span class=\"math\">^{3}</span> according to the incoming bids,</em> in order to extract more more MEV. In the worst case, MR-MEV-Boost will reflect L1 block times. Another consequence of this is an inconsistent slot time for the based rollup. This can be seen as a much more serious form of timing games.</p>\n<p>In the article, the discussed possible solutions to this problem are the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduce user incentives: if users determine that a proposer is misbehaving, they stop sending transactions to said proposer.</li>\n<li>Introduce a committee (consensus) to attest to timeliness and maintain slot durations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We now argue that a trustless solution that strongly limits the proposer without requiring actions from the user does exist, and it leverages the same construction we used for the VDF-powered block production algorithm in the context of decentralized sequencing.</p>\n<p>The construction is fairly simple and consists of computing a VDF that lasts <span class=\"math\">x := 12/r</span> seconds, where <span class=\"math\">r</span> is the number of rounds in an L1 slot (the L2 block time). The proposer must calculate this VDF using the previous based rollup block hash as public input and, at the end of the round, sending it along with the body of a modified <code>getPayload</code> call. The output of the VDF is then stored in the rollup block header and if invalid can result in slashing the proposer after a successful fraud proof.</p>\n<p>With this approach the amount of time a proposer can delay the end of a round is limited: for instance if the first auction ended one second later then during the last round it won’t be able to provide three seconds of computation for the VDF but two, resulting in an invalid block and consequent slashing <span class=\"math\">^4</span>. This is because in order to start computing a valid VDF, it requires the previous block hash as its input, implying a sealed block.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49826-security-considerations-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49826-security-considerations-10\"></a>Security Considerations</h2>\n<p><strong>Are VDFs really safe for this purpose?</strong><br>\nSuppose an adversary owns hardware which is capable of computing the VDF faster compared to the baseline of honest players <em>without getting noticed</em> (otherwise the number of iterations for the VDF is adjusted by the protocol). Then, the faster the attacker (<code>max_adversary_speedup</code>), the less our construction would constrain the space of its possible actions. In particular, the sequencer would be able to commit a bit later to blocks and be able to re-organize some of them for extracting more value.</p>\n<p>However, given we don’t need the “fast proving” property, hash-chains have proven to be robust with Solana’s Proof of History and will continue to be at least in the short-term. Also, our security requirements will not be as strict as something that <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/statement-regarding-the-public-report-on-the-analysis-of-minroot/16670\">needs to be enshrined in Ethereum</a> forever.</p>\n<p>Some solutions and directions to get stronger safety guarantees can be found in the <em>”Further work”</em> section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49826-current-limitations-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49826-current-limitations-11\"></a>Current limitations</h2>\n<p><strong>Sequencer credibility</strong></p>\n<p>As with many new services which leverage (re)staking, the credibility of the sequencer has an upper bound which is the amount it has staked: if a MEV opportunity exceeds that, then a rational untrusted actor would prefer to get slashed and take the MEV reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Leader rotation can be a critical moment</strong></p>\n<p>As discussed in the batcher and registry smart contract section, the inclusion window is shifted of one slot forward at minimum compared to the sequencing window. This is needed because of the time required to settle the last batch before rotating leader, but leaves an additional slot time of at least 12 seconds in which the sequencer has room to re-organize the last L2 blocks before publishing them on the rollup peer-to-peer network. As a consequence, liveness is harmed temporarily because <span class=\"math\">S_{i+1}</span> might be building blocks on invalid state if it starts to sequence immediately.</p>\n<p>Lastly, one additional slot might not be enough to settle a batch according to recent data on <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/slot-inclusion-rates-and-blob-market-combinatorics/19817\">slot inclusion rates for blobs</a>. This can be mitigated by leveraging new inclusion preconfirmation protocols, as explained below.</p>\n<p><strong>Sequencer last-look</strong></p>\n<p>Our construction makes very difficult for a sequencer to reorg a block after it has been committed to, however it doesn’t solve front-running in its entirety. In particular, the sequencer may extract value from users transactions while building the block with associated <code>deadline</code> field. A possible solution along with its limitations is explored in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49826-conclusion-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49826-conclusion-12\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this article, we explored mechanisms to enforce the timeliness, safety, and non-extractive ordering of untrusted L2 sequencers in a decentralized rollup environment.<br>\nThe primitives discussed ensure that sequencers can act more predictably and fairly, mitigating issues such as transaction delays and data withholding. Moreover, these techniques can reduce trust assumptions for existing single-sequencer rollups, aligning with the concept of rollups functioning as <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/06/30/epochslot.html#what-should-l2s-do\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">“servers with blockchain scaffolding”</a>.

However, in our setting we just need a guarantee that the sequencer is not using specialized hardware for computing the VDF, without caring about possible leakage of confidential data from the enclave or manipulation of the wall clock / monotonic clock.</p>\n<p><strong>Adapt existing anti-ASICs Proof-of-Work algorithms</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/resources/about/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Monero</a> blockchain, launched in 2014 as a privacy and untraceable-focused alternative to Bitcoin, uses an ASIC-resistant Proof-of-Work algorithm called <a href=\"https://github.com/tevador/RandomX\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RandomX</a>. Quoting their <code>README</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>RandomX is a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm that is optimized for general-purpose CPUs.

Fairblock provides threshold MPC encryption that can be utilized in Monomer rollups through a module built for Cosmos SDK chains.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/3/2311821ac2a3b134e2df081bbf12f2d71f2c31cc.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/2311821ac2a3b134e2df081bbf12f2d71f2c31cc\" title=\"451x500\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/3/2311821ac2a3b134e2df081bbf12f2d71f2c31cc_2_451x500.png\" alt=\"451x500\" data-base62-sha1=\"50edNT7A2IU2M9DMxkY6SJ1Swxe\" width=\"451\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/3/2311821ac2a3b134e2df081bbf12f2d71f2c31cc_2_451x500.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/3/2311821ac2a3b134e2df081bbf12f2d71f2c31cc_2_676x750.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/3/2311821ac2a3b134e2df081bbf12f2d71f2c31cc_2_902x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Fairblock enables blockchain developers to integrate pre-execution encryption. This pre-execution encryption is made possible through their threshold MPC network that delivers identity-based encryption (IBE), and soon custom encryption schemes, to partner chains. Fairblock’s MPC network, called Fairyring, generates threshold encryption and decryption keys for each supported Monomer rollup, while the rollups themselves receive and process encrypted transactions natively.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49798-how-it-works-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49798-how-it-works-2\"></a>How it Works</h1>\n<p>FairyRing uses decentralized key generation to issue a master secret key (MSK) for each epoch (every 100 blocks). From each MSK, a master public key (MPK) can be derived. Once the MPK is derived, it is relayed to a Monomer chain where it will be used to encrypt each requested transaction. In parallel, the MSK is split into equal shares for the amount of FairyRing validators participating in the network. For each request for decryption, FairyRing validators use their share of the MSK to collectively derive the associated private keys.</p>\n<p>In threshold IBE, users or developers can program the decryption conditions for transactions. Onchain conditions that could trigger decryption could be a block height, the price of an asset, a smart contract call, verification of a ZK proof, or the end of a governance poll, for example. Identity-based encryption allows for the programmability of decryption and allows for decryption to be triggered by “IDs,” which can be either onchain conditions or on/offchain identifiers or attributes that certain wallets prove ownership of.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49798-whats-possible-with-fairomon-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49798-whats-possible-with-fairomon-3\"></a>What’s Possible with Fairomon</h1>\n<p>MPC encryption can make a number of previously inaccessible applications possible within rollups, most notably encrypted mempools, censorship-resistant sequencing, and DeFi and gaming apps such as encrypted orders, leaderless NFT auctions, ID-gated content, and highest-hand-wins card games like blackjack.</p>\n<p>The transaction flow for an application is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User submits an encrypted tx and decryption condition (e.g. target height) to an app</li>\n<li>Chain receives encrypted txs in mempool</li>\n<li>Encrypted txs are sorted by target heights and ordering within a block is committed to inside of the integrated x/pep module</li>\n<li>When target height or decryption condition is reached, the app chain receives decryption key from the Fairyring chain</li>\n<li>Encrypted txs are decrypted and executed inside the BeginBlock method of the x/pep module</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the architecture diagram below for a detailed description of how Fairyring integrates with a Monomer appchain.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/7/2/723cc342b05947059263449d26d5e63a0010c14a.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/723cc342b05947059263449d26d5e63a0010c14a\" title=\"690x147\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/2/723cc342b05947059263449d26d5e63a0010c14a_2_690x147.png\" alt=\"690x147\" data-base62-sha1=\"giAC8NOqAwl6za4KBt4x9f9JiJk\" width=\"690\" height=\"147\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/2/723cc342b05947059263449d26d5e63a0010c14a_2_690x147.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/2/723cc342b05947059263449d26d5e63a0010c14a_2_1035x220.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/2/723cc342b05947059263449d26d5e63a0010c14a_2_1380x294.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F2EF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Monomer links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/polymerdao/monomer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/polymerdao/monomer/tree/main/doc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Docs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fairblock links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fairblock.network/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Website</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Fairblock\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Github</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.fairblock.network/docs/basics/overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Docs</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/accessible-encryption-for-ethereum-rollups-with-fairomon/20349\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/accessible-encryption-for-ethereum-rollups-with-fairomon/20349","pubDate":"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 15:45:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-20349"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/accessible-encryption-for-ethereum-rollups-with-fairomon/20349.rss","#text":"Accessible Encryption for Ethereum Rollups with Fairomon"}},{"title":"Outdated encryption stored on blockchain","dc:creator":"knev","category":"Security","description":"<p>Please pardon my ignorance.

It was first introduced in 2021 by [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04347\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1</a>] as k-MEV and further elaborated by [<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/445.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2</a>]. It is commonly assumed that controlling multiple slots in a sequence allows to capture significantly more MEV than controlling them individually. This derives from MEV accruing superlinearly over time. The <a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/multi-block-mev/457\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">most discussed</a> multi-block MEV strategies include <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/445.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">TWAP oracle manipulation attacks</a> on DEXes and producing forced liquidations by price manipulation.</p>\n<p>After the merge, [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04430\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">3</a>] have looked into the first four months of data on multi-block MEV and summarized it as <em>“preliminary and non-conclusive results, indicating [that] builders employ super-linear bidding strategies to secure consecutive block space\"</em>.</p>\n<p>With the recent Attester-Proposer-Separation (APS) and pre-confirmation discussions, multi-block MEV has become more of a pressing issue again as it might be prohibitive for some of the proposed designs (For a more in-depth overview, we’ve created a <a href=\"https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK07aBCU=/?share_link_id=220296247588\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">diagram of recently proposed mechanism designs</a> and also <a href=\"https://x.com/mikeneuder\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mike Neuder</a> lately gave a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToVi-zsiE4M\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">comprehensive overview</a>).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49786-methodology-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49786-methodology-4\"></a>Methodology</h2>\n<p>In order to get a better understanding of the historical prevalence of multi-block MEV, we decided to look at all slots from the Merge in September ‘22 until May ‘24 (totalling roughly 4.3 million slots) and analyze the corresponding data on validators and builders and on MEV-boost payments (if applicable). The scope was to identify patterns of unusual consecutive slot sequences and accompanying MEV values. <a href=\"https://mevboost.pics/data.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The data</a> has been kindly provided by Toni Wahrstätter and contains information per slot on relay, builder pubkey, proposer pubkey and MEV-Boost value as well as a builder pubkey and validator pubkey mapping. In the labeling of validators for our purposes staking pool providers such as Lido or Rocket Pool are treated as one entity.</p>\n<p>MEV-Boost payments are used as a proxy for the MEV per block. We acknowledge that this is only a non-perfect approximation. The ascending MEV-Boost first-price auction by its nature of being public essentially functions like a second price + 1 wei auction (thanks to Julian for pointing this out!). Hence, we strictly speaking only get an estimate of the intrinsic value of the second highest bidder. However, as [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01329\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">4</a>] have observed more than 88% of MEV-Boost auctions were competitive and [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13931\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">5</a>] concluded that the average profit margin per top three builder is between 1% and 5.4%, further indicating a competitive market between the top builders. Based on this, despite the limitations we deem it feasible to use the MEV-Boost payments as an approximation for the generated MEV per block.</p>\n<p>To establish a baseline of expected multi-slot sequences, a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted. In this simulation, builders were randomly assigned to each slot within the specified time period, based on their observed daily market share during that period. The frequency of consecutive slots, ranging in length from 1 to 25 (the longest observed sequence in the empirical data), was recorded. This procedure was repeated 100 times, and the average was taken. We decided to use daily market shares for the main analysis as in the investigated time period market shares have strongly shifted [4]. For comparison we also ran the analysis on monthly and overall market shares.</p>\n<p>Further, base fee volatility data has been included to cross-check effects of low and high-volatility periods. Previous research (e.g. [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19150\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">6</a>] &amp; [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01622\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">7</a>]) has focused on token price volatility effects based on CEX-prices. As we are interested in low- and high-MEV environments, we deem base fee volatility for our use case more fitting, as it is driven by empty or full blocks which are at least partially a result of the prevalence of MEV opportunities.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49786-empirical-findings-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49786-empirical-findings-5\"></a>Empirical Findings</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49786-finding-1-fewer-multi-slot-sequences-exist-than-assumed-by-random-distribution-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49786-finding-1-fewer-multi-slot-sequences-exist-than-assumed-by-random-distribution-6\"></a>Finding 1: Fewer multi-slot sequences exist than assumed by random distribution</h3>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/6/b6ab4921507e70c619d5121b5abf611e67e2138f.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/b6ab4921507e70c619d5121b5abf611e67e2138f\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/6/b6ab4921507e70c619d5121b5abf611e67e2138f_2_533x426.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"q3XSoYCSA2iCGImNM9PoiLu7vfF\" width=\"533\" height=\"426\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/6/b6ab4921507e70c619d5121b5abf611e67e2138f_2_533x426.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/6/b6ab4921507e70c619d5121b5abf611e67e2138f_2_799x639.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/6/b6ab4921507e70c619d5121b5abf611e67e2138f.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EFEEED\"></a></strong></div><br>\n<em>Figure 1: Comparison of statistically expected vs. observed multi-slot sequences (note that slots &gt; 25 have been summarized in slot 25 for brevity)</em><p></p>\n<p>Firstly, the prevalence of multi-slot sequences with the same builder proposing the block was investigated to determine if they are more common than would be expected by chance.</p>\n<p>Comparing the results of the Monte Carlo simulation as a baseline in expected distribution (blue) with the observed distribution (orange), it can be seen that significantly fewer multi-slot sequences occur than expected (Figure 1).

Note that the gray numbers in Figure 3 provide the sample size for each slot length. So it can be observed that the longer the sequence, almost linearly the average MEV-boost payment per slot in the sequence rises. At this stage of the research we can only speculate why this is the case. It could be driven by a higher value in longer consecutive sequences, but also by alternative effects. For example, Julian rightfully pointed out it could also be driven by an increasing intrinsic value for the second highest-bidder due to accumulating MEV in private order flow and the intrinsic valuation of the winning bidder remains constant. Or as Danning suggested, it might be driven by certain types of proprietary order flow (e.g. CEX-DEX arbitrage) being more valuable in certain time periods (e.g. volatile periods) leading to more consecutive sequences as well as higher MEV-Boost payments on average. For a more comprehensive answer and a more in-depth understanding, an analysis on the true block value (builder profits plus proposer payments) and potentially on individual tx level is necessary. We leave this open for future research.</p>\n<p>This trend also holds when plotting the average payments for each individual builder.

Additionally, it is interesting to note that for the Pearson correlation coefficient, the complete data set and the top 50% quantile dataset behave similarly, which is not the case for the Spearman and Kendall coefficients. This might be an indicator that the rank ordering for the lower 50% quantile can be more reliably predicted, further underlying that high MEV values are volatile and spiky, hence difficult to predict.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49786-finding-5-no-indication-of-builder-specialization-on-low-or-high-base-fee-volatility-environment-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49786-finding-5-no-indication-of-builder-specialization-on-low-or-high-base-fee-volatility-environment-10\"></a>Finding 5: No indication of builder specialization on low- or high base fee volatility environment</h3>\n<p>Previous research (e.g. [6] &amp; [7]) has found that certain builders specialize in low- or high token price volatility environments, with volatility being measured on CEX-price changes. Further, [5] observe that different builders have different strategies with some focusing on high-value blocks while others on gaining market share in low-MEV blocks.</p>\n<p>Complementary, to determine whether low or high base fee volatility impacts (multi-block) MEV, we analyzed changes in base fee data to identify periods of high volatility. The base fee fluctuations are driven by whether the gas usage in the previous block was below or above the gas target, as defined by <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-1559</a>. To identify high volatility environments, we employed two methods: (i) a more naive approach that calculated price changes per slot, classifying the highest and lowest (negative) 10% of these changes as high volatility periods, with the remaining 80 % of slots being categorized as low volatility. Consequently, high volatility blocks occur following a block with either minimal or significant MEV and/or priority tips. (ii) Secondly, the Garman-Klass volatility [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.3492\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">8</a>] was calculated on an epoch basis, with slots in the top 20% of GK values designated as high volatility. This approach allows us to examine longer periods characterized by minimal or significant MEV and/or priority tips.</p>\n<p>Initial correlation analysis shows only a low correlation between low and high volatile periods and the respective builders (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%27s_V\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cramér’s V</a> for the naive approach 0.0664 and for the Garman-Klass 0.0772). This indicates that there seems to be no builder specialization based on the volatility environment of the base fee. So, it can be observed that in contrast to token price volatility for base price volatility there seems to not have a specialization of builders developed (yet). Further research is needed to elaborate on this first finding.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49786-limitations-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49786-limitations-11\"></a>Limitations</h2>\n<p>The research presented here is intended as an initial exploratory analysis of the data rather than a comprehensive study. It is important to note several limitations that affect the scope and conclusions of this analysis. Firstly, it is limited by the considered data set being publicly available MEV-Boost payments data. This leaves out roughly 10 % of non-MEV-Boost facilitated blocks and it does not reflect potential private off-chain agreements. Additionally, the data was partially incomplete and in other parts contained duplicate information (see the <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kKM-da6xP7St8puzPuyn1Ndag6a6wsg3#scrollTo=0d986969-2492-49ac-ad92-8ff78e2a7fe1&amp;line=2&amp;uniqifier=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">notebook</a> for details). Further, missed slots have been excluded so far, a more detailed analysis in the future might focus on the particular effects missed slots have on the subsequent MEV. Lastly, as outlined in the methodology section, using MEV-Boost payments is only a proxy for captured MEV and the competitive metric used in [4] is only partially applicable for our use case.</p>\n<p>As outlined in section Finding 2 it currently can only be speculated about the causation of the increasing average MEV-Boost payouts. Furthermore, running the analysis on the true block value (proposer payment plus builder profits) might generate further insights and solidify the research findings.</p>\n<p>On the frequency analysis, the approach contains somewhat a chicken and egg-problem. The Monte Carlo simulation is run on market shares, while the market shares potentially derive from multi-slot sequences. We see a daily time window as an appropriate balance between precision and the need to filter out isolated effects, although this can be critically challenged.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49786-conclusions-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49786-conclusions-12\"></a>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Analyzing block meta-data since the merge, we observe that multi-slot sequences occur less frequently than statistically expected. Further, we observe that the average payments for longer multi-slot sequences increase with the sequence length. Similarly, the payments per slot position in longer sequences also slightly rise. This might indicate that there is generally value in longer consecutive sequences. However, considering the only slight increase in value and the fewer observed multi-slot sequences than expected we so far see no indication of deliberate multi-slot MEV strategies being deployed. Also on individual builder level we currently don’t observe strong deviations from expected distributions. This may also stem from the fact that in the current PBS mechanism, with MEV-Boost operating as a just-in-time (JIT) block auction, creating multi-block MEV opportunities carries inherent risk. This risk arises as creating these opportunities typically requires an upfront investment, and the opportunity might be captured by a competing builder in the next slot, assuming no off-chain collusion between the proposer and builder. This element of risk is a critical factor that could be eliminated by some of the proposed changes to the mechanism (e.g. some APS designs), making it an essential consideration when defining future mechanisms.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49786-references-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49786-references-13\"></a>References</h2>\n<p>[1] Babel K, Daian P, Kelkar M, Juels A.

Thanks again to Francesco for coming up with the second proposal.</em></p>\n<p>Whether we want to implement slot auctions into ePBS is an <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Arguments-in-Favor-and-Against-Slot-Auctions-in-ePBS-c7acde3ff21b4a22a3d41ac4cf4c75d6?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">active discussion area</a>, and support for slot auctions was signaled in the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fQx_UbaPX-E?si=C8ALtI4zOSmFjRpN\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">seventh ePBS breakout call</a>. Currently, the ecosystem lacks knowledge about the fork choice safety of slot auctions in the <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7732-enshrined-proposer-builder-separation-epbs/19634\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">current ePBS proposal</a>. This note presents two strawman proposals to start discussing the forkchoice safety of slot auction ePBS.</p>\n<p>This note presupposes the reader is familiar with the ePBS proposal (<a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7732-enshrined-proposer-builder-separation-epbs/19634\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-7732</a>).  An essential part of this EIP is that a <em>payload boost</em> is applied to a beacon block if the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/payload-timeliness-committee-ptc-an-epbs-design/16054#proposer-initiated-splitting-18\">Payload-timeliness committee (PTC)</a> reaches a quorum. If an execution payload is seen on time by a majority of the PTC, the beacon block that corresponds to the execution payload receives additional fork-choice weight (Reveal Boost). If the PTC observes a timely message from the builder stating that it withholds its payload, the additional fork-choice weight is given to the parent block of the beacon block corresponding with the withhold message (Withholding Boost).</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0x03c29504CEcCa30B93FF5774183a1358D41fbeB1/CPYI91s98cp9zKFkanKs_qotYzw09kWvouaAa9GXBrQ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">slot auction</a> ePBS, the beacon proposer does not commit to an execution payload hash, unlike in block auction ePBS. Instead, it commits to a specific builder that can submit an execution payload when it is time to reveal. The first problem is that a builder could submit multiple execution payloads. In this note, we will refer to this as a builder equivocation.</p>\n<p>In block auction ePBS, something similar to equivocation is possible. The builder could wait for at least one PTC member to vote <code>PAYLOAD_ABSENT</code> and then release a withhold message and an execution payload to split the PTC’s view such that none of the three vote options (<code>PAYLOAD_ABSENT</code>, <code>PAYLOAD_WITHHELD</code>, <code>PAYLOAD_PRESENT</code>) reaches the <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/874767108809031740/1272916231250382939\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">quorum of 50%</a> of the votes.</p>\n<p>In block auction ePBS, this equivocation does not benefit the builder much. If the PTC does not reach a quorum, no payload boost is applied, and the honest next-slot validator will take the payload as head. If the builder equivocates, the protocol does not need to guarantee Builder Reveal Safety since the builder does not act as the protocol expects. Still, the builder does not have the flexibility to submit a different execution payload since the beacon block commits to the execution payload hash.</p>\n<p>It could be that the builder is incentivized to play a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09032\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">timing game</a> and eventually decides that it is best if the block were withheld. The builder could submit a withhold message and see if the PTC will reach a quorum on <code>PAYLOAD_WITHHELD</code>. If the PTC does not seem to do so, and the PTC also has not yet reached a quorum on <code>PAYLOAD_ABSENT</code>, the builder reveals its payload after all. This attack seems difficult to pull off, but it allows the builder to check whether it can renege on its promised payment to the proposer while still landing its payload on-chain if it has to pay (assuming an honest next-slot proposer).</p>\n<p>In slot auction ePBS, a builder may be more incentivized to equivocate because it can change the contents of its execution payload. For example, the builder could broadcast a particular execution payload, but a short time later, a significant MEV opportunity appears, and the builder now wants to broadcast a new execution payload.</p>\n<p>Preventing equivocations in slot auction ePBS would be desirable because equivocations would cause insecurity in fork choice. Specifically, we want to obtain the following properties with minimal changes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/bulb.png?v=12\" title=\":bulb:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":bulb:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><strong>Desiderata</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the builder reveals precisely one timely execution payload, it should retain the same Builder Reveal Safety guarantees as in block auction ePBS</li>\n<li>If the builder reveals multiple timely and equivocating execution payloads,<br>\na. no execution payload should go on-chain,<br>\nb. but the Unconditional Payment should be as strong as in block auction ePBS</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Should slashing or a penalty be applied to equivocating execution payload messages? This question is relevant to block and slot auction ePBS, although the potential benefits of equivocation are likely to be higher in slot auction ePBS. Since ePBS still allows local block construction, it seems unwise to apply harsh slashing or penalties if there is equivocation because this may disincentivize local block construction. Moreover, since it is not clear that there are significant gains to be made from equivocating execution payloads, and if gains are to be made, slashing or penalties do not qualitatively change this, so slashing or penalties are not immediately necessary.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49750-proposal-1-vote-for-execution-payload-hash-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49750-proposal-1-vote-for-execution-payload-hash-1\"></a>Proposal 1: Vote for Execution Payload Hash</h2>\n<p>The first strawman proposal to obtain these properties involves changing the block auction ePBS fork-choice specification as follows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/bulb.png?v=12\" title=\":bulb:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":bulb:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <strong>Proposal 1: Vote for Execution Payload Hash</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Replace <code>PAYLOAD_PRESENT</code> with <code>execution_payload_hash</code></li>\n<li>If no PTC quorum is reached, let the honest next-slot validator use an empty block as its head instead of a full block.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A PTC member would now vote for the <code>execution_payload_hash</code> it has observed instead of simply voting whether a payload is present. Reveal boost is applied if a quorum is reached on <code>execution_payload_hash</code>. Intuitively, this is necessary for slot auctions since the PTC now indicates which execution payload should be used if the block is full and not just that the block is full.</p>\n<p>It seems like desideratum 1—the same Builder Reveal Safety as in block auction ePBS—is immediately satisfied since an honest builder does not release equivocating execution payloads. A PTC member’s <code>execution_payload_hash</code> vote functions the same as a <code>PAYLOAD_PRESENT</code> vote.</p>\n<p>If the builder equivocates but the PTC still reaches a quorum on <code>execution_payload_hash</code>, then the execution payload will make it on-chain in the same way a payload would have made it on-chain if the builder did not equivocate. I believe this is fine because the builder released an equivocating payload that did not split the view of the PTC (sufficiently). This indicates that this equivocating payload is a minor threat to the fork-choice security. Although this outcome contradicts desideratum 2a, the timely requirement in desideratum 2 should be read as the execution payload intends to split the view of the PTC sufficiently.</p>\n<p>If the builder equivocates and the PTC does not reach a quorum, then the next-slot honest proposer should see an empty block as its head. The builder loses some of its Builder Reveal Safety because it could be that the builder reveals only one payload (does not equivocate), yet the PTC does not reach a quorum. However, Builder Reveal Safety is not very strong in block auction ePBS either because a next-slot rational proposer would prefer to build on an empty block than a full block since these are more valuable (the ex-post reorg safety is low if reveal boost is not applied). Changing the default next-slot honest proposer behavior from seeing a full block to an empty block as its head does not change much in Builder Reveal Safety, and the system then satisfies desideratum 2.</p>\n<p>What if the next-slot proposer is dishonest? The builder could collude with the next-slot proposer and broadcast messages such that the PTC does not reach a quorum and include an execution payload late. This is similar to the attack in block auction ePBS, where a builder tries to get Withhold Boost to apply but releases an execution payload if it does not succeed. The builder and next-slot proposer collusion allows the builder to play aggressive timing games while ensuring Builder Reveal Safety. These timing games come at the expense of the execution validation time of the attesting committee. It is not immediately apparent what this attack would gain for the builder and next-slot proposer collusion since the builder timing game gain comes almost entirely from the next-slot proposer’s revenues.</p>\n<p>The downside of this proposal is the problem of free data availability. The PTC could now reach a quorum on an <code>execution_payload_hash</code>. These PTC votes would end up on-chain, and an adversary could use them to show that a piece of data was available to the PTC. Yet the adversary would not have to pay the base fee needed to provide the data on-chain; it only has to pay the proposer to commit to the adversary as the builder.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49750-proposal-2-pretend-payload-absent-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49750-proposal-2-pretend-payload-absent-2\"></a>Proposal 2: Pretend Payload Absent</h2>\n<p>The second strawman proposal does not suffer from the free data availability problem and achieves the desiderata as follows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/bulb.png?v=12\" title=\":bulb:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":bulb:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <strong>Proposal 2: Pretend Payload Absent</strong><br>\nIf the next-slot proposer/attesters observe(s) at least two equivocating payloads, it/they assign(s) no additional fork-choice weight to any empty or full block</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The behavior of a PTC member does not change from the block auction ePBS specification. However, suppose a proposer sees that the block producer in the previous slot released equivocating execution payloads. In that case, it ignores the fork-choice weight the PTC may have given to any fork.</p>\n<p>If the builder is honest, this does not change its Builder Reveal Safety since the system works exactly as it does in block auction ePBS. Desideratum 1 is thus immediately satisfied.</p>\n<p>If the builder equivocates, an honest-but-rational proposer will choose to build on an empty block since it allows the proposer to extract the MEV from two slots of time instead of one. The attesters will not object to this since they observed the equivocating payloads and assigned no additional fork-choice weight to any forks. Therefore, if the next-slot proposer and attesters are honest, desideratum 2 is also satisfied.</p>\n<p>The next-slot proposer could collude with the builder. The builder could equivocate, and the next-slot proposer could choose to build on a full block. Similarly to the collusion situation described in the first proposal, though, the gain that a builder gets from this equivocation seems to primarily come from the profits the next-slot proposer could make. It is not clear that the joint utility of the collusion increases by enough to justify the collusion.</p>\n<p>A builder and a next-slot proposer could collude to ensure an execution payload does not become canonical. Consider a builder that submits an execution payload, and the PTC reaches a quorum on whether this payload is timely. Later, the builder regrets the contents of its execution payload and aims to remove it from the canonical chain. It could then release an equivocation payload so the next-slot proposer will not build on the undesirable execution payload. This is similar to a builder not revealing its block in block auction ePBS.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, these strawman proposals seem to achieve the same fork-choice safety under slot auctions as under block auctions with minimal changes. While the first proposal has a problem with free data availability, the second proposal may be more susceptible to builder games, such as reorging its execution payload. The lack of free data availability and being less susceptible to builder games are advantages of slot auctions in ePBS. Further research on a design that simultaneously solves both problems would be very valuable.

This market allows for lower latency and more flexibility for the builder, as the builder only needs to commit to its bid once the proposer asks for it. This market, however, requires the proposer to connect to the builder’s RPC and actively pull bid(s) from it. Smaller builders who lack this connectivity with the validator set can use the push-based P2P market. This market has stricter rules for what bidders can do but does not need the proposer to pull bid(s) from it since bids are pushed to the proposer.</p>\n<p>This note explores the role of the P2P market in ePBS. Although there has been some <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/builder-bidding-behaviors-in-epbs/20129\">initial</a> <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@potuz/HyhN0Nt9A\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">exploration</a> on the topic, this note presents a clear counterfactual of a world where the P2P market were not included in EIP-7732. This note also emphasizes <a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/tee-boost/3741/5\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">multiplexing</a>—the ability of proposers to discover builders—as the most important aspect of the P2P market.</p>\n<p>The three arguments in favor of the P2P market that the author has seen in previous work are: 1) it allows anyone to set a floor price for the auction, 2) it can be used for MEV-Burn in future protocol upgrades, and 3) it lowers entry barriers for new entrants or long-tail builders.</p>\n<p>The first argument is that allowing anyone to bid via the publicly observable P2P market gives all validators the ability to set a floor price for the auction. Validators can bid based on the block that they could locally build. Builders must then bid at least above the bid of these validators to obtain the execution payload construction rights. It has been argued that this is valuable if a cartel of builders intends to keep bids low. The floor price, however, would not break up a cartel. Although proposers would make slightly more revenue in this case, it is unclear what the value of such a floor price is to the protocol.</p>\n<p>The beacon proposer selling the rights may be the ideal party to set a reserve price. As I argue in <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0x03c29504CEcCa30B93FF5774183a1358D41fbeB1/8aCbi_a-Gh5DWnkJWstm8zA5fvtoQB-QR5we7C8XC90\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this post</a>, a proposer may want to put a higher reserve price than its valuation for the execution payload construction rights to attract higher bids from builders. The P2P market allows the proposer to signal its reserve price to the market. In this sense, the P2P market allows the validator and other participants to express their preferences.</p>\n<p>The second argument states that the P2P market may facilitate <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-burn-a-simple-design/15590\">MEV-Burn</a> in future protocol upgrades. MEV-Burn aims to decouple the rewards from selling execution payload construction rights from being a validator. This has numerous benefits; for example, it decreases the value of using a staking service provider (SSP) since MEV-Burn decreases the variance of validator payoffs. MEV-Burn requires that builder bids be legible to the protocol. Most designs achieve this by having a committee that observes the best available bids. If ePBS would only have the direct connection market, the MEV-Burn designs need to be revisited since a proposer selling the execution rights is incentivized to understate the amount that will be burnt. Still, the P2P market is expected to only reflect a small portion of the value of the execution payload construction rights, hence even ePBS with the P2P market may not be satisfactory for an effective MEV-Burn solution.</p>\n<p>The last reason for the P2P market is that it would allow builders from which proposers are unlikely to pull bids to still compete in the market. Proposers may be unlikely to pull bids from builders that infrequently participate in the auction because they are very specialized or from new builders unknown to the proposer. This could be because proposers have an outdated whitelist of builders from which to pull bids. Allowing these proposers to participate in the push-based P2P market will result in more builder diversity in block construction, which may benefit the protocol.</p>\n<p>This last reason is what we will explore in this post. Specifically, what does the Ethereum ecosystem gain by enshrining the push-based P2P market aside from an out-of-protocol solution that facilitates small builders’ participation in the market?</p>\n<p>Shea Ketsdever recently released a post on <a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/tee-boost/3741\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">TEE-Boost</a>, an adaptation of MEV-Boost that uses Trusted Execution Environments. In this post, she highlights the different roles a relay plays. One of the roles is multiplexing, allowing proposers to discover builders who may want to participate in the auction.</p>\n<p>The ePBS P2P market aims to achieve multiplexing. In the context of ePBS, multiplexing has at least two facets: trustlessness and value reflection. Trustlessness is important because ePBS removes the trust that proposers and builders must place in a relay to facilitate the fair exchange. Value reflection is essential because a multiplexing tool that poorly reflects the value bidders assign to the auctioned item will not efficiently match an auctioneer with the correct bidder.</p>\n<p>The ePBS P2P market scores very well on the trustlessness front. Neither a proposer nor a builder must trust anyone since bids are broadcast via the P2P network, and the winning bid is committed to on-chain. The P2P market, however, scores poorly on the value reflection front. Since the P2P network must be DOS resistant, it cannot handle too many bids, so bidders will likely not be allowed to bid as often as they could in MEV-Boost, meaning they have to be strategic about when they bid. Moreover, early bids will not be able to be canceled, which could lead to strategic builders only winning via the P2P market if the valuation of other builders that operate via the direct connection market has decreased (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PXGPFFneMI\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">adverse selection</a>). Finally, the value reflection of the P2P market relative to the RPC market will worsen as the RPC market becomes more sophisticated while the P2P market becomes stale.</p>\n<p>How would an out-of-protocol actor facilitate multiplexing if ePBS were deployed? In MEV-Boost, relays facilitate multiplexing because submitting blocks to relays is (largely) permissionless, and relays are well-connected to validators. In ePBS, a relay - from no one referred to as a bid curation relay - would look different. A bid curation relay could open an RPC endpoint that proposers connect to and host an auction where builders submit bids, like in MEV-Boost. Bids, however, do not need to contain transaction data since the bid curation relay would not be responsible for the fair exchange problem that is solved via ePBS. Bids in ePBS are a bid value and the hash of the execution payload. A proposer then pulls the highest bid from the bid curation relay and, if it so desires, commits to the highest bid via the in-protocol ePBS system. A winning builder then sees this in-protocol commitment and publishes the block via ePBS.</p>\n<p>It becomes clear that the trust assumptions that proposers and builders must place in a bid curation relay are vastly lower than in MEV-Boost. Essentially, the proposer and builders must trust the bid curation relay to forward the highest-paying bid when the proposer asks for it. The bid curation relay is not trusted with the block contents (<a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/tee-boost/3741\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">builder privacy</a> is preserved) and is not responsible for unconditional payment (<a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/tee-boost/3741\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">data availability and validation</a> are enforced via the protocol).</p>\n<p>The ePBS relay scores worse on the trustlessness front than the P2P market since the proposer and builders must trust the relay not to censor its bids. On the other hand, the value reflection of such a bid curation relay could be far better. The relay could offer bid cancellations and high-frequency bidding to builders. Moreover, relays could invest in latency reductions and charge for this, as some do in MEV-boost. If a relay successfully reduces latency, more prominent builders may connect to it. This means the value reflection of relays relative to directly connected builders may remain stable or improve over time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/tee-boost/3741/5?u=julian\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Shea also highlights</a> another option that has been discussed widely before: next to the P2P market; there could be an on-chain registry of builders. There could be a smart contract that any builder could write its RPC endpoint to. Any validator could then see the available RPC endpoints and pull bids from it during its slot. This alternative scores well on the trustlessness front since no trust is required, and it scores well on the value reflection point since it allows all builders to compete on a similar level. The proposer could pull from this registry every time it is supposed to propose a block.</p>\n<p>Why do we care about multiplexing? Multiplexing contributes to the credible neutrality of the network. In the context of ePBS, credible neutrality may mean something like this: the builder with the highest valuation for the execution payload construction rights is allocated these rights. If proposers were to rely solely on directly connected builders, some long-tail builders who happened to have an exceptionally high value for a specific block might be excluded. If proposers rely on bid curation relays, they may not forward the highest-paying bid because they prefer to forward another bid for whatever reason. If proposers rely on an on-chain registry of builders, it may not connect to the newer or smaller builders.</p>\n<p>Allowing multiplexing to contribute to credible neutrality is a trade-off between trustlessness and value reflection. If a completely trustless market is so poor at value reflection that it never surfaces a winning bid, it does not contribute much to credible neutrality. If a perfectly value-reflecting market puts a lot of trust in one party, the benefit of credible neutrality is also nonexistent.</p>\n<p>To conclude, the P2P market is easy to implement, and its maintenance does not require a hard fork so clients can iterate freely. Although the P2P market only contributes a little to the core functionality of ePBS, there are virtually no downsides to implementing it, and it is a nice feature that may benefit some users and could be beneficial for proposers as it increases their revenues and may be helpful for MEV-Burn in the future. Further work could specify the P2P market rules and how an on-chain registry of builder RPC endpoints could work.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-role-of-the-p2p-market-in-epbs/20330\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-role-of-the-p2p-market-in-epbs/20330","pubDate":"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 16:01:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-20330"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-role-of-the-p2p-market-in-epbs/20330.rss","#text":"The Role of the P2P Market in ePBS"}},{"title":"An Automatic Technique to Detect Storage Collisions and Vulnerabilities within Solidity Smart Contract","dc:creator":"WaizKhan7","category":"Security","description":"<p>Storage collisions and vulnerabilities within Ethereum smart contracts can lead to unexpected issues like freezing funds, escalating privileges, and financial asset theft.

I still think Vitalik’s <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>Endgame</em></a> summarizes the best-case outcome most succinctly with,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Block production is centralized, block validation is trustless and highly decentralized, and censorship is still prevented.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can operationalize each of these statements into a design goal for our system:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>“Block production is centralized.”</em> <span class=\"math\">\\rightarrow</span> MEV is a fact of life in financial systems, and some actors will inevitably specialize in its extraction. We can’t expect solo-stakers to run profitable builders, but we can encourage competition and transparency in the MEV markets. When discussing <code>MEV-boost</code>, we usually describe it as aiming to democratize access to MEV for all proposers (which it does extremely well), but one under-discussed element of the existing system is that it <em>encourages builder competition</em> by creating a transparent market for buying block space. There are (and always will be) advantages and economies of scale for being a big builder (e.g., colocation with relays, acquiring exclusive order flow deals, and holding large inventory on various trading venues – for more, see this <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13931\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">recent paper</a> from Burak, Danning, Thomas, and Florian), but anyone can send blocks and compete in the auction. Another important element of <code>MEV-boost</code> is that the auction happens Just-In-Time (JIT) for the block proposal, making <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/on-attestations-block-propagation-and-timing-games/20272\">timing games</a> around the block proposal deadline valuable to the proposer who serves as the auctioneer. Still, the real-time nature of the auction ensures that the builder with the highest value <em>for this specific slot</em> wins the auction (rather than, e.g., the builder with the highest average value for any slot – see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03116\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Max &amp; Mallesh’s argument</a> for why ahead-of-time auctions are more centralized). This leads to <strong>design goal <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1:</span> encourage builder competition.</strong><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#fn1dst\"><span class=\"math\">^{[1]}</span></a><a name=\"fn1\"></a></li>\n<li><em>“Block validation is trustless and highly decentralized”</em><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#fn2dst\"><span class=\"math\">^{[2]}</span></a><a name=\"fn2\"></a> <span class=\"math\">\\rightarrow</span> Ethereum’s primary focus has been preserving the validator set’s decentralization (why this is important in item <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span> below). This fundamental tenet instantiates itself in both the engineering/technical design and the economic/incentive design. On the engineering front, the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">spec</a> is written with the <a href=\"https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base/hardware/hardware-requirements\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">minimum hardware requirements</a> in mind. This constraint ensures that participation in Ethereum’s consensus is <em>feasible</em> given (relatively) modest resources. On the economic level, the goal is to minimize the disparity in financial outcomes between at-home stakers and professional operators. Beyond feasibility, this aims to make at-home staking <em>not too irrational.</em> This double negative is tongue-in-cheek but hopefully conveys the message of trying to ensure there is some economic viability to at-home staking rather than staking through a centralized provider. Another lens for interpreting this is keeping the marginal value of sophistication low. We can’t expect at-home operators to have the exact same rewards as Coinbase and Lido (e.g., because they may have higher network latency), but the centralized staking providers shouldn’t benefit greatly from sophistication. This leads to <strong>design goal <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2:</span> limit the value of validator sophistication.</strong></li>\n<li><em>“Censorship is prevented.”</em> <span class=\"math\">\\rightarrow</span> Credible neutrality is what differentiates crypto-economic systems from FinTech. If centralized entities determine which transactions land on chain and which do not, it’s over. To ensure the anti-fragility and neutrality of Ethereum, we must rely on a <a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/decentralized-crypto-needs-you-to-be-a-geographical-decentralization-maxi/1385\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">geographically distributed</a> validators; the validator set is the most decentralized part of the block production pipeline. In my opinion, (i) the main point of having a decentralized validator set is to allow those validators to express different preferences over the transactions that land on chain (“high preference entropy” – <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/unbundling-staking-towards-rainbow-staking/18683\">h/t Dr. Monnot</a>), and (ii) relying on this decentralization is the only way to preserve neutrality of the chain (c.f., <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/uncrowdable-inclusion-lists-the-tension-between-chain-neutrality-preconfirmations-and-proposer-commitments/19372\"><em>Uncrowdable Inclusion Lists</em></a> for more discussion on chain neutrality). This leads to <strong>design goal <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3:</span> preserve the neutrality of Ethereum block space.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Right. To summarize:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>“Block production is centralized.”</em> <span class=\"math\">\\rightarrow</span> <strong>design goal <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1:</span> encourage builder competition.</strong></li>\n<li><em>“Block validation is trustless and highly decentralized”</em> <span class=\"math\">\\rightarrow</span> <strong>design goal <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2:</span> limit the value of validator sophistication.</strong></li>\n<li><em>“Censorship is prevented.”</em> <span class=\"math\">\\rightarrow</span> <strong>design goal <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3:</span> preserve the neutrality of Ethereum block space.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ok.

As in <code>MEV-boost</code>, the real-time block auction allows any builder to submit bids and encourages competition during each slot. Additionally, the JIT auction and bid-threshold enforcement of <code>MEV-burn</code> reduces the risk of multi-slot MEV by forcing each auction to take place during the slot. Lastly, <code>PTC</code> and other ePBS designs historically were aimed at <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/why-enshrine-proposer-builder-separation-a-viable-path-to-epbs/15710#reasons-to-enshrine-4\">removing relays</a>. With bid thresholds from <code>MEV-burn</code>, the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/relays-in-a-post-epbs-world/16278\">bypassability of the protocol</a> becomes less feasible (even if the best builder bypasses, the second best can go through the protocol and ensure their bid wins).</li>\n<li><span><code>PTC</code> marginally addresses <strong>design goal <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2:</span> limit the value of validator sophistication.</strong></span> By creating an explicit market for MEV-aware blocks, <code>PTC</code> ensures that all validators can access a large portion of the MEV available in their slot. <code>MEV-burn</code> also smooths out the variance in the validator rewards. However, one of the major limitations of this auction design is the “value-in-flight” (h/t Barnabé for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHw7gdJ14uQ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">coining</a> the <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/barnabe.eth/QJ6W0mmyOwjec-2zuH6lZb0iEI2aYFB9gE-LHWIMzjQ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">term</a>) problem of the auction taking place during the slot. Because the value of the sold item changes dramatically throughout a slot, the auctioneer’s role benefits from sophistication. Beyond simple <a href=\"https://dataalways.mirror.xyz/-m0-bp3aZpcqa15_QbMX3MD1v9xg7VCcfGtZBR7I9Bg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">timing games</a>, more exotic strategies around the fork-choice rule (e.g., using extra fork-choice weight to <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/on-attestations-block-propagation-and-timing-games/20272\">further delay block publication</a>, h/t Toni) are possible, and we are just starting to see these play out.</li>\n<li><span> <code>PTC</code> does not address <strong>design goal <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3:</span> Preserve the neutrality of Ethereum block space.</strong></span> Neither <code>PTC</code> nor PBS generally are designed to encourage censorship resistance. The fact that a few builders account for most of Ethereum’s blocks is not surprising, and we should not count on those builders to uphold the credible neutrality of the chain (even if they are right now). While it is true that <code>PTC</code> aims to maintain a decentralized validator set, the fact that the full block is sold counter-acts that effect by still giving discretionary power of the excluded transactions to the builder (e.g., consider the hypothetical where 100% of validators are at-home stakers (maximally decentralized), but they all outsource to the same builder <span class=\"math\">\\implies</span> the builder fully determines the transactions that land onchain).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49714-execution-auctions-an-attester-proposer-separation-instatiation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49714-execution-auctions-an-attester-proposer-separation-instatiation-5\"></a>Execution Auctions (an Attester-Proposer Separation Instatiation)</h3>\n<p>In contrast to the JIT block auction enabled by <code>PTC</code>, this design enshrines an ahead-of-time slot auction into the Ethereum consensus layer.

There is one issue, however, which arises from both auctions selling the same object – the proposing rights for <code>Slot N+32</code>. The resulting bids in the first auction (the slot auction sale of <code>Slot N+32</code> during <code>Slot N</code>) would thus not carry any economic meaning because bidders would be competing for the slot but would then be forced sellers by the time the slot arrived. To resolve this, the second auction (which happens JIT during the slot) could instead be a Top-of-Block auction (e.g., the first 5mm gas consumed in the block). There are many articles exploring the Top-of-Block/Rest-of-Block split (sometimes called block prefix/suffixes) (see, e.g., <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/how-much-can-we-constrain-builders-without-bringing-back-heavy-burdens-to-proposers/13808\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bharath-123/pepc-boost-relay\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/state-lock-auctions-towards-collaborative-block-building/18558\">here</a>), so we won’t go into the details of the consensus changes required to facilitate this exchange. Taking its feasibility for granted, the double-auction design of Mechan-stein makes more sense.<br>\n- <strong>Auction 1 during <code>Slot N</code></strong> sells the block proposing rights for <code>Slot N+32</code> and is conducted by the proposer of <code>Slot N</code>.<br>\n- <strong>Auction 2 during <code>Slot N+32</code></strong> sells the Top-of-Block to a (potentially different) builder who specifies the specific set of transactions to be executed first in the block. This auction is conducted just in time by the builder/winner of Auction 1.</p>\n<p>With this framing, the winner of Auction 1 effectively bought the option to build (or sell) the Rest-of-Block for <code>Slot  N+32</code> – thus the expected value of the bids in that auction would be the average amount of MEV extractable in the block suffix (aside: this might play nicely with <a href=\"https://x.com/barnabemonnot/status/1808444762376020121\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">preconfs</a>).

Without being comprehensive (neither in the list of potential issues nor the responses to said issues), let’s run down a few of the most obvious questions with Mechan-stein and some initial counter-points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Point <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span></strong> – complexity, complexity, complexity.</span> This could (and maybe should) count for multiple points (h/t Mallesh for the relevant <a href=\"https://x.com/malleshpai/status/1748026472923623619\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">tweet</a>). Each of these proposals involves massive changes to the consensus layer of Ethereum with wide-ranging impact (particularly on the fork-choice rule). The devil is truly in the details, and getting something like this spec’ed out and implemented would be an immense research and engineering lift – let’s just say <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">William of Ockham</a> would not be impressed.\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Counter-point <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span></strong> – building the future of finance in a permissionless and hyper-financialized world wasn’t going to be simple (“Rome wasn’t built in a day”).</span> It shouldn’t be shocking that there doesn’t seem to be a silver bullet for building an MEV-aware, decentralized, credibly neutral blockchain. Maybe eating the complexity now can leave the chain in a more stable equilibrium. Also, there may be significant synergies in combining designs (e.g., using the same committee for <code>FOCIL</code> and <code>PTC</code>). You could probably do a subset of Mechan-stein and still get some benefits (e.g., <code>FOCIL</code> + <code>PTC</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span><strong>Point <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span></strong> – how may the ahead-of-time slot auction distort the MEV market?</span> Mostly just reciting <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03116\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Max and Mallesh’s</a> argument (3rd time referencing that paper in this article lol). By removing the real-time nature of the initial auction, you bias it towards a winner-take-all for the best builder (or the “Best Block Space Future Value Estimator™”). I’d say this is similar in spirit to the Phil Daian view of making the competition as deterministic as possible (e.g., <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SBOGdofF4u8?t=620\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">“deterministic vs statistical opportunities”</a>).\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Counter-point <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span></strong> – that is the point of still having the <code>PTC</code> conduct a JIT Top-of-Block auction.</span> I think this feels reasonable. However, there is still a slight edge that the auctioneer (who may be a builder themselves) has in the JIT auction, which is they can benefit from the sophistication and latency investments as they are the auctioneer and a participant. As mentioned above, you could consider skipping the <code>Execution Auctions</code> part of Mechan-stein and just going with <code>FOCIL</code> + <code>PTC</code> (or even leave <code>MEV-boost</code> alone as the primary PBS market and just do <code>FOCIL</code>). (h/t Justin for pointing out that you could try to do <code>Execution Auctions</code> where multiple proposers (more than one auction winner) are selected – another combined mechanism that tries to mitigate the multi-slot MEV risk.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span><strong>Point <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span></strong> – there is still power in being the block producer.</span> As pointed out in this <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870/3\">comment</a> and <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870/4\">its response</a> on the <code>FOCIL</code> post, there is still some discretionary power in being the block builder. Namely, they can choose which ILs they exclude from their aggregate up to some protocol-enforced tolerance. This notion of having an IL “aggregator” is the main difference between <code>FOCIL</code> and a leaderless approach like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJLERWmQ2uw\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Braid</a>.\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Counter-point <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span></strong> – this seems like a fundamental feature.</span> Again, I find myself leaning on Phil’s comment and mental model for “how economic power expresses itself in the protocol.” In a distributed system with network latency and geographic decentralization, some parties will have advantages over others. Suppose the protocol doesn’t explicitly imbue some participants with power during some period (e.g., by electing a leader). In that case, that power will still manifest somewhere else, likely in a more implicit (thus more sophisticated) way. This is more of a meta point, and I am happy to be convinced otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All right, going to cut it here; hope you found it interesting.

To cram that much power into an entity requires a great deal of justification today. To decentralize the flow, on the other hand, one has to accept certain amounts of delay and noise usually found in decentralized compute networks.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-49694-zkvms-recursion-and-risc0s-approach-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49694-zkvms-recursion-and-risc0s-approach-2\"></a>zkVMs, recursion, and Risc0’s approach</h4>\n<p>Any zkVM toolset puts a certain upper bound on the maximum number of cycles(roughly speaking 1 cycle equals 1 operation) it can prove in one go. This is usually done for efficiency reasons. For <a href=\"https://github.com/risc0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Risc0</a>, a RISC-V general zkVM, it is 2^24 ~ 16.78m cycles. With recursion, proving infinitely sized programs are made possible. So the solution is to divide a large program into individual sub-programs(called segment in Risc0 jargon) and have them proved one by one and aggregate the proofs into a final proof as if the whole program was proved in one go. For example, consider proving a 1b cycles program. With 16.78M maximum segment size limit, one ends up proving 60 segments. The upper bound for segment size limit is not the end of story however and one can customize it into a well-known range of [2^13 - 2^24]. Each segment limit size needs specific memory requirements shown on Table 1:<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/7/b790b7f5fb18cec94d0e621383844425862ba9fb.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/b790b7f5fb18cec94d0e621383844425862ba9fb\" title=\"Screenshot from 2024-07-18 14-37-34\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/7/b790b7f5fb18cec94d0e621383844425862ba9fb_2_690x387.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from 2024-07-18 14-37-34\" data-base62-sha1=\"qbTqZ7OMhRtwxJFVg1x6kuxiXub\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/7/b790b7f5fb18cec94d0e621383844425862ba9fb_2_690x387.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/7/b790b7f5fb18cec94d0e621383844425862ba9fb_2_1035x580.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/7/b790b7f5fb18cec94d0e621383844425862ba9fb.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAFAFA\"></a></div><br>\nExtrapolating Table 1’s values, we get 50m cycles for a program that needs 384gb of memory, in order to be proved in Risc0. Recall that Linea’s prover uses 384gb of memory to generate proofs. This is a naive 1-1 translation, but we can treat it as baseline for further testing. So, with this assumption, should one write Linea’s sequencer logic in Risc0, she would end up with a program that is 50m cycles long. Doubling cycles to ~90m, to account for aggregation won’t hurt here.<p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-49694-segmentation-parallel-proving-and-decentralization-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49694-segmentation-parallel-proving-and-decentralization-3\"></a>Segmentation, parallel proving, and decentralization</h4>\n<p>Recursion is a powerful idea in zkVM proving.

In Table 2, two columns are colored in green, 2^18 and 2^19. Consulting Table 1, we would get 2gb and 4gb of required memory to prove them respectively. These columns are sweet spots for any zkVM proving network whose nodes are presumably weak. Focusing on the 2^19 segment size limit, to prove a 90m cycles program, one would need at least 168 nodes in order to prove the program in 4 minutes and 9 seconds. But 168 nodes is a faulty assumption. In reality, if a p2p network is to undertake the proving job, it needs to have redundancy values of 1:4 and above. The redundancy accounts for noise that is a feature of any p2p network. With 1:4 redundant nodes, 1 in every 5 nodes is assumed to be honest and the rest are time wasters. So, a 1:4 redundant p2p network needs at least of 840 nodes to get the job done.<br>\nAssuming that the proving network is p2p, one can expect to obtain decentralized guarantees en route.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49694-conclusion-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49694-conclusion-4\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Here we introduced an imaginary setup to decentralize and improve L2 sequencer proving times. If the claim turns out to be legit, we would expect to improve the overall proving time for any zkVM application area. In addition, the setup provides decentralization guarantees as a side effect. While everything looks nice, we, at <a href=\"https://github.com/WholesumNet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Wholesum network</a> would like to put this setup to test and see if it works in action.

This contract defines the service, and the functions within it specify the methods that can be invoked.</p>\n<p>Each service provider must register and stake on the service contract. For each service, multiple providers will be available to offer the service.</p>\n<p>When a user initiates a service request, such as requesting an AI inference from an LLM model:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The user first utilizes a verifiable Ethereum light client, such as Helios, to retrieve the list of available service providers from the on-chain service contract.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The user randomly selects several providers from this list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The user then sends off-chain transactions to these selected providers in parallel. These off-chain transactions are essentially the same as calling the corresponding service function in the smart contract, but they use a different chain ID. This specific chain ID indicates that the transaction is intended to call a cloud service rather than perform an on-chain transaction on Ethereum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The service providers execute the required computations in their local environments according to the program defined in the corresponding function in the service contract. They then return the responses to the user. Each response is signed by the service provider and includes the user’s transaction hash and the results.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upon receiving the responses from the selected providers, the user first verifies the signatures and checks the consistency of the results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the results are consistent, the service is considered to have functioned correctly, and no further action is required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If there is a discrepancy in the results, this indicates the presence of at least one malicious service provider. In this case, the user submits the providers’ responses to the on-chain arbitration contract. This triggers a process where the service providers must defend the accuracy of their results. The on-chain arbitration process is detailed in the following section.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49659-service-contract-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49659-service-contract-3\"></a>Service Contract</h2>\n<p>The design of the service contract is akin to the design of gRPC. A new service contract corresponds to a new service in gRPC, and the functions defined in the service contract specify the methods that can be invoked. Due to the constraints of smart contracts, we cannot implement complex computations, such as AI computations, directly within the smart contract. Instead, we define a standard for writing a program, which is then uploaded to decentralized DA services, with the program’s hash stored in the on-chain smart contract.</p>\n<p>Following the design principle of “Separate Execution from Proving,” there are two implementations for the service program. One is compiled for native execution, optimized for speed, and can leverage multithreaded CPUs and GPUs to accelerate execution. The other implementation is for proving; the service program is compiled into machine-independent code, allowing us to use zkVM (zero-knowledge virtual machine) or fpVM (fraud-proof virtual machine) to generate proofs. This dual-target approach ensures fast execution, while proving is based on the machine-independent code.</p>\n<p>For example, consider matrix multiplication. Native execution utilizes GPU computation (e.g., CUDA) for acceleration. During the proving phase, the service program is compiled into machine-independent instructions, which can be executed in zkVM or fpVM. Both implementations ensure consistent execution results.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/1/b1ccfdf9e6f994151293a835a4619dca5e974865.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/b1ccfdf9e6f994151293a835a4619dca5e974865\" title=\"output\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/1/b1ccfdf9e6f994151293a835a4619dca5e974865_2_690x151.png\" alt=\"output\" data-base62-sha1=\"pmTHL7pfXZqNQUG3qbGzDdecvfD\" width=\"690\" height=\"151\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/1/b1ccfdf9e6f994151293a835a4619dca5e974865_2_690x151.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/1/b1ccfdf9e6f994151293a835a4619dca5e974865_2_1035x226.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/1/b1ccfdf9e6f994151293a835a4619dca5e974865_2_1380x302.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>When processing user requests, service providers will run the program in the native execution environment and return the results to the users. Only when on-chain arbitration is required will the service providers run the program for proving. This approach allows service providers to handle requests as quickly as possible in most cases.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the service program can be configured to read data from trustworthy sources, such as Ethereum or other blockchains, as well as from decentralized, trustworthy data storage providers. This flexibility allows the service program to function as a blockchain explorer, an AI service, or a decentralized search engine.</p>\n<p>A demo version of the service contract is shown below.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">contract Service {\n\n    // address =&gt; web2 domain\n    mapping(address =&gt; string) serviceProviderHost;\n\n    address[] serviceProviders;\n\n    // function selector =&gt; programHash\n    mapping(bytes4 =&gt; bytes32) programHashs;\n\n    event Request(\n        address account,\n        bytes4 functionSelector,\n        bytes32 programHash,\n        bytes input\n    );\n\n    function func1(bytes calldata input) public {\n        emit Request(msg.sender, this.func1.selector, programHashs[this.func1.selector], input);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that <code>func1</code> specifies the method that can be called. When a user wants to call <code>func1</code>, instead of sending an on-chain transaction on Ethereum, the user needs to send an off-chain transaction directly to the service providers. Besides, the user can obtain the list of service provider addresses, along with their corresponding Web2 domains using Ethereum verifiable light client.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49659-onchain-arbitration-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49659-onchain-arbitration-4\"></a>Onchain Arbitration</h2>\n<p>We support multiple proving systems for on-chain arbitration, including zero-knowledge proofs, Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), and fraud-proof systems. For demonstration purposes, we focus on the fraud-proof system, as it offers lower generation costs compared to zero-knowledge proofs and does not require specific hardware. In previous work, we demonstrated the ability to generate fraud proofs for extremely large AI models. For more details, please refer to opML (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17555\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[2401.17555] opML: Optimistic Machine Learning on Blockchain</a>).</p>\n<p>The on-chain arbitration process using the fraud-proof system proceeds as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If a user receives inconsistent results from the service providers, they submit the providers’ responses to the on-chain arbitration contract, initiating an interactive dispute game with all the involved providers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At this point, the service providers must run the proving-version of the service program in their local fraud-proof VMs to generate the fraud proof, which they then submit to the on-chain arbitration contract to defend their results. For more details on the interactive dispute game, refer to the fraud-proof system design.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Service providers who supplied incorrect results will lose the dispute game, resulting in their staked amount being slashed. The slashed stake will be distributed to the winners of the dispute game, as well as to the user, as compensation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This on-chain arbitration mechanism ensures that only one honest node is required to guarantee the correctness of the provided service. As a result, the protocol relies on a minority trust assumption and inherits security from Ethereum. Assuming at least one honest node and the safety of Ethereum, the protocol can guarantee the correctness of the service.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that on-chain arbitration only occurs when some service providers produce incorrect results. In typical cases, no on-chain interaction is needed, which allows the service to operate as quickly as current centralized cloud service providers.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49659-charging-mechanism-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49659-charging-mechanism-5\"></a>Charging Mechanism</h2>\n<p>There are several possible charging mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Subscription Model:</strong> This is similar to the Web2 approach, where the charging mechanism can be conducted off-chain. For example, to use ChatGPT via an API for commercial purposes, you would pay OpenAI a monthly fee to access their services. Multiple service providers can offer the service, allowing for competition and choice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>On-Chain Payment Mechanism:</strong> Paying for each request on-chain can be costly due to transaction fees. Batching and rolling up these requests and payments can significantly reduce on-chain transaction costs. One possible approach is to use payment channels to pay for requests. Alternatively, service providers could generate service proofs and claim fees as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A service agreement contract specifies the price for each service request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Users first stake funds into the service agreement contract.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Service providers can claim their fees by submitting service proofs to the on-chain service agreement contract. To minimize transaction costs, providers can batch and roll up user requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The on-chain service proof is a zk-proof, which verifies that the service provider has delivered a certain number of responses to users. The provider can then claim the corresponding service fees according to the agreement contract. This proof ensures the correctness of the user’s request transaction signature, the service provider’s response signature, and the transaction nonce.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Free Service Model:</strong> Another approach is for companies to cover the service fees by the themselves (currently, the web2 companies pay the cloud service fee by themselves), offering free services to users while generating revenue through other means, such as advertising or VIP services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49659-advantages-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49659-advantages-6\"></a>Advantages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This decentralized cloud service can be cheaper than centralized cloud services while maintaining similar speed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Decentralized servers can be significantly cheaper than centralized cloud servers. For example, <a href=\"http://io.net\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">io.net</a> has shown that the cost of decentralized GPUs can be as low as one-third of the cost of AWS. For services with lower security requirements, such as using LLMs for personal queries, using just two nodes is often sufficient. Additionally, a random check mechanism can be adopted, querying one node most of the time and occasionally checking another to verify correctness. This setup can be more cost-effective than centralized platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scalability and Speed:</strong> This platform can outperform centralized systems, especially for computationally intensive tasks. A decentralized cloud service platform operates on an N-to-M model (N users with M servers, where the number of servers can be infinite), whereas centralized platforms use an N-to-1 model (N users with a single super server). This allows a decentralized cloud service platform to scale more effectively. For instance, a centralized AI platform like ChatGPT may slow down during peak times because it can’t scale its computing power quickly enough. In contrast, decentralized platform can dynamically distribute the load across many servers, ensuring faster response times even during heavy usage.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trustless and Verifiable:</strong> The protocol operates under a minority trust assumption, requiring only one honest node to guarantee service quality. Additionally, the correctness of the cloud service is verifiable on Ethereum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Censorship-Resilient:</strong> This platform contributes to a more robustly decentralized Web3, enhancing censorship resistance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49659-toward-fully-decentralized-and-verifiable-web3-application-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49659-toward-fully-decentralized-and-verifiable-web3-application-7\"></a>Toward Fully Decentralized and Verifiable Web3 Application</h2>\n<p>With this protocol, we can move toward fully decentralized and verifiable Web3 applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized and Verifiable Blockchain Explorer:</strong> Currently, blockchain explorers like Etherscan are hosted by centralized entities, and the results they present are not verifiable. If such an explorer were hacked, it could display malicious and misleading information, such as fake transactions or contracts, potentially leading to phishing scams. By migrating the entire blockchain explorer—including both the frontend and backend services—to our platform, we can ensure full verifiability and robust security for the blockchain explorer.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized, Verifiable, Faster, and Cheaper AI Platform:</strong> This protocol enables the creation of a fully decentralized, verifiable, and cost-effective AI platform. By moving the entire stack, including both frontend and backend services as well as AI computation, to a decentralized cloud, we can build an AI platform that is not only more affordable but also potentially faster than centralized alternatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized Cloud Gaming:</strong> Some games require high-end hardware, such as powerful GPUs and CPUs, leading game companies to move their games to cloud services, reducing the hardware requirements for customers. We can similarly bring Web3 games to our platform. Since our platform is verifiable on Ethereum, game reward settlements can be easily managed through smart contracts.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49659-further-discussion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49659-further-discussion-8\"></a>Further Discussion</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49659-updating-the-state-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49659-updating-the-state-9\"></a>Updating the State</h3>\n<p>In the previous discussion, the service program operates under a stateless design, meaning it does not modify its internal state. However, the data source used by the service program is upgradable. For instance, if a service program uses Ethereum as its data source, users can interact with smart contracts on Ethereum to update the state. The service program can then utilize the latest Ethereum state as its data source, enabling the implementation of a decentralized explorer.</p>\n<p>If updating the internal state of the service program is required, a state machine replication network must be established among the service providers. In this case, each service program would correspond to a layer 2 or layer 3 blockchain on Ethereum. When users invoke a method that updates the internal state, they would send the transaction to the corresponding layer 2 or layer 3 blockchain. The service providers would then reach a consensus on the execution results of that transaction and update the internal state accordingly. Periodically, the layer 2 blockchain would roll up the transactions and its latest state back to Ethereum.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49659-verifiable-fhe-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49659-verifiable-fhe-10\"></a>Verifiable FHE</h3>\n<p>To ensure user privacy, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) can be integrated into our protocol. In this case, the FHE computation would be incorporated into the service program. Instead of sending plaintext data to the service providers, users would encrypt their input and send only the ciphertext, thereby preserving their privacy. Additionally, if on-chain arbitration is triggered, the FHE service program would be compiled into machine-independent instructions, and a fraud proof or zk-proof would be generated to make the FHE computation fully verifiable.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49659-related-work-and-comparison-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49659-related-work-and-comparison-11\"></a>Related Work and Comparison</h2>\n<p><strong>Comparison with Web3URL</strong></p>\n<p>Web3URL (<a href=\"https://w3url.w3eth.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://w3url.w3eth.io/</a>) is an interesting project that transforms Ethereum into an unstoppable decentralized web server. Our protocol can be seen as a significant extension of Web3URL. In Web3URL, service functions must be written within smart contracts, which naturally limits large-scale applications. In contrast, our protocol supports complex service programs, such as AI computations, and provides flexible access to large-scale data, making decentralized ChatGPT and decentralized explorers a reality.</p>\n<p><strong>Comparison with ICP</strong></p>\n<p>The Internet Computer (ICP: <a href=\"https://internetcomputer.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://internetcomputer.org/</a>) hosts decentralized serverless compute, similar to our goal of creating a decentralized cloud service platform. However, we differ from ICP in several key aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Integration:</strong> We are building on Ethereum, allowing us to inherit its security features.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Higher Security:</strong> We achieve a higher level of security compared to ICP. While ICP operates in a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) network under a majority trust assumption—requiring that most nodes in the subnet are honest—we adopt an approach similar to rollups, with on-chain arbitration ultimately reverting to Ethereum. This allows us to guarantee correctness under a minority trust assumption, where just one honest node can ensure the integrity of our protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complex Computation:</strong> Following the design principle of “Separate Execution from Proving,” we can handle complex computations natively, such as LLM inference or even fine-tuning. In contrast, service programs in ICP always run within canisters, which significantly limits their applicability for large-scale computations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are interested in this project or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to reach out to me.</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/decentralized-and-verifiable-cloud-service-on-ethereum/20292\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/decentralized-and-verifiable-cloud-service-on-ethereum/20292","pubDate":"Sat, 17 Aug 2024 11:48:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-20292"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/decentralized-and-verifiable-cloud-service-on-ethereum/20292.rss","#text":"Decentralized and Verifiable Cloud Service on Ethereum"}},{"title":"Censorship Insurance Markets for BRAID","dc:creator":"jonahb27","category":"Block proposer","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/f/bf7665c93b36acdfa0cb7c8ed757aa3ef87f101f.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/bf7665c93b36acdfa0cb7c8ed757aa3ef87f101f\" title=\"BRAID\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/f/bf7665c93b36acdfa0cb7c8ed757aa3ef87f101f.jpeg\" alt=\"BRAID\" data-base62-sha1=\"rjKRtDgYAP4vmSSayhZ1b1A8Fm7\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-dominant-color=\"495C57\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>By: <a href=\"https://x.com/_jonahb_\">Jonah Burian</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/BenLevy0\">Ben Levy</a></p>\n<p><em>Tl;dr: We point out that BRAID’s liquidity requirements lead to poor user UX and suggest censorship insurance markets as a potential solution.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://x.com/maxresnick1\">Max Resnick</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/davidecrapis\">Davide Crapis</a> for the feedback.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49651-intro-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49651-intro-1\"></a>Intro</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The greatness of <s>America</s> <em>Ethereum</em> lies not in being more enlightened than any other <s>nation</s> <em>blockchain</em>, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.” <em>- Alexis de Tocqueville</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Censorship resistance (CR) is one of the core security properties of a blockchain.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/c/7/c7e58a93fe9b45a91ecf29a6aefa91567c310262.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/c7e58a93fe9b45a91ecf29a6aefa91567c310262\" title=\"CR\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/7/c7e58a93fe9b45a91ecf29a6aefa91567c310262_2_690x180.png\" alt=\"CR\" data-base62-sha1=\"swmO0GJ1QBKqG3t56pVSs0ZWPDA\" width=\"690\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/7/c7e58a93fe9b45a91ecf29a6aefa91567c310262_2_690x180.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/7/c7e58a93fe9b45a91ecf29a6aefa91567c310262_2_1035x270.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/c/7/c7e58a93fe9b45a91ecf29a6aefa91567c310262.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"151515\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Ethereum gifts proposers with one-slot monopolies on transaction inclusion, creating a principal-agent problem and a single point of failure.

If only a single proposer includes a transaction, they receive <span class=\"math\">T</span>; if multiple proposers include the transaction, they split <span class=\"math\">t</span>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49651-tipping-properties-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49651-tipping-properties-4\"></a>Tipping Properties</h3>\n<p>Let <span class=\"math\">ϕ(t,T)</span> be the minimum cost to censor a BRAID transaction. It has been <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13321\">shown</a> that <span class=\"math\">ϕ(t,T)=kT</span>.</p>\n<p>The goal of BRAID is that users will most likely never actually have to pay <span class=\"math\">T</span>; instead, they pay <span class=\"math\">t</span>, which can be much lower than <span class=\"math\">T</span>.</p>\n<p>This multi-dimensional tip disentangles the cost of inclusion (for the transacting party) from the cost of censoring such that <span class=\"math\">t&lt;&lt;T</span>.</p>\n<p>Simply put, a user get’s <span class=\"math\">kT</span> worth of CR while (usually) only paying <span class=\"math\">t</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Will Tip:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"math\">T</span>: From a user’s perspective, they set <span class=\"math\">T=\\frac{V}{k}</span> where <span class=\"math\">V</span> is the value the user places in their transaction not being censored.</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">t</span>: In current BRAID specs, the ordering of transactions depends on <span class=\"math\">t</span>, with more favorable ordering (i.e., coming first) given to those with the highest <span class=\"math\">t</span>. Therefore, a user will choose their <span class=\"math\">t</span> based on where they want to be in the ordering.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note that if a user does not care about CR, they can set <span class=\"math\">T=t</span> and send their transaction to just one proposer.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49651-the-ux-challenge-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49651-the-ux-challenge-5\"></a>The UX Challenge:</h2>\n<p>While a user will only pay <span class=\"math\">t</span> for their transaction, they need to have <span class=\"math\">T</span> available to make a credible promise to the protocol that they can pay <span class=\"math\">T</span>. Hence a user needs to have <span class=\"math\">T</span> of additional available liquidity to make a transaction. We saw before that <span class=\"math\">T \\propto V</span>: <span class=\"math\">T</span> tends to scale with the value of the transaction. This burdens users with a liquidity requirement.</p>\n<p>For example, say a user wants to sell $5M of ETH due to impending interest rate fears and values censorship resistance at $1M. Let’s say there are 4 shards, i.e., <span class=\"math\">k=4</span>. The user needs to have $250k of additional unpledged liquidity available just to exit their position. This hampers the UX of on-chain finance by placing additional and obscure liquidity requirements on participants that scale with the value of their positions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49651-fixes-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49651-fixes-6\"></a>Fixes:</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49651-proof-of-post-state-liquidity-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49651-proof-of-post-state-liquidity-7\"></a><strong>Proof of Post-State Liquidity</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> A user submits a transaction with a proof that they will have enough liquidity to pay <span class=\"math\">T</span> if necessary after their transaction. In the case before, the proof will show that the transaction will give the user $1M of liquidity so they could afford the <span class=\"math\">T=</span> $250k if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> This assumes that a proposer has a good understanding of the post-state of a transaction. Most financial transactions interact with shared state, and as a result, transaction ordering is needed to know the post-state. This knowledge relies on the final ordering so we can’t include it as an input to the transaction. Even when there is a reasonable lower bound on post-state available liquidity, establishing it would (unrealistically) require bespoke proofs for each transaction type.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49651-censorship-insurance-ci-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49651-censorship-insurance-ci-8\"></a>Censorship Insurance (CI)</h3>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> A third party–the CI provider–can sponsor the escrow of <span class=\"math\">T</span> for the transaction. Users will have to pay an insurance premium of <span class=\"math\">rT</span> to the CI provider, where <span class=\"math\">r</span> represents the rate (mostly) based on the likelihood of censorship. CI providers are thus assessing the rewards of censoring the transaction in real time to ensure it is below <span class=\"math\">kT</span>.</p>\n<p>To prevent an attack where a user purchases insurance and then only sends their tx to one proposer whom they are colluding with, the CI should be (one of) the relayer(s) for the tx. This mirrors how gas sponsorship works and indeed CI insurance should likely just be included in a gas sponsorship service.</p>\n<p>Effectively a user pays a total of <span class=\"math\">t + rT</span> for their transaction and only needs to have <span class=\"math\">t + rT</span> on hand as opposed to <span class=\"math\">T</span>, which is frequently more than <span class=\"math\">t + rT</span>.</p>\n<p>An additional benefit of this scheme is that a marketplace of at least two CI providers will conveniently alert users when their <span class=\"math\">T</span> is too low and there is a high risk of censorship because they’ll refuse to censorship-insure the transaction at a reasonable rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> It will be difficult to bootstrap a two-sided marketplace for this from scratch.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49651-ci-market-structure-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49651-ci-market-structure-9\"></a>CI Market Structure</h3>\n<p>In practice applications or wallets will likely claim jurisdiction over this issue. One possible solution to the bootstrapping problem, therefore, is for applications and/or wallets to sign wholesale agreements with CI providers à la PFOF.</p>\n<p>While the above solution likely works fine, another option is to create a proper on-chain market with e.g. an RFQ for each transaction whose sender wishes to purchase censorship resistance for.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/0/4/049237e341dc88cd24cde968c71e70ce689c3444.png\" alt=\"snake\" data-base62-sha1=\"ErbepHjP783sZdbfKfWocF9KUQ\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></p>\n<p>This market, fittingly, would benefit from the CR properties of BRAID.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49651-conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49651-conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>BRAID is still in its early days as a proposal. The UX issue of liquidity requirements has not been sufficiently explored, though there are promising signs that we can reasonably punt the issue to the application layer. For next steps, we suggest further exploration of the feasibility of CI markets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49651-previous-work-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49651-previous-work-11\"></a>Previous work:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13321\">Censorship Resistance in On-Chain Auctions</a>: Elijah, Max, Mallesh</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/concurrent-block-proposers-in-ethereum/18777\">Concurrent Block Proposers in Ethereum</a>: Mike, Max</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.duality.xyz/introducing-multiplicity/\">Introducing Multiplicity</a>: Duality blog</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://efdn.notion.site/ROP-9-Multiplicity-gadgets-for-censorship-resistance-7def9d354f8a4ed5a0722f4eb04ca73b\">ROP-9: Multiplicity gadgets for censorship-resistance</a> RIG</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJLERWmQ2uw\">BRAID: Implementing Multiple Concurrent Block Proposers</a>: Max</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870/1\">Fork-Choice enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL): A simple committee-based inclusion list proposal</a>: Thomas, Barnabé, Francesco and Julian</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/censorship-insurance-markets-for-braid/20288\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/censorship-insurance-markets-for-braid/20288","pubDate":"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 15:36:38 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-20288"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/censorship-insurance-markets-for-braid/20288.rss","#text":"Censorship Insurance Markets for BRAID"}},{"title":"Ethereum discv5 DHT Network Health Weekly Reports","dc:creator":"yiannisbot","category":"Networking","description":"<blockquote>\n<p><em>Work presented here has been carried out by the <a href=\"https://probelab.network\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ProbeLab</a> team and in particular <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/guillaumemichel\">@guillaumemichel</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/cortze\">@cortze</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/dennis-tra\">@dennis-tra</a> and Steph.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49640-high-level-description-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49640-high-level-description-1\"></a>High Level Description</h2>\n<p>The ProbeLab team has developed and deployed infrastructure to monitor several critical metrics for Ethereum’s CL discv5 DHT network.

A somewhat strange question to ask might be “why don’t keys represent people?” I will argue this is actually an important question and the crux of major privacy and onboarding challenges. We present a a threshold network design dubbed Mishti Network to derive keys from people rather than arbitrary randomness. This network solves a number of problems in ZK identity, compliance, and onboarding.</p>\n<p>What does it mean for a key to be a representation of a person? There are two conditions that should be met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A person’s knowledge and/or attributes can always map to the private key</li>\n<li>This person is the sole controller of the key</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, it is a collision-resistant map of personal data and attributes to a high-entropy pseudorandom number. Without collision resistance, multiple people could have the same key. Without high entropy, the key is not secure. Keys can be both standard private keys or also a nullifier that’s useful for secure ZK credentials.</p>\n<p>Human keys are not solely biometrics. They could be from human-friendly data such as security questions, passwords, or any unique knowledge belonging to an individual rather than arbitrary randomness.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49627-solution-oblivious-pseudorandom-function-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49627-solution-oblivious-pseudorandom-function-2\"></a>Solution: Oblivious Pseudorandom Function</h1>\n<p>This solution is based on a threshold verifiable oblivious pseudorandom function (tVOPRF) on private data. An oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF) takes a private input and computes a pseudorandom function (PRF). PRFs take low-entropy input and create high-entropy output. Adding verifiability via a ZKP makes it into a VOPRF. Verifying individual node contributions is important to decentralizing the network.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49627-why-it-is-helpful-to-ethereum-pki-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49627-why-it-is-helpful-to-ethereum-pki-3\"></a>Why it is helpful to Ethereum + PKI</h1>\n<p>Some of the outstanding issues in Ethereum are onboarding and privacy. Onboarding requires not just simplicity but also self-custody, and recovery. Current onboarding solutions such as social logins and passkeys do not have self-custody (as they can be recovered by web2 accounts), while self-custodial solutions can’t have recovery without extra onboarding step like electing gaurdians.</p>\n<p>A similar need is for ZK identity applications that need to derive nullifiers from their users’ identities, in a way nobody can trace back to the user. This is a common need in proof-of-personhood solutions to ensure that each person only has one corresponding nullifier without a central database or key that links users to their nullifiers.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the underlying cryptography and network can be repurposed to tackle another pressing challenge: that of satisfying compliance rules with ZK identity. The same underlying elliptic curve multiplication primitive that underlies this design can be used to construct threshold ElGamal decryption over ZK-friendly curves, which can allow ZK proofs to contain encrypted data with flexible access control.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49627-oblivious-pseudorandom-function-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49627-oblivious-pseudorandom-function-4\"></a>Oblivious Pseudorandom Function</h1>\n<p>To generate keys from identities, an oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF) can be constructed with distributed EC scalar multiplication. This allows private user data such as security questions, biometrics, passwords, or social security numbers, etc. to deterministically generate secret keys. The resulting pseudorandom value is computationally impractical to reverse despite it being from low-entropy input. One can thereby create wallet or nullifier from any (or a combination) of these low-entropy “human” factors. In the 2HashDH OPRF [1], a server or network’s secret is used to give randomness to the client’s input. The oblivious property prevents any server or set of nodes from seeing see this input.</p>\n<p>2HashDH is the following algorithm between a user with a private input <span class=\"math\">x</span> and a server (or network) with a private key <span class=\"math\">s</span>. For a subgroup <span class=\"math\">G</span> of an elliptic curve there are two hash functions:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">hashToCurve: \\{0,1\\}^* \\rightarrow G</span><br>\n<span class=\"math\">hashToScalar: G \\rightarrow F_q</span>.</p>\n<p>The 2HashDH OPRF proceeds as follows</p>\n<ol>\n<li>User samples a random mask <span class=\"math\">r</span> and sends <span class=\"math\">M = r * hashToCurve(x)</span></li>\n<li>Server multiplies by its secret, returning <span class=\"math\">s * M</span></li>\n<li>User computes the output by unmasking the server’s response and hashing it: <span class=\"math\">o = HashToScalar(r^{-1} * s * M)</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"math\">o</span> is uniformly pseudorandom in <span class=\"math\">F_q</span>, and the server is information-theoretically blinded from the user’s input.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-49627-decentralizing-the-server-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49627-decentralizing-the-server-5\"></a>Decentralizing the server</h2>\n<p>To decentralize the OPRF server, only the step with a server must be decentralized:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Server multiplies by its secret, returning <span class=\"math\">s * M</span></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For threshold elliptic curve multiplication, first a linear secret sharing, such as Shamir’s scheme, must be used. The secret key is generated through distributed key generation (DKG) such that each node with index <span class=\"math\">i</span> receives share <span class=\"math\">f(i)</span> for some secret polynomial <span class=\"math\">f</span> known to nobody. There is no node at the <span class=\"math\">0</span> index and <span class=\"math\">f(0)</span> is the secret key of the network. The secret key <span class=\"math\">f(0)</span> can be computed by a set <span class=\"math\">Q</span> of <span class=\"math\">t</span> nodes where <span class=\"math\">t</span> is one more than the degree of <span class=\"math\">f</span>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">f(0) = \\sum_{i \\in Q}{L_{0, Q}(i)*f(i)}</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">L_{0,Q}(i)</span> is the Lagrange basis for index <span class=\"math\">i</span> in set <span class=\"math\">Q</span> evaluated at zero.</p>\n<p>Instead of reconstructing <span class=\"math\">f(0)</span>, the nodes can collaborate to construct <span class=\"math\">f(0) * M</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">f(0) * M = \\sum_{i \\in Q}{L_{0, Q}(i)*f(i) * M}</span></p>\n<p>This is sufficient for step</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Server multiplies by its secret, returning <span class=\"math\">s * M</span></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>if the nodes are honest. But if one lies, the result will be wrong and there will be no way of knowing who lied. Thus, each node should prove their individual multiplication using a lightweight zero-knowledge DLEQ proof.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49627-other-interesting-use-case-provable-encryption-with-programmable-privacy-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49627-other-interesting-use-case-provable-encryption-with-programmable-privacy-6\"></a>Other interesting use case: Provable encryption with programmable privacy</h1>\n<p>The same decentralized EC scalar primitive can be used not just for VOPRF but also for ElGamal decryption over ZK-friendly curves. This is helpful when identities must be revealed in certain conditions.</p>\n<p>For example, many private DeFi protocols are interested in ensuring that bad actors do not get the benefits of anonymity, while the average user typically does. Governments are not satisfied with solely ZK because they need access to user data, but currently the only alternative is honeypots where all user data is stored to be turned over to authorities if needed.</p>\n<p>Another use of revealing provably encrypted identities under certain conditions is undercollateralized lending – what if you want an identity or private key to be revealed if a DeFi loan is defaulted on? In this case, you need to prove the proper data is encrypted correctly, then have a smart contract control decryption rights.</p>\n<p>To modify this threshold EC point multiplication to such use cases, little is needed.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49627-encryption-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49627-encryption-7\"></a>Encryption</h3>\n<p>ElGamal encryption is client-side:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an ephemeral keypair <span class=\"math\">(a, A = aG)</span></li>\n<li>Encode the message as an EC point <span class=\"math\">P</span></li>\n<li>Compute Diffie-Hellman shared secret with network public key: <span class=\"math\">aB</span></li>\n<li>Compute the ciphertext <span class=\"math\">(A, aB+P)</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-49627-decryption-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49627-decryption-8\"></a>Decryption</h3>\n<p>Unlike encryption, decryption requires a server or decentralized network.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Server/network multiply ephemeral public key <span class=\"math\">A</span> by its secret key <span class=\"math\">b</span> to get <span class=\"math\">bA</span> = <span class=\"math\">aB</span></li>\n<li>Decryptor subtracts this value from <span class=\"math\">aB+P</span> to get <span class=\"math\">P</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The server/network’s step can be handled by the same threshold multiplication protocol as before!</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49627-network-setup-and-collusion-protection-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49627-network-setup-and-collusion-protection-9\"></a>Network Setup and Collusion Protection</h1>\n<p>The team at Holonym has implemented this as as an AVS on Eigenlayer called Mishti Network. High reputation is common among Eigenlayer operators despite the permissionless nature, so it is ideal for threshold networks where collusion is a concern. To further mitigate collusion risk, there is the idea of parallel networks:</p>\n<p>The asynchronous and homomorphic nature of the computations means users can permissionlessly add nodes outside of Mishti Network that they trust to not collude with Mishti Network. E.g. instead of splitting a secret between Mishti Network, half of the secret is between the Mishti Network and the other half in a semi-trusted node elected by the user. Since the whole network just does an EC multiplication, exactly what its individual does do, nodes and networks can be treated the same. A 2/2 scheme could be done between a semi-trusted node and Mishti network, simply by</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding their public keys to get the joint public key</li>\n<li>Adding their responses to get a joint response to the computation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note this requires no consent from the network and is not limited to 2/2 schemes; it can be done with any combination of semi-trusted nodes and/or independent networks via threshold schemes.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-49627-references-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#p-49627-references-10\"></a>References</h1>\n<p>[1] S.
