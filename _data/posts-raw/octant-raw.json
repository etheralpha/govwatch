Lotteries are one of them, but the way they work right now make them easily manipulable, corruptible or inefficient when allocating resources. We are blending lotteries with Ethereum values to make them a great source of fairly and transparently distributed funding for public goods.</p>\n<p>To make lotteries fair, we’re researching and implementing onchain randomness technology. For our current version, we’re using new drand scheme that uses BLS on BN254 instead of BLS12-381 to make <a href=\"https://drand.love\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">drand</a> available <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@kevincharm/rJA4r_Iia\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">on any EVM</a> - a contribution done by our contributors. For the picking of winning numbers, we borrow some lesser-known algorithms from the latest in cryptography (e.g., stateless shuffles, grand product check) to achieve gas-efficient lotteries for both users and operators. More specifically, we’re using the Feistel Shuffle for this purpose.

These methods can (and will) be used at deeper levels of the tech stack (even the Ethereum Base Layer, read about Verfiable Delay Functions). We also believe that there’s a centralisation risk in relying on sponsors to fund public goods. They can indirectly define what are public goods and decide which ones are being funded. The variety in mechanisms we have to fund public goods, the better.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-950-team-information-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-950-team-information-9\"></a><strong>Team Information</strong></h3>\n<p>Our well-established team has been working together on different projects ranging from hackathons, to open-source contributions, products and client work for almost 3 years.

Once we fix it, he can work more independently again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Mid-term Outcomes (3-6+ months):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>[Describe the anticipated outcomes from the project, such as increased user engagement, adoption rates, or community growth.]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The onchain ads UI will validate whether there is actual demand for onchain ads and if it makes sense to spend more time on this.</p>\n<p>Generaly speaking, reaching more sustainable revenue model would let us focus more on product and community activation. That would lead to better user engagement, which - in our case - leads to more signal and better content and commments shared on our platform.</p>\n<p>That in turn leads to more growth, since for Kiwi, our content and the community is what makes people pay for the app.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Impact (5+ years):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>[Describe the long-term vision for your project, including how it will create lasting changes and benefits for the community or ecosystem.]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Kiwi reaches more adoption, it will serve as a forum for nuanced conversations about Ethereum. We believe that - just like Hacker News keeps web2 community in check - Kiwi could do the same for Ethereum.</p>\n<p>That would lead to less builders following hype, more scrutinity for bad actors and making it harder to run scams.</p>\n<p>Even if some users wouldn’t read Kiwi everyday, we can serve as a tool for double-checking current hypes, since users’ comments and different type of content shared on Kiwi can help to get out of the social bubbles.</p>\n<p>Plus Kiwi could keep serving as a repository of quality links and conversations. Since Google isn’t a good search engine for crypto, we could build one based on Kiwi’s content.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes Measurement:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>[Explain how you will measure the outcomes and impact of your project, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Include specific metrics or indicators you will use, such as user engagement, adoption rates, community impact, and user satisfaction. Also share the tools you’ll be using for this purpose.]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main goal for now is getting to financial sustainability for us two co-founders as this will guarantee us to run the project over the long term. So all outcome measures are ultimately just lagging indicators to increase our income to a point where it becomes sustainable.</p>\n<p>Yet, our main mission is improving the Ethereum community by delivering high-quality crypto content &amp; conversations to builders.</p>\n<p>Therefore, most of our metrics are based on that goal.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Number of users clicking the links per day</strong></p>\n<p>If many people click our crypto building-related links, it means that we surface content they think is valuable.</p>\n<p>We track link clicks by adding a “<a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/outbound?url=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://news.kiwistand.com/outbound?url=</a>” param to each outbound link, and then publish the results on our stats page in <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/users\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Daily Active Devices section</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Number of users submitting, upvoting, and commenting on links</strong></p>\n<p>Every action on the protocol level takes and EIP712 signature, which means that we can easily track each submission, comment and upvote from our users.</p>\n<p>We publish the results on our <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/users\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">User stats page</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Number of links stored on the protocol</strong></p>\n<p>If the links and comments are high-quality and follow our <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/guidelines\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">guidelines</a>, the more content, the better. Therefore we track this number on a <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/basics\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cumulative Total Messages chart</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Number of people who paid to use the product</strong></p>\n<p>At this point people can use Kiwi for free by following our bots, RSS feeds or the alt client. But for us the best signal is when people decide to pay a few $ to use Kiwi.</p>\n<p>Therefore we track this number by following our <a href=\"https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x66747bdc903d17c586fa09ee5d6b54cc85bbea45\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kiwi Pass NFT contract</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Adoption rate</strong></p>\n<p>We track how many users who minted a Kiwi Pass are active.

We make around $500/month from Kiwi Pass Sales, and made $1,800 from organizing two writing contests. We are in talks with 5 different projects to organize more contests.</p>\n<p>To become sustainable, we need to increase our revenue by a lot. We are very lean and - apart from running servers - we just have to pay ourselves some basic salary.</p>\n<p>The basic salary has to cover expenses such as rent, food, and so on, which is around $5,000/month before taxes. Half of it goes to tax, social insurances, etc.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we need around $10,000/month to be able to keep on working full-time on Kiwi without having to take some extra gigs.</p>\n<p>We are exploring different models.</p>\n<p>We don’t want to take VC funding because we believe that projects such as Kiwi should stay credibly neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>So we are exploring ideas such as:</strong><br>\na) ads,<br>\nb) subscription model,<br>\nc) user donations,<br>\nd) job board,</p>\n<p>and a few others.</p>\n<p>We’re super serious about financial sustainability and talk about it a lot on our semi-public Telegram channel for Kiwi Pass holders.

Kiwi, contrarily to X or HN, will always remain vibrant and open to innovation because this is how it was architected. The operators of HN and X will always remain powerful because they monopolize the software that their community uses to communicate. We think this is unaceptable and so we want to demonstrate with Kiwi that an alternative model is possible.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-949-supporting-decentralization-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-949-supporting-decentralization-7\"></a><strong>Supporting Decentralization</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re supporting decentralization in a few ways:</p>\n<p><strong>P2P Protocol</strong>. All our content, including upvotes, comments, and submissions, is stored on a decentralized network rather than centralized servers. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rys5UEi2SWg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Learn more about our p2p network protocol</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Community-first approach.</strong> Since the beginning, we share a percentage of our revenue with our contributors, reinforcing the idea that the community collectively benefits from Kiwi. We’re also sharing our revenue with the top posting accounts. It’s contrary to the traditional web2 social model where users post content so that the platform can sell more ads.</p>\n<p><strong>Open-source</strong>. Kiwi’s entire codebase, including the front-end, back-end, and protocol, is open-source. This allows anyone in the community to fork the project, contribute to its development, or create their own versions of Kiwi. So even if we are not around, people can keep developing the project.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-949-team-information-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-949-team-information-8\"></a><strong>Team Information</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Tim Daubenschutz</strong><br>\n<em>(Tech &amp; Product)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worked on the precursor of NFTs @ <a href=\"https://github.com/ascribe/onion\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ascribe.io</a> in 2015,</li>\n<li>Co-created Soulbound tokens.

We emerged from conversations in the EthFinance and EthStaker communities, and aim to provide credibly neutral infrastructure for the Ethereum staking ecosystem. The relay has been in continuous operation for nearly 2 years and serves over 850,000 validators, including many solo stakers, Rocketpool users, and large professional staking operations. Between 1-5% of all Ethereum mainnet blocks pass through Aestus.</p>\n<p>MEV remains a valuable part of revenue for Ethereum PoS consensus participants, but it is critical to the long-term health of the network that we minimize centralization pressures and ensure MEV profits are equitably distributed amongst all validators. Aestus operates as a public good, free from commercial interests and adhering to principles of credible neutrality.</p>\n<p>Aestus was originally imagined to be a short-term enterprise destined only to fill a short-term gap between the Merge and the development of enshrined proposer-builder separation (“ePBS”). This pathway to an in-protocol solution has been significantly more challenging than initially anticipated and remains somewhat elusive. Aestus intends to remain in operation until we outlive our purpose.</p>\n<p>Recently, there has been considerable interest and extensive research towards improving Ethereum UI/UX by supporting cross-chain (L2) atomic synchronicity, including instantaneous inclusion and execution guarantees (preconfs), and using L1 validators to secure L2s. This “based” ecosystem entails significant new responsibilities for relays and new ecosystem actors.

Our flagship products include our production-capable beacon chain and validator client. Additionally, we maintain public repositories of useful tools for public use, such as BLS, SSZ, Discv5, Gossipsub, and Noise. Our work contributes to the backbone infrastructure required to keep the Ethereum blockchain progressing within the rules as defined by the specification. Lodestar’s niche is its implementation language, TypeScript. Our software and tooling are uniquely situated for researchers and developers for rapid prototyping, including our Prover, a verified web3 provider using light clients to increase decentralization and security of the JSON-RPC. Millions of developers around the world are familiar with TypeScript, and Lodestar’s high-quality codebases serve as excellent introductions to the Ethereum world, with the goal of increasing client diversity and attracting new talent. Our project does not generate any revenue and relies on funding from open-source donations and foundations to continue developing in the core Ethereum ecosystem.

As we continue to evolve, it’s important for us to align Octant’s processes and mechanisms with our values and mission. We’ve recently taken a closer look at how we can improve the way we measure and present the success of the projects we support, and we want to share our intentions and upcoming changes with you.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-understanding-octants-impact-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-understanding-octants-impact-2\"></a>Understanding Octant’s Impact</h3>\n<p>One of our core goals is to ensure that Octant is not just a platform for funding public goods but also a space where the impact of these projects is clearly visible and easily understood. We want to make sure that the projects you choose to support when you donate your Octant rewards are making a tangible difference, and that this difference is communicated effectively. To do this, we’ve focused on two key areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clearer Reporting Requirements</strong>: Based on feedback conducted in a recent survey, we’re refining how projects report their progress and outcomes. This will help us, and participating projects, track the effectiveness and impact of their work more accurately.</li>\n<li><strong>Better User Support</strong>: We want to provide you with the tools and information you need to make informed decisions. By improving what’s displayed in the Octant app, we’re aiming to make your experience smoother and more transparent.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-changes-to-reporting-requirements-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-changes-to-reporting-requirements-3\"></a>Changes to Reporting Requirements</h3>\n<p>From our recent survey, we’ve gathered valuable insights into what you care most about when it comes to the projects on Octant. Here’s what we learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Highest Importance</strong>: Potential Impact and Previous Impact of projects are what you value the most. These metrics are critical in helping you decide where to allocate your support, so we’ll be making sure these are prominently displayed when you first look at projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium Importance</strong>: Details like the team’s background, how funds are being used, and development activity are also important. These will be available on each project’s page within Octant, giving you the context you need without overwhelming the initial decision-making process.</li>\n<li><strong>Lower Importance</strong>: Metrics like sustainability plans, community support, governance structures, and user testimonials were ranked lower. These will still be available but might be housed in more specialized sections, or through tools like KarmaGap for those who want to dive deeper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based upon these results, we will be looking to implement many of these these features into the Octant app over the coming epochs.</p>\n<p>We have already implemented some changes for projects that have received funding previously.  Please scroll down through this page and be sure to check the template that corresponds to your project here: <a href=\"https://docs.octant.app/reporting-templates.html#project-proposal-template\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Octant Docs</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-why-these-changes-matter-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-why-these-changes-matter-4\"></a>Why These Changes Matter</h3>\n<p>By focusing on what’s most important, we can ensure that the projects funded through Octant are impactful and aligned with the values of our community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For Recently Funded Projects</strong>: Reporting requirements will start light, focusing on early outputs. As projects progress, their reporting will shift to include more detailed outcomes and impact assessments.</li>\n<li><strong>For Long-Running Projects</strong>: Those that have received funding before the most recent round,  they will have stricter reporting requirements, focusing on not just outputs, but the outcomes of those outputs. This ensures that projects are not only delivering on their promises but are also growing and evolving in ways that benefit the broader community.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-your-opinion-matters-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-your-opinion-matters-5\"></a>Your Opinion Matters</h3>\n<p>We’re committed to making Octant a platform where your voice matters. We’re listening closely in how you think we can improve Octant.  Through surveys, direct 1 on 1’s, and consistent discussion on our governance board, we’re very confident that Octant has a bright future because of your feedback. These changes are just the beginning, and we’re really excited to continue building with you!</p>\n<p>Thank you for being an integral part of this journey.</p>\n<p>Warm regards,</p>\n<p>The Octant Team</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/improving-our-processes-for-octant-recipients/409\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/improving-our-processes-for-octant-recipients/409","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 22:50:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-409"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/improving-our-processes-for-octant-recipients/409.rss","#text":"Improving Our Processes For Octant Recipients"}},{"title":"Mechanism Institute: Democratizing Cryptoeconomics","dc:creator":"sofiacos","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/original/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/utLfUYdkuqNuev7wxEdTeoXib3w.png?dl=1\" title=\"hero 2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_690x175.png\" alt=\"hero 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"utLfUYdkuqNuev7wxEdTeoXib3w\" width=\"690\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_690x175.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_1035x262.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_1380x350.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"999894\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-847-project-description-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-847-project-description-1\"></a><strong>Project Description</strong></h2>\n<p>Mechanism Institute is a research initiative that shapes building blocks for digital-age institutions.

In due time, if a governance structure can be battle tested and the team is confident, we see the community taking more and more ownership over key aspects of Octant, maybe everything in total minus ownership of staking… But 1 step at a time <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>So we started out with that intention, to design a governance framework that would empower our community to initially govern the recent Community Fund.  What began as a simple experiment to give more power to our community has lead to a lot of learnings for the Octant core team in how we can improve the next version of this moving forward.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"chronology-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#chronology-2\"></a>Chronology</h3>\n<p>This first started with bringing together the contributors in January, where we had our first call mid February, &amp; with calls taking place every 2 weeks to 1 month.  Organization over the first rounds operation began to formalize in March, with key pieces coming together (roles, Charmverse setup etc) in April.  In May, we opened up applications to the public for 3 key directives (<a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/octant-community-fund/octant-community-fund-hq-8956739992421918\">Marketing, Tooling, &amp; Public Goods ecosystem collaboration</a>), and in early June the final votes were approved for 11 applicants.  47.99 ETH has been awarded, and all projects are moving forward with their work.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"group-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#group-3\"></a>Group</h3>\n<p>Before this process began, we had a tremendous amount of support from key allies in the space, and naturally, inviting many of them to join us in the development of this framework made sense.  Their expertise in different areas cannot be understated, which further cemented my feelings in what is the superpower of web3, <em><strong>‘diversity’</strong></em>. One of the problems from managing this, was that we didn’t have a clear idea in what the optimal group size would be.  So the group grew to almost 20 people!  Whenever you have a large group like this, coordination can be quite tricky, so participation within the monthly or bi monthly calls began to fluctuate.  But nevertheless, with a largely committed group. it ended up working out well.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"timing-scope-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#timing-scope-4\"></a>Timing &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>I as the core team member putting all of this together, was a bit naive in how long some of these processes can ultimately take.  Taking a step back, it was not the initial intention to have this group of individuals being the driving force behind decision-making over how the first round of funds would be distributed.  Instead, this group was brought together to design a broader community governance framework so that the Octant community (at least at a larger scale than this group) could participate in some capacity in the first round.</p>\n<p>This work takes a while, and definitely not something that you can whip up quickly, without potential problems rearing their faces.  So in March, with the realization that staking rewards coming in and ready to allocate May 1st, we pivoted from the longer term design, to this group being that decision-making body.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this went as well as it possibly could have.  But that isn’t to say there weren’t some drawbacks.  Naturally, when you bring a group in for a different intention, there are going to be issues with what some of the members had committed to, both in timing, and requirements.  With that in mind, I cannot express my gratitude enough for the flexibility, and the work, that each of these members had contributed.  They made for a very productive first round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"evolution-moving-forward-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#evolution-moving-forward-5\"></a>Evolution Moving Forward</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to understand where we are now is that Octant governance is moving on two separate tracks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We are going to continue running Octant Community Fund rounds, with the next taking place in October/November.  Changes with this upcoming round will include: holding an open process for community members to participate in being on the next council, while getting really clear on expectations for those who participate next round.  Additionally, we’ll be refining what will be the directives of intent for proposals.  Some of that will be based upon early learnings in what was effective from this first round.  Lastly it’s worth noting that the treasury for this next round will be ~2x what it was this first round.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Separately, <a href=\"https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/\">Hats Protocol</a> a recent grantee, will collaborate with key stakeholders and the core team to resume the initial efforts of designing a long-term governance structure for the Octant community. Their work will focus on supporting Octant’s journey towards progressive decentralization.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is much more I can share about this process, but this may be a good stopping point for now.  I want to emphasize that we are looking interested community members to consider applying to be a part of this upcoming round.  More details will be shared on this soon!</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/reflections-from-the-first-community-fund-round/381\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/reflections-from-the-first-community-fund-round/381","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jul 2024 23:48:57 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-381"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/reflections-from-the-first-community-fund-round/381.rss","#text":"Reflections From The First Community Fund Round"}},{"title":"About the Governance category","dc:creator":"james","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Octant is steering this ship towards more community ownership.

The reason we moved quicker than we had planned was because our last round experienced full exposure of why a plutocracy doesn’t work from a community members perspective.

Unlike many other projects, Octant has a reliable funding supply, but needs to have a larger public reach, with more engaged GLM holders in order to grow and scale its user base. Our marketing and growth campaign pulls inspiration from Octants self nomination system for projects looking to receive funding via their app, but instead looks to reward high quality individuals interested in supporting public goods.</p>\n<p>In a play on a retro citizens round, people will be able to nominate themselves or nominate others in a series of call to actions that require people to post and engage in the Octant farcaster channel. This will include needing to quote tweet and answer a weekly prompt. These prompts will not only serve as a means of selecting those who will receive GLM,  but these prompts will also help highlight and teach people about Octant works and how to get involved.</p>\n<p>The final weeks prompt is ‘proof of stake’ where participants will stake their GLM in Octant and be entered into a contest to win a larger pool of GLM tokens.</p>\n<p>Our end goal is to create a Public Goods Flywheel, by ensuring that GLM gets into the hands of regenerative and public goods-minded individuals so that more people stake and use Octant.</p>\n<p>If you want to read more about our campaign and read our original proposal you can check it out here - <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/octant-community-fund/public-goods-flywheel-9797027594937666\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.charmverse.io/octant-community-fund/public-goods-flywheel-9797027594937666</a></p>\n<p>We are looking to launch this at the end of July and have participants staked and able to participate in epoch 5.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/public-goods-flywheel/368\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/public-goods-flywheel/368","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 20:27:59 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-368"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/public-goods-flywheel/368.rss","#text":"Public Goods FlyWheel"}},{"title":"Octant Community Growth Strategy","dc:creator":"Abundance","category":"Mechanism Design","description":"<p>I wanted to share some thoughts on what I see as a great potential for Octant’s growth, and get input from the Octant team and broader community on strategy etc.</p>\n<p>What I mean by “growth” is: (1) more people familiar with Octant and its mission (2) more people actively engaged in the Octant community/public goods funding, and (3) more people holding/locking GLM (ie. driving demand for the GLM token).</p>\n<p>My thesis is that the key to driving growth in all these metrics is harnessing the open social graph - in particular the one implemented on <a href=\"https://www.farcaster.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Farcaster Protocol</a>.</p>\n<p>(Fair disclosure: I have no financial interest in promoting Farcaster. I am however building a public goods project on Farcaster for the same reasons I’m outlining here - because I believe that the open social graph is a key component for creating an effective and self-sustainable public goods funding mechanism - more on that later).</p>\n<p><strong>What is Farcaster?</strong></p>\n<p>Farcaster (FC) is a “sufficiently decentralized” social media protocol (meaning that user posts are censorship resistant but display of the posts is client-dependent). FC currently has about 500,000 registered users (though I estimate the number of “real” accounts is probably around 100K)</p>\n<p><strong>Why Farcaster?</strong></p>\n<p>Octant’s main venue for community engagement right now is through Epochs (and to a lesser extent the nascent community fund). Epochs recur on a quarterly basis. For a short period, projects (and their respective communities) compete for a share of Octant’s ETH staking rewards. This brings some engagement and publicity to Octant but it’s not persistent.</p>\n<p>While Epochs are the core of Octant, I believe that to have sustained growth on all metrics we need to have persistent community engagement - and preferably it should be driven by the community itself rather than top-down - this is where Farcaster comes in.</p>\n<p>FC obviously has a tiny fraction of the users of a platform like Twitter. It does however have a large (and growing) base of the Ethereum community (Vitalik, for example, casts there much more often than on X), and it’s one of the most exciting ecosystems in crypto in my view. I also believe there is a much greater potential to build and grow an active and engaged Octant community there thanks to the open social graph and everything that can be built on it and integrated with Octant.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the Strategy?</strong></p>\n<p>What I’m proposing here is a very rough outline with a few suggestions just to get a sense of what’s possible. I’d love to have a lot more community/team input on this so we can make it into a more robust plan, and look into what resources Octant would consider dedicating to this (if that is indeed a path that Octant would want to pursue in the first place…) I’m putting it out here because I believe it’s worth pursuing and has a lot of potential. I don’t think it should necessarily be the sole focus of Octant, but I do think it should be a major element in Octant’s overall growth strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>The key elements of the strategy include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Growing awareness of Octant on FC through contests, games, and other forms of community engagement.</li>\n<li>Periodic partnerships with other communities on FC (eg Purple, Regen, Greenpill, Lotto, etc.) to both build the Octant brand and fund public goods.</li>\n<li>Harness FC’s tipping economy toward activities that align with Octant’s growth goals and funding public goods more generally</li>\n<li>Use the open social graph to get quantitative (eg. GLM locked by FC user, number of Octant-related casts etc.) and qualitative data (eg. quality of content posted or benefit to community provided) on users which can then be used for Octant’s effort to decentralize its governance (as well for sybil resistance in Epoch voting)</li>\n<li>Set up broad categories of how community members can contribute to Octant’s growth (eg. memes, tooling, data analysis, Frames, etc. etc.) on FC and then periodically reward community members (both through the community tipping those users and through Octant funds) for their contributions. We can then use (shameless plug:) Impact App’s (free) curation tools to get the community itself involved in estimating the effect of the contributions (this is especially useful at scale, when the team will not have the capacity to review many posts, and it’s also a way to promote bottom-up involvement/potential governance for the community). Then measure the efficacy of the campaign and adjust accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So these are just some ideas and of course we can brainstorm other ways to harness the open social graph for Octant’s growth (I think there is a lot of potential with Frames, for example).</p>\n<p>This strategy would obviously require both time and funding from Octant. But I think that it is flexible enough that it can be adjusted over time (based on KPIs) for both the time and resources invested in it.</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/octant-community-growth-strategy/366\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/octant-community-growth-strategy/366","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 14:48:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-366"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/octant-community-growth-strategy/366.rss","#text":"Octant Community Growth Strategy"}},{"title":"EcoSynthesisX: Impact in real life through Web3 for a Better Future","dc:creator":"paul_burg","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<p>Empowering Change with Blockchain<br>\nEcoSynthesisX: Impact in real life through Web3 for a Better Future</p>\n<p>At EcoSynthesisX, we are leveraging the latest Web3 and blockchain technology to make a significant impact on public goods funding.

There are over 5000 Vyper contracts deployed across a dozen chains, securing over $2 billion of value. Vyper is free, open-source under a permissive license and usable on all EVM-compatible chains.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your main project funding sources?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grants funding and user donations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How much have you raised from each of your funding sources and from who?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimism RetroPGF Grant 3, 2024 : 250,000 $OP (~$1m at the time

project launched or planning to launch a token?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Share your project roadmap:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Officially release the major 0.4.0 update that will include modules, a new import system, a new IR and many other features to improve developer experience.</li>\n<li>Further develop the Vyper intermediary language (Venom) to give developers ever more optimized bytecode and reduce contracts’ gas usage.</li>\n<li>Continue to strengthen the security of the language through close collaboration with auditors, bug bounty programs, auditing competitions and providing better Vyper support to security tools such Slither or Echidna.</li>\n<li>Improve developer UX through tools such as titanoboa (<a href=\"https://github.com/vyperlang/titanoboa\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - vyperlang/titanoboa: a vyper interpreter</a>) or the Vyper Jupyter Lab environment (<a href=\"https://try.vyperlang.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://try.vyperlang.org/</a>) to facilitate thorough testing and quick prototyping</li>\n<li>Promote Vyper adoption and onboard new developers by participating in major blockchain conferences, organizing workshops, outreach programs and producing more educational resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What milestones have you achieved?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vyper is now the second most widely used smart contract programming language.</li>\n<li>The tooling developed by the team around Vyper has constantly improved, with projects like titanoboa now offering fuzzing, code coverage and gas profiling with faster execution speed than Foundry.</li>\n<li>Optimizations to the Vyper compiler consistently reduce gas costs and produce binaries that are on average 50% smaller compared to Solidity.</li>\n<li>Following the discovery of a vulnerability in 2023, the team organized bug bounty programs, security competitions and worked with auditors to thoroughly review the codebase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tell us more about milestones you’d like to achieve</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The official release of the 0.4.0 version of Vyper will be a major milestone for the language, offering more modularity, security and efficiency to users.</li>\n<li>We hope to significantly increase the number of developers and protocols adopting Vyper and eventually make it the go-to smart contract programming language on the EVM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Funding Goal and Budget:</strong><br>\nWe are looking to raise $3 millions USD

Everyone can make a dappnode app of any node without having to consult us!</li>\n<li>Access to the machine via VPN for remote access to the GUI</li>\n<li>Opt-in Auto-updates: hands-free node updates. Extremely useful for users but also networks as they get the subset of nodes running on dappnode automatically updated - simplifies potential fork situations.</li>\n<li>Stakers UI: A dedicated UI for EVM/Ethereum-like Proof-of-Stake validator setups (choosing EL, CL, Web3signer, MEV Boost) - intuitive and easy to choose! Allows for almost-instant consensus client switch without risking slashing to promote client diversity.</li>\n<li>Ethical Monitoring: Tor-based monitoring system to alert users when their Dappnodes are down but respecting the privacy of the user: we route liveness pings via Tor so we never get IPs! - Coordinated a standard API for the keymanager with Ethereum Core developers to facilitate validator key management between clients and other software.</li>\n<li>Developed a FOSS dashboard to manage keys irrespective of the underlying client software (using the Key Manager API)</li>\n<li>Created Smooth, a MEV Smoothing Pool to counterbalance the centralizing forces of the uneven distribution of MEV rewards that makes it that effectively pools with lots of validators end up with higher rewards than the median/expected solo staker. Smooth validators get 104% MORE execution layer rewards (DOUBLE!) than the expected non-smooth solo staker. This is absolutely necessary to make it economically fair for solo stakers and keep promoting decentralization.</li>\n<li>Operation Solo Staker with <a href=\"http://Ether.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ether.fi</a> provided dappnode machines to community members around the world to geographically decentralize the node set of Ethereum and allow them to run validators and get benefits without needing to put the ETH themselves.

This includes documentation, educational videos and a devrel program. Creating a healthy ecosystem around the dappstore will bring value to existing users and expand the reach of the software to other communities.<br>\n• Partnering with Gnosis Chain to bootstrap decentralized validators via a validator incentivization program. We are expected to make grow the number of nodes significantly.<br>\n• Smooth v2, improving on the first design of the MEV Smoothing pool considering the feedback of current users and expand the reach so solo stakers will get better rewards.</p>\n<p>Aside from specific milestones, we would like to keep working on 3 directions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>advocacy and practical solutions implementation to defend decentralization like the Keymanager API, Smooth.</li>\n<li>Technological accessibility - keep improving our software to fulfil our general mission to bring ease of use for the web3 decentralized stack and make it more accessible. Decentralization through good UX.</li>\n<li>Economic accessibility - keep forging partnerships within the ecosystem to bring the economic barriers of entry to Staking down (&lt;32 ETH) to gain users and stakers in regions of the world with less disposable income and increase decentralization.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Moonshot objective for this year are to explore AI integrations. Dappnode, as software that you install in a machine at home that is 24/7 online (needs to be to validate), is perfectly positioned to also be a private local server for personal AI assistants.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"funding-goal-and-budget-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#funding-goal-and-budget-10\"></a>Funding Goal and Budget:</h2>\n<p>Our burn rate is of around 650,000 yearly (yes, we try to keep costs low - missionaries not mercenaries!). Needless to say, if instead of maintaining our current team we could grow, we could advance much faster on the milestones and expand on other activities :).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tell-us-more-about-your-team-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#tell-us-more-about-your-team-11\"></a>Tell us more about your team:</h2>\n<p>Founders:</p>\n<p>Jordi Baylina - OGs know him as part of the WHG who participated in the recovery of funds in The DAO and the Parity multisig hacks.

You have a few nodes in different countries? Political interference resilience. You have nodes in different power grids? You have resilience to power grid failure. In different hardware?

On one side, some of them have bought the Dappnode Hardware, making a contribution with their payment to the team that also builds the software, but that unfortunately is not enough to maintain the project at the current rate of updates in the sector. Our intention is to become sustainable and not to rely on grants, and we believe we can find a non-extractive business model that will leverage web3 characteristics to create truly win-win-win situations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-can-the-octant-team-help-you-with-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#what-can-the-octant-team-help-you-with-20\"></a>What can the Octant team help you with?</h2>\n<p>There are many things we could do to collaborate and help Dappnode:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>With 100,000 ETH staked, it achieves enough smoothing effects to get Execution rewards a lot closer to the average than the median. By joining Smooth with even just a portion of such validators and thousands of Solo Stakers would benefit from exposure to the MEV of the blocks produced by such a big influx of validators, effectively smoothing their rewards to the same level as validator pools and centralized actors. Octant would be contributing to all solo stakers and also to Dappnode in a more long-term sustainable way with the 7% fee on Execution Layer rewards of the pool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Would love to hear more about how Octant is running these validators. At dappnode we can provide you with a turnkey solution to put all or some of these validators in more decentralized setups but without losing control - by distributing machines to team mebmers and using DVT to reduce impact of downtime of some of machines. This would put a substantial amount of ETH validating in completely decentralized setups, being completely ethereum aligned and actively pushing for decentralization while engaging the team to do it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another model is to allow for a contest where we distribute such machines and DVT setups to applicants in different places in the world to achieve maximal geographical decentralization and then move part of Octant’s ETH to validate in these machines. Would love to hop in a call to jam ideas on this!</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-do-you-define-impact-for-your-project-what-metrics-are-you-tracking-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#how-do-you-define-impact-for-your-project-what-metrics-are-you-tracking-21\"></a>How do you define impact for your project? What metrics are you tracking?</h2>\n<p>For Dappnode, impact is defined by how much we can contribute to the decentralization of the web3 infrastructure. Our primary measure of impact would be the number of nodes and validators running on Dappnode, as this directly reflects our mission to make web3 infrastructure accessible to all. We would also consider the geographic distribution of these nodes, as this is a key indicator of the networks that we serve’s resilience to various potential challenges. I say WOULD because since our design principles are decentralization, privacy and self-sovereignty, we actually do not track our users. Some metrics that we can track is how many users self-report as using Dappnode by putting Dappnode in their grafitti and we also track how many validators have decided to share this information with us. That makes around 7400+ validators on Ethereum and more than 20000 on Gnosis Chain. We can’t track the usage of our FOSS at a user level, but we do establish partnerships with companies and networks/foundations: <a href=\"https://dappnode.com/en-us/pages/partners\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dappnodes Partners - Building a Decentralized World</a> We believe that the widespread usage of our software is a testament to its utility and effectiveness. Finally, we monitor the growth and activity of our on-chain product, Smooth, and of the activity in our community. The first directly impacts the smoothing effects and the increase in rewards for Solo Stakers, and the second, the engagement of our community, is crucial to our mission and serves as a barometer for our impact.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"share-your-project-impact-metrics-and-results-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#share-your-project-impact-metrics-and-results-22\"></a>Share your project impact metrics and results</h2>\n<p>Link 1: Graffiti word cloud where we can see the Default validator of Dappnode as one of the top 25 graffitis.

Here we can see that dappnode appears in different variations of the biggest graffitis. Link 3: 14 companies and their partnerships with Dappnode are described in our partners page.

Blockscout has been active since 2018 and has made considerable improvements to the product over the past 1 1/2 years to support the vast array of chains entering the ecosytem.  Any project can fork Blockscout and use it as a block explorer for their network free of charge. This includes optimistic rollups, zk rollups, L3s, Bitcoin L2s, appchains - all shapes and sizes of EVM-compatible chain.</p>\n<p>Blockscout runs Ethereum instances as a public good (including <a href=\"https://eth.blockscout.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mainnet</a> , <a href=\"https://eth-sepolia.blockscout.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sepolia</a> and <a href=\"https://eth-holesky.blockscout.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Holesky</a>) without ongoing compensation. This is paramount for transparency and redundancy and provides many useful tools for developers (APIs, contract verification) as well as transaction tracking capabilities for the blockchain public.</p>\n<p>Paid hosting services are offered for networks who want to offload archive node and explorer hosting, customizations, maintenance and upgrades to our team of experts and optimized infrastructure. At any given time projects who choose the EaaS or RaaS services may have access to alpha features in development (such as an advanced admin panel and transaction interpreter). However, once new features are thoroughly tested they are released to the open-source community for unlimited use. Currently, all features that have undergone the required QA process are available to the public.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"primary-funding-sources-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#primary-funding-sources-2\"></a>Primary funding sources</h2>\n<p>Grant funding, user support and donations, and our EaaS offering are our primary revenue sources.</p>\n<p>These include previous grants with approximate funding amounts from the EthPrize Foundation (250K), the Ethereum Foundation (80K), Gitcoin (80K), Optimism RetroPGF (265 OP), ETC DAO (50K), Gnosis DAO (300K), and many projects who we’ve collaborated with to provide EaaS and/or development services.</p>\n<p>Any additional funding we receive from this campaign will go towards defraying infrastructure costs for our public goods instances and developing new features to support open-source exploration.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"project-milestones-and-roadmap-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#project-milestones-and-roadmap-3\"></a>Project milestones and roadmap</h2>\n<p>We have achieved many milestones in the past year, notably a large push towards feature parity with Etherscan, support for all EIPs (<a href=\"https://www.blog.blockscout.com/blobs/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">including 4844</a>), a standalone smart contract verification service, <a href=\"https://www.blog.blockscout.com/ui-features/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">major UI upgrades</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blog.blockscout.com/performance-update/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">major performance optimizations</a>.

Blockchain explorers are not meant to be siloed in gated, closed-source environments, but transparent and available to all. They are meant to serve vital information quickly and effectively, be auditable and customizable by the community, and provide much needed infrastructure redundancy when required. Just like we need multiple clients for Ethereum, we need multiple explorers and tooling diversity for the Ethereum ecosystem. If one goes down or contains inaccuracies, others are there to step in and support.</p>\n<p>We appreciate your support of this and other vital infrastructure for a decentralized future!!</p>\n<h2><a name=\"project-llinks-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#project-llinks-8\"></a>Project Llinks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blockscoutcom\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">x.com</a></li>\n<li>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/blockscout\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockscout · GitHub</a></li>\n<li>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/blockscout\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockscout</a> - Discord Contact (.mojmir)</li>\n<li>Website: <a href=\"https://www.blockscout.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.blockscout.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/blockscout-open-source-block-explorer/313\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/blockscout-open-source-block-explorer/313","pubDate":"Sun, 02 Jun 2024 23:10:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-313"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/blockscout-open-source-block-explorer/313.rss","#text":"Blockscout Open Source Block Explorer"}},{"title":"Blockchain Innovation Hub: Abakhus Protocol to bring privacy to Golem Network","dc:creator":"amrdavila","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<h3><a name=\"project-description-and-why-we-classify-it-as-a-public-good-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#project-description-and-why-we-classify-it-as-a-public-good-1\"></a>Project Description and why we classify it as a Public Good</h3>\n<p>Privacy is a human right, widely recognized by United Nations (<a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/delegate/data-privacy-right-read-without-being-read\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Data privacy: A right to read without being read | United Nations</a>) and is also considered a public good in Gitcoin definitions of public goods (<a href=\"https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants/general-questions/what-are-public-goods\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">What are Public Goods? | Gitcoin support</a>) as well as Joshua A.T.

For example, with our dashboard, community builders quickly know who the active members are and spot trends. To bridge the gap between data and impact, we offer several features that build on top of our analytics: smart announcements, reputation NFT, Hivemind (Q&amp;A-bot).</p>\n<p>We kicked off our project in May 2022 with a deep dive into community science.

Summer 2023 we launched our app, providing analytics to communities on Discord. Since then we have further developed our backend, increasing the efficacy of data ingestion and computation, and added new metrics to our dashboard. We are currently completing a grant by SingularityNet for developing an LLM bot (HiveMind), and another grant by Arbitrum for developing an off-chain reputation score that is displayed onchain (dynamic NFT). As part of these grants we are integrating data from other community platforms (Discourse, Telegram).</p>\n<p>We are building TogetherCrew as an open source project, including our metrics. As PhDs and scientists, we know that the data that feeds our algorithm isn’t ours, but is owned by the community. Our vision is to enable communities to build their own mini-apps powered by their own data. To enable this, we are indexing and structuring the conversations that are happening on various communication platforms. In addition to this, our community engagement metrics adopt a human approach, by considering activity over a longer timespan. For example, members do not need to post every day to be considered active. We know that live happens outside of community platforms.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"main-project-funding-sources-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#main-project-funding-sources-3\"></a>Main Project Funding Sources</h2>\n<p>We have received grants and completed work for</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aavegrants.org/check-out-our-grantees-wip/untitled/community-health-analytics\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aave</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.aragon.org/t/real-time-community-health-analytics/3472\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aragon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/prezenti.eth/lQi3cg5CwTXVFeOGODSB3JYUPNAxRzNufPo20D-khfw\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Celo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.metacartel.org/t/grant-request-community-health-a-project-by-rndao/2354\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MetaCartel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.pokt.network/t/allocated-priority-pocket-network-ecosystem-metrics-dashboard/4594/10\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pokt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/community-health-check.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Web3Foundation</a></li>\n<li>Near (no online link available)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/hivemind-augmented-qa-bot-and-p2p-knowledge-base/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SingularityNet</a> - work in progress</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism</a> - work in progress</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://new.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&amp;chainId=10&amp;role=builder&amp;proposalId=0x62b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum</a> - work in progress</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"project-funding-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#project-funding-4\"></a>Project Funding</h2>\n<p>We are seeking project-specific funding to support the development of a Farcaster pipeline and features. We have two features in mind:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"know-your-community-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#know-your-community-5\"></a>Know your community</h3>\n<p>This feature is community-leader centric. The admin of the community can turn on this feature, and decides who has access to it. It allows them to</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Receive a quick update on what happened while they were away</li>\n<li>Get more familiar with members by knowing their interests</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This information can be used to develop better resources for the community (content, events etc), spot collaboration opportunities etc.</p>\n<p><em>How we will do this:</em>* We will summarize conversations using the expertise we already developed thanks to HiveMind. These summaries will be send to the user via direct message. The user will decide the timeframe for these summaries, data source (e.g., channel data, channel follower casts, token holder casts), and when the summary should be received. Only admins of the TogetherCrew app will be able to decide the content of the summary and who should receive it.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"friendrecommender-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#friendrecommender-6\"></a>FriendRecommender</h3>\n<p>This feature is community-member centric. It will be available to everyone on Farcaster, but only use data from communities who use TogetherCrew. This is in line with our principle that a user’s data should not be used without their consent.</p>\n<p>We will create a frame. This frame provides users with a recommendation with whom to connect with. This recommendation is based on previous casts, and matches users based on their similarity of casts. 6</p>\n<h2><a name=\"roadmap-and-milestones-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#roadmap-and-milestones-7\"></a>Roadmap and Milestones</h2>\n<p>We’re looking for ETH 3 to ETH 5 (USD 18k) in funding to support this development.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1</strong>: Infrastructure Setup<br>\nThe pipeline integrates Neynar webhooks, listening to real-time Farcaster events and storing them in a graph database.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2</strong>: Farcaster Analyzer Pipeline<br>\nThe pipeline transforms Farcaster data into a data format compatible with the TogetherCrew analyzer.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3</strong>: Farcaster LLM Pipeline<br>\nThe pipeline transforms Farcaster data into a data format compatible with the TogetherCrew LLM.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 4</strong>: Community summaries<br>\nDesign message scheduler and message parameters build bot that sends DC Test bot Deploy bot</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 5</strong>: FriendRecommender<br>\nDesign frame flow + parameters + growth/usage strategy</p>\n<h2><a name=\"team-information-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#team-information-8\"></a>Team Information</h2>\n<p>For this project, the following team members will be core:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/amindadgar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Amin</a> will be responsible for the data analytics and LLM work.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Behzad-rabiei\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Behzad</a> will be responsible for creating the data pipeline: Backend Engineer with over 5 years of expertise spanning IoT, streaming services, and financial social networks.</li>\n<li>I (Katerina, contact person) and Daniel will be responsible for product development (user experience, research).

The commitment to continued growth in our ecosystem and supporting public goods is truly inspiring.</p>\n<p>As we look forward to this exciting opportunity, I propose further integrating the advanced funding tools provided by Gitcoin to enhance our grant allocation processes. Specifically, we encourage you to consider Gitcoin’s Quadratic Funding (QF) and EasyRetroPGF for upcoming community fund rounds.</p>\n<p>These tools complement the existing direct grants via Charmverse, introducing innovative funding mechanisms that could significantly benefit the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Quadratic Funding?</strong></p>\n<p>Quadratic Funding (QF) is a powerful democratic funding mechanism that allocates resources more equitably. It amplifies the community’s voice, allowing the collective preference to drive funding decisions. This method offers several advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Increased Community Engagement:</strong> Encourages active participation from the community, making everyone’s contributions count.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fair Distribution of Funds:</strong> Ensures a balanced allocation, favoring projects with broad community support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for Diverse Projects:</strong> Enables funding for many initiatives, including smaller, impactful projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why EasyRetroPGF?</strong></p>\n<p>EasyRetroPGF (Easy Retro Public Goods Funding) simplifies the process of retroactive funding, focusing on rewarding projects that have already delivered value to the community. This approach can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incentivize Successful Projects:</strong> Recognizes and supports projects with significant impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Encourage Continuous Contribution:</strong> Motivates ongoing efforts and contributions to the ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Streamline Funding Processes:</strong> Provides clear criteria for funding based on past performance and outcomes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Proven Partnership and Track Record</strong></p>\n<p>Our previous collaboration with Octant has been immensely fruitful. As detailed in <a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/gitcoin-continuing-to-fund-what-matters/234\">Gitcoin: Continuing to Fund What Matters</a>, we have successfully directed funds from Octant Epochs to shared Public Goods Initiatives. This partnership has leveraged our experience and tools to support impactful projects, showcasing the potential for even greater achievements through these novel funding mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>I encourage the Octant community to explore these tools further and consider a pilot implementation in the next funding round. Together, we can drive innovation and ensure our community fund achieves its full potential.</p>\n<p>Feedback and comments are welcome and encouraged!</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Sov</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/proposing-gitcoin-tools-for-enhanced-funding-mechanisms-in-the-octant-community-fund/302\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/proposing-gitcoin-tools-for-enhanced-funding-mechanisms-in-the-octant-community-fund/302","pubDate":"Wed, 22 May 2024 19:33:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-302"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/proposing-gitcoin-tools-for-enhanced-funding-mechanisms-in-the-octant-community-fund/302.rss","#text":"Proposing Gitcoin Tools for Enhanced Funding Mechanisms in the Octant Community Fund"}}]}}}
