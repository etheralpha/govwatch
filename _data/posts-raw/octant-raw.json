That is: for everyone to be able to run validators and nodes, and decentralize the networks they use and love - regardless of their technical ability or economic situation.</p>\n<p>It’s a public good because we do not only not charge anything for the software, and we keep the values of decentralization, self-sovereignty and privacy as our main design principle: we don’t capture telemetry and we don’t know how many people use dappnode except if they decide to self-identify as validators in EVM chains by putting the word “dappnode” in the graffiti.</p>\n<p>The FOSS nature of it means that individuals use it, teams use it, companies use it and even knowledgeable developers use it despite having the knowledge to run nodes and validators by themselves because it makes their life simpler.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-are-your-main-project-funding-sources-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#what-are-your-main-project-funding-sources-3\"></a>What are your main project funding sources?</h2>\n<p>Grants funding, User donations, Other</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-much-have-you-raised-from-each-of-your-funding-sources-and-from-who-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#how-much-have-you-raised-from-each-of-your-funding-sources-and-from-who-4\"></a>How much have you raised from each of your funding sources and from who?</h2>\n<p>482000 from EF, Aragon, Gitcoin Grants and Giveth</p>\n<h2><a name=\"are-you-seeking-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#are-you-seeking-5\"></a>Are you seeking:</h2>\n<p>Funding for general operations</p>\n<h2><a name=\"has-your-project-launched-or-planning-to-launch-a-token-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#has-your-project-launched-or-planning-to-launch-a-token-6\"></a>Has your project launched or planning to launch a token?</h2>\n<p>We do not have a token.</p>\n<p>Dappnode had a governance token called $NODE that was hacked. Anyone providing LP was reimbursed on their ETH and GNO positions by Dappnode. This token was <strong>not sold</strong> - no money ever entered our treasury thanks to it - and contributed negatively to Dappnode’s sustainability because of the hack refunds… we lost a bunch of money.

Everyone can make a dappnode app of any node without having to consult us!</li>\n<li>Access to the machine via VPN for remote access to the GUI</li>\n<li>Opt-in Auto-updates: hands-free node updates.

Allows for almost-instant consensus client switch without risking slashing to promote client diversity.</li>\n<li>Ethical Monitoring: Tor-based monitoring system to alert users when their Dappnodes are down but respecting the privacy of the user: we route liveness pings via Tor so we never get IPs! - Coordinated a standard API for the keymanager with Ethereum Core developers to facilitate validator key management between clients and other software.</li>\n<li>Developed a FOSS dashboard to manage keys irrespective of the underlying client software (using the Key Manager API)</li>\n<li>Created Smooth, a MEV Smoothing Pool to counterbalance the centralizing forces of the uneven distribution of MEV rewards that makes it that effectively pools with lots of validators end up with higher rewards than the median/expected solo staker. Smooth validators get 104% MORE execution layer rewards (DOUBLE!) than the expected non-smooth solo staker. This is absolutely necessary to make it economically fair for solo stakers and keep promoting decentralization.</li>\n<li>Operation Solo Staker with <a href=\"http://Ether.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ether.fi</a> provided dappnode machines to community members around the world to geographically decentralize the node set of Ethereum and allow them to run validators and get benefits without needing to put the ETH themselves.

This includes documentation, educational videos and a devrel program. Creating a healthy ecosystem around the dappstore will bring value to existing users and expand the reach of the software to other communities.<br>\n• Partnering with Gnosis Chain to bootstrap decentralized validators via a validator incentivization program. We are expected to make grow the number of nodes significantly.<br>\n• Smooth v2, improving on the first design of the MEV Smoothing pool considering the feedback of current users and expand the reach so solo stakers will get better rewards.</p>\n<p>Aside from specific milestones, we would like to keep working on 3 directions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>advocacy and practical solutions implementation to defend decentralization like the Keymanager API, Smooth.</li>\n<li>Technological accessibility - keep improving our software to fulfil our general mission to bring ease of use for the web3 decentralized stack and make it more accessible. Decentralization through good UX.</li>\n<li>Economic accessibility - keep forging partnerships within the ecosystem to bring the economic barriers of entry to Staking down (&lt;32 ETH) to gain users and stakers in regions of the world with less disposable income and increase decentralization.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Moonshot objective for this year are to explore AI integrations. Dappnode, as software that you install in a machine at home that is 24/7 online (needs to be to validate), is perfectly positioned to also be a private local server for personal AI assistants.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"funding-goal-and-budget-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#funding-goal-and-budget-10\"></a>Funding Goal and Budget:</h2>\n<p>Our burn rate is of around 650,000 yearly (yes, we try to keep costs low - missionaries not mercenaries!). Needless to say, if instead of maintaining our current team we could grow, we could advance much faster on the milestones and expand on other activities :).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tell-us-more-about-your-team-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#tell-us-more-about-your-team-11\"></a>Tell us more about your team:</h2>\n<p>Founders:</p>\n<p>Jordi Baylina - OGs know him as part of the WHG who participated in the recovery of funds in The DAO and the Parity multisig hacks.

Thousands of users use dappnode to validate on Ethereum, Gnosis Chain and LUKSO and we continue to advocate for increasing nodes run in home setups and in underrepresented geographical regions.</p>\n<p>Decentralization is a spectrum where different properties emerge: Got 2 nodes? you have data redundancy. You have a few nodes in different countries? Political interference resilience. You have nodes in different power grids? You have resilience to power grid failure. In different hardware? You have resilience to 0 day attacks, etc. The firm belief that an uncensorable, self-sovereign platform needs decentralized infrastructure to maintain these properties is why we will keep pushing to make it extremely simple to achieve such degree of decentralization.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"whats-your-projects-twitter-handle-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#whats-your-projects-twitter-handle-14\"></a>What’s your project’s Twitter handle?</h2>\n<p><span class=\"mention\">@dappnode</span></p>\n<h2><a name=\"github-link-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#github-link-15\"></a>GitHub Link:</h2>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/dappnode/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/dappnode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"280\" height=\"280\" src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/original/1X/15a08c0a111d0289e1b18281709c77ab272f4bff.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"453E61\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/dappnode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dappnode</a></h3>\n\n  <p>dappnode has 237 repositories available.

On one side, some of them have bought the Dappnode Hardware, making a contribution with their payment to the team that also builds the software, but that unfortunately is not enough to maintain the project at the current rate of updates in the sector. Our intention is to become sustainable and not to rely on grants, and we believe we can find a non-extractive business model that will leverage web3 characteristics to create truly win-win-win situations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-can-the-octant-team-help-you-with-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#what-can-the-octant-team-help-you-with-20\"></a>What can the Octant team help you with?</h2>\n<p>There are many things we could do to collaborate and help Dappnode:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>With 100,000 ETH staked, it achieves enough smoothing effects to get Execution rewards a lot closer to the average than the median. By joining Smooth with even just a portion of such validators and thousands of Solo Stakers would benefit from exposure to the MEV of the blocks produced by such a big influx of validators, effectively smoothing their rewards to the same level as validator pools and centralized actors. Octant would be contributing to all solo stakers and also to Dappnode in a more long-term sustainable way with the 7% fee on Execution Layer rewards of the pool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Would love to hear more about how Octant is running these validators. At dappnode we can provide you with a turnkey solution to put all or some of these validators in more decentralized setups but without losing control - by distributing machines to team mebmers and using DVT to reduce impact of downtime of some of machines. This would put a substantial amount of ETH validating in completely decentralized setups, being completely ethereum aligned and actively pushing for decentralization while engaging the team to do it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another model is to allow for a contest where we distribute such machines and DVT setups to applicants in different places in the world to achieve maximal geographical decentralization and then move part of Octant’s ETH to validate in these machines. Would love to hop in a call to jam ideas on this!</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-do-you-define-impact-for-your-project-what-metrics-are-you-tracking-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#how-do-you-define-impact-for-your-project-what-metrics-are-you-tracking-21\"></a>How do you define impact for your project? What metrics are you tracking?</h2>\n<p>For Dappnode, impact is defined by how much we can contribute to the decentralization of the web3 infrastructure. Our primary measure of impact would be the number of nodes and validators running on Dappnode, as this directly reflects our mission to make web3 infrastructure accessible to all. We would also consider the geographic distribution of these nodes, as this is a key indicator of the networks that we serve’s resilience to various potential challenges. I say WOULD because since our design principles are decentralization, privacy and self-sovereignty, we actually do not track our users. Some metrics that we can track is how many users self-report as using Dappnode by putting Dappnode in their grafitti and we also track how many validators have decided to share this information with us. That makes around 7400+ validators on Ethereum and more than 20000 on Gnosis Chain. We can’t track the usage of our FOSS at a user level, but we do establish partnerships with companies and networks/foundations: <a href=\"https://dappnode.com/en-us/pages/partners\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dappnodes Partners - Building a Decentralized World</a> We believe that the widespread usage of our software is a testament to its utility and effectiveness. Finally, we monitor the growth and activity of our on-chain product, Smooth, and of the activity in our community. The first directly impacts the smoothing effects and the increase in rewards for Solo Stakers, and the second, the engagement of our community, is crucial to our mission and serves as a barometer for our impact.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"share-your-project-impact-metrics-and-results-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#share-your-project-impact-metrics-and-results-22\"></a>Share your project impact metrics and results</h2>\n<p>Link 1: Graffiti word cloud where we can see the Default validator of Dappnode as one of the top 25 graffitis.

Just a wallet and the will to try out something uniquely private-by-default!</h4>\n<p>This is achieved through the MASQ open-sourced mesh network solution (called MASQ Node) powered by the users themselves, that works on top of the normal internet without special hardware or traditional VPN or Tor technology.</p>\n<p>Coupled with the MASQ web3 privacy browser, any user can try out the MASQ Network now for free on Polygon Amoy testnet, and see the exciting user experience created so far.</p>\n<p>Some of the key features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Borderless browsing and privacy online without tracking, from anywhere in the world</li>\n<li>Native handling of ENS domain profiles, dot eth content, IPFS websites, Handshake domain resolution</li>\n<li>Uncensored access to crypto platforms, web3 dApps, and the social platforms</li>\n<li>In-built web3 dApps library, curated by the team and community</li>\n<li>Ability to earn passive crypto by sharing Internet bandwidth with the MASQ Network</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"classification-as-a-public-good-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#classification-as-a-public-good-4\"></a>Classification as a Public Good</h2>\n<p>MASQ is characterized as a Public Good for several core reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Freedom of Information:</strong> MASQ enables access to uncensored information and content on the clear web, supporting freedom of expression and the democratization of knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefits to Society with Enhanced Privacy:</strong> MASQ helps protect individuals from intrusive surveillance and data collection, promoting digital privacy rights. Your data stays your data!<br>\nMASQ does not harvest, track or log anything on users and ensures privacy and enhanced browsing security for all users, serving the public interest and contributing to the common good of the web2 and web3 users.<br>\nTruthfully, the MASQ team doesn’t even know exactly how many active Nodes are worldwide at any given time - no personal user information or app analytics are collected. (on-chain data and privacy-respecting download metrics are used to estimate network use and growth trends)</li>\n<li><strong>Non-Excludability</strong>: MASQ Core networking software is open-source and the browser is available publicly to all users, (also hosted in IPFS) so it is impossible to exclude anyone from using them. This means that anyone with access to the internet can benefit from the privacy and security features offered by MASQ.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-Rivalrous Consumption:</strong> The use of the MASQ Network/Browser by one individual does not reduce its availability to others. Multiple users can simultaneously benefit from the network without disrupting the availability of the service. In fact, the more users supporting the MASQ Network, the more capacity and network stability is present overall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"main-project-funding-sources-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#main-project-funding-sources-5\"></a>Main Project Funding Sources</h2>\n<p>Having started from community grass-roots, MASQ has operated without conducting an ICO, public raises or Angel/VC backing.

Blockscout has been active since 2018 and has made considerable improvements to the product over the past 1 1/2 years to support the vast array of chains entering the ecosytem.  Any project can fork Blockscout and use it as a block explorer for their network free of charge. This includes optimistic rollups, zk rollups, L3s, Bitcoin L2s, appchains - all shapes and sizes of EVM-compatible chain.</p>\n<p>Blockscout runs Ethereum instances as a public good (including <a href=\"https://eth.blockscout.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mainnet</a> , <a href=\"https://eth-sepolia.blockscout.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sepolia</a> and <a href=\"https://eth-holesky.blockscout.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Holesky</a>) without ongoing compensation. This is paramount for transparency and redundancy and provides many useful tools for developers (APIs, contract verification) as well as transaction tracking capabilities for the blockchain public.</p>\n<p>Paid hosting services are offered for networks who want to offload archive node and explorer hosting, customizations, maintenance and upgrades to our team of experts and optimized infrastructure. At any given time projects who choose the EaaS or RaaS services may have access to alpha features in development (such as an advanced admin panel and transaction interpreter). However, once new features are thoroughly tested they are released to the open-source community for unlimited use. Currently, all features that have undergone the required QA process are available to the public.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"primary-funding-sources-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#primary-funding-sources-2\"></a>Primary funding sources</h2>\n<p>Grant funding, user support and donations, and our EaaS offering are our primary revenue sources.</p>\n<p>These include previous grants with approximate funding amounts from the EthPrize Foundation (250K), the Ethereum Foundation (80K), Gitcoin (80K), Optimism RetroPGF (265 OP), ETC DAO (50K), Gnosis DAO (300K), and many projects who we’ve collaborated with to provide EaaS and/or development services.</p>\n<p>Any additional funding we receive from this campaign will go towards defraying infrastructure costs for our public goods instances and developing new features to support open-source exploration.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"project-milestones-and-roadmap-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#project-milestones-and-roadmap-3\"></a>Project milestones and roadmap</h2>\n<p>We have achieved many milestones in the past year, notably a large push towards feature parity with Etherscan, support for all EIPs (<a href=\"https://www.blog.blockscout.com/blobs/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">including 4844</a>), a standalone smart contract verification service, <a href=\"https://www.blog.blockscout.com/ui-features/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">major UI upgrades</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blog.blockscout.com/performance-update/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">major performance optimizations</a>.

Blockchain explorers are not meant to be siloed in gated, closed-source environments, but transparent and available to all. They are meant to serve vital information quickly and effectively, be auditable and customizable by the community, and provide much needed infrastructure redundancy when required. Just like we need multiple clients for Ethereum, we need multiple explorers and tooling diversity for the Ethereum ecosystem. If one goes down or contains inaccuracies, others are there to step in and support.</p>\n<p>We appreciate your support of this and other vital infrastructure for a decentralized future!!</p>\n<h2><a name=\"project-llinks-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#project-llinks-8\"></a>Project Llinks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blockscoutcom\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">x.com</a></li>\n<li>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/blockscout\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockscout · GitHub</a></li>\n<li>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/blockscout\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockscout</a> - Discord Contact (.mojmir)</li>\n<li>Website: <a href=\"https://www.blockscout.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.blockscout.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/blockscout-open-source-block-explorer/313\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/blockscout-open-source-block-explorer/313","pubDate":"Sun, 02 Jun 2024 23:10:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-313"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/blockscout-open-source-block-explorer/313.rss","#text":"Blockscout Open Source Block Explorer"}},{"title":"Blockchain Innovation Hub: integrating Abakhus Protocol with Golem Network in order to bring privacy-preserving features to that network","dc:creator":"amrdavila","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<h3><a name=\"project-description-and-why-we-classify-it-as-a-public-good-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#project-description-and-why-we-classify-it-as-a-public-good-1\"></a>Project Description and why we classify it as a Public Good</h3>\n<p>Privacy is a human right, widely recognized by United Nations (<a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/delegate/data-privacy-right-read-without-being-read\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Data privacy: A right to read without being read | United Nations</a>) and is also considered a public good in Gitcoin definitions of public goods (<a href=\"https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants/general-questions/what-are-public-goods\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">What are Public Goods? | Gitcoin support</a>) as well as Joshua A.T.

We contribute to a sustainable growth of communities without burning out community builders.</p>\n<p>We offer two sets of features: Analytics (View your data) and Actions (take actions based on your data). For example, with our dashboard, community builders quickly know who the active members are and spot trends. To bridge the gap between data and impact, we offer several features that build on top of our analytics: smart announcements, reputation NFT, Hivemind (Q&amp;A-bot).</p>\n<p>We kicked off our project in May 2022 with a deep dive into community science. This was funded by Aragon. Since then we have continued to fund our efforts through grants (e.g., Aave, MetaCartel, Optimism, Web3 foundation, SingularityNet). Summer 2023 we launched our app, providing analytics to communities on Discord. Since then we have further developed our backend, increasing the efficacy of data ingestion and computation, and added new metrics to our dashboard. We are currently completing a grant by SingularityNet for developing an LLM bot (HiveMind), and another grant by Arbitrum for developing an off-chain reputation score that is displayed onchain (dynamic NFT). As part of these grants we are integrating data from other community platforms (Discourse, Telegram).</p>\n<p>We are building TogetherCrew as an open source project, including our metrics. As PhDs and scientists, we know that the data that feeds our algorithm isn’t ours, but is owned by the community. Our vision is to enable communities to build their own mini-apps powered by their own data. To enable this, we are indexing and structuring the conversations that are happening on various communication platforms. In addition to this, our community engagement metrics adopt a human approach, by considering activity over a longer timespan. For example, members do not need to post every day to be considered active. We know that live happens outside of community platforms.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"main-project-funding-sources-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#main-project-funding-sources-3\"></a>Main Project Funding Sources</h2>\n<p>We have received grants and completed work for</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aavegrants.org/check-out-our-grantees-wip/untitled/community-health-analytics\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aave</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.aragon.org/t/real-time-community-health-analytics/3472\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aragon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/prezenti.eth/lQi3cg5CwTXVFeOGODSB3JYUPNAxRzNufPo20D-khfw\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Celo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.metacartel.org/t/grant-request-community-health-a-project-by-rndao/2354\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MetaCartel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.pokt.network/t/allocated-priority-pocket-network-ecosystem-metrics-dashboard/4594/10\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pokt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/community-health-check.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Web3Foundation</a></li>\n<li>Near (no online link available)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/hivemind-augmented-qa-bot-and-p2p-knowledge-base/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SingularityNet</a> - work in progress</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism</a> - work in progress</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://new.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&amp;chainId=10&amp;role=builder&amp;proposalId=0x62b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum</a> - work in progress</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"project-funding-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#project-funding-4\"></a>Project Funding</h2>\n<p>We are seeking project-specific funding to support the development of a Farcaster pipeline and features.

These summaries will be send to the user via direct message. The user will decide the timeframe for these summaries, data source (e.g., channel data, channel follower casts, token holder casts), and when the summary should be received.

The commitment to continued growth in our ecosystem and supporting public goods is truly inspiring.</p>\n<p>As we look forward to this exciting opportunity, I propose further integrating the advanced funding tools provided by Gitcoin to enhance our grant allocation processes. Specifically, we encourage you to consider Gitcoin’s Quadratic Funding (QF) and EasyRetroPGF for upcoming community fund rounds.</p>\n<p>These tools complement the existing direct grants via Charmverse, introducing innovative funding mechanisms that could significantly benefit the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Quadratic Funding?</strong></p>\n<p>Quadratic Funding (QF) is a powerful democratic funding mechanism that allocates resources more equitably. It amplifies the community’s voice, allowing the collective preference to drive funding decisions. This method offers several advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Increased Community Engagement:</strong> Encourages active participation from the community, making everyone’s contributions count.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fair Distribution of Funds:</strong> Ensures a balanced allocation, favoring projects with broad community support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for Diverse Projects:</strong> Enables funding for many initiatives, including smaller, impactful projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why EasyRetroPGF?</strong></p>\n<p>EasyRetroPGF (Easy Retro Public Goods Funding) simplifies the process of retroactive funding, focusing on rewarding projects that have already delivered value to the community. This approach can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incentivize Successful Projects:</strong> Recognizes and supports projects with significant impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Encourage Continuous Contribution:</strong> Motivates ongoing efforts and contributions to the ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Streamline Funding Processes:</strong> Provides clear criteria for funding based on past performance and outcomes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Proven Partnership and Track Record</strong></p>\n<p>Our previous collaboration with Octant has been immensely fruitful. As detailed in <a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/gitcoin-continuing-to-fund-what-matters/234\">Gitcoin: Continuing to Fund What Matters</a>, we have successfully directed funds from Octant Epochs to shared Public Goods Initiatives. This partnership has leveraged our experience and tools to support impactful projects, showcasing the potential for even greater achievements through these novel funding mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>I encourage the Octant community to explore these tools further and consider a pilot implementation in the next funding round. Together, we can drive innovation and ensure our community fund achieves its full potential.</p>\n<p>Feedback and comments are welcome and encouraged!</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Sov</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/proposing-gitcoin-tools-for-enhanced-funding-mechanisms-in-the-octant-community-fund/302\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/proposing-gitcoin-tools-for-enhanced-funding-mechanisms-in-the-octant-community-fund/302","pubDate":"Wed, 22 May 2024 19:33:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-302"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/proposing-gitcoin-tools-for-enhanced-funding-mechanisms-in-the-octant-community-fund/302.rss","#text":"Proposing Gitcoin Tools for Enhanced Funding Mechanisms in the Octant Community Fund"}},{"title":"Impactvoice.xyz is the foundation of impact measurement(Voice what matters to fund what matters from the ground up)","dc:creator":"decentralizedceo","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>We are embarking on a journey to identify the true needs of communities, focusing initially on Africa. We use on-chain metrics to assess and select stable and valuable public goods projects in emerging markets. Our approach balances grassroots community needs with the top-down availability of resources, aiming to achieve sustainable project funding. Our scalable methodology in resource allocation serves as a foundation for measuring impact. A pilot program will begin in West Africa on April 10th, setting a benchmark for subsequent initiatives in other regions.</p>\n<p>We seek to collaborate with the Octant community on this initiative. This partnership will not only enhance brand visibility in emerging markets but also position Octant as a symbol of hope. Together, we can support communities in prioritizing and addressing critical areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>\n<p>There exists a global gap in resource coordination. Contributors are often unclear about how to effectively support emerging markets or assess the impact of their contributions. Simultaneously, communities from emerging markets struggle to communicate their needs in a measurable way, leading to a cycle of poor coordination and wasteful resource allocation.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n<p>Our solution involves directly identifying community problems through engagement with the communities themselves. We will identify widespread issues, address them, and transparently monitor progress. Starting with an understanding of local conditions, we will enable communities to propose their own solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Experiment Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regional project manager</li>\n<li>Sample community</li>\n<li>App for creating viable proposals</li>\n<li>Budget for community proposals post-voting</li>\n<li>Budget for assessing experiment viability</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implementation:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Assign a local project manager familiar with the region’s language and culture to lead the experiment.</li>\n<li>The project manager will organize in-person meetings to explain the process and guide community members in using the <a href=\"https://impactvoice.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Impactvoice.xyz</a> app to generate solution-oriented proposals. These meetings will occur in various locations within the target country.</li>\n<li>Conduct a voting period of approximately one month to select preferred community projects.</li>\n<li>Partner with the Open Source Observer to perform a feasibility analysis of the chosen projects.</li>\n<li>Implement a direct grant round using the alloy protocol, dependent on the projects’ viability and available budget.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Treasury Implementation:</strong></p>\n<p>As part of this experimental approach, we encourage the Octant community to vote on resource allocation from the treasury to the top-ranked projects. This could be implemented via platforms like Tally or Jokerace:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Direct funding from Octant community funds to Impact Voice, allowing projects to receive full funding upon achieving their initial milestones. This raises questions about the sustainability of Impact Voice without additional funding.</li>\n<li>After the initial funding disbursement, the remaining funds in the Impact Voice Treasury could be staked to generate additional resources for future rounds after final milestone completion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Scalability:</strong></p>\n<p>We are prepared to expand this initiative globally through the Greenpill Network Chapters. Potential next regions include Brazil, Kenya, Ivory Coast, and Uganda. These areas could serve as prototypes or benchmarks for other network states to engage with on-the-ground communities with identified needs.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1

composable public goods funding and impact tracking stack, built on Web3 social, DAOs, &amp; decentralized frontends.</p>\n<p>Since we first started building in October we have deployed multiple funding strategies with composability and decentralization in mind and a quarter million USD flowing through our platform. Already accessible through 50 gateways through the BOS framework. Our main priority this year is to not only build the building blocks to new funding mechanisms, but build a smooth experience to onboard the masses as well as a developer friendly stack so others can build their own public goods funding experiences for their own use case.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"important-links-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#important-links-1\"></a>Important Links</h1>\n<p>Important Links: <a href=\"http://github.com/potlock\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com/potlock</a></p>\n<p>Twitter https:<a href=\"http://x.com/potlock_\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">x.com/potlock_</a></p>\n<p>Docs <a href=\"https://docs.potlock.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.potlock.io</a></p>\n<p>Tutorial <a href=\"https://potlock.org/tutorials\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PotLock</a></p>\n<p>App <a href=\"https://app.potlock.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.potlock.org</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"why-are-a-public-good-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#why-are-a-public-good-2\"></a>Why Are A Public Good</h1>\n<p>We are a meta public good. A public goods that directly supports other public goods, regardless of blockchain or onboarding to Web3. We build everything in public, everything is open source (under MIT <a href=\"https://potlock.org/license\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">license</a>) and composable. We are building an open source ecosystem around non-evm public goods funding and impact tracking and looking to merge this with chain abstraction to the EVM ecosystem. More on our <a href=\"https://potlock.org/endgame\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">end game vision</a> (WIP)</p>\n<p>Everything we build in public in a composable way that has fees for all stakeholders which are optional. Our front end code is saved on chain and integrated into Web3 social. Follow our <a href=\"http://github.com/potlock\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github</a> for updates or subscribe to our <a href=\"https://subscribe.potlock.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">newsletter</a>.</p>\n<p>In October we started from a team of 2, now we have grown and hare greenpilling the entire NEAR Ecosystem, and have a robust group of contributors. We have launched our own identity protocol that integrates 3rd party providers and cross chain functionality, direct donations with on chain referrals, quadratic funding with more primitives to come, built on Web3 social and integrated with DAO support.</p>\n<p>Why Project Important</p>\n<p>Decentralized point of failure for funding mechanisms and silo’d experience for public goods funding. A separation of impact tracking, project profiles, social graph, and different funding strategies. We are combining all of these experiences and bringing true composability to the public goods funding space onto ecosystems that previously didn’t consider it. For public goods to gain true adoption we believe that we not only have to target existing ecosystems, but expand and bridge public goods funding to ecosystems that often overlook it from very early on.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"current-traction-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#current-traction-3\"></a>Current traction</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct Donations Launched in November $30,000 in direct donations</li>\n<li>Quadratic Funding Launched in February $200,000</li>\n<li>150 projects + on registry</li>\n<li>800 unique donors</li>\n<li>Beginning to build an <a href=\"https://ecosystem.potlock.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ecosystem</a></li>\n<li>Regular public goods <a href=\"https://subcribe.potlock.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">updates</a> (turning to video series for public goods eco updates)</li>\n<li>Built Identity Solution <a href=\"https://www.nada.bot/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">nada.bot</a> with 9 Stamps (Holonym, Farcaster, Lens, Twitter, etc verification) and more to come with 600+ checks verified on chain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By end of year target</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1,000 public goods on registry</li>\n<li>10 quadratic funding rounds</li>\n<li>5,000 verified humans and donors</li>\n<li>$1,000,000 through that platform</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Live Data</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dappradar.com/dapp/potlock\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dappradar.com/dapp/potlock</a></li>\n<li>Stats <a href=\"https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Lordking/potlock-UD3Flm\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PotLock | Lordking | Flipside</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://potlock.org/donors\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PotLock</a></li>\n<li>Data Repo <a href=\"https://potlock/data-repo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://potlock/data-repo</a></li>\n<li>Nada Bot on Dapp Radar <a href=\"https://dappradar.com/dapp/nada-bot\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dappradar.com/dapp/nada-bot</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"use-of-funds-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#use-of-funds-4\"></a>Use of Funds:</h1>\n<p>None of this will be used to cover engineering or core team costs.

By fostering a global network of regenerative founders, investors, builders, and enthusiasts, and embodying the principles of open-source technology, transparency, and decentralization, ReFi DAO acts as a catalyst for change, driving the Web3 movement towards creating sustainable, inclusive, and equitable economic systems.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"our-mission-and-contribution-to-public-goods-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#our-mission-and-contribution-to-public-goods-2\"></a><strong>Our Mission and Contribution to Public Goods</strong></h1>\n<p>ReFi DAO is dedicated to regenerating the Earth and revolutionizing how communities interact with finance and technology. Our core mission revolves around developing public goods for the ReFi ecosystem—tools, knowledge resources, and community networks—that facilitate the growth of ReFi and regenerative practices across the globe. These resources are designed not only to support the ReFi ecosystem’s immediate needs but also to ensure long-term sustainability and resilience.</p>\n<p><strong>A Global Network:</strong> Since inception in January 2021, ReFi DAO has rapidly evolved into a global community, with over 80,000 downloads of the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5RTHF6JVgQL1cgaVfvi7cv\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ReFi Podcast</a> across various media platforms, more than 100 events hosted in 58 cities, and a substantial online following. By consistently publishing informative content on the <a href=\"https://blog.refidao.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ReFi DAO Blog</a>, we continue to educate and inspire both global and local ReFi communities. Our media network is a key public good for the ReFi ecosystem by facilitating knowledge exchange, collaboration, and innovation across diverse geographies and cultures.</p>\n<p><strong>Empowering Localized Impact through ReFi Local Nodes</strong>: A cornerstone of ReFi DAO is the establishment of ReFi Local Nodes. These nodes are vibrant, community-driven platforms that empower localized environmental and social regeneration projects. By providing tools, funding, and support, we empower communities to implement solutions tailored to their unique contexts, driving meaningful change from the ground up.</p>\n<p>So far, we’ve allocated over $55,000 to ReFi local nodes, particularly in marginalised and underserved areas.

Our project is important for several reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Addressing Environmental Challenges:</strong> In the face of escalating environmental crises, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, ReFi DAO supports tangible solutions through regenerative finance. By leveraging blockchain technology, we facilitate investments in projects that have a direct positive impact on the environment, encouraging practices that restore rather than deplete natural resources.</li>\n<li><strong>Promoting Economic Inclusivity:</strong> Traditional financial systems often exclude marginalized communities, limiting access to funding for projects that could benefit both the environment and the community. ReFi DAO breaks down these barriers, offering a decentralized alternative that empowers individuals and communities worldwide to participate in the financing of projects that align with their values and needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Innovating for Sustainable Development:</strong> Our commitment to developing public goods and supporting the ReFi ecosystem with tools and resources underscores our role in innovating for sustainable development. ReFi DAO’s initiatives, such as the ReFi Passport and the support of Local Nodes, provide the infrastructure and network necessary for the widespread adoption of regenerative practices.</li>\n<li><strong>Fostering Community Empowerment:</strong> By building a global network of ReFi Local Nodes, we enable localized action and decision-making, ensuring that solutions are tailored to the specific needs and contexts of communities. This grassroots approach not only amplifies impact but also strengthens community cohesion and resilience against environmental and economic challenges.</li>\n<li><strong>Leading a Cultural Shift:</strong> ReFi DAO is at the vanguard of a cultural shift towards sustainability, regeneration, and decentralization. By championing regenerative finance, we advocate for a future where economic activities contribute to the healing of the planet and the well-being of its inhabitants. Our work inspires and mobilizes a growing community of individuals and organizations committed to making this vision a reality.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"project-links-resources-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#project-links-resources-10\"></a><strong>Project Links &amp; Resources</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/refidaoist\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/refi-dao/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@refidao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Youtube</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.refidao.com/#/portal/signup\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blog</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReFiPodcast\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ReFi Podcast</a></p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/refi-dao-a-network-society-to-regenerate-the-earth/273\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/refi-dao-a-network-society-to-regenerate-the-earth/273","pubDate":"Sun, 17 Mar 2024 16:44:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-273"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/refi-dao-a-network-society-to-regenerate-the-earth/273.rss","#text":"🔵 ReFi DAO - A Network Society to Regenerate the Earth"}},{"title":"LexDAO: law is a public good","dc:creator":"bestape","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<p>List defined <a href=\"https://docs.octant.app/submission-process.html#project-information-submission\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the “contributions” and “impact” paragraphs below:</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"contributions-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#contributions-1\"></a>contributions</h2>\n<p>LexDAO is a club of legal engineering professionals united to bring the traditional legal settlement layer to code and coded agreements to the masses. We believe that everyone deserves access to justice in a quick and efficient manner. If legal services were easier to use, verify and enforce, we could live in a fairer world.</p>\n<p>LexDAO organizes sophisticated conversations and educational materials to help orient people around how to build in the new and evolving space. LexDAO focuses on Code is Law applications where practical legal theory is embedded into smart contracts, applications and networks. The efforts we undertake are all in the spirit of public goods and services. Many of our projects spin out into standalone tools or services; some examples include KaliDAO and Smart Invoice.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impact-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#impact-2\"></a>impact</h2>\n<p>We’ve done many projects over the years, and recently got a grant big enough to start publishing comprehensive annual reports!</p>\n<p>Examples of high-impact are Real World Asset “RWA” offshoot projects like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaterDao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tater</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CougarDao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cougar</a>, using our offshoot project Kali for the DAO OS. These Kali RWA project are making important strides in web3 real estate. Like many other on-chain DAO deployers, Kali is the culmination of LexDAO Projects related to onchain governance, arbitration and corporate structures. The smart contract code is greatly simplified which makes it easier to read and secure assets on-chain.</p>\n<p>Another example is <a href=\"https://app.smartinvoice.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Smart Invoice</a>, a tool by a 3rd party built on LexDAO’s public-good lawtech <a href=\"https://github.com/lexdao/lexlockerv2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">LexLocker</a> that is designed to provide web3 workers with cryptocurrency invoicing, escrow and arbitration capabilities. As with most LexDAO affiliated solutions, Smart Invoice is built in an open source framework so that other developers can build on top of its code.

Lowering the cost of law has an exponential impact on human collaboration. Legal automation offers amazing opportunities to lower costs, but not all law can be automated. As such, LexDAO works in deterministic law (very automatable) and discretionary law (high-level reasons). Most importantly, we do this work as open source for the public good. Too few organizations offer pro-bono web3 legal services, and there ais more demand than LexDAO can currently offer; an Octant grant will help us scale to meet demand.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"whats-your-projects-twitter-handle-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#whats-your-projects-twitter-handle-15\"></a>what’s your project’s Twitter handle?</h2>\n<p><span class=\"mention\">@lex_dao</span></p>\n<h2><a name=\"github-link-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#github-link-16\"></a>GitHub link</h2>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/lexdao\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/lexdao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"280\" height=\"280\" src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/original/1X/3453e5760f5ee563d092f2c9fc8b1e8e4ff364df.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"41203D\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/lexdao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">LexDAO</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Web3 Legal Engineering Guild.

I’m one of the team members at the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI) and here’s more information about our work and the milestones we can achieve with the support of the Octant community.</p>\n<p><strong>About EUCI</strong></p>\n<p>EUCI is a non-profit advocacy organisation based in Brussels, which acts on behalf of Web3 organisations to negotiate a better regulatory outcome. It’s a mouthful, so what do we do in short? We lobby. We write legal arguments and explain technical terms to the regulators and authorities. Our objective is to prevent bad regulations which could stiff the innovative development of permissionless, decentralised applications leveraging blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>Since the formation, we’ve defended the decentralized tech stack on several fronts. Imagine building Octant or holding GLM tokens without wallets or other “crypto-asset service providers” to onboard users. We ensured these weren’t our reality. We educate regulators that DeFi isn’t like TradFi and that decentralization is not only possible but a responsible thing to do. We trained members of the parliament in Metamask use and enlightened EU Commission representatives about DAOs’ utilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Do we classify as a public good?</strong><br>\nYes. The provision of regulatory clarity that supports further innovation within the Web3 industry is not to be taken for granted. In fact, it’s often heavily opposed by traditional stakeholders (governments, banks, etc.) who may not be open to decentralised solutions for various misconceptions.</p>\n<p>This is why EUCI was created. Establishing strong advocacy and lobbying for the crypto industry and Web3 space was made out of necessity. We must collectively engage in a conversation with the regulators early on when the regulatory frameworks are being drafted. As a team of legal professionals who worked with crypto companies over a few bull runs already, we have the capacity to understand how certain regulations may affect Web3 developments. While we do a lot of work in writing, we continue to organise events and workshops to educate both, policymakers on one side and developers on the other.</p>\n<p><strong>What milestones have we achieved?</strong></p>\n<p>In the past, we urged the regulators to reconsider their positions and definitions. We’ve fought against harmful regulations, like banning crypto wallets or privacy protocols, equating NFTs to securities, or labelling protocols as bank accounts. Through our public policies, responses and campaigns, EUCI has explained why decentralised governance, tokens, stablecoins and other DeFi intricacies and blockchain innovative tools are detrimental to the preservation of privacy, inclusion and transparency.</p>\n<p>We’ve also collaborated with global organizations to curb impractical crypto laws because regulation can make or break an industry, and we won’t let it hinder this ecosystem. While we do much of the work in written form, we often meet with regulators and host regulatory workshops for industry stakeholders. Our workshops and events are usually free of charge and open to anyone. As public discourse is crucial, we’ve also organised several Reg3 conferences and supported Reg3 forks, taking place in other countries.</p>\n<p>See some of the highlights and milestones below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eu.ci/public-policy/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EUCI Public Policies and Responses</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://data-act.info/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Data Act Campaign led by the EUCI</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blockchain-manifesto.eu/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Publication of the Manifesto for Blockchain: Embracing its Potential in the European Union</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13757-Virtual-worlds-metaverses-a-vision-for-openness-safety-and-respect/F3411873_en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EUCI Response to the EU Commission’s Call for Evidence on Virtual Worlds</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11U2oyME5YtUCwAZatZA-agzuORO1sCgF/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Public Comment on IOSCO’s Consultation Report on Policy Recommendations for DeFi</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nVA0Yr2qLOcsAipzGgCjxSyW3h8kU-2k/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EUCI’s Response to the ACPR DeFi Discussion Paper, May 2023</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CeQwQLVGLQlLimb03MwyfCVY_0u4FO-y/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EUCI’s Response to the AMF DeFi Discussion Paper, September 2023</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OCiL8kqgNvUxr5GOysQQ8vA-Lyg0R56q/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EUCI Position Paper on MiCA &amp; Stablecoins, February 2021</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H9ksS4TUYOyGITh5QhLY5173iL7KhX_B/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EUCI’s Position on MiCA &amp; DeFi, February 2021</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reg3.eu/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Reg3 Events hosted by the EUCI (2023)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OVM_xXfrRFgmFKjKP3M7eajvg9mFHCUg/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Reg3 Lisbon, Portugal - 2022 Report</a></p>\n<p><strong>Milestones we would like to achieve</strong><br>\n2024 stands as a pivotal year marked by significant milestones. The narrative for the year and the key objectives will be deeply influenced by the application of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation that classifies and defines different tokens, the EU elections, the selection of diverse sets of regulations and position papers, and the emphasis on continuous research and knowledge sharing among the policymakers and industry stakeholders. As Brussels lies at the heart of Europe and presents the centre of European policymaking activities, we especially welcome the decision of EthCC organisers to host the event at the Square in Brussels, Belgium.</p>\n<p><strong><code>1. Regulatory overview and positioning</code></strong></p>\n<p>Each of these elements contributes to a broader strategy aimed at shaping the Web3 policy landscape in Europe and beyond. Below, we’re naming concrete milestones we wish to achieve in light of the above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>European Securities Market Agency (ESMA) has issued two more important consultation papers open to public feedback until 29th April 2024 that are linked to the implications of MiCA regulation. We aim to respond to both, and thus address the topics of (i) reverse solicitation, and (ii) how crypto-assets differ from financial instruments. We deem the first topic extremely relevant for the crypto industry as individuals often establish their entities outside Europe. The EU regulations demand them to register in Europe if they solicit (i.e. offer or market) their products and services within the EU market. We intend to gain clarity with regard to which actions may be perceived as solicitation so we understand the do’s and don’ts when crypto companies outside the EU make their products and services available to EU citizens. The second topic is very similar to the questions often raised in the USA, e.g. “Are my tokens defined as securities?”</li>\n<li>Noting that provisions of MiCA regulation concerning stablecoin issuers become applicable end of June 2024, we intend to further observe, discuss and negotiate the outcomes for stablecoin issuers within the EU. Namely, it is important to note that non-compliant stablecoin issuers may no longer be listed on exchanges operating their businesses in Europe.</li>\n<li>Our aim is to further protect and defend the interests of developers, engineers and innovators within the Web3 space. This includes many who develop with Golem and Octant smart contracts. To this end, we intend to continue our legal analysis of regulatory frameworks that impact developers’ responsibilities such as the Product Liability Directive (PLD) and the Data Act. Regarding the PLD it’s important to note that the scope of the PLD has been significantly widened, including both tangible and intangible products (e.g. software), in the definition of ‘product’. This has raised EUCI’s awareness as it comes along with the broader definition of ‘loss’ or ‘corruption of data’ in the definition of ‘damage’. Further, manufacturers are made responsible for software updates (or the lack of them) and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This is extremely important as it could also entail scoping in developers of certain “software” such as smart contracts – subjecting them to strict liability rules in case they cause harm to consumers (particularly with respect to loss or corruption of data). We will continue to organise public events and produce public written positions explaining the objectives and obligations set by the regulators, while we will discuss the challenges the Web3 community may experience if the regulators do not consider the particularities of the Web3 ecosystem when imposing such rules.</li>\n<li>Similarly to the above, we will continue our analysis and advocacy regarding the Cyber Resilience Act and Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) to ensure crypto-asset service providers and software engineers’ responsibilities are not too burdensome or unreasonable.</li>\n<li>We will also keep an eye on the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Regulation and KYC requirements as the Web3 community has been heavily impacted by the request to verify users’ identity on every single step they take. Keeping this in mind, we will continue to advocate and educate the community and policymakers about the privacy preservation tools that have been developed by the Web3 community.</li>\n<li>Lastly, we will continue to research the intersection between the Product Liability Directive and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act as well as the upcoming AI Liability Directive. This work will be important to further discuss the fault-based liability rules that may not only apply to software engineers but also to smart contract developers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Continuous Research and publications</strong></p>\n<p>The above political discourse and written positions regarding regulatory proposals will be coupled with the position or research papers we intend to write regarding the perception (and exclusion) of DeFi from regulatory scope, staking and MEV particularities and NFTs. We have formed several working groups and are discussing these topics with individuals, and domain experts, to help us craft better arguments and defend our legal stance.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Series of Events during EthCC Brussels</strong></p>\n<p>As a result of the organisational work started in late 2023, we will be organising a series of regulatory workshops and events in Brussels during the week of EthCC. The aeries will include a Summer School where we intend to train and educate legal professionals, compliance officers and students on some of the most important Web3 topics. We also intend to organise a regulatory event (<a href=\"https://www.reg3.eu/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Reg3</a>) with Impact+ where we will host meaningful panel discussions between the industry stakeholders and regulators.</p>\n<p><strong>4. EU Elections and Manifesto for Blockchain</strong></p>\n<p>As per EU elections, it is important to find new allies and approach elected politicians and officials with an agenda and constructive argumentation. We wish to make sure blockchain, crypto and Web3 are seen for what it is and stripped of all the misconceptions and wrongful narratives. Keeping this in mind, we’ve already published a <a href=\"https://blockchain-manifesto.eu/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Manifesto for Blockchain</a> with several other EU-focused advocacy groups and intend to organise online webinars and publish papers to help improve the upcoming political agenda and uphold our Web3 core values.</p>\n<p>Impact metrics and results</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://euci.notion.site/EUCI-Events-Workshops-Podcasts-Panels-7c80cb1fae4b437293db793fff48a46f?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EUCI Events, Workshops &amp; Podcasts: 61</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://euci.notion.site/EUCI-Position-Papers-4cca41f9453b492c9e87c79b68143f6d?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EUCI Position Papers: 22</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://euci.notion.site/Media-Presence-407e69c2fb984e2fbe0a049950119f44?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EUCI Media Presence: 31</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://euci.notion.site/Calls-with-National-Organisations-e277cd9fa3c548e7b06439438193bc67?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Collab with National Organisations: 21</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://euci.notion.site/Meetings-w-Policymakers-217b6cdcc466447c857f0d237e9bdf9c?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EUCI Meetings with Policymakers: 28</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://euci.notion.site/Regulatory-Oversight-010176b303634607adbe9c3993297295?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Regulatory Oversight &amp; Monitoring: 27</a></p>\n<p><strong>Our Team</strong></p>\n<p>EUCI founders have been in the Ethereum community since 2014/2015 and have all worked with local blockchain think tanks where they led the conversations between early blockchain adopters and the regulators, authorities and policymakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Marina Markezic - EUCI Co-founder and Executive Director</strong></p>\n<p>Since 2017 Marina has been working with crypto projects on governance and legal matters with a focus on decentralisation, DeFi, and NFTs.

It’s open-source, permissionless, and token-free. Learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.attest.sh/docs/purpose/eas-purpose\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">why we exist.</a></p>\n<p>Attestations are simply digital signatures on structured data. From this primitive, we can ultimately decentralize more than just money &amp; assets. We can start to build more trustful interactions online and onchain. EAS runs on two smart contracts. One for registering a schema and the other for making attestations with that schema. Additional utilities extend the functionality while making the protocol highly composable and easy to build upon.</p>\n<p>Credible neutrality is <strong>incredibly important</strong> for the success of an open standard like EAS. Imagine if email didn’t exist today and people were competing to own and monetize the protocol for emailing each other. You’d have separate protocols for Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo, and others. In this world, no one can email in a standardized way without endless integrations. Imagine… “Do you use gmail? Nope. I use Outlook. Ok I guess we’ll just have to call each other.” Or imagine having to pay <a href=\"http://email.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">email.org</a> a service fee every time you send an email. The email industry would be completely fragmented. We see the attestation ecosystem in a similar way. EAS must be a credibly neutral public good so any entity can make attestations about anything in a more structured way without competing with others at the infrastructure layer. From this infra layer, anyone can build amazing businesses on top while knowing it remains a free and open resource.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-are-your-main-project-funding-sources-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#what-are-your-main-project-funding-sources-2\"></a>What are your main project funding sources?</h1>\n<p>Grants funding</p>\n<h1><a name=\"how-much-have-you-raised-from-each-of-your-funding-sources-and-from-whom-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#how-much-have-you-raised-from-each-of-your-funding-sources-and-from-whom-3\"></a>How much have you raised from each of your funding sources and from whom?</h1>\n<p>219k OP from retropg3, $30k from Gitcoin rounds, $12k from Base.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"are-you-seeking-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#are-you-seeking-4\"></a>Are you seeking?</h1>\n<p>Funding for general operations</p>\n<h1><a name=\"has-your-project-launched-or-planning-to-launch-a-token-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#has-your-project-launched-or-planning-to-launch-a-token-5\"></a>Has your project launched or planning to launch a token?</h1>\n<p>No. Just burn more ETH.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"share-your-project-roadmap-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#share-your-project-roadmap-6\"></a>Share your project roadmap:</h1>\n<p>Our mantra is, “get builders building faster” and it’s how we prioritize where to focus.

What if we’re dealing with brand new mechanisms like online governance and Quadratic Funding? What does it mean to collude?</p>\n<p>Well, then the word becomes a negative connotation.</p>\n<p>Collusion is the evil twin of <em>coordination</em>, just like <em>manipulation</em> is the evil twin of <em>leadership</em>.</p>\n<p>If Bob is influencing people toward an outcome which is deemed self-serving, that’s manipulation. If he’s influencing people toward a group-benefiting goal, we call that leadership.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if people are working together toward a positive outcome, we say they are coordinating. But if they’re doing it toward a self-serving outcome which benefits their group at the expense of the larger group, then we call that collusion.</p>\n<p>A textbook example is when businesses collude to fix prices. A more relevant one is when money corrupts systems which aim to uphold certain values above money.</p>\n<p>For example, think of governance and justice systems. We don’t want people ‘coordinating’ to buy/sell votes, bribe judges, or pay off dirty cops. Consequently, these systems have had to find ways to discourage collusion with (often severe) penalties.</p>\n<p>But as we build out decentralized systems of governance, we are encountering very analogous threats of collusion, and yet we lack any of the tools that centralized systems have to discourage such behavior.</p>\n<p>This is a big problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Sybil Resistance vs. Collusion Resistance</strong></p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4749892\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">outstanding paper</a> perfectly demonstrates this through a real-life case study of a Proof of Personhood protocol called Idena.</p>\n<p>The founder of Idena was gracious enough to expose the shortcomings of his project so that the rest of us can learn from them, at great risk to his own reputation. I commend him for pioneering a personhood protocol – that’s really hard. And I commend him even more for shining a spotlight on it afterward. We all make mistakes and learn from them, but it’s not often that we get to learn from others’ mistakes; it’s true a gift.</p>\n<p>Idena created a personhood mechanism which made their users perform quite a bit of work to prove, and maintain, their unique personhood. But in doing so, they did solve the sybil problem. With minimal exceptions, every Idena user was a human being with only a single account.</p>\n<p>What additionally made this such a great case study is that there was a monetary incentive to try to game the system, in the form of an ongoing UBI token distribution to all account-holders. With real money on the line, we got to see what people actually did to game it.</p>\n<p>They didn’t try to get overly clever about hacking the personhood mechanism. Instead, they did something much easier – they started colluding.</p>\n<p>For example, a Russian company (‘puppeteer’) hired a bunch of workers (‘puppets’) in low-wage countries to perform the personhood ceremonies, but never gave them the private keys to their own accounts. They simply paid them some small fraction of the UBI token earnings and kept the rest for themselves.</p>\n<p>Other versions involved set-ups where the puppets technically had access to their private keys, but they didn’t possess the know-how to be able to do anything with them. In one scenario, a company hired a bunch of children in Egypt as their puppets to perform the personhood ceremonies.</p>\n<p>It’s an incredibly thought-provoking paper, both in its analysis as well as the discussion; would highly recommend it.</p>\n<p>The main takeaway, if I had to choose one, is that sybil-resistance and collusion-resistance are really two sides of the same coin. If you incentivize sybil attacks, but you only solve for personhood, people will simply start colluding via some form of puppeteering, targeting low-wage and low-info humans and acting as the middle-man that takes a giant chunk of the money or power or whatever is up for grabs.</p>\n<p>So as we think about sybil resistance, we must simultaneously solve for collusion resistance; it’s pretty clear what will happen otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Can’t We Just Math Our Way Out of This?</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, so can we use clever math and analysis to detect collusion based on people’s behavior?</p>\n<p>Short answer is, not really. Because if the colluding takes place off-chain, how can we ever detect it?</p>\n<p>The best we can do is mathematically guess whether people are colluding or not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4311507\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Various mechanisms</a> have been proposed to use correlations of people’s votes (or contributions in the case of Quadratic Funding) to probabilistically derive collusion. But the problem is that not only is the on-chain data very limited, but fundamentally correlation does not prove collusion (any more than correlation proves causation).</p>\n<p>Let’s take a simple example.</p>\n<p>Every day, Bob, Alice and Sarah vote on what to have for lunch.</p>\n<p>Their choices are:</p>\n<p>a)\tPizza-to-the-Moon (Italian Restaurant),<br>\nb)\tCheddar Jack (Burger Joint), and<br>\nc)\tTokyo Palace (Sushi place).</p>\n<p>Over time, we notice that Bob and Alice seem to vote for Pizza-to-the-Moon quite often, and many times they are correlated in their votes, while Sarah seems to be about evenly split over time.</p>\n<p>And suppose we also know some information about Bob and Alice’s social ties, that they know each other and have a lot of friends in common, while Sarah is more removed from both of them on the social graph.</p>\n<p>Mathematically, given this data set, the anti-collusion mechanisms would discount Bob’s and Alice’s votes on the grounds that they are likely colluding, because either:</p>\n<p>a)\tTheir votes are highly correlated over time, and/or<br>\nb)\tThey belong in similar social circles, so they are more likely to talk and collude</p>\n<p>And it might very well be the case that collusion is happening, or maybe not. Consider two sets of scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenarios of set A:</strong></p>\n<p>Bob might be bribing Alice to vote a certain way, or vice versa. Or maybe Pizza-to-the-Moon is bribing one or both of them. Or instead of money, there might be social pressure exerted, or favors exchanged, and so on. It gets very messy and blurry, very quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenarios of set B:</strong></p>\n<p>On the other hand, it might also be the case that Pizza-to-the-Moon just makes really good food, and the other two restaurants make crappy food. And Sarah happens to not care much about the taste of food, she only cares about the ambiance, and all three restaurants have equally satisfying ambiance. Or maybe Bob and Alice just like Italian food more than American or Japanese food, while Sarah likes them all about the same.</p>\n<p>In both sets of scenarios (set A or set B), the data inputs into the algorithm would be the same, so there is no amount of math that can be done to derive whether collusion is truly happening.</p>\n<p>Either you run an anti-collusion algorithm and you risk having everyone eating where they don’t actually want to eat, or you don’t run the algorithm and you risk rewarding collusion.</p>\n<p>But what if the algorithm had access to all the real-world data and it could understand the context fully and assess every situation uniquely, and all that data was obtained and updated at a relatively low cost, and kept in an extremely privacy-preserving manner?</p>\n<p>Well, good luck with that. I’d say it’s not exactly a pizza on the moon, but at it’s at least a pie in the sky.</p>\n<p><strong>What Can We Do?</strong></p>\n<p>I’d like to propose an alternate path.</p>\n<p>Let’s build out reputation systems which are <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Soulbound</a>, and which empower people in communities to hold one another accountable to behave in an honest and sincere manner, whether they are voting, contributing to a Quadratic Funding round, or engaging in token-earning activities.</p>\n<p>We don’t need to re-invent human social coordination and put it all on the blockchain. Powerful incentives like social status, fear of exclusion, social pressure, and so on, already exist. Let’s subsume these off-chain dynamics which evolved over the millennia and extend them to give ourselves more powerful and precise tools toward even better social coordination.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, we need to not only have a way to represent unique personhood, but also a way to replicate within the digital space how we actually relate to one another: we form groups, and families and mini tribes, and clubs, and meetups, and squads, and a million other things. And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGzbqyinx4c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">we connect <em>with</em> and <em>through</em> those <strong>communities</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>And it’s within the context of those communities that we have our relationships, and hold ourselves, and each other, to a higher standard. It’s where we form unwritten rules and norms and culture. It’s where we actively choose not to collude, because we value our reputation and our belonging to communities higher than the short-term monetary gain from gaming the system. Our social bonds mean everything to us, and our reputation is the glue that holds those bonds together.</p>\n<p>Reputation holds so much more real-world data and context than we can hope to upload into a bunch of databases or blocks. It is the aggregation of all our social behavior, and from many disparate points of view. In other words, the best oracles for detecting collusion are <em>other humans.</em></p>\n<p>A properly designed system that can accurately represent communities, community membership, and our reputations with one another, in a decentralized, permissionless and privacy-preserving way, would elegantly address the problem of collusion, along with many other problems, while also opening the door to many new possibilities.</p>\n<p>To illustrate, imagine something like an ‘Independence Score’ which everyone assigns to one another, denoting how likely that person is to not collude. This score could increase over time, so someone who has participated in 10 rounds and continues to receive a high score from everyone gets a higher total score than someone who is doing their first round. If you collude with someone, they are incentivized to give you a high score for the round you are colluding on, but then they are incentivized to change it to a low score afterward (as you might be colluding against them next time). After multiple rounds, the low scores will stack up. All the scores are normalized at the end so that everyone has an equal vote, and then QV is applied.</p>\n<p>This is just a rough example, and can be improved in many ways.</p>\n<p>We are currently building <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wpnZi6xhlvDQMazWD4nVzGufzB5LgFQDsl_30b3vl9k/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Community Graphs</a>, which will be fully open, decentralized infrastructure that will allow for the experimentation of many different types of reputation, attestation, and voting mechanisms. And these will all be stackable and composable, so that combining multiple identity or reputation systems might offer an even stronger signal than any one of them on their own.</p>\n<p>To plagiarize David from Bankless, it’ll be Legos. But instead of Money Legos, it’ll be Social Coordination Legos.</p>\n<p>I’m confident that a solution exists somewhere in this space of possibilities, while I have little idea what will ultimately be the most optimal mechanism(s). We should try and play around with as many as possible so that we learn what works well under which circumstances.</p>\n<p>We should also expect to encounter new obstacles and unintended consequences along the way, so it’s important to always test new ideas in smaller, low-stakes environments before scaling anything out.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, I’m super excited to explore this space, and welcome anyone interested to join us on the journey.</p>\n<p>We’ll be submitting Community Graphs as a project in this funding round. Whether accepted or not, would love to offer what we’re building (once it’s ready) as a tool to Octant in order to provide sybil and collusion resistance in future rounds.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/sybil-and-collusion-resistance-via-community-graphs/249\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/sybil-and-collusion-resistance-via-community-graphs/249","pubDate":"Wed, 13 Mar 2024 19:53:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-249"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/sybil-and-collusion-resistance-via-community-graphs/249.rss","#text":"Sybil and Collusion Resistance via Community Graphs"}},{"title":"🥧 growthepie: Metrics and usage data for Ethereum scaling solutions and their projects","dc:creator":"tobsch","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<p><strong>Describe your project and why you classify it as a Public Good</strong></p>\n<p>We are a public goods data platform designed specifically for Ethereum scaling solutions to analyze fundamentals as well as more detailed blockspace usage with a curated set of categories. Our goal is to empower developers and users alike by providing them with a comprehensive overview of fundamental metrics, onchain data, and educational resources, to help them make informed decisions when selecting their chain to build and interact on. We believe that real-world impact can only be achieved when people can select and use projects that fulfill their actual needs and when they know what’s out there. We achieve this through better transparency and overview of what’s happening in the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The platform is and will stay free to use forever. We do not have any VC funding or angel investment, nor do we have any subscription fee to access more data by individual users. All data can be seen and used (also via our API) free of charge.

We received the first tranche of the Ethereum Foundation grant in February 2023, and launched the first version of our platform end of May 2023. The following has been achieved since then:</p>\n<p><strong>Fundamental Metrics Chain Comparisons</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, we provide a curated and easy-to-understand set of metrics for Layer 2s, focusing on 14 chains: Arbitrum One, Base, OP Mainnet, Immutable X, Linea, Loopring, Mantle, Polygon zkEVM, Public Goods Network, <a href=\"http://Rhino.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Rhino.fi</a>, Scroll, Starknet, zkSync Era and ZORA. All data has been pulled via RPC, some has been received from data providers or is linked to other sources. However, we are changing more and more to connecting our own RPC for better data quality and reliability.</p>\n<p>We have 4 main categories that allow you to analyze the following fundamental metrics:</p>\n<p>Activity</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Daily Active Addresses: The number of unique daily addresses that interacted with a chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transaction Count: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts, excluding system transactions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Value Locked</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Stablecoin Market Cap: The sum of stablecoins that are locked on the chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Total Value Locked: The sum of all funds locked on the chain.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Economics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fees Paid by Users: The sum of fees that were paid by users of the chain in gas fees or, in the case of chains like Immutable X, the amount of fees that were paid to the protocol wallet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rent Paid to L1: The gas fees paid by L2s to post transaction data &amp; verification states onto Ethereum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Onchain Profit: The net profit of L2s, accounting for revenues as L2 gas fees collected and expenses as posting transaction data &amp; verification states onto Ethereum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fully Diluted Valuation: The theoretical market cap of a token if all its planned tokens (total supply) were issued at the current price.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Market Cap: The total value of all circulating tokens, calculated by multiplying the current price of a single token by the total number of tokens in circulation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Convenience</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transaction Costs: The median amount that is paid per transaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Blockspace Explorer</p>\n<p>With one rollup launching after the other, it is hard for users to understand what’s going on in the Ethereum ecosystem. Helping to analyze blockspace changes this trajectory.</p>\n<p>Our platform offers the following to Ethereum’s ecosystem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An overview of chains’ high-level blockspace usage. All expressed in shares of a chain’s total blockspace. In simple words: For which purpose are these Layers 2s built and what do people do with them?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A comparison for available Layer 2s for their usage in specific categories, ranging from NFT, Token Transfers to Socials applications. For each of these and more categories, we have a set of subcategories that allow you to filter in more detail and compare which category is more used on which chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For each category/subcategory, users can see the most-used smart contracts ranked in a table and make sense of how the chain is being used</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Open Labels Initiative (OLI)</p>\n<p>In order to ensure that people can make sense of all these Ethereum scaling solutions, we need to label smart contracts, i.e. projects that launch on the respective Layer 2s or Layer 3s. Currently, we label smart contracts ourselves. This is a huge effort, as every smart contract that is deployed needs to be researched, labeled, and verified. For this reason, we are building the Open Labels Initiative as one of the founding members, together with other contributors. This initiative aims to tackle the issue of isolated and non-standardized contract and wallet labeling datasets within the blockchain data community. By introducing a standardized data model for smart contract and wallet labels we advocate for the consolidation into a single, universally accessible data structure utilized by various data providers. Additionally, we also aim to function as an aggregator for labeling tools (i.e. automated ERC detection, activity tagging, etc.)</p>\n<p>Smart Contract Label Suggestions</p>\n<p>As a user of our platform, you can already participate! Suggest smart contract labels and become an essential part of the pie. We will work on this feature to enable more community-based and open-source smart contract labeling.</p>\n<p>Single Chain Metrics All-in-One</p>\n<p>You can compare chains amongst each other with all the metrics mentioned. Additionally, you have chain-specific pages that allow you to have a glance at all metrics for a chain at once.</p>\n<p>Retroactive Public Goods Fund Tracker</p>\n<p>In addition to aggregating data and providing fundamental metrics, we tracked projects and their impact for Optimism’s RPGF round 3. This was the start of tracking impact for projects and providing transparency and overview of their achievements and previous funding.</p>\n<p>Tell us more about milestones you’d like to achieve</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Application-specific analytics: We want to go one level deeper and enable users to analyze individual projects (labeled smart contracts) in much more detail, for example their traction on different Layer 2s, fees of using them on either, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More detailed transaction fees page: We are building on our most popular metric, and enhancing the data and transparency for our users by providing more detailed fees for transacting on the listed Layer 2s</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More convenient analytics and sharing features: We continue to improve the UX to enable better analytics of metrics and chains, comparisons and also sharing of charts and tables for your own usage</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enhancing data with knowledge snippets: Tied with our metrics, we provide content for both developers and consumers to understand data and their specific use cases more. Also, what each of the events readable from data means for a specific Layer 2 and what this means compared to other L2 chains. Additional educational content for each metric brings data-based decision-making closer to each end-user/developer/investor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Development of more impact trackers: We are working on enhancing our RPGF3 Tracker, and enable the same and better information overview for other impact projects. This development is in the early stages but fits our goal to provide better metrics and usability around data, as a public goods funded project.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cross-reference applications/projects with their impact and funding: Since we are a public good and have lots of valuable data on projects (see goal above in this list), we aim to provide more visualizations and trackers on projects and their impact on users and the ecosystem in general. This can include OP RPGF, Gitcoin, Octant and other platforms providing data for us to visualize</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Addition of more current and upcoming chains in the Ethereum ecosystem, more specifically Metis, Manta, Blast and Mode</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changing and maintaining infrastructure, adapting our Blockspace Explorer to OLI’s data standard once the first version is defined</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Funding Goal and Budget</strong></p>\n<p>USD 65k, mostly to be spent on team (for design, development, and maintenance), infrastructure, and marketing/BD efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us more about your team</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Matthias: Started to work in the blockchain/EVM space 6 years ago with his master thesis on the “Implementation of blockchain-based local energy markets”.

With between 1.5 to 1.8 million downloads per month, Web3.js stands as one of the most significant libraries within the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The recent release of Web3.js version 4 introduces the inclusion of plugins. These allow for the extension of the web3.js library’s functionality, providing developers with enhanced capabilities, flexibility and an overall improvement in developer experience. A list of plugins can be found here: <a href=\"https://web3js.org/plugins\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://web3js.org/plugins</a></p>\n<p>How much have you raised from each of your funding sources and from who?</p>\n<p>ChainSafe has been operational since 2017 and has conducted several fundraising events since its inception. The company currently employs 130 people worldwide, resulting in significantly high operating costs. The most recent fundraising round, conducted in late 2022, raised $18.75 million USD. These funds are allocated across various verticals, including protocol development, developer tooling, product development, sales, communications, and marketing, among others. This capital is dedicated to general operating expenses, rather than the funding of public goods developed by ChainSafe, which are supported through grant funding. Recent grants for the development of web3.js version 4 include:</p>\n<p><strong>Period: January 2023 - March 2024</strong><br>\nOptimism Retro PGF: 248,448.21 OP<br>\nEthereum Foundation: $451,782 USD</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, despite appearances, web3.js is not as well-funded as it may seem. ChainSafe has had to continually reassess the viability of ongoing development and maintenance of web3.js due to gradually decreasing support from the Ethereum Foundation. It has been made clear to us that as the EF continues to make every effort to decentralize itself, grant funding toward web3.js shall also decline. This has forced us to seek alternative funding sources in order to continue improving and maintaining the library. ChainSafe’s commercial goals for Web3.js do not include profit, rather, to cover the costs associated with maintaining it as well as remaining a compelling option in comparison to various other libraries that are available to developers.</p>\n<p>All of the aforementioned funding has been allocated solely to employee salaries and overhead operating costs. It does not cover product management, product discovery, or any engineering work related to the architecture, planning, and the development of plugins.</p>\n<p>For this grant application, ChainSafe seeks additional funding specifically for the portions currently subsidized by ChainSafe, as detailed below:</p>\n<p>Product Discovery (web3.js plugins)<br>\nEngineering (web3.js plugins)</p>\n<p><strong>What milestones have you achieved?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Released web3.js version 4 that included many major new features such as:</li>\n<li>Easy extensibility ( using web3.js Plugins feature )</li>\n<li>Dynamic Contract Typing</li>\n<li>Native typescript</li>\n<li>ESM CJS native builds</li>\n<li>90%+ test coverage</li>\n<li>Custom data formatting feature</li>\n<li>Reduced package size</li>\n<li>New packages ( web3-types, web3-errors, web3-validator, web3-rpc-methods )</li>\n<li>Validation functionality using schema</li>\n<li>User friendly documentation ( API docs, Guides, Tutorials )</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Achieved Growth in the Plugins Ecosystem</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>There are now 12+ Web3.js plugins supporting L1, L2 infrastructure, DApps and other EVM based chains as well (Chainlink, EIP4337, ZkSync, Optimism, Near Protocol, Aurora, SuperFluid, Swisstronik, complete list found here: <a href=\"https://web3js.org/plugins\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://web3js.org/plugins</a> )</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Supporting New Developers</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Released video tutorials and an online course as well as various hackathons for plugins and workshops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Share your project roadmap:</strong></p>\n<p>The roadmap of web3.js library includes attracting and facilitating new developers in the EVM based decentralized infrastructure space for building tools and apps, boosting community support and engagement, fostering the growth of the web3.js plugin ecosystem, enhancing contributors experience, and maintaining &amp; extending the existing feature set of Web3.js.

It is the first blockchain protocol that proposes a mechanism to create effective feedback loops for both public goods and negative externalities, and a way to fund any common or public good self-sustainably (without the need for external funding sources)</p>\n<p>Our vision is an economy where any person or community can simply focus on creating impact and be rewarded based on the impact they create, where impact equals profit - an Abundance Economy.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"problem-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#problem-2\"></a>Problem</h1>\n<p>If we look at current public goods funding mechanisms, the one that stands out the most is the consensus mechanism. While other crypto mechanisms rely on external funding and provide tens or hundreds of millions in funding to public goods, consensus mechanisms have provided over a trillion dollars in rewards for the common good of network security, and have done so self-sustainably (without the need for external funding).</p>\n<p>Yet, consensus mechanisms only work for one specific common good. If we wanted to generalize this capability to other common and public goods we’d need an effective way to both gather the data on the impact of the goods, and a way for a community to come to consensus on what it values - without such consensus no amount of data would be sufficient to determine how much public goods contributors should be rewarded for their work.</p>\n<p>On top of that the process would need to be credible; preventing sybil attacks and collusion, credible impact valuation, and maintaining stable currency value among others.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"solution-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#solution-3\"></a>Solution</h1>\n<p>Abundance Protocol introduces the concept of Value Consensus: the idea is to align the economic incentives of all participants in an ecosystem such that valuing (and rewarding) public goods fairly and accurately would be in the economic self-interest of every participant.</p>\n<p>Participants in any Abundance Ecosystem want to maximize their economic opportunity while maintaining the value of their tokens. Overvaluing public goods leads to devaluation of the currency, while undervaluing public goods leads to fewer public goods contributors in the future, and thus slower economic for the ecosystem. The dynamic equilibrium for any ecosystem is therefore where public goods are fairly evaluated based on their impact. This concept aligns the interests of all participants in the ecosystem and allows self-sustainable funding of public goods where the currency value is maintained.</p>\n<p>The protocol integrates a consensus mechanism, a prediction market and a retroactive funding mechanism (in additional to multiple mechanisms to prevent sybil attacks, collusion, etc.) which would create a cryptoeconomic model where public goods funding can be self-sustainable and credible (see <a href=\"https://whitepaper.abundance.id\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Whitepaper</a> or check <a href=\"https://youtu.be/h9bnFS1PKX0?si=yu-XnEZu7PDWh-HT\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EthDenver presentation</a>)</p>\n<p>Abundance Protocol’s approach is then to integrate this mechanism within a decentralized social media platform. Such integration would allow users to seamlessly participate in the process, get rich data on the interests of their community, and the impact that public goods projects create, and eventually allow anyone make a living simply by creating impact for their community and the broader world.</p>\n<p>The app could allow, for example, Octant community members to get a sense of what the community is interested in, and then would allow anyone create public goods for the benefit of the community and be rewarded through the protocol.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/original/1X/c0c38da89e7a010dbd38f039769143dd93f61053.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/rvgE183M0S2kCdM3BDcmwX2Zlh9.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Impact App\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/c0c38da89e7a010dbd38f039769143dd93f61053_2_517x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Impact App\" data-base62-sha1=\"rvgE183M0S2kCdM3BDcmwX2Zlh9\" width=\"517\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/c0c38da89e7a010dbd38f039769143dd93f61053_2_517x307.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/c0c38da89e7a010dbd38f039769143dd93f61053_2_775x460.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/c0c38da89e7a010dbd38f039769143dd93f61053_2_1034x614.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0EBE9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"milestones-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#milestones-4\"></a>Milestones</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed research on and released a whitepaper outlining the Proof-of-Impact value consensus mechanism (<a href=\"https://whitepaper.abundance.id\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://whitepaper.abundance.id</a>)</li>\n<li>Released <a href=\"https://book.abundance.id\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Abundance Economy</a> book, describing the public goods (and negative externalities) problem space and its challenges, and how blockchain technology can address these (available for free at <a href=\"https://book.abundance.id\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://book.abundance.id</a>)</li>\n<li>Ongoing work on developing the onchain dataflow for the protocol</li>\n<li>Initial work on user app</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"project-roadmap-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#project-roadmap-5\"></a>Project roadmap</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Impact app development</li>\n<li>Development of onchain dataflow</li>\n<li>Development of smart contracts for protocol</li>\n<li>Integration of onchain contracts with user app</li>\n<li>Testnet version of app/protocol</li>\n<li>Audit of smart contracts</li>\n<li>Initial mainnet version app/protocol</li>\n<li>Launch protocol on mainnet</li>\n<li>Progressive iteration on the user app and protocol</li>\n<li>Multichain integration for protocol</li>\n<li>Progressive integration of AI into protocol</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"funding-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#funding-6\"></a>Funding</h1>\n<p>Received $5,000 grant from Polygon.
