What we learned is that the retail side is very difficult to compete in without a restaking / airdrop angle, which is something we need to address. In contrast, the business side is showing huge promise thanks to the unique proposition of StakeWise V3.</p>\n<p>The Vaults architecture is rated very highly by the leading operators in the space, who are starting to offer Vaults as a bundled package (Vault + operator nodes) in the new deals they pursue. They are also speaking to their existing clients about the opportunity to use Vaults for streamlining the staking UX and accessing liquidity on demand.</p>\n<p>B2B cycles take months to complete, and with StakeWise V3 approaching 6 months since launch, the fruits of this side of the business are starting to show. The best thing about the B2B business is that TVL through these channels is of the highest quality and most sticky - far more valuable than mercenary capital attracted through airdrop campaigns. In short, it’s a slow process, but it is bound to be a fruitful one when it is completed.</p>\n<p>This got us thinking: instead of focusing a potential incentives program on retail users, why don’t we find a way to make StakeWise V3 even more attractive to prospective business clients?</p>\n<p>If StakeWise could accelerate its own and its partners’ sales effort by understanding clients’ migration pains, and made it a priority to solve them, it could bring significant new inflows into the protocol and further validate the strength of our Vaults architecture.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what the StakeWise Incentivized Migration Program is about: its goal is to make it easier for both our partners and their clients to initiate staking through Vaults, or migrate to Vaults, in order to access new features we unlock for them and grow StakeWise TVL in the process. It also lets operators benefit from the success of this endeavor, and incentivizes them to sell Vaults more aggressively to new prospects.</p>\n<p>In practice, we propose that the Incentivized Migration Program does three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>compensate any migrating clients for the ETH rewards they lose during validator exits and re-registration,</li>\n<li>cover the costs of setting up new validators for the operator, and</li>\n<li>issue a $SWISE bonus (vested) to the operator for every migrated / new ETH stake in Vaults.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given our Treasury’s size and the expected cost of the migration process, this initiative has the capacity to bring up to 2M ETH into StakeWise Vaults by using up to 50M SWISE and 1,000 ETH. Should we reach this capacity, we will have put our Treasury to a very good use and significantly changed the market dynamics in our favour. See the details of the proposed program in the Implementation section below.</p>\n<p>We initiated conversations with our partners about this very program in early April, and are now starting to see the first successful responses from clients. This actually prompted us to propose the program sooner, because we would like to have full certainty that the StakeWise DAO is on board with the program before more capital is committed.</p>\n<p>To conclude, we believe that the StakeWise Incentivized Migration Program would allow us to accelerate the B2B efforts of our team and our partners, attract significant TVL, and make sure that our Treasury funds are put to good use. We now seek your support in making this program official.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#implementation-3\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<p>New Clients - StakeWise to reward partner operators with 25 SWISE for each ETH staked, up to a total of 1M ETH[1].</p>\n<p>Existing Clients - StakeWise to cover the lost yield associated with the migration of 1M ETH[2], provide a 25 SWISE bonus to operators for each ETH staked, and cover the gas costs associated with spinning up new validators[3] for existing clients[4].</p>\n<p>At current market prices, the max possible SWISE bonus for an operator over both the New and Existing Client programs is $2,000,000 paid in SWISE[5] for a total of 2M ETH staked.</p>\n<p>Client reimbursements would be paid in ETH directly into client Vaults by passing the client’s address as the receiver parameter via the deposit function (<a href=\"https://docs.stakewise.io/for-developers/stake#depositing\">see documents</a> for more information). A single payment would be made by StakeWise on behalf of each client, with payments made at the end of each week.</p>\n<p>ETH payments to operators would be made every 3 months to cover validator registration gas costs[3].</p>\n<p>A vesting contract would be deployed by the StakeWise team every 3 months on behalf of operators for the total amount of $SWISE earned over the previous 3 months. This SWISE would be linearly vested for 3 months.</p>\n<p>The team will periodically request ETH and SWISE from the DAO Treasury to process the payments.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"terms-and-conditions-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#terms-and-conditions-4\"></a>Terms and Conditions</h1>\n<p>[1] The new client bonus is strictly for new clients of both the operator and StakeWise.</p>\n<p>[2] Each successful deposit will receive ~10 days worth of staking yield assuming an APY of 3.5%, paid in ETH to the client’s Vault (i.e. 0.001 ETH per 1 ETH staked).</p>\n<p>[3] The exact gas fees associated with validator registrations for all eligible deposits will be returned to the operator at the end of the program. Note, a maximum of 0.008 ETH will be paid per validator registration (representing the expected cost at 30 GWEI base fee).</p>\n<p>[4] The ETH yield reimbursement and the validator gas cost reimbursement is strictly for existing clients of the operator that migrate to StakeWise. The operator must provide the old validator IDs for these existing clients.</p>\n<p>[5] All operator Vaults are eligible. StakeWise reserves the right to cancel SWISE vesting contracts should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A client be identified as exploiting the program (e.g. looping staked capital via liquidity pools using the operator’s referral address), or</li>\n<li>Should mass unstaking of the operator’s client capital occur, defined as &gt;50% of capital staked through the program being unstaked within 6 months.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Should vesting contracts be canceled, all previously vested SWISE will remain in control of the operator with unvested SWISE returning to StakeWise DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#considerations-5\"></a>Considerations</h2>\n<p>While the capacity of this program stands at a whopping 2M ETH, realistically we expect fewer inflows within the program. We propose that the StakeWise DAO keep the right to end the program at any time upon community discretion, in order to put the remaining Treasury funds to another use should the opportunity present itself.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"discussion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#discussion-6\"></a>Discussion</h2>\n<p>We invite all StakeWise DAO members to comment on this proposal as it represents a potentially significant growth opportunity for the protocol and requests a potentially significant amount of DAO funds.</p>\n<p>We hope to wrap up the discussion in 7 days, so let’s hear everyone’s opinions and collectively figure out if this is the right path for the StakeWise DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/accelerate-b2b-business-via-stakewise-incentivized-migration-program/1585\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/accelerate-b2b-business-via-stakewise-incentivized-migration-program/1585","pubDate":"Thu, 25 Apr 2024 18:50:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.stakewise.io-topic-1585"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/accelerate-b2b-business-via-stakewise-incentivized-migration-program/1585.rss","#text":"Accelerate B2B Business Via StakeWise Incentivized Migration Program"}},{"title":"Match $ARB incentives with $SWISE for the upcoming osETH deployment on Arbitrum","dc:creator":"kiriyha","category":"Proposals","description":"<h2><a name=\"executive-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#executive-summary-1\"></a>Executive summary</h2>\n<p>In this proposal, we suggest that StakeWise DAO commits to incentivizing liquidity for osETH on Arbitrum from August 2024 until May 2025 in order to receive the 300K $ARB grant, and matches the dollar value of incentives provided by the Arbitrum Foundation (~$350,000) over this time period.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Anyone who has ever interacted with DeFi apps on Ethereum mainnet  knows the bitter feeling of paying upwards of $100 to enter or exit a farm, thinking “is this really the future of finance?”, and calculating the yield that was lost to high fees.</p>\n<p>The experience ranges from just acceptable to utterly poor.

At the current SWISE price, this means ca 11,500,000 extra SWISE emitted over the 9-month period.</p>\n<p>The decision on the commitment for this amount of incentives is solely in the hands of the StakeWise DAO.</p>\n<p>Given the additional incentives contributed by the Arbitrum Foundation, and the growth prospects unlocked by an aggressive osETH expansion to Arbitrum, the team believes that matching the incentives would be the right move.</p>\n<p>The deployment and the grant provide StakeWise with a new growth impulse, and an extra 3 months for restoring momentum and helping reduce the incentives burden on the SWISE token. Without the grant, StakeWise would need to pursue expansion to Arbitrum with its own efforts, which is likely to be significantly more costly.</p>\n<p>In light of these considerations, we believe that accepting the grant and matching the incentives is a great way to get osETH started on Arbitrum, and urge DAO members to vote in favour of the proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#implementation-3\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<p>At this time, no technical implementation is necessary.

Ok having deep liquidity is important but that doesnt fuel the growth of the protocol effectively in its current form.</p>\n<p>This is what im thinking:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Incentivize Vault Operators</strong></p>\n<p>So instead of incentivizing user deposits we should give incentivizes for vault operators, where they receive SWISE rewards for increasing their TVL in their individuals Vaults.</p>\n<p>You want to make them ambassadors of your protocols and have them try the hardest to increase their own vaults TVL.</p>\n<p>Any other incentives will likely just get farmed and dumped. (Vault operators are alinged and might not dump as much as mercenary yield farmers)</p>\n<p>This incentivization does not need be build in a complex smart contract way, a simple frontend in a leaderboard style design which tracks the $$$ increase for each vault, and show that lets stay 10k$ USD of rewards per Week up for grabs and to be distributed to the top 10 vault operators.

StakeWise DAO will continue to pursue a listing for osETH on leading lending markets like Aave and Compound, however the ability to unlock such an important use-case for osETH ahead of these integrations cannot be understated.</p>\n<p>The StakeWise team has been in discussions with various Risk Advisors on Morpho Blue to ensure that any osETH-ETH lending market is included into their Vaults, acting as a central distribution channel of capital and ensuring the osETH market gains traction. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Re7Capital\">Re7 Capital</a> will be creating a Vault to target LSTs that are not currently adopted by major lending protocols. They have outlined their vision on the <a href=\"https://forum.morpho.org/t/re7-labs-lst-backed-eth-metamorpho-vault-whitelisting/427\">Morpho forums</a> and have committed to include osETH as part of their Vault launch in the coming weeks. This will best position the osETH market to receive capital and ensure any incentives used to boot-strap it are put to good use.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"why-incentivise-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#why-incentivise-3\"></a>Why Incentivise?</h2>\n<p>Without ETH supplied to the osETH-ETH market, there will be no capital for osETH holders to borrow against. Just like with Aave and Compound during their initial launch, Morpho requires the incentivization of the supply side across these various markets to bootstrap the ecosystem. Once there is a healthy supply and borrow across a market, they become self-sustainable and are no longer in need of incentives. Lido launched their stETH-ETH market earlier this month and have committed over $300k of incentives over the next 3 months to help bootstrap the stETH market.</p>\n<p>We have worked closely with the Morpho team and various Risk Advisors to design an optimal bootstrapping campaign, with the aim to distribute $45k over a 3-month period to kickstart the osETH-ETH market. That equates to a total of 900k SWISE, or 300k per month. For context, the DAO currently spends around 600k SWISE per month to incentivize the SWISE-ETH liquidity pool. The DAO is responsible for the liquidity and integrations of osETH, and as such, the DAO should view this cost as analogous to the liquidity incentives it pays. These incentives will be deployed by the Morpho team as described <a href=\"https://forum.morpho.org/t/standardized-method-for-distributing-incentives-on-morpho-blue-markets/412\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Morpho are ‘matching’ incentives with their upcoming token, $MORPHO.

Motivation:</strong></p>\n<p>I believe StakeWise DAO is very serious about its Governance Process and involving community in making key decisions as evidently by the amount of work to do it.</p>\n<p>I’m a co-founder of Syncvote. I believe our tool can add tangible value to the implementation of StakeWise DAO’s governance process without any changes to the current setup. The goal is to let admins and members focus on making decisions instead of getting lost in tech stuff.</p>\n<p>I previously raised a discussion on the forum (here: <a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/automated-workflow-for-stakewise/1259\">Automated workflow for StakeWise Dao</a>) and upgraded our products continuously during the discussion, so I decided to start this thread to make a better presentation on how StakeWise DAO can benefit from Syncvote. If this is something interesting, I would like to take this to the next phase.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Problem Now:</strong></p>\n<p>I see 3 existing problems in implementing StakeWise DAO governance process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The proposer must remember all the technical details of the governance process to avoid making miStakeWises.</li>\n<li>The proposer has to bounce around different platforms, such as StakeWise, for each step of the process.</li>\n<li>Any solution that could potentially consolidate everything into one platform for consistency and ease of navigation would require the DAO to abandon its current setup and adopt a new one.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3. How We Solve It:</strong></p>\n<p>Syncvote provides a chrome extension. It works as a unified front-end for any DAO member that wants to make a proposal to StakeWise DAO. It acts like a central hub, no more bouncing between different platforms. Members can kick off and handle proposals, watch progress, and move through stages – all in one interface.</p>\n<p>Why Syncvote will fit nicely into the current StakeWise DAO practice:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Non-invasive, there isn’t any new platform to familiarize with, just open the extension and click “start new proposal” to start.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The extension works with all the platforms DAO has been using, so you don’t need to make any changes to your current setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s free, our goal is to eventually put every DAO to operate completely on-chain, so until StakeWise DAO decides to write data on-chain; it won’t cost you anything.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My cofounder’s created this video to illustrate how the plugin works for a DAO: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/5f18dbdaa1a942298a24d1a82fa738a8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Syncvote Demo</a></p>\n<p><strong>4. Next Steps to Implement:</strong></p>\n<p>To implement this transformative solution for StakeWise DAO, we propose the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After the proposal has been passed, I will convert the StakeWise Governance Process into a format compatible with Syncvote. An administrator/coreteam member can help me to follow-up and also check its accuracy.</li>\n<li>After that, StakeWise DAO will start announcing to community members on forum, announcement channels on discord and twitter etc., that they can start using Syncvote extension to make new proposals from then on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion, I see this as a straightforward implementation that helps to smooth governance experience for StakeWise DAO community members. I would be grateful if StakeWise DAO adopts Syncvote.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading my post.

It will also keep the distribution of rewards in V2 intact to allow users to migrate at their own pace.</p>\n<h1>\n<a name=\"stakewise-v3-upgrade-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#stakewise-v3-upgrade-2\"></a>StakeWise V3 upgrade</h1>\n<p>As it stands, the StakeWise team is ready to release the successor to StakeWise V2 called StakeWise V3.</p>\n<p>It’s a liquid staking protocol that features a brand new architecture, which has been praised for its versatility and potential to uphold the status quo in the staking market. It introduces an overcollateralized LST called osETH, and a staking marketplace where stakers can choose who runs their nodes and operators can join without permission to attract deposits and stake their own capital. It is a significant upgrade for the existing product of the StakeWise DAO, and an important step for the continued growth of the protocol.</p>\n<p>With the release of StakeWise V3, existing stakers will not become users of the new protocol automatically. Instead, they will continue as users of the existing version (StakeWise V2), unless they manually migrate their stake to StakeWise V3. Once they migrate, they will become a part of the Genesis Vault, which is identical to the former StakeWise Pool in terms of the fees, operators and performance. For the full details of the migration, take a look at this updated <a href=\"https://stakewise.medium.com/transitioning-to-stakewise-v3-the-migration-plan-f44d7602e955\">blogpost</a>.</p>\n<p>Executing the migration this way requires the StakeWise DAO to approve upgrades to the existing smart contracts and pause some others. In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transfer PoolEscrow ownership to EthGenesisVault. PoolEscrow is currently used as the withdrawal address for StakeWise V2, and will collect ETH from the exited validators. This ownership transfer will allow the Genesis Vault to request ETH from PoolEscrow whenever users desire to unstake ETH or redeem osETH.</li>\n<li>Upgrade V2 contracts: Oracles, Pool, RewardEthToken, StakedEthToken. The upgrades will allow sETH2 and rETH2 tokens to be burned, and let the new set of oracles control the update of rewards for those who continue to use StakeWise V2.</li>\n<li>Pause V2 contracts: PoolValidators, Pool. This will implement a freeze on new deposits into StakeWise V2, for obvious reasons.</li>\n<li>Move V2 contracts and product to a new domain name: <a href=\"http://v2.stakewise.io\">v2.stakewise.io</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>\n<a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>See the transactions in the Snapshot below.</p>\n<h1>\n<a name=\"considerations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#considerations-4\"></a>Considerations</h1>\n<p>Once the DAO votes on this proposal, we will collectively open the new chapter for StakeWise and, hopefully, staking on Ethereum more broadly.</p>\n<p>The proposed migration path has been audited by Sigma Prime, Halborn, and the auditors in the Hats contest.

Oracles are a crucial part of the protocol, and must remain sufficiently decentralized and maintain high uptime in order for StakeWise V3 to work seamlessly. In this proposal, StakeWise core team suggests a list of 11 Oracles who it believes can achieve the required degree of decentralisation and uptime. We ask for DAO approval to include these organizations as members of the Oracle Network for StakeWise V3.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"background-about-the-oracle-role-in-v3-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#background-about-the-oracle-role-in-v3-2\"></a>Background about the Oracle role in V3</h2>\n<p>With the launch of StakeWise V3 hinging on this last milestone, the core team is looking to finalise the participants in the Oracle Network - a crucial component for the proper functioning of the StakeWise protocol. But what is an Oracle and why is a network of Oracles required for V3?</p>\n<p>An Oracle is an entity responsible for fetching validator rewards data for all the Vaults from the Beacon Chain and pushing it on-chain. An Oracle is also responsible for approving validator registration for all the Vaults, and exiting validators in response to withdrawal and redemption requests. These duties are performed automatically using Oracle software developed by the StakeWise team, with no manual actions involved.</p>\n<p>Correct and timely fulfillment of Oracle duties is necessary for a seamless staking and unstaking experience for both users and operators in StakeWise. Because an Oracle has the power to influence the amount of rewards paid out to stakers and the effectiveness of validator registration and exit, it has a very important role in the whole system.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"why-an-oracle-network-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#why-an-oracle-network-3\"></a>Why an Oracle <em>Network</em>\n</h2>\n<p>To minimize concerns about the manipulation of outcomes and reduce the susceptibility of the Oracle Network to regulatory capture, as well as to maximize the longevity of the protocol, the core team suggests an approach where a network of Oracles is working via a consensus mechanism to determine the outcomes. Instead of an Oracle being a single entity with centralized power over the protocol’s outcomes, using a network of Oracles is the gold standard for ensuring that the protocol does not have overpowered centralized components.</p>\n<p>Over time the DAO should be looking to replace the Oracle Network with trustless solutions based on zk tech, but quite a few technological advances must happen before it can become feasible.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"proposed-network-size-threshold-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#proposed-network-size-threshold-4\"></a>Proposed Network Size &amp; Threshold</h2>\n<p>We propose 11 participants total with 7/11 threshold for updating rewards and processing validator registrations/exits.</p>\n<p>A large number of participants is a must for the Oracle Network to remain decentralized. Meanwhile a high threshold for consensus is necessary to prevent centralization concerns and reduce the risk of malicious capture of the Oracle Network.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"operational-requirements-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#operational-requirements-5\"></a>Operational requirements</h2>\n<p>Due to the high threshold requirement and near-constant involvement of Oracles in the user interactions with the protocol, all entities running Oracles must achieve near-perfect uptime. The core team believes that Oracles must be expected to have above 99% uptime and will follow the same standard itself as one of the Oracles. This excludes situations where V3-Operator has failed as defined by unexpected errors in the software developed by the StakeWise core team.</p>\n<p>This is not trivial to achieve due to the occasional conflicts between the new versions of consensus and execution clients and the Oracle software, as well as potential node downtime experienced in environments with poor internet connection and insufficient technical resources.</p>\n<p>In light of the high demands on uptime &amp; technical expertise in running the Oracle, the best prospects for the role of Oracles are staking companies with stellar reputations, and infrastructure-focused teams with significant web3 experience.</p>\n<p>As a core team, we are fortunate to work with amazing partners who have expressed interest in becoming an Oracle for the StakeWise V3 protocol.

This service aims to provide a passive, convenient, gas-efficient and non-custodial solution for liquidity providers (LPs) while also tackling many of the challenges that emerge from the ongoing forum <a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/stakewise-v3-liquidity-stakewise-liquidity-committee-slc/1204/13\">discussion</a> and in the wider LST ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We believe that this solution offers tangible benefits for LPs and improves the effectiveness of the incentive program overall. Moreover, this initiative provides a mechanism to actively reduce the dominance of Lido and to promote a healthier balance in the LST market distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>MAIN CHALLENGES</strong></p>\n<p>From the forum <a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/stakewise-v3-liquidity-stakewise-liquidity-committee-slc/1204/13\">discussion</a> around the LP incentive program, it’s clear that several challenges emerge:</p>\n<p><strong>Managing Different LP Personas</strong>: LPs of different sizes exhibit varying behaviours, motivations, and friction points. Small and large LPs are not equally aligned with the project’s long-term goals, and managing these differences poses a significant challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Negative Impact on $SWISE price</strong>: distributing SWISE tokens to liquidity providers who may not have a strong connection to StakeWise could impact the token’s price and have vicious-circle effects on the alignment of other LPs with the StakeWise protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost Efficiency vs. Decentralisation</strong>: Striking a balance between the efficiency of distributing SWISE incentives and the goal of decentralising token ownership. It’s key to ensure that decentralised ownership is achieved without significantly increasing costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Monitoring &amp; Adaptation:</strong> Continuously monitoring the impact of SWISE distribution to LPs and having contingency plans in place to adapt the strategy if it leads to increased sell pressure on SWISE is a challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Excessive Concentration &amp; Project Risks</strong>: The organic concentration of liquidity in a single pool (e.g. paired with another LST) raises concerns about counterparty project risk. Ensuring that liquidity is well distributed to mitigate risks associated with a single project or platform is an additional challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>RATIONALE &amp; BENEFITS</strong></p>\n<p>In order to tackle the above mentioned challenges, we propose the creation of a Liquidity Program Service for passive LPs, to be run on a time-tested platform like Enzyme. The Enzyme Vault would be owned by the Stakewise DAO and the deployment to DeFi pools managed by Avantgarde Treasury via trustless vault management delegation.

LP’s can opt to hold a vault token that passively provides liquidity, accrues SWISE rewards and periodically compounds them. The convenience of using such a vault where liquidity is passively spread across the selected DeFi pools improves dramatically the ease of participating in the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-Custody for LPs</strong>: LPs would remain inhold custody of the vault shares for the duration of the program and have 24/7 transparency into the activity of the vault.</p>\n<p><strong>Gas savings</strong>: The aggregation of LP’s into one place means shared gas costs amongst all LP’s making it much more affordable for smaller LP’s to participate.</p>\n<p><strong>Better Alignment &amp; Efficiency</strong>: More predictable collective LP behaviour leads to better monitoring for Stakewise, better strategic long term alignment and increased overall efficiency. The concerns of the immediate and systematic price erosion caused by mercenary LPs would be reduced, thus improving the effectiveness of the incentive program.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversification</strong>: The Liquidity deposited on the vault would be equally distributed across the selected DeFi pools, as per advice from the SLC. This balanced approach would contribute to a more stable and sustainable liquidity environment, benefiting LPs and safeguarding the protocol from corrective incentive, excessive concentration and counterparty project risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible tax advantages</strong>: Depending on each LP’s tax jurisdiction, the vault token may offer tax advantages. LP fees and rewards accumulate as appreciation and capital gains instead of immediate taxable income. This structure may reduce tax liabilities, allowing LPs to defer tax payments until they sell their vault tokens. However, LPs should consult tax professionals for jurisdiction-specific guidance to maximise these benefits and ensure compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the feedback we will receive from the Stakewise community, 1 or 2 vaults can be created. In case of 2 vaults, LPs will have the option of choosing between one vault denominated in ETH and the other in stETH. What sets the stETH vault apart is its capability to actively contribute to a more balanced staking ecosystem. This feature allows it to natively un-stake assets from the Lido contract, enhancing the overall dynamics of decentralisation of the staking landscape while aligning with the fundamental principles of the Stakewise community, as also shown by the commitment of Stakewise to the 22% self-limitation.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/original/1X/3bc77247d43c7d0536b5d418a471454c24820dff.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8wPtVyK2BWzMdMMLoGJAaMfrusD.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 13.08.25\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/3bc77247d43c7d0536b5d418a471454c24820dff_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 13.08.25\" data-base62-sha1=\"8wPtVyK2BWzMdMMLoGJAaMfrusD\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/3bc77247d43c7d0536b5d418a471454c24820dff_2_690x386.jpeg, https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/3bc77247d43c7d0536b5d418a471454c24820dff_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/3bc77247d43c7d0536b5d418a471454c24820dff_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E0E9EC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/original/1X/a1de651284737b40f3433faaf5e7eecf5ab1149d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/n5XlMUpCguyy7LR5GGnMMLPPRBr.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 13.25.36\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/a1de651284737b40f3433faaf5e7eecf5ab1149d_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 13.25.36\" data-base62-sha1=\"n5XlMUpCguyy7LR5GGnMMLPPRBr\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/a1de651284737b40f3433faaf5e7eecf5ab1149d_2_690x386.jpeg, https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/a1de651284737b40f3433faaf5e7eecf5ab1149d_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/a1de651284737b40f3433faaf5e7eecf5ab1149d_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DFE9EB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</strong></p>\n<p>The creation of this solution would involve the following steps:</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Integration</strong><br>\nInitial scope: the native redemption from Lido is part of the work done for Diva Staking, which can be used in this case too without additional effort. For this specific use case, Avantgarde would need to integrate the price feeds for <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/SWISE\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$SWISE</a> and $osETH, provided by Redstone. This would involve some engineering work, testing, and quality assurance processes. This effort would allow the vault to execute swaps into osETH.</p>\n<p>Possible scope extension: the initial setup does not allow the native minting of osETH, nor does it include the integration of Charm Finance’s Alpha Vaults. While these extra steps are well feasible, they would require more intensive engineering work + audit and therefore may be scheduled in the future in case this initiative receives positive feedback and sufficient AUM traction from the Stakewise community.</p>\n<p><strong>Education and Outreach</strong><br>\nDevelop materials and conduct outreach efforts to inform the Enzyme and the Stakewise community about the benefits of this solution. This may include webinars, tutorials, documentation and a unique white labelled page for the Stakewise community.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/original/1X/d0fcae670a42e7fc83d5ef8b181cf177f0616546.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/tOMGdAO9AR8SEfYAXvwgLSpt8Hk.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 13.11.52\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/d0fcae670a42e7fc83d5ef8b181cf177f0616546_2_690x481.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 13.11.52\" data-base62-sha1=\"tOMGdAO9AR8SEfYAXvwgLSpt8Hk\" width=\"690\" height=\"481\" srcset=\"https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/d0fcae670a42e7fc83d5ef8b181cf177f0616546_2_690x481.jpeg, https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/d0fcae670a42e7fc83d5ef8b181cf177f0616546_2_1035x721.jpeg 1.5x, https://dl5k4cxr5xcx2.cloudfront.net/optimized/1X/d0fcae670a42e7fc83d5ef8b181cf177f0616546_2_1380x962.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"5D5E5F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Launch &amp; manage</strong><br>\nCoordinate the launch of the solution and provide ongoing management (in close dialogue with SLC) and monitoring to address issues that may arise.</p>\n<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>\n<p>Security is a top priority for the Enzyme. Here’s some key considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The protocol has been live on mainnet for about 5 years.</li>\n<li>Every adapter/integration is <a href=\"https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol/tree/v4/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audited</a> by Chain Security, one of the top security firms in the space.</li>\n<li>Enzyme has a large <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bounty/enzymefinance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bug bounty</a> on Immunefi.</li>\n<li>In terms of protocol upgrades, Enzyme does not force users to upgrade to a new version. Users can review the upgrade features and can decide not to <a href=\"https://docs.enzyme.finance/managers/signal-an-upgrade\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">opt-in</a> on a new version of the protocol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any other consideration regarding the use of Enzyme, here are the detailed <a href=\"https://enzyme.finance/terms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Terms &amp; Conditions.</a></p>\n<p><strong>FEES</strong></p>\n<p>While we want to remain open to community feedback on this matter, we propose implementing a flat 0.3% AUM-based fee structure, which also incorporates protocol fees. These fees on Enzyme are automatically processed through an on-chain module, accumulating for the designated vault manager. They are calculated as a percentage of the AUM on an annual basis and are accrued as an inflationary increase in vault shares that rewards the vault manager.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that these fees are borne by LPs (Liquidity Providers). Our goal is to strike a good balance between the additional (opportunity) cost incurred and the additional value offered by this service. The advantages for the LPs include enhanced convenience and UX simplicity, time savings, lower gas cost per capita, passive reward compounding and possible tax benefits, ultimately resulting in net-positive higher rewards for all participants.</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed liquidity program service for osETH, managed by Avantgarde Treasury and run on a time-tested platform like Enzyme, offers a cost-efficient and flexible approach to incentivising liquidity provision. It seeks to balance the interests of the LPs with the protocol’s need to attract and retain liquidity in a cost-efficient manner. By monitoring the impact and adjusting the strategy, the proposed solution aims to maximise the benefits for all stakeholders while working towards a self-sustaining liquidity ecosystem. The built-in mechanism that reduces Lido’s dominance provides an extra element that is fully in line with the ethos and values of the community.</p>\n<p>We invite the community to provide us with ample feedback to ensure that the final design aligns 100% with the collective goals and interests of StakeWise and becomes a useful tool for the project moving forward.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/tempcheck-enhancing-oseth-liquidity-and-lst-decentralization-a-proposal-for-a-liquidity-program-on-enzyme/1272\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/tempcheck-enhancing-oseth-liquidity-and-lst-decentralization-a-proposal-for-a-liquidity-program-on-enzyme/1272","pubDate":"Tue, 10 Oct 2023 13:52:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.stakewise.io-topic-1272"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/tempcheck-enhancing-oseth-liquidity-and-lst-decentralization-a-proposal-for-a-liquidity-program-on-enzyme/1272.rss","#text":"[Tempcheck] Enhancing osETH Liquidity and LST Decentralization: A Proposal for a Liquidity Program on Enzyme"}},{"title":"SLC Budget Request - Month 1","dc:creator":"Jstar","category":"Proposals","description":"<p>The contracts for StakeWise V3 are due to be deployed in the coming weeks, allowing StakeWise to kickstart the liquidity for osETH as per the <a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/stakewise-v3-liquidity-oseth/1203\">approved liquidity strategy</a>. An important part of the launch of StakeWise V3 is the migration of liquidity incentives from the current sETH2 farms to the new liquidity pools. By design, the SLC is structured to be nimble enough to navigate the V3 deployment process, extending the sETH2 incentives up until the time of V3 launch, before transitioning those incentives to the new osETH liquidity pools. <strong>To be clear, from the V3 public launch and beyond, all sETH2 farming rewards will cease as <a href=\"https://vote.stakewise.io/#/proposal/0x9f59dc64a9aaeb743aaf6d9881deeef1320b0541f410cfb9bf0a8b59b755d4fe\">approved by the DAO</a>.

A further 4 weeks of emissions are requested to ensure the SLC has enough SWISE to cover their extension until the public launch of V3. If V3 is launched shortly after October 20th, any SWISE left over from the allocation to sETH2 pools will be accounted for in the following month’s budget request. The SLC proposes the same level of incentives as per the previous month for the sETH2-ETH and sETH2-rETH2 pools:</p>\n<p>3,300,000 SWISE to be distributed across the pools in the following proportions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sETH2/ETH - 3,000,000 SWISE</li>\n<li>sETH2/rETH2 - 300,000 SWISE</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>New ETH-SWISE liquidity pool</strong></p>\n<p>The new ETH-SWISE pool is deployed and we propose to move some incentives from the existing sETH2-SWISE pool to the new pool. We suggest that 50% of the incentives be migrated to start with, followed by the remaining 50% a few weeks later. Historically, the monthly budget for the SWISE pool was 500,000 SWISE in incentives - the SLC requests the same budget, to be split equally between the old and the new ETH-SWISE pool.</p>\n<p><strong>New osETH liquidity pools</strong></p>\n<p>It is impossible to predict how quickly liquidity will migrate from the existing sETH2 pools to the new osETH pools. What is important, however, is to ensure the SLC has enough SWISE on hand to effectively bootstrap the pools should migration occur rapidly. With this in mind, a SWISE budget is requested to provide the SLC with enough incentives assuming 100% of the current liquidity migrates. That equates to 3,000,000 SWISE (the same as the current sETH2-ETH allocation).</p>\n<p>Just like the budget to extend the sETH2 farms, the SLC is not committing to deploy 100% of this SWISE over the next month within the new osETH pools. The SLC will monitor capital inflows and adjust the incentives on-demand to ensure that osETH pools APYs remain attractive and adjust according to demand.

What am I missing?</p>\n<p>Also, what’s the timeline for the ability to withdraw ETH?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n            <p><small>10 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/swapping-reth2-for-seth2/1261\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/swapping-reth2-for-seth2/1261","pubDate":"Tue, 19 Sep 2023 17:40:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.stakewise.io-topic-1261"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/swapping-reth2-for-seth2/1261.rss","#text":"Swapping rETH2 for sETH2"}},{"title":"Automated workflow for Stakewise","dc:creator":"godwin13","category":"Ideas","description":"<p>Hi Stakewise friends,</p>\n<p>I’m co-founder of Syncvote (<a href=\"https://www.syncvote.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">syncvote.com</a>). We try to transform the whole DAO’s operation team into one person, or even none.</p>\n<p><strong>Normally, DAO will do this</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to discord to raise a discussion</li>\n<li>Go to forum to create a post, mentioned that the post has been discussed somewhere</li>\n<li>Go to Snapshot/Realms to create a proposal, mentioned that the proposal has been passed in forum. DAO Admin will share the link to governance channel to notify member that a proposal has been on air and waited for their vote.</li>\n<li>Some people notice, some people not. Sometimes DAO admin is active, sometimes he is not. Sometimes passed proposal will be executed, sometimes it will not.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>That is really long and boring process</strong>. People need to learn all the rule, while jumping back and forth multiple platforms. On the other hand, DAO Admin need to do the same things everyday, while community lose track of what is going on.</p>\n<p><strong>So why not spend time to create interactive workflow</strong> and let it operate without the need for constant oversight from a centralized team?</p>\n<p>We face the problems, and we think about Syncvote as the solution.</p>\n<p>SyncVote’s capabilities is its remarkable ability to execute tasks precisely as you’ve defined them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Precision Execution:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>DAO define the conditions, triggers, and actions, and SyncVote follows the instructions faithfully without the risk of human error.</p>\n<p>One of truly powerful use case is <strong>Automated Fund Transfers:</strong></p>\n<p>DAO can create automated workflows that initiate fund transfers based on DAO predefined conditions. Whether it’s vendor payments, employee salaries, or contributor payments, SyncVote ensures that transactions occur smoothly and on time.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Effortless Workflow Design:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>No coding skills are required. Simply drag and drop elements, set conditions, and build workflows that match DAO specific requirements. SyncVote simplifies the entire process, empowering DAO to take control of DAO operations.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Real-time Monitoring and Oversight:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>While SyncVote operates autonomously, DAO maintain full visibility and control. Real-time monitoring and oversight features allow DAO to track the progress of automated tasks, review logs, and intervene when necessary. This combination of autonomy and control ensures that DAO operations run smoothly and effectively.</p>\n<p>My co-founder and I love to explore what problems Syncvote can solve for you and walk you through our Demo.</p>\n<p>You can get in touch with us through our calendly <a href=\"https://calendly.com/godwin-d/friendly-call?month=2023-09\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Calendly - Godwin Mount</a></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/automated-workflow-for-stakewise/1259\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/automated-workflow-for-stakewise/1259","pubDate":"Tue, 19 Sep 2023 03:12:16 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.stakewise.io-topic-1259"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/automated-workflow-for-stakewise/1259.rss","#text":"Automated workflow for Stakewise"}},{"title":"[September’23] SWISE Allocations for Uniswap Pools","dc:creator":"Jstar","category":"Proposals","description":"<p>StakeWise DAO recently approved the creation of the <a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/passed-stakewise-liquidity-committee-slc/1249\">Stakewise Liquidity Committee</a> (SLC), an entity mandated to drive StakeWise’s liquidity and incentivisation strategy for StakeWise V3. The SLC is also perfectly positioned to help streamline the migration of incentives from the existing sETH2 liquidity pools to the new osETH pools. A formal budget request for the new osETH pools will go live in the coming weeks as the launch of StakeWise V3 approaches. In the meantime, however, the current sETH2 farms need to be extended.</p>\n<p>StakeWise currently uses the Merkle Distributor to distribute SWISE incentives to its liquidity providers (LPs). The Merkle Distributor calculates the amount of incentives to allocate each LP based on the size and duration of their capital deployment, and the price range the capital is deployed across. Based on these calculations, the Distributor automatically allocates tokens to LPs, ready to be claimed on the <a href=\"https://app.stakewise.io/farm\">Farms</a> page.</p>\n<p>The Distributor contract is token-agnostic and automatically distributes any tokens it receives to LPs. Because of this nature, an important security feature is the whitelisting of addresses that are eligible to send tokens to the Distributor. Without this, anyone could deposit potentially malicious tokens for the Distributor to send to LPs. Currently, the DAO treasury is the only address whitelisted, however with the StakeWise Liquidity Committee (SLC) now in place and responsible for incentives distribution moving forward, the SLC must be whitelisted before it can deploy incentives.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"proposal-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#proposal-1\"></a>Proposal</h2>\n<p><strong>A)</strong> Whitelist the SLC Master Safe (0x189Cb93839AD52b5e955ddA254Ed7212ae1B1f61) to send tokens to the Merkle Distributor.</p>\n<p><strong>B)</strong> Claim 3,800,000 SWISE from DAO vesting contract and deposit it into the SLC Master Safe</p>\n<p><strong>DAO vesting contract:</strong> 0xF0d99D5d1D5E06CdAd4766503Cb82213B5E1d1bE<br>\n<strong>SLC Master Safe:</strong> 0x189Cb93839AD52b5e955ddA254Ed7212ae1B1f61</p>\n<p>SWISE to be distributed across the pools for 30 days (199385 blocks) as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sETH2/ETH - 3,000,000 SWISE</li>\n<li>sETH2/rETH2 - 300,000 SWISE</li>\n<li>sETH2/SWISE - 500,000 SWISE</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note, the amount of proposed rewards is unchanged compared to last month.</p>\n<p>Link to the Snapshot: <a href=\"https://vote.stakewise.io/#/proposal/0x2b605a6bd967c91a4d40d203e44cd967d071c8800b04f87bcc33266b70de94fd\">Snapshot</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/september-23-swise-allocations-for-uniswap-pools/1256\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/september-23-swise-allocations-for-uniswap-pools/1256","pubDate":"Mon, 18 Sep 2023 12:45:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.stakewise.io-topic-1256"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/september-23-swise-allocations-for-uniswap-pools/1256.rss","#text":"[September’23] SWISE Allocations for Uniswap Pools"}},{"title":"Hello, as one of auditors","dc:creator":"mahdirostami","category":"Uncategorized","description":"<p>Hello, I review Stake wise v3, and just want to say that it’s really fantastic and well audited before.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/hello-as-one-of-auditors/1253\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/hello-as-one-of-auditors/1253","pubDate":"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 19:00:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.stakewise.io-topic-1253"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/hello-as-one-of-auditors/1253.rss","#text":"Hello, as one of auditors"}}]}}}
