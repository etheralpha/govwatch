I’m Mahdi, a developer currently working on the implementation of the Zellular Sequencer. I’m investigating how this technology can be integrated with the EigenLayer infrastructure to enhance the decentralized execution environment. Our goal is to leverage EigenLayer’s security features alongside the Zellular Sequencer’s efficient consensus mechanisms to optimize the operation of decentralized applications.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"introduction-to-zellular-sequencer-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#introduction-to-zellular-sequencer-1\"></a>Introduction to Zellular Sequencer</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Replicating</a> centralized services across multiple nodes enables the creation of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) services that remain robust, even if some nodes fail or act maliciously. In BFT services, all replicated nodes should maintain the same data or state. This uniformity can be achieved if all user-signed requests are processed in the same order across nodes.</p>\n<p>The Zellular Sequencer directly addresses this challenge by ensuring that every node in the network processes every request in the same sequence. In Zellular Sequencer, one of the network nodes, the Sequencer, takes the leader role for sequencing tasks. User-signed requests received by a node are applied to the database only after being sent to the leader and received back along with other nodes’ requests in a consistent order.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/e/e0664cb33f653f9843b9f60ad58ed4c0ae5f761d.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"w1880Y5M2414ubCbyUPuPKZJIRL\" width=\"411\" height=\"277\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p>If the Sequencer fails—due to going offline, censoring requests, or sending inconsistent orders—other nodes have the capability to challenge its actions and appoint a new leader. This built-in redundancy ensures that the Zellular Sequencer operates as a BFT service, effectively eliminating any single point of failure.\"</p>\n<p>For further details on the protocol, please review our documentation here:<a href=\"https://zellular-sequencer-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Zellular Sequencer Protocol</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"capabilities-enabled-by-zellular-sequencer-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#capabilities-enabled-by-zellular-sequencer-2\"></a>Capabilities Enabled by Zellular Sequencer</h3>\n<p>Just as Bitcoin can be considered a blockchain, blockchains are essentially replicated state machines that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replicated on an unlimited number of nodes</li>\n<li>Where each node runs an unlimited number of apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Zellular Sequencer on the other side, enables developing state machines that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replicated on a limited number of nodes</li>\n<li>Where each node runs a single app</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This architecture enables the development of sufficiently decentralized apps by optimally balancing decentralization with efficiency. Unlike smart contracts hosted on traditional blockchains, apps decentralized using replicated state machines with Zellular can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be developed in high-level languages like JavaScript and Python.</li>\n<li>Handle hundreds of thousands of requests per second.</li>\n<li>Finalize transactions in less than a second.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"implications-for-eigenlayer-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#implications-for-eigenlayer-3\"></a>Implications for EigenLayer</h3>\n<p>From the perspective of EigenLayer, while traditionally developers might use blockchain to host the state of their dApps and rely on EigenLayer for verifying state integrity when transferring it securely, the Zellular Sequencer invites a paradigm shift. It allows developers to consider hosting the state directly on the EigenLayer network, leveraging its security on demand.</p>\n<p>This shift enables dApp developers to enjoy greater flexibility in development, achieve higher throughput, ensure rapid transaction finality, and dynamically adjust their security needs. Essentially, the Zellular Sequencer empowers developers to fully utilize the EigenLayer infrastructure for more than just the verification of the state read from blockchains—transforming it into a platform for hosting the state itself and efficiently reaching consensus over it.</p>\n<p>Imagine a sufficiently decentralized order-driven exchange that merges the permissionless listing of decentralized exchanges with the blazing speed and efficiency of centralized exchanges, to be fully hosted and secured by EigenLayer without reliance on any blockchain. This capability not only exemplifies the adaptability and potential of the EigenLayer network but also showcases how it can serve as the foundational technology for the next generation of decentralized applications.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/hosting-zellular-sequencer-on-eigenlayer/13395\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/hosting-zellular-sequencer-on-eigenlayer/13395","pubDate":"Thu, 09 May 2024 14:42:18 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.eigenlayer.xyz-topic-13395"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/hosting-zellular-sequencer-on-eigenlayer/13395.rss","#text":"Hosting Zellular Sequencer on EigenLayer"}},{"title":"EigenLayer News: Updated EIGEN token allocations | May 7th","dc:creator":"web3citizenxyz","category":"🌞General","description":"<h2><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#tldr-1\"></a><strong>TL;DR</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>TVL watch: $15.3B</li>\n<li><strong>Updated EIGEN allocations to the community</strong></li>\n<li>Aligned Layer Testnet in EigenLayer</li>\n<li>Altlayer launches reALT token</li>\n<li>Introducing EigenExplorer</li>\n<li>Lagrange &lt;&gt; Polymer</li>\n<li>Coinbase will become a node operator for EigenDA</li>\n<li>Etherfi is live on Base</li>\n<li>AVS Spotlight: Eoracle</li>\n<li>Infinite Layers: Eoracle</li>\n<li>Final Call for the EigenLayer Hackathon</li>\n<li>Spaces: Electron + Aligned</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"ecosystem-news-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#ecosystem-news-2\"></a><strong><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/globe_with_meridians.png?v=12\" title=\":globe_with_meridians:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":globe_with_meridians:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Ecosystem News</strong></h1>\n<h3><a name=\"tvl-watch-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#tvl-watch-3\"></a><strong>TVL watch</strong></h3>\n<p>A week after announcing EIGEN, today EigenLayer reached a total value locked (TVL) of $15.3B according to <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/eigenlayer#information\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DefiLlama</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"updated-eigen-allocations-to-the-community-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#updated-eigen-allocations-to-the-community-4\"></a><strong>Updated EIGEN allocations to the community</strong></h3>\n<p>In response to community feedback, the Eigen Foundation will allocate 100 tokens to all users who’ve interacted with EigenLayer <em>before</em> April 29th to cover their gas costs.<br>\nThis results in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Season 1 users receive a minimum of 110 EIGEN (floor of 10 EIGEN + newly awarded 100 EIGEN).</li>\n<li>Season 2 users who staked between March 15th and April 29th receive a minimum of 100 EIGEN.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amounts will be reflected in allocations claimed after May 10th.</p>\n<p>Additionally the team clarified that tokens for Investors and the team lockup for 1 year after transferability is enabled to the community (estimated for september 30th).

This token differs from usual one-token governance token models.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Allocation</strong></p>\n<p>With a total supply of 1.67B, the foundation has allocated 45% of tokens to the community, composed of 15% towards stakedrops, 15% to community initiatives and 15% towards ecosystem development. Stakedrops will be distributed across many seasons, beginning with a 5% drop of the token supply to active users (snapshot March 15th).</p>\n<p>Claiming begins on May 10th with a 120 day claiming window. The token will not be transferable initially to foster consensus around its utility. You can check your eligibility on <a href=\"https://claims.eigenfoundation.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">claims.eigenfoundation.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>Introducing intersubjective forking</strong></p>\n<p>The token model allows for a crypto-economic security system that enables a disputing mechanism of intersubjective challenges. These types of challenges arise from events that any observers can identify offchain and social consensus can be agreed upon, but that can be difficult to <em>objectively</em> identify onchain.</p>\n<p>EigenLayer proposes a two token model where EIGEN is the tradable, “fork unaware” token and bEIGEN is the staking token which is “fork aware”. If a challenge is raised, bEIGEN can be forked into the agreed-upon state without affecting EIGEN.</p>\n<p>This model builds a path for EigenLayer to withstand a complex attack, making it more resistant to corruption within the node operator set.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87823337-8cca-4b40-8bf7-c5cd7b9e72cd_1600x840.jpeg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/3/32d6f1206210f5bdf947c621c1106850cdf882e7.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"7fKnPI5nWB3H1mE8dlAU6eEvOMT\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\" role=\"presentation\"><br>\n</a></p>\n<p><strong>What can you do right now?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check eligibility <a href=\"https://claims.eigenfoundation.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">claims.eigenfoundation.org</a> and claim the EIGEN drop May 10th.</li>\n<li>Once available you can delegate and begin securing EigenDA through EIGEN.</li>\n<li>Familiarize yourself with the EIGEN design.

After months of development in stealth, today we are sharing the Alpha V0.1 release of our <a href=\"https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/Anzen-Whitepaper-Release\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">whitepaper</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/anzen-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">codebase</a>, <a href=\"https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x419d8D025806F3cC118Bb1c110D8B12EaE1aEA77#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">live testnet</a> and <a href=\"https://dashboard.anzenprotocol.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example dashboard</a>. This early research release marks the first step in our mission of helping AVSs (Actively Validated Services, i.e. middleware on EigenLayer) increase security and reduce operator payment costs. Because this is an early release, exact details of the design and implementation are still subject to change as EigenLayer evolves.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-the-economic-security-challenge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#motivation-the-economic-security-challenge-2\"></a>Motivation: The Economic Security Challenge</h3>\n<p>Economic security is hard, and the purpose of EigenLayer is to help AVSs bootstrap their security in a faster and more efficient manner. With EigenLayer, instead of bootstrapping a siloed network for economic security, AVSs can tap into an existing network for shared economic security with an existing and efficient marketplace for decentralized trust. By adjusting the fees paid to incentivize operators, AVSs can target a certain amount of economic security they purchase.</p>\n<p>But how does a new AVS know how much they need to pay for economic security? How much economic security is needed to secure their protocol and prevent an economic attack? How do they ensure they are constantly meeting the minimum amount of economic security while avoiding over-paying operators?

We created the Safety Factor (SF) as a generalized standard metric to use for measuring AVS economic security, akin to health factors widely utilized throughout DeFi. The SF is based on the concepts of Cost of Corruption (CoC) and Profit from Corruption (PoC) and is defined in our whitepaper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90aab5d7-65c0-41df-82ab-3c3a23d6322b_1920x1080.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6JG1IuEXH40ScAdLwdUt0ExVO19.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"6JG1IuEXH40ScAdLwdUt0ExVO19\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"19181E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>When the SF is below 0, it means that a protocol is vulnerable to economic exploit (akin to health factor falling into liquidation territory).</p>\n<p>When the SF approaches 1, it means that an AVS is overpaying for economic security.</p>\n<p>We expect the typical SF to trend near a target buffer above 0 to avoid being too close to an economic exploit. Analogously, DeFi users typically maintain a margin above the minimum Health Factor in order to prevent being liquidated.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protocol-overview-alpha-v01-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#protocol-overview-alpha-v01-4\"></a>Protocol Overview (Alpha v0.1)</h3>\n<p>Now that we know how to measure economic security on EigenLayer, we need to make sure that we stay within our desired target range.

Each AVS integrated with Anzen protocol has a customized SF Oracle Module which is programmed to calculate the SF for a given AVS. The SF Oracle Module queries external data sources, performs calculations and risk management computations, and returns the resulting response to the oracle, which then broadcasts all of the results on-chain. Before an SF Oracle Module is deployed, it is recommended to conduct economic security modeling and auditing.</p>\n<p>The AVS Reserves Manager is a contract that integrates with the EigenLayer AVS Payments manager to regulate the flow of AVS operator payments. With the SF now delivered on-chain, the AVS Reserves Manager is capable of increasing or decreasing the rate of operator payments in order to target a desired SF level. When there is a surplus of economic security, operator payments can be reduced to save money for the AVS. When there is a shortage of economic security, operator payments must be increased to safeguard the AVS.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"benefits-for-avss-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#benefits-for-avss-5\"></a>Benefits for AVSs</h3>\n<p>The benefits of Anzen Protocol for AVSs are clear: reduced operator payment costs and increased security. Another benefit is insight: we are building a comprehensive dashboard for AVSs to monitor and understand their AVSs economic security information in simple terms and to launch new AVSs with a clear understanding of the associated costs and requirements. The importance of contract security is also paramount; in our alpha testnet, we include rate limits in the AVS Reserves Manager for maximum security.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"testnet-deployment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#testnet-deployment-6\"></a>Testnet Deployment</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83aa8e6-de43-415a-8c07-b72beffef3b6_1600x498.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gV7DOguxRNThZjahe0O8ashNdUt.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_690x214.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gV7DOguxRNThZjahe0O8ashNdUt\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_690x214.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_1035x321.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_1380x428.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEEF2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/anzen-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/anzen-contracts</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"example-dashboard-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#example-dashboard-7\"></a>Example Dashboard</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75dcae16-9ef1-458d-bcad-42faa4e586ed_916x763.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/a6euOLAjupucMTsFDQU1zQRO8lr.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1_2_600x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"a6euOLAjupucMTsFDQU1zQRO8lr\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1_2_600x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1_2_900x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1F1C1A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"links-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#links-8\"></a>Links</h3>\n<p>Learn more about Anzen Protocol by joining our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/54bKCbAA5E\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">discord</a> community or following us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnzenProtocol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X (Twitter</a>).

Bitcoins value comes from our consensus about its role, which is dependent on its market cap. The higher it is relative to other crypto currencies, the more distinct its role is. Ethereum is different, it is valued not for it’s first-in-kind role nor for its valuation but for the activity, value, and innovation that is generated in its ecosystem. One could say that Eth has fundamental value and Bitcoin consensual value. If Ethereum closes in on Bitcoin in terms of its valuation, Bitcoins consensual value might accrue to Eth and if Bitcoin is flipped, it may lose its entire consensual value to Eth.

Having an enthusiastic response from the Eigenlayer community would certainly increase the chances that this project is approved.</p>\n<p>You can read the application here: <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/round-8-gmc-call-for-bounty-applications-deadline-is-january-14/2558/2?u=jasperthegovghost\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/round-8-gmc-call-for-bounty-applications-deadline-is-january-14/2558/2?u=jasperthegovghost</a></p>\n<p>I am happy to answer any questions.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\njasperthefriendlyghost.eth</p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/rocket-pool-x-eigenlayer/12466\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/rocket-pool-x-eigenlayer/12466","pubDate":"Sat, 06 Jan 2024 23:21:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.eigenlayer.xyz-topic-12466"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/rocket-pool-x-eigenlayer/12466.rss","#text":"Rocket Pool x Eigenlayer"}},{"title":"Use cases - Network Adoption","dc:creator":"ScaleWeb3","category":"🔬New Middleware R&D","description":"<p>I initially thought new networks would take advantage of the economic security &amp; existing decentralized validator set of ETH - Eigenlayer and not need to bootstrap an expensive validator set initially aside not wanting to further fragmentize the space, liquidity, etc.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Independent l1s</li>\n<li>Identity networks</li>\n<li>Trust networks</li>\n<li>Privacy networks</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, all of them could build up a unique validator set but won’t be limited by its size as long as enough EigenLayer support is given &amp; can use it in parallel to not miss out on the other EigenL benefits.</p>\n<p>So far, it seems to me that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>no independent l1s are <em>interested</em> in Eigenlayer security.</li>\n<li>Eth l2s should already inherit security from Ethereum - hence they won’t be big “clients”</li>\n<li>Rollup-as-a-Service projects are among first adopters - makes sense if they don’t inherit Eth security</li>\n<li>MEV related projects (DEXs, sequencer, settlements) are early adopters - valuable use cases</li>\n<li>there are not many networks waiting for Eigenlayer support - maybe this will come a bit later</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I understand that the first part of the go-to-market is onboarding ETH stakers and that works very well!</p>\n<p>I also understand that ETH (l2) users are somewhat most aligned with the ETH validator set and consequently it may make sense to decentralize sequencers etc. utilizing the same validator set (-&gt; no economic outflow in the economy, little additional attack vectors).</p>\n<p>As I am diving deeper into the ecosystem, I keep asking myself the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there already networks in the pipeline to adopt Eigenlayer?</li>\n<li>Which kind of networks are most interesting?

I tried to change my validator withdrawal address on Allnodes to the EigonPod address I set up, but I don’t think I did this correctly and was confused by it all. There was no place to change this on Allnodes that I could find and I only had 20 or so minutes to do this (the alloted time Allnodes allows once I decided to change the Allnodes address). I instead changed my recipient fee address using the EigonPod address I generated, but I don’t see any of the ETH there now while the staked ETH node on Allnodes is no longer there. I don’t see my ETH in my Ledger wallet either, so at this point I don’t know where the ETH is and it appears lost. I sent a message to Allnodes too about this. I desparately hope I did not lose my 32 ETH as well as the awards. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/changing-validator-withdrawal-address/12428\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/changing-validator-withdrawal-address/12428","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Jan 2024 21:05:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.eigenlayer.xyz-topic-12428"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/changing-validator-withdrawal-address/12428.rss","#text":"Changing validator withdrawal address"}}]}}}
