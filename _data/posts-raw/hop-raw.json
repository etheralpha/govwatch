This will increase HOP liquidity and market depth while providing a natural source of diversification for the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>As Hop prepares for the launch of v2 and hopefully the ensuing growth of the protocol, now is the time to improve HOP liquidity and position the DAO for increased demand.  Hop has not engaged any market makers or incentivized liquidity for HOP to date.  I believe that this is the correct approach, however HOP liquidity is extremely low.  This makes it difficult to enter positions and leads to significant price volatility.  As of this past week, ~$500k of total buy orders would basically exhaust the entire Univ3 pool.  This is a relatively small amount of liquidity and could prove problematic if Hop v2 significantly increases demand.  I understand that some might say, ‚Äúwow token shortage good, price go up big‚Äù, but that approach is not sustainable.  The current TVL of the HOP pool is approximately $280k.  This proposal would increase the TVL by $1.2m which would put HOP in line with similar assets.  Much of the TVL will be well above the current spot price of HOP which should limit potential adverse effects.  As a community, I believe that having well aligned HOP holders is in our long-term best interest.  Increasing HOP liquidity will create avenues for more participants to get on board in a reasonable manner.</p>\n<p>Recent efforts to increase HOP liquidity are positive but still leave a ways to go.  Single sided liquidity lets us LP meaningful amounts of HOP solely to the ‚Äúupside‚Äù of the price range.  As the price of HOP increases, the DAO is gently selling HOP for ETH based on market demand.  If the price of HOP decreases once this position is in range, there will be significantly more market depth to absorb selling.  From my perspective, the biggest downside of this proposal is that it effectively creates resting sell orders for HOP that will need to be filled for the price to increase in the pool.  I have tried to size the proposal appropriately to increase liquidity while not overburdening the market for HOP.  The impact of additional HOP appears to be very reasonable.  The next section explains the mechanics and practical implications for the position.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics of Execution</strong></p>\n<p>I will caveat this by saying that it is difficult to model Univ3 positions and that this should be generally accurate but may be slightly off ‚Äì please keep in mind that everything is priced in ETH terms so that is an additional variable that makes precision challenging.  If there is a great tool for modeling Univ3 positions, please let me know because this was all done manually.</p>\n<p>This proposal would take 25,000,000 HOP held by the DAO and LP in a range from just above the current spot price to tick <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#6400</span> which equates to roughly a $6 HOP price.  To provide context for the additional liquidity, this will add ~$250k of depth between the current spot price and $0.10 HOP.  As the price of HOP increases, the dollar value of the depth increases as well (e.g. there is about 2x as much additional depth between $0.10 and $0.20, etc.).  The current liquidity is fairly concentrated near the spot price; this proposal would greatly increase the longer tail of liquidity throughout this range.  For the purpose of illustration, if the entire range were to be filled it would yield about $31m in ETH for the DAO.  This proposal will not provide any liquidity for people to ‚Äúdump‚Äù on at the current prices and only comes into range if the price of HOP increases.  If we determine that the liquidity is having negative impacts on HOP or unintended consequences, we can pull the liquidity at any time (I assume this would require a subsequent vote).</p>\n<p>I believe that this proposal is a positive step towards creating a more robust environment for HOP ahead of v2 while also providing a gentle means of diversification for the DAO.  Please let me know if you have any comments, suggestions or concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>Voting Options</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>LP 25,000,000 HOP in specified range</li>\n<li>No action</li>\n<li>Abstain</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post -

We need to consider all aspects of our finances, but we also need to prioritize what‚Äôs most important.</p>\n<p>The Hop Protocol makes a lot of money, but not all of it goes into our HopDAO Treasury. We have a great community, and it‚Äôs important to listen to them to understand how they see the financial situation and what‚Äôs important to them when making investment decisions.</p>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15vPOOlFAPcCr3AtjlUPAIqIrwyuDB-FCMmLCW4ypXB8/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">we did a survey</a> to find out what the community thinks we should focus on. From the feedback we received from delegates, the survey, and my own experience, here are the things that HopDAO needs:</p>\n<p>a) Hop requires a systematic and well-thought-out approach to managing its treasury to ensure the DAO‚Äôs financial resilience and create a platform for sustainable growth.</p>\n<p>b) To achieve this, we need a Treasury Management Framework. This framework should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a transparent operational model with actions, accountable persons, and governance structure,</li>\n<li>a well-defined financial plan that aims to establish a sustainable runway, liquidity targets, supplemented by proactive budgeting, and regular reporting,</li>\n<li>a HOP token liquidity management plan to ensure Protocol‚Äôs token stability and attractiveness for current and future investors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These priorities form the foundation for the Treasury Management Framework that I‚Äôm about to introduce.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"updated-hop-treasury-management-framework-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#updated-hop-treasury-management-framework-5\"></a>Updated Hop Treasury Management Framework</h1>\n<p>We have laid out the basic structure needed for a successful treasury management plan <a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-hop-treasury-management-framework/1024\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, let‚Äôs refine and tailor it to fit the priorities of our DAO.

It encompasses the following key components:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-treasury-management-principles-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#h-1-treasury-management-principles-7\"></a>1. Treasury Management Principles</h3>\n<p>Following these principles helps us manage our DAO‚Äôs finances well. We focus on being open, inclusive, and responsible. These principles help us handle our funds in a decentralized way, aiming for transparency, reducing risks, and aligning with our goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: We believe in open communication and sharing relevant information about the DAO‚Äôs finances. Everyone should have access to know how funds are allocated and investments are made. Transparency builds trust and ensures that everyone is on the same page. We commit to monthly financial reporting, accessible via the Hop Community Forum.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: ‚Äú<em>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication</em>‚Äù. We believe in simplicity over complexity. Treasury management doesn‚Äôt have to be convoluted and confusing. We aim to streamline our processes, making them accessible and easy to understand for everyone involved. By keeping it simple, we reduce risks and avoid unnecessary complications.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversification</strong>: We encourage spreading the risk by diversifying our investments. Instead of relying on HOP, we explore various opportunities across stablecoins, ETH, and WBTC, deployed across multiple DeFi protocols and strategies. Diversification keeps us balanced and safeguards against unexpected exploits.</li>\n<li><strong>Accountability and Decentralisation</strong>: We recognize the importance of having a dedicated individual or team responsible for driving decisions forward. This ensures that inertia is overcome and progress is made. While we value efficiency, we also advocate for a democratic process where the DAO collectively votes on fundamental guidelines. This strikes a balance between swift action and maintaining oversight to prevent reckless trading practices.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Our foremost priority is safeguarding our financial resources. We meticulously assess various risk metrics, from market-related risks to strategy-specific vulnerabilities, ensuring our treasury remains robust and sustainable.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Our treasury management decisions should align with our DAO‚Äôs objectives, focusing on ensuring the long-term sustainability of the DAO and it‚Äôs token. By keeping our objectives in sight, we make purposeful and impactful decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-treasury-management-objectives-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#h-2-treasury-management-objectives-8\"></a>2. Treasury Management Objectives</h3>\n<p>As framed in the problem statement section, <strong>the goal of the Treasury Management is to build</strong>:</p>\n<p>‚Äú<em>‚Ä¶a systematic and well-thought-out approach [‚Ä¶] to ensure the DAO‚Äôs financial resilience and create a platform for sustainable growth.</em>‚Äù</p>\n<p>I.e., translating this into 5 key objectives that inform our work for the framework:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Meeting Operational Needs</strong>: One of the primary objectives of the DAO‚Äôs treasury management is to ensure that a DAO has sufficient cash and liquidity to meet its financial obligations and fund its day-to-day operations. This involves optimizing cash flows, managing working capital effectively, and maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity to mitigate the risk of cash shortages. The rest of the longer-term oriented capital, e.g., not needed within the next 24-36 months for operational needs, should be used to take advantage of investment opportunities with different risk profiles.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide a sustainable liquidity for HopDAO token:</strong> Liquidity is a foundational element for the success and stability of any token-based project. It ensures that new investors can seamlessly enter the market while providing an exit path for those looking to divest. HopDAO Treasury should be able to identify mid-term liquidity improvement strategies, and propose long-term solutions to enhance protocol liquidity.</li>\n<li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making</strong>: By leveraging data, we aim to optimize investment choices, risk management strategies, and operational efficiency. This principle ensures that our DeFi strategies are grounded in solid analysis of on-chain and off-chain data, as well as utilising state-of-art statistical concepts, enhancing the effectiveness of our treasury management.</li>\n<li><strong>Overseeing Risks, related to Treasury</strong>: Treasury management aims to identify, assess, and manage various financial risks faced by a DAO. This includes protocol risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. The objective is to implement strategies and/or hedging techniques to minimize the impact of these risks on the DAO‚Äôs financial performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Regulatory Considerations</strong>: We stay updated on DeFi regulations to adapt our strategies and partnerships accordingly. This helps us avoid legal risks and adjust our investments as needed. We stay resilient and flexible amid regulatory changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the DAO approves these initial components, we can move forward with implementing and executing the framework.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"tmf-top-priority-components-overview-and-next-steps-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#tmf-top-priority-components-overview-and-next-steps-9\"></a>TMF Top Priority Components Overview and Next Steps</h1>\n<p>Now, we‚Äôre at a critical point where we need to discuss the practical execution of our objectives. The proposal will be divided into two main areas: Protocol Liquidity Management and Treasury Management execution. Here‚Äôs what you can expect in Part 2 and Part 3:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"part-2-protocol-owned-liquidity-management-overview-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#part-2-protocol-owned-liquidity-management-overview-10\"></a>Part 2 - Protocol Owned Liquidity Management Overview:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>POL Research:</strong> Every decision made by the DAO should be rational and data-driven. I aim to provide the Hop community with an overview of common practices used to manage protocol liquidity. The goal is to assess various protocols and strategies, ranking them based on our specific needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Protocol Liquidity Management Framework:</strong> In this section, I‚Äôll introduce the principles I plan to use to achieve deep liquidity and price stability.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"part-3-treasury-management-mandate-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#part-3-treasury-management-mandate-11\"></a>Part 3 - Treasury Management Mandate:</h3>\n<p>This final part of the RFC will be structured as a mandate, which will be submitted to the snapshot after gathering all necessary feedback from the community and delegates. Here are the topics we will discuss:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Treasury Management Operational Model &amp; Governance:</strong> This section outlines the central components of the framework, aligning all stakeholders and ensuring clarity in the treasury management process. It details procedures, policies, and tools for efficient cash flow management, risk mitigation, and decision-making within the DAO.</li>\n<li><strong>Financial Management and Budgeting:</strong> Emphasizing cash flow forecasting and liquidity management, this section explores strategies to ensure adequate liquidity for operational needs. It aligns budgeting practices with the DAO‚Äôs financial goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Treasury Asset Allocation:</strong> Efficient allocation of treasury funds is vital for maximizing returns while managing risk. This section covers the selection and allocation process for deploying the DAO‚Äôs financial resources, including diversification, rebalancing, and investment strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Transparency is essential for the success of a DAO. This section focuses on reporting tools and mechanisms to ensure full transparency in treasury management, emphasizing timely and accurate reporting for stakeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>KPIs, Deliverables, and Terms:</strong> This section outlines the specific terms, expectations, timeline, and compensation associated with the mandate.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#conclusion-12\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>By implementing the Treasury Management Framework, HopDAO can establish a robust and sustainable approach to managing its financial resources.

Additionally, speed of fraud proofs allows for near instant native bridging of funds bridge (rather than waiting seven days).</p>\n<p>¬∑ An Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.</p>\n<p>¬∑ A new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization, to address the required recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts.</p>\n<p>¬∑ NEO X is aligned with NEO and its values.</p>\n<p>¬∑ Hop is already deployed on POS with good success</p>\n<p>¬∑ Hop gaining market-share through early mover advantage</p>\n<p>NEO X main net will launch in May to June. Our aim is to have Hop as one of our early stage bridge partners, as we view Hop as a highly crucial product for users to bridge their assets across various chains.</p>\n<p><strong>About NEO X</strong></p>\n<p>Neo was founded 2014 and has grown into a first-class smart contract platform. NEO is one of most feature-complete L1 blockchain platforms for building decentralized applications.</p>\n<p>Neo X is an EVM-compatible sidechain incorporating Neo‚Äôs distinctive dBFT consensus mechanism. Serving as a bridge between Neo N3 and the widely adopted EVM network, we expect Neo X to significantly expand the Neo ecosystem and provide developers with broader pathways for innovation.</p>\n<p>In this pre-alpha version of the TestNet, we have aligned the Engine and dBFT interfaces. The main features are as follows:</p>\n<p>dBFT consensus engine support has been added to Ethereum nodes. Geth Ethereum node implementation is taken as a basis.</p>\n<p>A set of pre-configured stand by validators act as dBFT consensus nodes. All the advantages, features and mechanics of dBFT consensus are precisely preserved.</p>\n<p>Ethereum P2P protocol is extended with dBFT-specific consensus messages.</p>\n<p>Invasive existing Ethereum block structure modifications are avoided as much as possible to stay compatible with existing Ethereum ecosystem tools. MixHash block field is reused to store NextConsensus information and Nonce field is reused to store dBFT Primary index.</p>\n<p>Multisignature scheme used in Neo N3 is adopted to the existing Ethereum block structure, so that it‚Äôs possible for Neo X consensus nodes to add M out of N signature to the block and properly verify signature correctness. Extra block field is reused for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Secp256k1 signatures are used for block signing.</p>\n<p>The multi-node dBFT consensus mechanism, enveloped transactions, and a seamless native bridge connecting Neo X with Neo N3 will be introduced in subsequent versions.</p>\n<p>*Please be aware that this pre-alpha version of NeoX is in the active development phase, meaning that ALL data will be cleared in future updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>There‚Äôs significant value in Hop being available on an EVM. Deploying early on NEO X helps solidify Hop‚Äôs place as a leading DEX and a thought leader.</p>\n<p>Additionally, given the community and user uptake Hop has seen on NEO X PoS, it‚Äôs only natural to make its deployment on NEO X a priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Partner Details</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neo Global Development</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal is being made by Tony Sun, an employee of Neo Global Development. Neo Global Development is a legal entity focused on the ecosystem growth and maintenance of the suite of NEO.</p>\n<p><strong>Partner Legal</strong></p>\n<p>The legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Neo Global Development Ltd, a British Virgin Islands corporation known as ‚ÄúNGD‚Äù.</p>\n<p><strong>Delegate Sponsor</strong></p>\n<p>There is no delegate co-authoring or sponsoring this proposal. Instead, this is a proposal submitted by Tony Sun of NGD to support the growth of NEO as part of the overall NEO community.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflict of Interest Declaration</strong></p>\n<p>There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between NGD and any of Sushiswap‚Äôs legal entities, including Sushiswap, SUSHI tokens, nor investments of Sushiswap‚Ä¶</p>\n<p><strong>What potential risks are there for this project‚Äôs success? How could they be mitigated?</strong></p>\n<p>Deploying on NEO X should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer Two, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit NEO‚Äôs core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. The bridge has been disintermediated, and Sushiswap can expect reputable Oracle providers to be available as data providers from Day One. NEO X‚Äôs EVM testnet has been running for the past two months. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Red4Sec. <a href=\"https://neo.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Welcome to NEO</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post -

This is a proposal to extend the Hop Delegate Incentivization Program for a period of twelve months.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>Through the delegate incentivisation trial over the past year, delegates have been incentivised to actively participate in Hop DAO Governance by taking part in discussions on the forum, voting on proposals and ensuring to share their rationale for voting a particular way. This program has created a healthy culture of governance-related engagement in the Hop DAO.</p>\n<p>Renewing this Hop Delegate Incentivization trial will ensure that the quality of Hop DAO does not decline.</p>\n<p>This Incentivisation Program will retain the delegate talent that the Hop DAO has attracted; its continued existence will allow future delegates to join the Hop DAO and allocate resources to improving the Hop Protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>How did the program work?</strong></p>\n<p>Delegates are required to vote on proposals and communicate their rationale for voting in their delegate thread on the Hop DAO Forum.</p>\n<p>Under the current Delegate Compensation Program, delegates are compensated using a formula where delegate incentives increase with the amount of HOP delegated, but in a decreasing fashion. This means that a small delegate will receive a greater incentive per voting weight than a large delegate, but a larger delegate will receive more.</p>\n<p>Delegates utilise this <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/1672223\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dune Querry 3</a> to ascertain their lowest level of Hop for that month and use this visualization <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/20u1ujbx4k\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">graph 1</a> to ascertain the incentives they are due according to their lowest amount of Hop for that month.</p>\n<p>Finally, delegates would self-report under a thread dedicated to reporting delegate eligibility each month. The following information would be required of a delegate.</p>\n<p>Vote participation percent = (Number of proposals voted upon √∑ all proposals) * 100</p>\n<p>Communication participation percentage = Number of proposals referenced with voting position and reasoning for that position √∑ all proposals ) * 100</p>\n<p>Lowest Amount of Hop for the period</p>\n<p>Incentives to be paid out.</p>\n<p><strong>Previous Changes to the Program</strong></p>\n<p>Sequel to the feedback provided in the previous proposal, the following changes were implemented in the previous renewal proposal.<br>\nThere shall be a new formula used to calculate incentives.<br>\nWhere:<br>\nI = Incentives to be received<br>\nh = lowest level of HOP delegated that month<br>\nM = Multiplier based on consecutive participation periods</p>\n<p>To calculate the multiplier (M), we can use the following formula:</p>\n<p>M = 1 + (0.1 * P)</p>\n<p>Where:<br>\nP = Number of consecutive completed 6-month participation periods (capped at a certain value, e.g., 5)</p>\n<p>This multiplier starts at 1 for new delegates and increases by 0.1 for each <em>consecutive</em> completed 6-month participation period, capped at a certain value (e.g., 1.5 after five periods).</p>\n<p>The Participation rate would be removed; therefore, new delegates who reach the 90,000 threshold could join as delegates at any time.</p>\n<p>The incentive formula would be amended to include a Multiplier based on consecutive participation periods.</p>\n<p>The primary import of these changes is that new delegates can join Hop Governance at any time, while old delegates are incentivized to continue participating.</p>\n<p>There is no opt-in or opt-out mechanism. Delegates will have to self-report to receive compensation.</p>\n<p><strong>Specification</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal requests for the Hop Delegate Incentivization Program to be renewed for another twelve months; the program will retain all the guidelines and procedures laid down by the<a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial/376\"> original proposal 18</a>, its <a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/hip-4-amendment-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial/559\">subsequent amendment 11</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-renewal-of-the-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial/852\">amendment in previous renewal</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps.</strong></p>\n<p>If this proposal passes, the Hop DAO Delegate Incentivization Program will continue for another twelve months.</p>\n            <p><small>23 posts - 10 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-renewal-of-the-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial-3rd-period/1097\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-renewal-of-the-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial-3rd-period/1097","pubDate":"Sat, 27 Jan 2024 01:26:46 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.hop.exchange-topic-1097"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-renewal-of-the-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial-3rd-period/1097.rss","#text":"RFC: Renewal of the Hop Delegate Incentivization Trial (3rd Period)"}},{"title":"[RFC] V2 Open questions (financial perspective)","dc:creator":"0xLev1","category":"üó≥Meta-Governance","description":"<h1><a name=\"related-discussions-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#related-discussions-1\"></a><strong>Related discussion(s)</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-hop-treasury-management-framework/1024/12\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[RFC] - Hop Treasury Management Framework - #12 by francom</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-treasury-diversification-protocol-owned-liquidity-multichain-hop-eth-lps/1046\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[RFC] Treasury Diversification &amp; Protocol Owned Liquidity (multichain HOP/ETH LPs)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-head-of-dao-governance-and-operations-role/1089\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[RFC] Head of DAO Governance and Operations Role</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#rationale-2\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>We have a V2 launch coming up soon, and we need to ensure that we have all financial aspects covered.

Hop DAO has had help from several groups since its inception. GFX Labs was the first to help with DAO operations given their extensive experience in governance and ops. When they exited the DAO, StableLab took on the role of helping the DAO with operations and governance initiatives. Unfortunately, StableLab has decided to refocus their resources elsewhere during this prolonged bear market and have recently exited the DAO.</p>\n<p>While it is hard during this extensive bear market to retain talent‚Ä¶. the show must go on. With that in mind, I propose creating a new role titled Head of DAO Operations where an individual is responsible for the day-to-day operations acting as a liaison between the different participants and subgroups of the DAO such as; core developer team, grants committee, ambassadors, delegates, multisig signers and more.</p>\n<p>The Head of DAO Operations is not to be construed as a central figure of authority but more like the glue that connects different aspects of the DAO and makes sure there is cross collaboration and communication and helps propagate personal responsibilities for each of the DAOs subgroups. It is imperative for the Head of DAO ops to be fully aligned. Therefore, to qualify for the role one must have been materially active in the DAO for at least 6-months, having attended community calls, posted on the forum, used the hop bridge, held hop).</p>\n<p>The Head of DAO Ops will be in charge of community calls, the governance forum (pushing proposals from start to finish with the respective author), and pushing along the grants committee, ambassador program and multisig signers.</p>\n<p>Additional responsibilities:<br>\n‚ÅÉ evaluating and defining compensation for existing and new committees and their members<br>\n‚ÅÉ Assigning budgets to committees<br>\n‚ÅÉ Verifying the data posted each month for the delegate compensation thread<br>\n‚ÅÉ Providing an overview of DAO ops at a regular cadence<br>\n‚ÅÉ Oversee and manage the transition from old committee members to new committee members when appropriate<br>\n‚ÅÉ More rapidly iterate on HIP amendments when they are needed<br>\n‚ÅÉ Help reform the grants committee and handle some of the ops side<br>\n‚ÅÉ 30 hours a month (1.5xday)<br>\n‚ÅÉ If a good faith effort to accomplish the tasks set forth as the Head of DAO ops is not made, the DAO will not pay the compensation.</p>\n<p>This role should go through a 6-month initial term to make sure DAO operations continue to run smoothly in the short term while preparing for a long-term solution regarding ongoing operations. Since this role requires constant participation and time commitment, I believe compensation for this role should be $3k/month with a 1-year vesting period.</p>\n<p>Compensation to be made in HOP token.

It will also establish a Lead Community Moderator role and sets up an ongoing moderator compensation program to continue rewarding these contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"background-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#background-1\"></a>Background</h2>\n<p>Since Hop‚Äôs inception over a year ago, the role of Community Moderator has been entirely voluntary. This arrangement served the DAO well and attracted moderators driven by genuine enthusiasm for the protocol rather than financial incentives. However, it is now crucial to establish a structured framework for rewarding, managing, and training these contributors.</p>\n<p>The Hop Community Moderators watch the Hop Discord and forum 24/7 to mitigate spam, scammers, technical difficulties, and much more. This includes manually banned approximately 5,000 Discord scammer or spam profiles, fielding an endless stream of questions from the community, and keeping appropriate stakeholders informed to ensure technical issues are resolved quickly. They‚Äôve played an essential role in building Hop into the trusted platform it is today.</p>\n<p>Rxpwnz has taken on a leadership role on the moderator team and regularly goes above and beyond basic moderator responsibilities. He regularly delves into technical and operational security topics including assisting with stuck transactions and reporting phishing websites to <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arxpwnz+is%3Aclosed\">Metamask</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g14gRhNhqzjrg7bfvzzp11vhFj2HbStC/view?usp=sharing\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RiZYZdVIM-IsZ5zuwSp2WmlVfuVpa3rX/view?usp=sharing\">DNS providers</a> leading to their rapid deactivation. He continually contributes ideas to enhance various aspects of Discord operations. This includes integrating Discord bots and streamlining channels to ensure they remain clean and topic-related. During Arbitrum Bridge Week, he even provided users with his own <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6_jEzl6ZE1AkEpkAshG0eU4reOTp4aCsDt2bBm0owo/edit\">personal funds</a> to help cover gas fees when needed.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"retrospective-rewards-for-dedicated-moderators-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#retrospective-rewards-for-dedicated-moderators-2\"></a>Retrospective Rewards for Dedicated Moderators</h2>\n<p>Our community moderators have been actively contributing for over 18 months, and it‚Äôs time to recognize and reward their invaluable efforts in driving Hop‚Äôs growth.</p>\n<p>Rxpwnz has been consistently engaged in a wide range of responsibilities, which include Discord and Forum moderation, managing Hop Guild, enhancing operational security (OpSec) by identifying and taking down over 150 phishing sites impersonating Hop, contributing to business development discussions regarding potential partnerships, engaging with developers interested in collaborating with Hop, and offering troubleshooting and improvement assistance. We propose a compensation rate of $3,000/month, both for his active contributions and in retrospective recognition starting June 9th, 2022. This compensation will be divided in a 50:50 ratio between $USDC and $HOP, with the latter being linearly vested over a 1-year period.</p>\n<p>Our other moderators, while relatively less active, have been instrumental in moderation tasks and effectively conveying information about issues to key stakeholders. To acknowledge their important contributions, we propose one-time bonuses as follows:</p>\n<p>Nauzystan: $4,000<br>\nCai: $2,000<br>\nHossein: $1,000<br>\nAbruzy: $1,000</p>\n<p>Compensation for these bonuses will also be distributed in a 50:50 ratio between $USDC and $HOP, with the latter subject to linear vesting over 1 year.</p>\n<p>The amount of $HOP distributed for retroactive payments should be calculated using the time-weighted average price from the launch of Hop DAO to the date of this proposal passing. Partial months should be prorated appropriately.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"establishing-a-lead-community-moderator-role-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#establishing-a-lead-community-moderator-role-3\"></a>Establishing a Lead Community Moderator Role</h2>\n<p>This proposal establishes a Lead Community Moderator role initially filled by Rxpwnz.

Each month, approximately $2,000 worth of $HOP tokens will be made available to the Lead Community Moderator to distribute to the moderator team when appropriate. The lead moderator will conduct monthly assessments, guided by considerations of individual involvement and performance (activity and delivered Key Performance Indicators) to determine compensation.

Protocol Managed Liquidity","dc:creator":"Copra_finance","category":"üê∞Hop Ecosystem","description":"<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Summary</strong></strong><br>\nCopra Finance wishes to partner with Hop Protocol in issuing a protocol loan. The loan would not be used for token liquidity, but to finance protocol activities, offering an additional source of revenue, as proof of the reliability of Hop‚Äôs smart contracts, and to prove that Hop can consistently generate revenue to repay the loan interest.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Introduction</strong></strong><br>\nCopra Finance helps defi protocols set up loans to help finance their growth and remain competitive. Our high-level goal is to create a secondary market for ‚Äòinternet corporate bonds‚Äô, comprised of defi protocol loans. We aim to help defi protocols shore up liquidity without distributing native token incentives, although we can help facilitate OTC-style token deals after loans reach maturity. To reiterate, our liquidity deals are not to support your native token, but rather to offer lenders a safe way to finance your growth, with the option to buy some of your native tokens at maturity should they want to.</p>\n<p>For our lenders, who are typically tradfi institutions or whales, our bonds are a fixed-income product with ETH, BTC, or stablecoins. Many defi protocols rely on spoken word deals with whales, whose reliability cannot be assured. Copra loans can provide a safer, fairer and more flexible arrangement for both parties.</p>\n<p>We are currently developing an Arbitrum Opportunity Vault, a collection of small/medium-sized protocols that wish to finance their growth, we aim to support them by providing them with reliable liquidity. We have also applied for an Arbitrum grant, and if successful will be able to support our borrowers with additional offerings from the grant.</p>\n<p>All aspects of our loans are facilitated on-chain through our smart contracts, including a credit account that manages funds, a revenue escrow account that receives future income, and a token warrant account for managing native token deals. Funds can only be deployed from our smart contract credit account to whitelisted pools.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>How a Copra Loan Could Benefit Hop</strong></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>For borrowers such as Hop, a loan would help to boost TVL and overcome any liquidity bottlenecks. In the case of Hop, loan liquidity would be used to <strong>support your bridge pools</strong>.</li>\n<li>Seeing as Hop already has considerable TVL, additional benefits of interest include the ability to <strong>generate additional income</strong>. Any yield generated by the loan funds above the preset revenue escrow ceiling will be returned to Hop at maturity.</li>\n<li>Facilitating deals with whales or other large lenders such as protocols, to provide Hop with <strong>rearrangeable, fixed-duration liquidity</strong>. In turn, these lenders get a share of protocol revenue to satisfy the loan interest and are paid in the same currency as the loan principal.</li>\n<li>Seeing one of our bonds through to maturity can help <strong>give confidence to future liquidity providers</strong>. We intend to generate the equivalent of a credit score to be used as proof of your reliability. Being able to repay the loan with interest will also prove Hop‚Äôs ability to consistently generate revenue. This may also allow you to assess the validity of your v2 fee structure in supporting Dao activities.</li>\n<li>Finally, you will have the opportunity to <strong>sell some of your Hop tokens to lenders at maturity</strong> at a predetermined price, this can support your protocol token‚Äôs current valuation, and the lenders, having been repaid the loan principal with interest interest will not be under pressure to sell.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From looking at your liquidity pools it is clear that the majority of Hop‚Äôs liquidity is in the form of USDC and ETH (over $2m and $8m respectively), hence these would likely be the currency of choice for such a loan, and hence the currency of the loan interest.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/uploads/default/original/1X/7036a405d125518966f9454698bb5e6ed38b88ed.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/uploads/default/7036a405d125518966f9454698bb5e6ed38b88ed\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/uploads/default/optimized/1X/7036a405d125518966f9454698bb5e6ed38b88ed_2_690x450.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"g0GxIFJXsWjlc4MBKIiCb7eyP1P\" width=\"690\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/uploads/default/optimized/1X/7036a405d125518966f9454698bb5e6ed38b88ed_2_690x450.png, https://forum.hop.exchange/uploads/default/optimized/1X/7036a405d125518966f9454698bb5e6ed38b88ed_2_1035x675.png 1.5x, https://forum.hop.exchange/uploads/default/original/1X/7036a405d125518966f9454698bb5e6ed38b88ed.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"313545\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Your ETH pool for example contains many whales and also protocols. Copra‚Äôs smart contracts could help to facilitate fixed duration and predictable liquidity deals with any of these lenders. The lenders would receive fixed income from your protocol revenue, and you would receive their liquidity at a fixed interest rate that could be repurposed or rearranged as most beneficial for the protocol. Deals could be made with protocols such as Beefy to enhance their pool yield offerings in exchange for predictable liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Loan Terms</strong></strong><br>\nThe ‚Äòrisk-free‚Äô yield of defi comes from staked ETH, naturally, the yield on defi protocol bonds must come with a higher yield due to the risk premium. We currently offer 14% APR to our lenders but are open to negotiation.<br>\nHowever, we are open to discussing loan size and duration, as well as servicing any other liquidity needs.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Bottom Line</strong></strong><br>\nThe bottom line is that Copra‚Äôs trustless loans can be used to support Hop in whatever ways are needed. The deployed liquidity is rearrangeable and reliable due to its fixed duration. The entire process is automated by smart contracts, the funds will be under the custody of our credit account.</p>\n<p>We are currently developing our product and forming bonds with our first few clients. We have detailed protocol docs, which can be shared on request. Any questions and feedback are welcomed, and we hope to be able to form a long-lasting partnership with Hop.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/copra-loans-protocol-managed-liquidity/1059\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/copra-loans-protocol-managed-liquidity/1059","pubDate":"Thu, 07 Dec 2023 06:34:16 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.hop.exchange-topic-1059"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/copra-loans-protocol-managed-liquidity/1059.rss","#text":"Copra Loans - Protocol Managed Liquidity"}},{"title":"[Request for Comment] Incentivize Hop AMMs on Supported and Upcoming Chains","dc:creator":"shanefontaine","category":"üê∞Hop Ecosystem","description":"<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Hop V1 is on track to be deployed on a number of new chains in the Ethereum ecosystem that have already gone through Hop governance.

If accepted, there will not be a new post/vote for the addition of incentives on the new chains since this is meant to account for all of them.</p>\n<p>This post is meant to open up the discussion about the addition of incentives on these chains and their respective amounts.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-amounts-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#proposed-amounts-2\"></a>Proposed Amounts</h2>\n<p>This proposal seeks to set up an incentive program for the ETH AMM on Linea, Polygon zkEVM, Scroll, zkSync, and PGN. The incentive values below were calculated by looking at the TVL of each chain and comparing it to the TVL of Optimism and multiplying that ratio with the HOP incentives on the ETH bridge on Optimism to derive a value. A multiplier of 3x was added to account for the potential growth of these chains given that they have been live for far shorter than the reference chain, Optimism. The exact formula used is:</p>\n<p><code>HOP Incentive Amount = (Chain TVL / Optimism TVL) * Optimism ETH Bridge HOP Incentives * 3</code></p>\n<p>Using the TVL <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary\">data from L2Beat</a> on December 5th, 2023 and applying that calculation to each chain, we get:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Chain</th>\n<th>TVL (Million)</th>\n<th>HOP Incentives / Month</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Optimism</strong></td>\n<td><strong>$4,130.00</strong></td>\n<td><strong>346,800</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Linea</td>\n<td>$175.00</td>\n<td>44,085</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon zkEVM*</td>\n<td>$114.00</td>\n<td>28,718</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scroll</td>\n<td>$42.90</td>\n<td>10,807</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>zkSync</td>\n<td>$536.00</td>\n<td>135,025</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PGN**</td>\n<td>$1.53</td>\n<td>385</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>*<em>The <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x3b59bfaf298282c45d088ff972e4d641c649fe60532c29bf7c6ed3b798e1c7ea\">original Polygon zkEVM proposal</a> asked to reallocate 15% of the current Polygon PoS chain‚Äôs incentives to the Polygon zkEVM chain.

This move aims to mitigate the current skew between HOP‚Äôs circulating market cap and its fully diluted value, which stands as an impediment to stable price discovery and large-scale, value-aligned investment in HOP from non-private parties.</p>\n<p>HOP‚Äôs circulating to fully diluted supply is far too skewed (4M circulating mkt cap, 40M fully diluted value FDV). This skew makes it difficult for proper price discovery to occur and even more difficult for anyone to make a large, opinionated allocation to HOP at a stable valuation in the open market. Moreover, as the HOP token is playing an increasingly growing role in the protocol, POL increases accessibility for the token while generating fees for the DAO. This proposal brings idle HOP into the market, makes it productive, increases market liquidity, and retains DAO ownership.</p>\n<p>Generally, the amounts are small and ensure a continued reserve of HOP in the treasury for future developmental use cases such as grants, incentives, and other value-creating opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details</strong><br>\nThis proposal would seek to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Allocate 1,500,000 HOP ($57,000 @ $.038) and 57,000 USDC from the treasury for distribution to Mainnet, Optimism, and Arbitrum. <strong>The total value is ~$114,000 ($57,000 + $57,000).</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sell 57,000 USDC for ETH</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bridge HOP and ETH to each chain in the predetermined proportions (see calculations further down in proposal):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mainnet:</strong> 49.33%</li>\n<li><strong>Optimism:</strong> 30.04%</li>\n<li><strong>Arbitrum:</strong> 20.75%</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deposit HOP/ETH liquidity into DEXes</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mainnet:</strong> Uniswap v3 0.3% tier (full range?)</li>\n<li><strong>Optimism:</strong> Velodrome v2</li>\n<li><strong>Arbitrum:</strong> Camelot v2 (potentially v3?)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lastly, deposit veNFT into compounding Relay strategy created for us by Velodrome (including this in this proposal, because it‚Äôs DEX related and fairly low stakes)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each chain/dex‚Äôs proportion of the 1,500,000 HOP is decided as a blended percentage of each DEX‚Äôs HOP liquidity &amp; HOP 24 hr volume, and each chain‚Äôs percentage of Hop protocol‚Äôs bridging volumes (from volume.hop.exchange). Current HOP/ETH liquidity across chains is ~$350,000, so this proposal would increase the outstanding liquidity by ~33%.

Unfortunately, after the comment period and during the live vote, a member of the community highlighted a new rule that slightly predated the ambassadors disallowing use of OP received through a grant to be used in governance.

On top of this, I not only attended, but also frequently presented on nearly all of the Hop community calls during the past 6 months and have made myself available through Discord and the forum during this time as well.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"compensation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#compensation-5\"></a>Compensation</h2>\n<p>Full Compensation: 155239.327296 HOP</p>\n<pre><code>$500 * 6 months / .0386 HOP (price as of 11:45 ET Oct 29, 6 months after program launch) = 77619.6636481 // Optimism Compensation\n77619.6636481 * 2 (including work done on behalf of Hop DAO at Arbitrum) = 155239.327296\n</code></pre>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/optimism-retrospective-quarterly-report-thread/1044\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/optimism-retrospective-quarterly-report-thread/1044","pubDate":"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 02:08:49 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.hop.exchange-topic-1044"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/optimism-retrospective-quarterly-report-thread/1044.rss","#text":"Optimism Retrospective Quarterly Report Thread"}},{"title":"Arbitrum Retrospective Quarterly Report Thread","dc:creator":"max-andrew","category":"üê∞Hop Ecosystem","description":"<h2><a name=\"hop-protocols-governance-power-changes-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#hop-protocols-governance-power-changes-1\"></a>Hop Protocol‚Äôs Governance Power (Changes)</h2>\n<p>Q1<br>\n0 ARB</p>\n<p>Q2<br>\n0 ARB</p>\n<h2><a name=\"number-of-votes-done-by-the-ambassador-including-any-missed-vote-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#number-of-votes-done-by-the-ambassador-including-any-missed-vote-2\"></a>Number of votes done by the ambassador (including any missed vote)</h2>\n<p>Q1<br>\nN/A</p>\n<p>Q2<br>\nN/A</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposals-are-written-by-the-ambassador-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#proposals-are-written-by-the-ambassador-3\"></a>Proposals are written by the ambassador</h2>\n<p>Q1 ‚Üí Q2<br>\nIn contrast to the experience of entering the Optimism program with an existing ambassador multisig and OP voting power ready to be delegated, the Arbitrum program was initiated entirely from scratch. As such, there were a number of moving parts that needed to be planned and orchestrated. I personally oversaw this process including, but not limited to, drafting a proposal to claim the ARB provided to Hop as part of their airdrop, creating a community multisig on the Arbitrum network to manage these funds, and directing those signers to delegate these funds to the ambassador multisig I created.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x11cc2f01417b75e257b4029f19f06102b70e126a2ce7cfda272ad24f485e73da\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x11cc2f01417b75e257b4029f19f06102b70e126a2ce7cfda272ad24f485e73da</a></p>\n<p>While this process sounds straightforward, there were a number of considerations and challenges associated with it. Some of these include the structure for how the Arbitrum community multisig should be established and who the signers should be. These difficulties were exacerbated by the necessary process of the multisig signer elections and the subsequent handoff. Despite this, I continued to oversee this process and communicate with Hop Labs how we might be able to get it across the finish line. The ARB claim and send to the multisig was ultimately accomplished during the Treasury Diversification Tally vote and I have since continued to push for the final delegation step to be completed in the soonest possible multisig cycle.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hop/proposal/9784707434912981798745451387039890995483352876768683443315035555006717324695?chart=0\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hop/proposal/9784707434912981798745451387039890995483352876768683443315035555006717324695?chart=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tally</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/uploads/default/original/1X/3dda7bc4740446e23f98d39fac496d21698ed77c.png\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"DB87D4\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hop/proposal/9784707434912981798745451387039890995483352876768683443315035555006717324695?chart=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tally | Hop Proposal</a></h3>\n\n  <p>[HIP-38] Treasury Diversification</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<h2><a name=\"progress-of-business-development-opportunities-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange#progress-of-business-development-opportunities-4\"></a>Progress of business development opportunities</h2>\n<p>Q1 ‚Üí Q2<br>\nSimilarly contrasting the experience with the fairly established Optimism DAO, the newer Arbitrum DAO had yet to establish formal community calls.

These communications and relationships led naturally to my participation in Tally‚Äôs Delegation Week where I continued my advocacy for Hop and made the case for users to delegate their ARB to the Hop ambassador program. In fact, I was invited to speak on Arbitrum‚Äôs Twitter Space and leveraged those connections to generate an offer from the community leads at Arbitrum to have Hop present V2 on a future Space when ready.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/m0xandrew/status/1661044107978866688?s=20\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://x.com/m0xandrew/status/1661044107978866688?s=20</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://x.com/m0xandrew/status/1661756066227531778?s=20\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://x.com/m0xandrew/status/1661756066227531778?s=20</a></p>\n<p>More recently, following from conversations had over the last 6 months in Hop community calls and on the Discord, it was agreed that the ambassadors should be flexible and patient with the necessary process of the multisig handoff and shift focus to gathering information that would be useful for Hop Labs. I communicated directly with Labs at this time to determine what information would be most useful and was able to formulate a number of questions around finality and Arbitrum‚Äôs vision of bridging. A highlight of my ambassadorship and, in part, a culmination of the work spent strengthening connections with the Arbitrum community was getting to have multiple conversations with builders at Offchain Labs working on Arbitrum all the way up to the founders themselves while at Pragma New York. These conversations generated a number of unique insights that will provide Hop with competitive advantages by enabling us to build towards the future leaders in Arbitrum envision, rather than the state we are currently in.

While this is the first iteration of the Ambassador program, I would like to thank the other ambassadors (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/u/dybsy\">@dybsy</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/u/max-andrew\">@max-andrew</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/u/frisson\">@Frisson</a>) for participating and providing ample feedback on how to ameliorate the program.</p>\n<p>The ambassador program kicked off with three protocols; Arbitrum, Optimism, and Rocketpool.</p>\n<p>The main responsibilities of the ambassadors for season one was;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voting on behalf of Hop DAO on the respective protocol‚Äôs governance.</li>\n<li>Acquire more delegated votes for the ambassador wallet.</li>\n<li>Business development and work on integrations with other DAOs on top of the respective ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Be up to date on the DAO by constantly reading the governance forum and attending community calls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to recognize the time and effort that our ambassadors put into the program. For example, MaxAndrew spent time setting up the ambassador operations by creating the multisigs and posting on proposals in the Arbitrum and Optimism governance forums. Frisson lead the delegate week campaign with Tally, which was created to enhance the delegated votes for the ambassador wallets on Arbitrum and Optimism. Dybsy was instrumental in setting up the reth bridge with rocketpool. I focused most of my effort as an ambassador on integrations by reaching out to several protocols within the Arbitrum and Optimism communities, as well as attending their community calls, and some irl events without much success.</p>\n<p><strong>Problems</strong><br>\nIn my opinion, a problem with this first phase of the ambassador program was that the goals weren‚Äôt clear enough and responsibilities weren‚Äôt clearly delineated which led to stagnation and lack of focus from ambassadors, including myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Questions</strong><br>\nAmbassador compensation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While the original post stated that each ambassador shall receive $500/month for every 6-month term I believe it is a good time for the ambassadors and community to weigh in on compensation and results.<br>\no\tFrisson has stated since the beginning that he will not take compensation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong><br>\nMy proposed solution with the help of the other ambassadors and authereum labs is that we adjust the ambassador program by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding a Head of the Ambassador program which will be responsible for communicating with each ambassador twice a month to brainstorm and follow through on integration opportunities.</li>\n<li>Reducing the number of ambassadors per protocol to one so a single person is clearly responsible for the success throughout the term.</li>\n<li>Creating a budget for each ambassador to be able to incentivize other communities and its members to integrate and use Hop.</li>\n<li>Refocus ambassador responsibilities towards business development and less on governance within other protocols.</li>\n<li>Amend the compensation to a lower flat rate for the ambassadors (and the head ambassador) to a monthly rate of $200/month while adding a commission where an ambassador can request up to 10% of value created through a specific integration that they sourced and executed. This commission would be subject to a 1-year vesting period to further align the ambassadors with the protocol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In conclusion it would be great to hear any thoughts from the community on how to strengthen Hop‚Äôs ambassador program and provide feedback on any aspect of this proposal.</p>\n            <p><small>17 posts -
