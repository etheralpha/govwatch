Think reading EIP-1559 without knowing Roughgarden’s paper, EIP-1155 without OpenZeppelin’s reference implementations, or EIP-721 without its various extension EIPs.</p>\n<p>Sure, we have threads on this forum, discussions on PRs and lots of blogs/Twitter threads, but none of this information is structured and/or specific, i.e. a comment on a specific line of an EIP might be buried among other discussions and be generally hard to find. Adding this information to the EIP itself is not feasible either, since a) the line between opinions and factual information can be fuzzy, and EIPs tend to err on the side of caution b) the process to update an EIP requires several checks and discussions, which is way too much effort for a single comment or off-hand reference.</p>\n<p>For this reason, I was brainstorming about a website where endorsed users (see below) can add annotations to EIPs in the form of comments, while everyone else can upvote/downvote them. These can be either structured (e.g. standard templates for “Compare with EIP X”, “Platform X uses this EIP”, “See X for an in-depth analysis”, “Be careful of X while implementing this EIP”, which can be machine-readable) or free-form. The annotations can refer to the EIP as a whole or to specific parts of it.<br>\nTo avoid spam/malicious annotations, I’m taking inspiration from arXiv’s endorsement system. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All EIP authors and core contributors are automatically endorsed</li>\n<li>Endorsed users can endorse n other users</li>\n<li>Non-endorsers users can petition to be manually endorsed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What do you think? Would you find this useful for the ecosystem? Any problems/pitfalls you might foresee? Any useful applications?</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/annotated-eips-concept-feedback/20810\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/annotated-eips-concept-feedback/20810","pubDate":"Thu, 15 Aug 2024 12:25:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20810"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/annotated-eips-concept-feedback/20810.rss","#text":"Annotated EIPs - Concept Feedback"}},{"title":"EIP-7756 EOF/EVM Trace Specification","dc:creator":"shemnon","category":"EIPs interfaces","description":"<p>Discussion topic for <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7756\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-7756</a></p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-50371-update-log-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50371-update-log-1\"></a>Update Log</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2024-08-14: initial draft <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8799\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PR</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-50371-external-reviews-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50371-external-reviews-2\"></a>External Reviews</h4>\n<p>None as of 2024-08-14.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-50371-outstanding-issues-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50371-outstanding-issues-3\"></a>Outstanding Issues</h4>\n<p><span class=\"chcklst-box fa fa-square-o fa-fw\"></span> 2024-08-14: member name for CALLF retrun stack - <code>fdepth</code> or something else?</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7756-eof-evm-trace-specification/20806\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7756-eof-evm-trace-specification/20806","pubDate":"Thu, 15 Aug 2024 04:07:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20806"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7756-eof-evm-trace-specification/20806.rss","#text":"EIP-7756 EOF/EVM Trace Specification"}},{"title":"ePBS breakout #7, August 16 2024","dc:creator":"abcoathup","category":"Protocol Calls & happenings","description":"<h4><a name=\"p-50354-agenda-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50354-agenda-1\"></a>Agenda</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1133\" class=\"inline-onebox\">EIP-7732 breakout room #7 · Issue #1133 · ethereum/pm · GitHub</a>; moderated by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/potuz\">@potuz</a></p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-50354-notes-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50354-notes-2\"></a>Notes</h4>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://hackmd.io/@potuz/ByZVEya5A\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8f0a562a90992dd656ced3f9b9b37c942cfbde54.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"696969\" width=\"134\" height=\"134\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@potuz/ByZVEya5A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HackMD</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"268\" height=\"268\" src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5140eb4c9ddea7989a445b9aa69f8de5b716e9e0.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"264637\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@potuz/ByZVEya5A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EIP-7732 Breakout room #7 Notes - HackMD</a></h3>\n\n  <p>This meeting had very low attendance.

However, the lack of standardization across these programs has led to inefficiencies, confusion, and difficulties in managing and tracking grants across different protocols and networks. Hence I propose the creation of a unified Grant Program Standard, comprising a standardized interface and a grant registry contract. This standard aims to harmonize the processes around grant issuance, management, and tracking, ensuring a seamless experience for all participants and contributors involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, each grant program operates with its own set of rules, interfaces, and management protocols, leading to a fragmented landscape that hinders interoperability. This lack of uniformity creates several issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Inconsistent Grant Tracking</strong>: Different standards make it challenging to track grants across various platforms, leading to missed opportunities, duplicated efforts, and weak backward compatibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Complex Management</strong>: Grantees and program managers struggle with keeping the communication of their grants updated, increasing the administrative burden and potential for errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Transparency</strong>: Without a common on-chain standard, it is difficult for the community to monitor, aggregate, and audit grant programs, which can impact trust and accountability.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To address these issues, I propose the adoption of a standardized interface based on the most common fields that are crucial for the grant lifecycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Interface</strong></p>\n<p>This interface will serve as the foundational layer for all grant programs, ensuring that key information is recorded and accessible in a consistent manner across the Ethereum ecosystem:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">/// Grant Interface\nid: uin256           // Grant unique identifier\nnetwork: uint256     // Blockchain network where the grant is being developed\ngrantee: address     // Address of the person responsible for delivering and receiving the grant award\nprotocol: string     // Name of the protocol/community that issued the grant\nproject: string      // Name/Title of the project or company that received the grant\nexternalLinks[]: string // Link that redirects to the grant proposal, discussion or relative\nstartDate: uint256   // Start date for the grant development\nendDate: uint256.    // Expected completion date for the grant\nstatus: enum(Status) // Current status of the grant\ndisbursements: Disbursement // Disbursement stages based on milestones\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">/// Disbursement Struct\nfundingTokens: address[]   // Tokens that will be disbursed in this stage\nfundingAmounts: uint256[]  // Amounts of tokens to be disbursed in this stage\ndisbursed: bool[]          // Indicates if the disbursement has been made in this stage\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">/// Status Enum\nProposed,        // The grant has been proposed but not yet approved (Default)\nApproved,        // The grant has been reviewed and approved\nInProgress,      // The project is actively being worked on\nCompleted,       // The project has been completed and deliverables submitted\nCancelled,       // The grant was cancelled\nRejected         // The grant proposal was reviewed and rejected\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Grant Registry Contract</strong></p>\n<p>To complement the standardized interface, I propose the development of a Grant Registry Contract. This contract will act as a universal registry where all grants, regardless of the issuing protocol or network, can be registered, tracked, and managed. Similar to how the multicall3 works.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Universal Registration</strong>: Allows any grant program to register their grants using the standardized interface.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Management</strong>: Provides functionalities for program managers to update the status of grants, track progress, and manage funding distribution.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency and Audibility</strong>: Enables the community to view grant details, track funding allocations, and monitor progress, enhancing trust and accountability.</li>\n<li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Facilitates cross-chain and cross-protocol grant management, breaking down silos and enabling seamless interaction between different grant programs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Consideration: Use of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)</strong></p>\n<p>The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) offers a decentralized, trustless, and on-chain method to create verifiable attestations, making it an attractive option. By utilizing EAS, we could theoretically record and verify key events, such as grant approvals, disbursements, and project completions, directly on the blockchain. However, one significant challenge in applying EAS within this context is the lack of mutability due to its reliance on static schemas.</p>\n<p>In the proposed grant management system, flexibility is crucial, especially regarding the management of disbursement stages, milestone achievements, and potential changes in project scope or funding requirements. The static nature of EAS schemas limits the ability to modify attestations once they are created, which conflicts with the dynamic needs of a typical grant lifecycle where adjustments are often necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Community Feedback</strong>: I encourage feedback on the proposed interface and grant registry contract.

This new interface standardizes equity management for issuers, investors, transfer agents, and financial intermediaries. Creating a standard for a corporation requires a large industry effort. That’s why this token standard adheres to the same design principles as the <a href=\"https://www.opencaptablecoalition.com/format\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open Cap Format</a> (OCF), an industry-approved data schema for cap tables. Now everyone can adopt the same OCF-compliant token standard for Ethereum and beyond!</p>\n<p>Building off of ERC-3643 enables features such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transfer agent controls (asset freeze, account recovery, etc.)</li>\n<li>Compatibility with onchain identity management</li>\n<li>Customized compliance modules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, support for storing governing documents of the stock such as a corporate charter or stock plan have been introduced. For organizations that don’t issue stock such as partnerships or LLCs, we recommend using the equity token with one share class and refer to them as membership unit interests. Such entities should ensure that their operating agreement reflects this ownership structure.</p>\n<p>ERC-7752 brings breaking changes to ERC-3643 by requiring an additional <code>securityId</code> param in <code>forceTransfer</code>, <code>freezePartialTokens</code>, <code>unfreezePartialTokens</code> methods and <code>securityIds</code> param to <code>batchMint</code>, <code>batchBurn</code>, <code>batchForcedTransfer</code>, <code>batchFreezePartialTokens</code>, and <code>batchUnfreezePartialTokens</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally, ERC-20 breaking changes were made. This change introduces <code>shareClass</code> and <code>uri</code> parameters to the <code>mint</code> method and a <code>securityId</code> parameter to <code>burn</code>, <code>transfer</code>, and <code>transferFrom</code> methods, <code>shareClass</code> param to the <code>approve</code>, <code>increaseAllowance</code>, and <code>decreaseAllowance</code> methods, and corresponding event signatures.</p>\n<p>Assigning a unique <code>securityId</code> to all issuances of equity tokens is necessary for the ease of understanding cost basis and ease of auditing.

This ensures that every transfer of tokens is permanently recorded, providing a clear history of token ownership.</li>\n<li><strong>OCF</strong>: The event-driven architecture in OCF also ensures that every action (issuance, transfer, etc.) is recorded immutably. The OCF does not allow for altering past events.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Event-Driven Nature</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ERC-20</strong>: Token transfers in the ERC-20 standard are event-driven. Every transfer emits a <code>Transfer</code> event, which can be tracked by applications and users to monitor token movements.</li>\n<li><strong>OCF</strong>: Similarly, OCF uses events like <code>StockTransfer</code> to record the movement of securities. Each event is a discrete record in the history of the security.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Standardized Format</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ERC-20</strong>: The ERC-20 standard defines a consistent format for managing and transferring tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>OCF</strong>: The OCF also defines a standardized format for recording corporate actions, including transfers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"differences-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#differences-3\"></a>Differences</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Asset Nature</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ERC-20</strong>: ERC-20 is a standard for fungible tokens, where each token is identical and interchangeable with any other token. ERC-20 tokens typically represent assets like cryptocurrencies or utility tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>OCF</strong>: OCF deals with securities, which are often non-fungible or semi-fungible. For example, shares of stock might come with different rights, restrictions, or legends, making them distinct from one another even if they belong to the same stock class.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Transfer Mechanism</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ERC-20</strong>: In the ERC-20 standard, a transfer simply moves tokens from one address to another. The balance of the sender is decreased, and the balance of the recipient is increased in a single operation.</li>\n<li><strong>OCF</strong>: OCF requires a more complex process for transfers. It involves creating a new issuance event for the recipient and linking the old and new securities through a transfer event. This reflects the fact that securities are not merely balances to be adjusted, but distinct legal instruments that may have unique attributes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Handling Partial Transfers</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ERC-20</strong>: Partial transfers are straightforward in ERC-20, where a specified number of tokens can be transferred from one address to another, and the balance is adjusted accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>OCF</strong>: In OCF, partial transfers require creating a new security issuance for the remaining balance after the transfer. The original security is effectively split into two, with one part transferred to the new owner and the other part remaining with the original owner.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Complexity of Events</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ERC-20</strong>: The ERC-20 standard has relatively simple events (<code>Transfer</code>, <code>Approval</code>), as it is designed to manage fungible tokens that do not have complex attributes or varying legal implications.</li>\n<li><strong>OCF</strong>: OCF events are more complex, reflecting the multifaceted nature of securities.

ERC-20 tokens are primarily used for blockchain-based applications, and while they can be subject to regulation, they do not inherently carry the same legal obligations as securities.</li>\n<li><strong>OCF</strong>: The OCF is specifically designed to manage and track securities, which are heavily regulated. It accounts for legal requirements, such as stock legends, compliance with securities laws, and proper documentation of transfers, making it suitable for managing equity in real companies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"erc-pull-request-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#erc-pull-request-4\"></a>ERC Pull Request</h2>\n<aside class=\"onebox githubpullrequest\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/579\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/579\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com/ethereum/ERCs</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\">\n\n\n\n    <div class=\"github-icon-container\" title=\"Pull Request\">\n      <svg width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"github-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11 11.28V5c-.03-.78-.34-1.47-.94-2.06C9.46 2.35 8.78 2.03 8 2H7V0L4 3l3 3V4h1c.27.02.48.11.69.31.21.2.3.42.31.69v6.28A1.993 1.993 0 0 0 10 15a1.993 1.993 0 0 0 1-3.72zm-1 2.92c-.66 0-1.2-.55-1.2-1.2 0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2 0 .65-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2zM4 3c0-1.11-.89-2-2-2a1.993 1.993 0 0 0-1 3.72v6.56A1.993 1.993 0 0 0 2 15a1.993 1.993 0 0 0 1-3.72V4.72c.59-.34 1-.98 1-1.72zm-.8 10c0 .66-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2-.65 0-1.2-.55-1.2-1.2 0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2zM2 4.2C1.34 4.2.8 3.65.8 3c0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2 0 .65-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2z\"></path></svg>\n    </div>\n\n  <div class=\"github-info-container\">\n\n\n\n      <h4>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/579\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Add ERC: Equity Token</a>\n      </h4>\n\n    <div class=\"branches\">\n      <code>ethereum:master</code> ← <code>capsign:eip-equity-token</code>\n    </div>\n\n      <div class=\"github-info\">\n        <div class=\"date\">\n          opened <span class=\"discourse-local-date\" data-format=\"ll\" data-date=\"2024-08-07\" data-time=\"06:39:25\" data-timezone=\"UTC\">06:39AM - 07 Aug 24 UTC</span>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"user\">\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/mrosendin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">\n            <img alt=\"mrosendin\" src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ebb1228880002ac21524028617d9cd468f416cb.jpeg\" class=\"onebox-avatar-inline\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" data-dominant-color=\"B4A197\">\n            mrosendin\n          </a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"lines\" title=\"13 commits changed 1 files with 617 additions and 0 deletions\">\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/579/files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">\n            <span class=\"added\">+617</span>\n            <span class=\"removed\">-0</span>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  <div class=\"github-row\">\n    <p class=\"github-body-container\">Forum discussion at https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7752-equity-token/20735</p>\n  </div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n            <p><small>5 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7752-equity-token/20735\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7752-equity-token/20735","pubDate":"Wed, 07 Aug 2024 06:18:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20735"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7752-equity-token/20735.rss","#text":"ERC-7752: Equity Token"}},{"title":"ERC-7750: Decentralized Employment System (DES)","dc:creator":"jamesavechives","category":"ERCs","description":"<h3><a name=\"body-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#body-1\"></a>Body:</h3>\n<p><strong>Link to PR</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/573\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-7750 Pull Request</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction:</h3>\n<p>This topic is dedicated to the discussion of ERC-7750: Decentralized Employment System (DES).

Although EIP-191 defines different versions serving different purposes, versions <code>0x00</code> and <code>0x45</code> (E) do not serve the same purpose.</p>\n<p>In this issue, we can see that EIP-191 was almost fully supported, but precedence led to only versions 0x45 and 0x01 being implemented, dropping version 0x00.</p>\n<p>Due to this, several apps have deviated from version 0x00, although it makes more sense to use it than 0x45. For example, in the issue mentioned above, the team deviated from 0x00 and chose 0x45, even though a smart contract account (Multisig) should handle verification and signing for one intended validator address.</p>\n<p>This was the issue where support for EIP-191 Full was being worked on: <a href=\"https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/1566\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub Issue</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"support-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#support-4\"></a>Support</h2>\n<p>We see many members of the ETH ecosystem tired of the hacks that happen due to blind signing. Even if this standard is not perfect, it at least provides an idea of which verifier will verify the message. If you trust the verifier, then it’s one extra step towards safety (not full safety as users can’t know what bytes they are signing, but still).</p>\n<p>In the Metamask forum, it received support and was praised by <a href=\"https://x.com/nicksdjohnson\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">nick.eth</a>, Lead developer of ENS &amp; Ethereum Foundation alum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://x.com/0xYamen/status/1790736305539661977\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Nick’s Tweet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://community.metamask.io/t/add-support-for-eipe-191-version-0-intended-validator-data/28940\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Metamask Forum - 15+ Votes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Currently, signing messages relies heavily on ERC-191 version 0x45 (<code>eth_sign</code>) and <a>EIP-712</a> (<code>eth_signTypedData</code>). While EIP-712 provides a more structured approach, it is often seen as complex. On the other hand, ERC-191 version 0x45 is widely used but poses significant phishing risks due to the lack of data parsing.</p>\n<p>ERC-191 defines three versions: 0x45, 0x01, and 0x00. This proposal aims to fully support ERC-191 by introducing the rpc call for 0x00 version, which enables signing data with an intended validator address. This new method will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable more dApps to use ERC-191 version 0x00 without using raw signing methods which might be dangerous and restricted in few wallets.</li>\n<li>Enhance security by parsing data and displaying the intended validator address, reducing phishing risks.</li>\n<li>Provide a simpler alternative to EIP-712, offering a balance between usability and security.</li>\n<li>Be particularly relevant for smart contract accounts, allowing signing with a specific intended validator address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the rise of smart contract accounts and the reliance on signatures to improve UX, the need for supporting ERC-191 version 0x00 increases, especially given the prevalence of verifier smart contracts, such as Entry Points, Smart Contract Accounts, Key Managers, etc.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"wallet_signintendedvalidatordata-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#wallet_signintendedvalidatordata-7\"></a><code>wallet_signIntendedValidatorData</code></h3>\n<p>MUST calculate an Ethereum signature using <code>sign(keccak256(\"\\x19\\x00&lt;signature validator address&gt;&lt;data to sign&gt;\"))</code>.</p>\n<p>This method adds a prefix to the message to prevent malicious dApps from signing arbitrary data (e.g., a transaction) and using the signature to impersonate the victim.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"parameters-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#parameters-8\"></a>Parameters</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><code>DATA</code> - 20-byte account address: The address signing the constructed message.</li>\n<li><code>DATA</code> - 20-byte account address: The intended validator address included in the message to sign.</li>\n<li><code>DATA</code> - Data string: The data to sign.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"returns-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#returns-9\"></a>Returns</h4>\n<p><code>DATA</code> - Signature.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"example-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#example-10\"></a>Example</h4>\n<p><strong>Request:</strong></p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"bash\"><code class=\"lang-bash\">curl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"wallet_signIntendedValidatorData\",\"params\":[\"0x6aFbBC5e6AFcB251371711a6551E60ead2779Dc0\", \"0x345B918b9E06fAa7B0e56bd71Ba418F31F47FED4\", \"0x59616d656e\"], \"id\":1}'\n</code></pre>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"json\"><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"wallet_signIntendedValidatorData\",\n  \"params\": [\n    \"0x6aFbBC5e6AFcB251371711a6551E60ead2779Dc0\",\n    \"0x345B918b9E06fAa7B0e56bd71Ba418F31F47FED4\",\n    \"0x59616d656e\"\n  ],\n  \"id\": 1\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"json\"><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": \"0x4355c47d63924e8a72e509b65029052eb6c299d53a04e167c5775fd466751c9d07299936d304c153f6443dfa05f40ff007d72911b6f72307f996231605b915621c\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#rationale-11\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>The <code>wallet_signIntendedValidatorData</code> method aims to bridge the gap between the simplicity of ERC-191 version 0x45 and the structured approach of EIP-712.

However, there are areas for improvement to further secure and democratize the governance of multisig wallets, especially within decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposed-improvements-to-the-multisig-standard-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#proposed-improvements-to-the-multisig-standard-1\"></a>Proposed Improvements to the Multisig Standard</h3>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-time-based-voting-shares-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#h-1-time-based-voting-shares-2\"></a>1. Time-Based Voting Shares</h3>\n<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Many DeFi protocols are managed using multisig wallets, which control the distribution of funds and participate in critical protocol decisions. Currently, there is no effective mechanism to remove bad actors from the core governance of a DAO if they form a majority within the multisig group or a majority within the community</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Implement an election-based multisig process to address the issue of entrenched bad actors. This proposal includes the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Regular Elections</strong>: Members of the multisig wallet are elected by the community every four years. This process ensures that the control of the wallet remains in the hands of trusted and accountable members.</li>\n<li><strong>Presidential Role</strong>: The multisig can have a president or owner, who may be chosen on a different schedule from other members or this role may not be voted on at all. This role provides an additional layer of oversight and leadership.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Involvement</strong>: This standard allows the community to have an equal opportunity to influence the future of their platform through regular elections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not every DAO will require this standard, but it offers a democratic method for those that prioritize community governance.</p>\n<p>This standard can also be incorporated with:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-time-locked-transactions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#h-2-time-locked-transactions-3\"></a>2.
