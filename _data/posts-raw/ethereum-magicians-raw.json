The following story is that of a co-worker (non-developer). At some point he imported one of the test wallets into MetaMask while demoing an app to somebody at a conference, where it remained in his account list for a few months.</p>\n<p>Then, needing a new wallet to setup Gnosis Pay, looked in his Metamask and there it was, sitting at the end of the account list after his Ledger and other routinely used accounts, proceeded to go through KYC, and enter that address in, tried to fund the card but the $20 test transaction didn’t seem to go through… strange he thought. Tried sending <code>0.1 ETH</code> … but that disappeared!</p>\n<p>Initially he thought he’d been hacked, maybe it was malware, a keylogger, was his seed phrase brute forced? Fortunately… the wallet address was one of these test accounts and nothing more sinister, but up until that point there was no indication that basically every every Ethereum adjacent developer has used these accounts at one point or another.</p>\n<p>This is yet another story to add onto the giant burning fire of user frustration, this is not the first time something like this has happened - far from it - and it certainly won’t be the last.</p>\n<p>But, if we can do one simple thing in our apps, in our wallets, in our services, in our deterministic icon generators:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clearly demarcate test accounts with known keys and warn the users, as they may not realize until it’s too late</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>My suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deterministic icon generators: overlaid with a warning sign</li>\n<li>Account name auto-fill, instead of <code>Account N</code>, it could be <code>Test Account!!!

For those who don’t, it’s <a href=\"https://kiwinews.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://kiwinews.xyz</a></p>\n<p>In any case, a core UX concept is that we use temporary keys that we create in the browser, store in local storage, and use for confirmation-less signing when a user upvotes, submits a link, or leaves a comment.</p>\n<p>Now, we’ve obviously done that to provide our users with a better UX so that they don’t have to sign each interaction on the side cumbersomely using their custody wallet.</p>\n<p>The system works by delegating posting rights from your custody wallet, for example, managed by your Rainbow or Metamask wallet, to this temporary key in your local storage. We use a simple delegation protocol on Optimism. The user has to send a transaction that connects the keys onchain for the Kiwi News nodes to witness the connection.</p>\n<p>All this said a problem that has significantly lowered users’ engagement is that they naturally use multiple different browsers and devices. For example, a user may use a mobile and desktop device. Hence, creating multiple local-storage-specific keys is necessary, and leading them to delegate these keys on Optimism is necessary, too. But this is problematic because it is far from a seamless user experience. If we have to lead the user to send multiple transactions on Optimism, even if they’re virtual free in terms of costs, they cost us engagement and churn. Asking users to send transactions is scary to them and a drop-off point, so we try to avoid it.</p>\n<p>Hence, a while ago, I actually started to look into solutions that would make the local storage key less perishable, and I also became interested in finding a solution that would somehow easily synchronize keys between a user’s mobile and desktop device.</p>\n<p>In fact, with Apple and Google’s campaign to establish Passkeys more, I became really interested in them. I found out that there is the “largeBlob” extension, which allows the developer to store a small payload in iCloud. This payload is only accessible to the user when they authorize themselves with FaceID to Apple using Passkeys. This is useful as it allows me to store a full Ethereum private key in the largeBlob and retrieve it from any Apple device the user has later on.</p>\n<p>So I ended up implementing Passkeys into my app, and it is actually fairly usable on Apple devices. The user can back up the temporary key using the largeBlob extension, and then upon “Connecting their Wallet,” they can consider “Connecting with Passkeys,” which essentially prompts them to authenticate themselves and then downloads the Ethereum private key from iCloud using largeBlob.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8b7b2f3d064f8ce22238c9dda7eb47094bc40e60.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/8b7b2f3d064f8ce22238c9dda7eb47094bc40e60\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-06-05 at 07.30.59\"><img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/8/8b7b2f3d064f8ce22238c9dda7eb47094bc40e60_2_690x489.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-06-05 at 07.30.59\" data-base62-sha1=\"jTUhYPQJZDwztSk4WIdSinZyR8Y\" width=\"690\" height=\"489\" srcset=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/8/8b7b2f3d064f8ce22238c9dda7eb47094bc40e60_2_690x489.png, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/8/8b7b2f3d064f8ce22238c9dda7eb47094bc40e60_2_1035x733.png 1.5x, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/8/8b7b2f3d064f8ce22238c9dda7eb47094bc40e60_2_1380x978.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EAEAEC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Honestly, this was great because I actually don’t have much concerns about storing this temporary key on iCloud:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The temporary keys in Kiwi News are technically revocable onchain, and so if they ever leak or there are safety concerns, we could ask users to revoke their delegation.</li>\n<li>These keys aren’t meant to hold any funds. Their purpose is strictly to post content on behalf of the custody wallet and so, for a user who’s willing to opt in, I think it’s totally fair to post them to iCloud. That said, Kiwi News can be used entirely with your Ethereum wallet and you never actually have to delegate to a temporary wallet, so using Passkeys is optional as of now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, with that out of the way, let me tell you the caveats to using Passkeys:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple and Google are fighting about integrating the “largeBlob” extension. My reading is that Google wants to go forward with PRF instead of “largeBlob,” and so my understanding is that PRF won’t allow developers to store arbitrary data.</li>\n<li>While there seems to be momentum for RIP-7212 for secp256r1, using this curve for Kiwi News (which would be reasonable) would mean that the user still has to authorize themselves pretty frequently using FaceID when signing stuff (which isn’t really a good trade-off for a social media site).</li>\n<li>As of now, the Passkeys integration that we’ve done has terrible browser and OS support. It basically exclusively works for Safari on Mac and iOS devices. Chromium-based browsers don’t seem to work because of Google’s unwillingness to implement them. iOS 16 devices don’t work. And there is a mysterious bug that if users use 1Password on iOS to manage their Passkeys, it breaks our entire flow. That said, it is my assessment that this entire situation will take years and not months to be fixed, too, which may be time that we don’t have as a startup.</li>\n<li>Finally, I think for an Android and Mac user, Passkeys will never seamlessly work as Google and Apple have decided that their respective solutions will only ever work well “in their ecosystem.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So having found out all of this through integrating with Passkeys, it has made me feel rather pessimistic about their future, so I started looking for alternatives.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem for users, recently, I’ve started considering privy another time, and I found that they perfectly solve our use case. For the sake of simplicity, I’m going to refer to the specific solution as privy, although there are also alternatives such as web3auth or dynamic, which, to my knowledge, all provide roughly the same service. My layman’s understanding of its inner workings is that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can connect their wallets as usual, and privy takes care of sending the signature request, etc.</li>\n<li>But privy also allows to provision so-called “embedded wallets,” which are (on a UX-level) essentially equivalent to the temporary keys that Kiwi News currently stores in the browser’s local storage, except that privy encrypts these keys, stores them on their servers (or in an iframe, I’m not sure how it works exactly), but in any case, this allows a privy-using developer to generate an embedded wallet that can be synced across a user’s multiple devices and browsers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While privy is often touted as a tool to onboard new users to crypto, I’m actually not interested in allowing a user to, for example, start trying my site with a Google-login or whatever, but, instead, I find it really useful that embedded wallets can be synced across devices!</p>\n<p>So, to me, as having already spent months trying to come up with a reasonable solution for my users, and considering that this issue really kills engagement on the site, I find it now quite tempting to integrate with privy. This is because privy, as opposed to other solutions, seems to work independently of whether Apple and Google find a solution to the largeBlob conflict. privy’s embedded wallet synchronization doesn’t rely on browsers finishing to implement new features, it just relies on a user being able to sign through the SIWE process.</p>\n<p>Now, this integration, however, obviously comes with a caveat, which is that it will allow privy to hold my users’ keys hostage. What do I mean by that?</p>\n<p>If I lead all my users to create an embedded wallet with privy, and so their temporary key is now stored with privy servers, then for my site to function, I will have to continue integrating with privy - and if I ever want to migrate away, I’d have to ask all my users to send a transaction to Optimism to delegate a new key. So logically, this will also allow privy to charge us quite a bit in the future. And it makes us reliant on them to provide a safe and properly functioning service.</p>\n<p>In fact, I think, as of now, this entire situation doesn’t even yet warrant writing an Ethereum Magicians post, but I feel like there is a greater pattern at play here where companies try to intentionally capture a user’s keys because they know that this will increase their app’s moat.</p>\n<p>Without trying to sound too accusatory, I think you can also see this with Warpcast’s strategy to generate their own Ethereum key in the app, as this is done to lock down the user’s key and hence make it rather unlikely for the user to swap into other clients/apps with that key as importing and exporting of seed phrases isn’t recommended and a scary act. All of this increases the defensibility of building their app. It makes it harder for others to compete as users are being locked into the ecosystem/app.</p>\n<p>So, looking at how privy works and that it makes it very unlikely that, with integrating it, I will give my users the capability to “exit” with their embedded wallets, I couldn’t help but wonder what open-source alternatives exist that also address all my concerns above.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that, at least for a site like mine, which doesn’t need the keys to hold actual money, there don’t seem to be that many requirements that would complicate an integration.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I feel like this use case is integral for anyone building crypto consumer use cases as temporary wallet keys must inevitably somehow be synced across devices and browsers, and since the more financial-minded self-custody wallets (and Google and Apple) don’t seem to be too interested in providing solutions here. Their interest is in locking down the keys and keeping them safe instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Hence I would love to connect and hear other’s thoughts on this!</strong></p>\n<p>I feel like I’m pretty much in the trenches here as I’m one of the few who have attempted to build an actual social consumer use case with the Ethereum wallet stack that doesn’t primarily deal with sending funds around.</p>\n<p>So I’d be super happy if this post actually had an impact where it’d change the strategy of some wallet providers in the future, where they start to pay attention to these use cases to help users keep custody of their keys.</p>\n<p>Or, in case I haven’t done my research, it’d be helpful if there was something like a privy that I could somehow self-administer so that I’m not giving up control of my users’ keys to give them a better user experience.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/open-source-alternatives-to-privy-web3auth-and-dynamic/20209\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/open-source-alternatives-to-privy-web3auth-and-dynamic/20209","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 05:41:56 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20209"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/open-source-alternatives-to-privy-web3auth-and-dynamic/20209.rss","#text":"Open source alternatives to privy, web3auth and dynamic"}},{"title":"EIP Fun Newsletter #50: PeerDAS","dc:creator":"zoe-im","category":"EIPs","description":"<p>Hi,everyone!

That said, ACD is also one of the most visible forums for the broader community to engage with “core devs”, and we should ensure it remains open to them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"acd-proposal-1-eip-review-requests-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#acd-proposal-1-eip-review-requests-3\"></a>ACD Proposal 1: EIP Review Requests</h3>\n<p>Today, it isn’t uncommon for someone to bring up a topic on ACD which very few people have previously reviewed, leading to people “getting up to speed” live on the call. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/jO-BbmSsT_0?feature=shared&amp;t=440\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Here is an example from ACD#188</a>.</p>\n<p>To improve on this, we could introduce “Review Requests” on the ACD agenda, where instead of discussing a topic on the call by default, it is flagged to core teams for review. Once the item has been reviewed by at least one client team asynchronously, it could then be discussed more thoroughly on the next call, if needed.</p>\n<p>These latter synchronous discussions could potentially be gated by client teams proposing the topic be discussed on a call.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"acd-proposal-2-breakout-room-templates-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#acd-proposal-2-breakout-room-templates-4\"></a>ACD Proposal 2: Breakout Room Templates</h3>\n<p>Breakout rooms are broadly appreciated as a way to have deeper discussions on specific topics, and as the best place to bring in experts from outside client teams to discuss specific topics. So far, they haven’t been very “templatized”. Adding a common structure across them could help better dessiminate information from breakouts back to ACD.</p>\n<p>Going forward, breakout rooms could require:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A moderator, who will run the call and report progress back to ACD</li>\n<li>A public agenda in <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ethereum/pm/issues</a></li>\n<li>A written summary of discussions/decisions (by default, done by moderator)</li>\n<li>A recording, uploaded to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ethereumprotocol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@EthereumProtocol</a> YouTube</li>\n<li>A transcript (autogenerated OK) posted to <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/tree/master/Breakout-Room-Meetings\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ethereum/pm</a></li>\n<li>A notice on Ethereum Magicians (see “EthMag Proposal 1” below)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Breakouts do a mix of some/most/all of this already, but having a common template (explained in <code>ethereum/pm</code>?) would help both preserve records and efficiently communicate the takeaways in AllCoreDevs calls.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"acd-proposal-3-async-team-updates-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#acd-proposal-3-async-team-updates-5\"></a>ACD Proposal 3: Async Team Updates</h3>\n<p>While planning Pectra, some teams started voicing their preferences for specific EIPs asynchronously ahead of ACD calls. There is broad agreement that this is valuable to keep doing, with the caveat that we want to ensure the governance process remains anchored to “rough consensus” (rather than formal voting or unanimity), and that we allow for individuals to keep voicing their opinions, even if it is different from their team’s majority view.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of “rough consensus”, this feels like something we should encourage but not formalize. Teams sharing their views on important topics ahead of time (ideally &gt;24h before the call) enables all participants to have a higher context discussion. That said, we should allow each team to do this in the format/medium they prefer. Similarly, we should leave ample room for qualitative discussion rather than simply trying to quantify support/objections for proposals.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"network-upgrade-process-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#network-upgrade-process-6\"></a>Network Upgrade Process</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"nup-proposal-1-pfi-cfi-sfi-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#nup-proposal-1-pfi-cfi-sfi-7\"></a>NUP Proposal 1: <code>PFI</code>, <code>CFI</code>, <code>SFI</code></h3>\n<p>A few years ago, Ethereum’s execution layer started using the “Considered for Inclusion” status to highlight EIPs that client teams were seriously considering for a network upgrade but didn’t want to make a full commitment to include yet. The term was inspired from <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#conceptual-review\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">“Concept ACK”</a> in Bitcoin Core.</p>\n<p>While teams still feel <code>CFI</code> is a valuable status (CL teams have now started using it!), it is far from perfect: there’s a lack of clarity around when something should be CFI’d, some EIPs go from being<br>\nproposed\" (which is not a formal status) to “Included” (which is), leading to confusion, etc.</p>\n<p>Today, the rough pipeline for EIPs is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The EIP is “proposed” for a network upgrade, either on Ethereum Magicians, or a Github issue. For the <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/pectra-network-upgrade-meta-thread/16809\">past</a> couple <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/cancun-network-upgrade-meta-thread/12060\">forks</a>, I’ve kept a list of these proposals on Ethereum Magicians.</li>\n<li>Some EIPs are formally <code>Considered for Inclusion</code>, which gets recorded in the Meta EIP for the network upgrade, see e.g. <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7600\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-7600</a>.</li>\n<li>Some EIPs then get formally <code>Included</code> in the network upgrade, which is also recorded in the Meta EIP. Note that EIPs do not necessarily have to be CFI’d before being Included.</li>\n<li>When a network upgrade goes live, the Meta EIP only retains the <code>Included</code> EIPs. In other words, the <code>CFI</code> status is only applied to EIPs on a per-fork basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To improve on this, I propose introducing a new status, <code>Proposed for Inclusion</code>, and renaming <code>Included</code> to <code>Scheduled for Inclusion</code>.</p>\n<p><code>Proposed for Inclusion</code> would be used by an EIP author to signal they want their EIP to be considered for a network upgrade. To formally propose an EIP for inclusion, one would simply need to open a PR to a network upgrade’s Meta EIP and list it there. This removes the need for someone (usually me!) to track proposals across multiple places, and provides EIP authors an “artifact proof” of the proposal, the PR to the Meta EIP.</p>\n<p><code>Considered for Inclusion</code> would remain mostly used as it is today, a way for client developers to signal which EIP they would like potentially see included in a network upgrade.</p>\n<p>Again, there has been confusion about when something should be CFI’d. If we wanted a formal threshold for this status, I would propose “&gt;1 client team affected thinks this is worth considering for the network upgrade”.</p>\n<p>We currently have a soft rule to “not CFI something on the first ACD it is presented on”. If <code>PFI</code> was a formal status, this could potentially be relaxed to “don’t CFI something that hasn’t been <code>PFI'd</code> for 7+ days”.</p>\n<p><code>Scheduled for Inclusion</code> would replace <code>Included</code> to highlight EIPs that client teams have committed to implement and include in the network upgrade barring significant unexpected technical issues. Historically, a handful of <code>Included</code> EIPs have been removed during the implementation and testing phases because of technical issues. <code>SFI</code> better conveys that this may happen.</p>\n<p>Optionally, once a network upgrade has gone live, <code>SFI</code> EIPs could be categorized as <code>Included</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"nup-proposal-2-eip-review-tracker-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#nup-proposal-2-eip-review-tracker-8\"></a>NUP Proposal 2: EIP Review Tracker</h3>\n<p>Something that would make <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#ACD-Proposal-1-EIP-Review-Requests\">EIP Review Requests</a> better is the ability to collect and keep track of reviews on an EIP. EIPs currently have <code>discussions-to</code> links which direct towards a single forum thread that can be hard to follow and “hide” important but unaddressed concerns.</p>\n<p>Having a way for EIP authors and reviewers to solicit/highlight/track more formal “reviews” on an EIP could help make the async process more efficient.</p>\n<p>An easy way to do this would be to create default templates for EthMagicians <code>discussion-to</code> threads which make it easy for the EIP authors to keep track of various reviews, audits, critcisms, etc. in a single place.</p>\n<p>One example of this being done informally is the <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/shanghai-cancun-candidate-eip-1153-transient-storage/10784\">EIP-1153 shanghai/cancun thread</a>. A possible sections for the template could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Client Implementations</li>\n<li>Expert Reviews</li>\n<li>Open Questions &amp; Risks</li>\n<li>Objections &amp; Concerns</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"nup-proposal-3-align-eip-and-nup-processes-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#nup-proposal-3-align-eip-and-nup-processes-9\"></a>NUP Proposal 3: Align EIP and NUP Processes</h3>\n<p>With the split of the EIP and ERC repositories, there is an opportunity to modify the EIP process to better suit the needs of Ethereum network upgrades. For example, <code>PFI</code>, <code>CFI</code>, <code>SFI</code> could be added to the header of EIPs, and lists of EIPs in each status could be exposed on <a href=\"http://eips.ethereum.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">eips.ethereum.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The biggest blocker here is bandwidth: there are only a handful of EIP/ERC editors and they struggle to do more than the bare minimum to keep the process moving.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"nup-proposal-31-client-team-eip-editors-by-default-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#nup-proposal-31-client-team-eip-editors-by-default-10\"></a>NUP Proposal 3.1: Client Team EIP Editors by Default</h4>\n<p>One idea to address this would be for every L1 client team who participates in the Network Upgrade Process to volunteer a part time EIP editor to help with the process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ethereum-magicians-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#ethereum-magicians-11\"></a>Ethereum Magicians</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"ethmag-proposal-1-breakout-room-highlights-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#ethmag-proposal-1-breakout-room-highlights-12\"></a>EthMag Proposal 1: Breakout Room Highlights</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest issues for the broader Ethereum community is knowing if and when they should pay attention to AllCoreDevs. While EIP champions typically try and reach out to stakeholders affected by their proposals, historically this has often resulted in many relevant teams being unaware of a proposal until fairly late in the network upgrade process.</p>\n<p>A good proxy for proposals which require deeper discussion and community engagemment are “proposals that lead to breakout rooms”. A simple improvement could then be to advertise past and upcomming breakouts on Ethereum Magicians, potentially with a way for users to subscribe to these posts exclusively.</p>\n<p>For example, the website could display a banner with upcomming breakout rooms and their topics, or a weekly/forthnightly/monthly post could link all the recent breakouts and where follow-up conversation is happening.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ethmag-proposal-2-revamped-categories-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#ethmag-proposal-2-revamped-categories-13\"></a>EthMag Proposal 2: Revamped Categories</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/categories\">Ethereum Magicians Post Categories</a> need some love. While many are used regularly and well understood (e.g. <code>EIPs</code>, <code>last-call</code>, etc.), several of them are outdated (<code>Working Groups</code>, <code>Ethereum 1.x</code>, etc.), vague (<code>Primordial Soup</code>), or simply unused (<code>Sharding</code>, <code>Address Space Extension</code>).</p>\n<p>Creating a net set of categories which both regular and more casual users of Ethereum Magicians find useful would help make Ethereum Magicians a central hub for both types of users. Ideally, users could also “follow” these categories in various ways, e.g. via per-category email notifications/digets or even things like custom Lens/Farcaster channels or Twitter bots that share new activity in them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ethmag-proposal-3-onboarding-new-admins-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#ethmag-proposal-3-onboarding-new-admins-14\"></a>EthMag Proposal 3: Onboarding New Admins</h3>\n<p>Similarly to the EIP process, maintainer bandwidth is the main blocker to making Ethereum Magicians much better. To reflect that Ethereum Magicians is a resource for both the broader Ethereum community and core L1 R&amp;D contributors, we should consider having an open process to add maintainers who can represent these different stakeholder groups.</p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/allcoredevs-network-upgrade-ethmagicians-process-improvements/20157\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/allcoredevs-network-upgrade-ethmagicians-process-improvements/20157","pubDate":"Wed, 29 May 2024 15:38:43 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20157"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/allcoredevs-network-upgrade-ethmagicians-process-improvements/20157.rss","#text":"AllCoreDevs, Network Upgrade & EthMagicians Process Improvements"}},{"title":"EIP-7716: Anti-correlation attestation penalties","dc:creator":"Nerolation","category":"EIPs","description":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8598\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-7716: Anti-correlation attestation penalties</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjust penalties for missed attestations based on in-slot correlation of missed attestation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rational behind this EIP is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Economics of scale come with correlations\n<ul>\n<li>no matter if running many validators from the same node, in the same country, on servers of the same cloud providers, the same ISP provider, the same client, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Economies of scale make it harder for solo stakers to compete with large node operators.</li>\n<li>With in-protocol incentives that foster diversivication, decentralization (and increased fault-tolerance thorugh, e.g. DVTs), the protocol can become more decentralized/credible neutral/censorship resistant.</li>\n<li>Escaping high-correlations comes with costs (moving nodes into a diverse set of geo locations, using different cloud providers, setting up a fault-tolerant DVT cluster, etc).</li>\n<li>Based on <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/analysis-on-correlated-attestation-penalties/19244\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">prior analysis</a>, the impact on large centralized parties is negative while small-scale participants (e.g. solo stakers or rocketpool node operators) benefit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>More content on the EIP <a href=\"https://github.com/dapplion/anti-correlation-penalties-faq\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a> (EthBerlin hackathon project)</strong>:<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a4f4959d338c31570bbd19ebb8e7897ff526143a.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/a4f4959d338c31570bbd19ebb8e7897ff526143a\" title=\"penalty_factor_chart\"><img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a4f4959d338c31570bbd19ebb8e7897ff526143a_2_690x259.png\" alt=\"penalty_factor_chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"nxgk8PxrlBydNdbFWnr5iKOeSLg\" width=\"690\" height=\"259\" srcset=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a4f4959d338c31570bbd19ebb8e7897ff526143a_2_690x259.png, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a4f4959d338c31570bbd19ebb8e7897ff526143a_2_1035x388.png 1.5x, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a4f4959d338c31570bbd19ebb8e7897ff526143a_2_1380x518.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"181817\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Find the EIP here:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7716\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7716</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7716-anti-correlation-attestation-penalties/20137\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7716-anti-correlation-attestation-penalties/20137","pubDate":"Mon, 27 May 2024 20:08:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20137"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7716-anti-correlation-attestation-penalties/20137.rss","#text":"EIP-7716: Anti-correlation attestation penalties"}},{"title":"Proof of Value: Igniting Blockchain 3.0 with DAism","dc:creator":"zhous","category":"Primordial Soup","description":"<p>I’m thrilled to share with you a groundbreaking consensus that we’ve been developing since 2019: Proof of Value.

To resolve this limitation, service providers employ temporary EOAs to deterministically generate an <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org\">ERC-4337</a> account for their users, assigning the temporary EOA as the initial owner. This approach, however, introduces a security vulnerability, as the temporary EOAs’ private keys are managed by the service providers. Furthermore, the service providers assume responsibility for these private keys until such a time when users take the ownership.</p>\n<p>Solution:<br>\nSet a separate contract as the owner when calling <code>createAccount</code>, and allow the user to claim ownership at a later date via a signature provided by the service provider.</p>\n<p>This approach has its limitations, however. To prevent the predetermined address from being claimed by an external party, most AA wallet factory contracts include the <code>owner</code> address when calculating the predetermined address and make sure that the owner of the AA wallet becomes the given <code>owner</code> address. In order to satisfy this constraint, service providers opt to creating a new and random private key on their server and sending it later when the user requests it.</p>\n            <p><small>10 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7717-deterministic-aa-wallet/20080\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7717-deterministic-aa-wallet/20080","pubDate":"Wed, 22 May 2024 07:42:38 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20080"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7717-deterministic-aa-wallet/20080.rss","#text":"ERC-7717: Deterministic AA wallet"}},{"title":"EIP-7704: Soul Resonance Token","dc:creator":"Mike_0x1024","category":"ERCs","description":"<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>\n<p>SRT(Soul Resonance Token), introduces a novel token protocol. Much like SBT, SRT lacks support for transfer methods, prohibiting users from moving SRT assets between different accounts. What sets SRT apart is its utilization of the mint() and burn() methods via the Bonding Curve mechanism, facilitating pricing and trading functionalities for SRT. Consequently, SRT represents an asset type that is non-transferable yet tradable. By merging the features of SBT’s soul binding and the tradability of traditional ERC20 assets, SRT effectively closes the gap between SBT and conventional ERC20 tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Non-transferable:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The inability to transfer SRT tokens ensures that they remain securely bound to the account where they were originally minted or acquired.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Tradable:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Despite being non-transferable, SRT tokens are still tradable. This means that they can be bought and sold on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or other platforms that support trading of SRT tokens. The trading functionality allows users to exchange SRT tokens for other assets or currencies within the ecosystem in a unique way.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Customizable Market Curve:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>SRT implements a customizable market curve through the Bonding Curve mechanism. This curve determines the pricing and supply dynamics of SRT tokens based on the amount of tokens in circulation. By customizing the market curve, developers can tailor the token economics of SRT to suit specific use cases or objectives.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox githubpullrequest\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/414\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com/ethereum/ERCs</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\">\n\n\n\n    <div class=\"github-icon-container\" title=\"Pull Request\">\n      <svg width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"github-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11 11.28V5c-.03-.78-.34-1.47-.94-2.06C9.46 2.35 8.78 2.03 8 2H7V0L4 3l3 3V4h1c.27.02.48.11.69.31.21.2.3.42.31.69v6.28A1.993 1.993 0 0 0 10 15a1.993 1.993 0 0 0 1-3.72zm-1 2.92c-.66 0-1.2-.55-1.2-1.2 0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2 0 .65-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2zM4 3c0-1.11-.89-2-2-2a1.993 1.993 0 0 0-1 3.72v6.56A1.993 1.993 0 0 0 2 15a1.993 1.993 0 0 0 1-3.72V4.72c.59-.34 1-.98 1-1.72zm-.8 10c0 .66-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2-.65 0-1.2-.55-1.2-1.2 0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2zM2 4.2C1.34 4.2.8 3.65.8 3c0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2 0 .65-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2z\"></path></svg>\n    </div>\n\n  <div class=\"github-info-container\">\n\n\n\n      <h4>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Add ERC: Soul Resonance Token</a>\n      </h4>\n\n    <div class=\"branches\">\n      <code>ethereum:master</code> ← <code>mike0x1024:master</code>\n    </div>\n\n      <div class=\"github-info\">\n        <div class=\"date\">\n          opened <span class=\"discourse-local-date\" data-format=\"ll\" data-date=\"2024-05-07\" data-time=\"06:27:44\" data-timezone=\"UTC\">06:27AM - 07 May 24 UTC</span>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"user\">\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/mike0x1024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">\n            <img alt=\"mike0x1024\" src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/5/52d4e2ce7b27ff33e2b15aa5deee11ad146bde25.png\" class=\"onebox-avatar-inline\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" data-dominant-color=\"E8DFCF\">\n            mike0x1024\n          </a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"lines\" title=\"1 commits changed 1 files with 90 additions and 0 deletions\">\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/414/files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">\n            <span class=\"added\">+90</span>\n            <span class=\"removed\">-0</span>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  <div class=\"github-row\">\n    <p class=\"github-body-container\">When opening a pull request to submit a new EIP, please use the suggested templa<span class=\"show-more-container\"><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" class=\"show-more\">…</a></span><span class=\"excerpt hidden\">te: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md\n\nWe have a GitHub bot that automatically merges some PRs.

This EIP assumes that <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org\">EIP-2935</a> has been implemented, and that blockhashes can be retrieved from the systems contract storage. By updating the behavior of <code>BLOCKHASH (0x40)</code> to directly read and serve from state through the system contract storage, we allow Verkle blocks to include a storage access witness, which will allow stateless execution.</p>\n<p>The motivation behind the updated gas cost is to match the real cost of the operation, which is equivalent to an <code>SLOAD</code>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"open-questions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#open-questions-3\"></a>Open Questions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When providing access witnesses.

Logs work for <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org\">ERC-20</a> tokens, but they do not work for ETH. ETH transfers from EOAs can be read from the transaction list in the block, but ETH transfers from smart contract wallets are not automatically logged anywhere. This has already led to problems in the past, eg. early exchanges would often not properly support deposits from smart contract wallets, or only support them with a much longer delay. This EIP proposes that we automatically generate a log every time a value-transferring CALL or SELFDESTRUCT happens.</p>\n<p>EIP number TBD.</p>\n            <p><small>27 posts - 11 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7708-eth-transfers-emit-a-log/20034\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7708-eth-transfers-emit-a-log/20034","pubDate":"Fri, 17 May 2024 12:08:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20034"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7708-eth-transfers-emit-a-log/20034.rss","#text":"EIP-7708: ETH transfers emit a log"}},{"title":"EIP 7707: Align incentives for access list provisioning","dc:creator":"benaadams","category":"Core EIPs","description":"<ins>\n<p>To facilitate future developments of parallel data load, we need to encourage as many transactions as possible that contain as complete and valid access lists.
