Introduction</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Background on Uniswap v3</strong></p>\n<p>Uniswap v3 revolutionized decentralized finance (DeFi) by introducing concentrated liquidity, enabling liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate capital within specific price ranges. This approach, represented by ERC-721 NFTs, created unique, non-fungible liquidity positions that maximized capital efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations of ERC-721 in Current Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>While ERC-721 effectively represents unique positions, it introduces certain inefficiencies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gas inefficiencies:</strong> Managing multiple positions requires multiple transactions, leading to high gas costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Complexity:</strong> The necessity to manage numerous unique NFTs can complicate operations for LPs, especially those employing more sophisticated strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited programmability:</strong> ERC-721’s structure limits the implementation of advanced, programmatic DeFi strategies that require dynamic and automated position management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Introduction to ERC-1155</strong></p>\n<p>ERC-1155, a multi-token standard, supports the creation and management of fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible tokens within a single smart contract. This capability allows for more efficient batch operations and versatile token management, making it an ideal candidate for representing liquidity positions in a more programmatic and dynamic manner. By adopting ERC-1155, Uniswap v3 could unlock new possibilities in programmable liquidity management and real-time market adjustments.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-50766-iii-technical-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50766-iii-technical-overview-3\"></a><strong>III. Technical Overview</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>ERC-721 vs. ERC-1155: A Comparative Analysis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ERC-721:</strong> Designed for unique, non-fungible tokens where each token is distinct. This standard is excellent for representing individual assets but lacks efficiency in batch operations and programmability.</li>\n<li><strong>ERC-1155:</strong> Supports multiple token types within a single contract, enabling efficient batch operations and the representation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. This flexibility is crucial for implementing complex, automated liquidity strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Alignment with Concentrated Liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>Uniswap v3’s core innovation is concentrated liquidity, allowing LPs to provide liquidity within specific price ranges, creating personalized, unique positions. ERC-721 was initially chosen because it effectively represents these unique, one-off positions. However, ERC-1155 can maintain the uniqueness of each liquidity position by leveraging its multi-token structure. Each liquidity position within a pool can be represented by a sub-token under a unique pool ID, where the metadata for each sub-token holds the specific parameters of the position, such as price range and liquidity amount. This allows for the distinctiveness of each position to be preserved while offering enhanced programmability and batch operations. This proposal will include detailed examples of how this structure can be implemented, ensuring that each position retains its unique characteristics within the ERC-1155 framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract Architecture</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed ERC-1155 structure for Uniswap v3 would involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pool-based tokenization:</strong> Each liquidity pool is represented by a unique token ID within the ERC-1155 contract.</li>\n<li><strong>Sub-tokenization of positions:</strong> Individual liquidity positions within a pool are represented as sub-tokens, each with its metadata, allowing for precise management of attributes like liquidity amount, price range, and accrued fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration with existing protocols:</strong> The ERC-1155 contracts would be fully compatible with Uniswap v3’s existing architecture, ensuring seamless integration and operation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tokenization of Liquidity Positions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Representation of liquidity positions:</strong> ERC-1155 can represent both the liquidity pool and individual positions within that pool, simplifying the management of aggregated liquidity and enabling more complex, programmatic strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Metadata management:</strong> Each position’s unique attributes are stored as metadata within the sub-token, allowing for real-time data integration and instant market response.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-50766-iv-advantages-of-using-erc-1155-for-liquidity-pools-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50766-iv-advantages-of-using-erc-1155-for-liquidity-pools-4\"></a><strong>IV.

For instance, a liquidity position can be set to automatically adjust its price range in response to market shifts by using condition-based logic embedded in the ERC-1155 contract. These triggers could be based on predefined thresholds or real-time market data, enabling dynamic rebalancing without user intervention. Additionally, fee management can be automated to collect and reinvest fees once they reach a certain threshold, further enhancing LPs’ returns. Customizable algorithms could be developed for users who want to tailor these automated strategies to their specific needs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pool-Based Tokenization and Modular Management</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simplified management:</strong> Representing entire pools and their positions within a single contract allows for easier tracking and management of aggregated liquidity, improving the efficiency of liquidity provisioning.</li>\n<li><strong>Modular approach:</strong> This setup supports a modular management strategy where different layers of liquidity can be managed independently or collectively, depending on the strategy employed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid Asset Management</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Versatile products:</strong> ERC-1155’s ability to handle both fungible and non-fungible assets enables the creation of versatile DeFi products, such as liquidity tokens that can also serve as governance tokens or yield-bearing assets.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-protocol integration:</strong> The standard allows for the creation of cross-protocol liquidity pipelines, where liquidity can be moved or reused across different DeFi protocols efficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Fractional Ownership and Shared Positions</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Collaborative strategies:</strong> ERC-1155 supports fractional ownership of liquidity positions, allowing multiple users to share and collaboratively manage a single position. This can lead to innovative financial products, such as liquidity pools structured as index funds.</li>\n<li><strong>Crowdsourced liquidity:</strong> The ability to fractionalize positions enables new forms of crowdsourced liquidity provisioning, where multiple LPs contribute to and benefit from a shared liquidity strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Improved User Experience</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unified dashboards:</strong> Users can view and manage all their positions and intents through aggregated dashboards, simplifying the interface and making it easier to track and optimize their liquidity strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptive management:</strong> The flexibility of ERC-1155 allows for adaptive liquidity management, where the system can automatically optimize yield based on market conditions and user preferences.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Scalability and Future-Proofing</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Preparation for growth:</strong> ERC-1155’s structure is scalable, making it well-suited for future expansions and integrations within the DeFi ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>AI-driven strategies:</strong> The standard’s flexibility also supports the development of AI-driven rebalancing and predictive yield allocation strategies, ensuring that the platform remains adaptable to future advancements in financial technology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-50766-v-potential-challenges-and-mitigation-strategies-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50766-v-potential-challenges-and-mitigation-strategies-5\"></a><strong>V.

discussion focuses on the very basic component of every hack stack, <em><strong>erc20 token</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>a</strong> rollback token gives an address or a contract a time period to roll back an erc20 transaction, if the transaction is not rolled back within the time period, the transaction is considered valid and cannot be rolled back.</p>\n<p>one of the main advantages of using the rollback token standard in cold wallets or long-term asset holding wallets is the added layer of security it provides without compromising accessibility. cold wallets are typically used to store large amounts of cryptocurrency securely over long periods, with minimal interaction with the blockchain.</p>\n<p>by incorporating the rollback feature, users gain the ability to reverse any unauthorized transactions within a set time frame, significantly reducing the risk of permanent loss due to hacks or mistakes. this is particularly valuable for long-term holders who may not frequently monitor their wallets.</p>\n<p>the rollback token ensures that even if a cold wallet is compromised, the owner has a window of opportunity to reclaim their assets, making it an ideal solution for safeguarding long-term investments. this mechanism can offer peace of mind to asset holders, knowing that their funds are protected against unforeseen security breaches without needing to actively manage their wallets on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p>the rollback token standard integrates zero-knowledge proofs, specifically zk-STARKs, to enhance security and privacy in reversing compromised transactions. by using zk-STARKs, the system allows users to assign and verify a helper address (<code>sahayak</code>) without exposing sensitive information. this ensures that rollback operations are conducted in a secure, decentralized, and trustless manner, protecting long-term holdings from unauthorized access. zk-STARKs were selected for their scalability, efficiency, and the absence of a need for a trusted setup, making them ideal for this implementation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-50632-why-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50632-why-1\"></a>why?</h1>\n<p>in recent times, there have been many cases of people losing their tokens <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404062349979-Accidentally-sending-funds-to-the-wrong-address\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">due to a mistake</a> in the transaction, <a

href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/hackers-steal-around-100-million-cryptocurrency-binance-linked-blockchain-2022-10-07/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">due to a hack</a>. for a blockchain to handle this type of scams, large amount of hacks, it needs to be rolled back to the previous state to accumulate/reverse all the funds, as it was with ethereum that created ETC after <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ethereum-classic/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">hackers stole around $50 million from DAO</a></p>\n<p>and more recently, <a href=\"https://wazirx.com/blog/preliminary-report-cyber-attack-on-wazirx-multisig-wallet/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the wazirx hack</a></p>\n<p>now the point is, after that, billions of dollars in crypto has been hacked and scammed from various blockchains. and many of them didn’t rolled back, causing users and organizations to suffer great losses.</p>\n<p>the rollback token standard proposes, <em><strong>instead of rolling back the entire blockchain, one can just undo the transfer transaction within a time period, safeguarding the assets that were compromised.</strong></em></p>\n<p>with rbts,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>anyone can reverse their compromised token transfers</li>\n<li>crypto hacks can be minimized to 0</li>\n<li>new layer of security will be added on-chain</li>\n<li>no losses to anyone</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-50632-how-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50632-how-2\"></a>how?</h1>\n<p>rollback token standardizes an existing erc20 token with a rollback feature. behind the curtains, the process starts with assigning an helper address Y (<code>sahayak</code>) to the address X, when the latter is compromised or hacked, rbt tokens transferred to the exploiter can be reversed back using the helper address.</p>\n<p>using zero-knowledge proofs, one can assign its helper in a way without exposing its details. only the sahayak will have the proof to prove its ownership over reversing transfers.</p>\n<p>hold on, wouldn’t the exploiter transfer to another address again? no! that’s the catch (and a security level check), for the tokens to be reflected in the balance, the same time period will be considered.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">struct TransferStruct {\n    address to;\n

Instincts represent final targets, but mid-way targets are generated along the path, each with its own temptation value, guiding the AI agents toward the final instinct. If the conditions for an instinct or mid-way target are met, the associated transaction is executed automatically. This standard enables the creation of a self-regulating, adaptive blockchain ecosystem where decisions and transactions are made based on calculated rewards and penalties.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-50621-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50621-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>As AI and blockchain technologies evolve, the need for autonomous systems that can make complex decisions and execute transactions without direct human intervention becomes more apparent. This standard aims to provide a framework for integrating AI-driven instincts into the blockchain, allowing for more sophisticated, adaptive, and autonomous transaction mechanisms that mimic natural decision-making processes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-50621-discussion-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50621-discussion-3\"></a>Discussion</h2>\n<p>We welcome feedback, suggestions, and any discussion around this proposed standard.

Think reading EIP-1559 without knowing Roughgarden’s paper, EIP-1155 without OpenZeppelin’s reference implementations, or EIP-721 without its various extension EIPs.</p>\n<p>Sure, we have threads on this forum, discussions on PRs and lots of blogs/Twitter threads, but none of this information is structured and/or specific, i.e. a comment on a specific line of an EIP might be buried among other discussions and be generally hard to find. Adding this information to the EIP itself is not feasible either, since a) the line between opinions and factual information can be fuzzy, and EIPs tend to err on the side of caution b) the process to update an EIP requires several checks and discussions, which is way too much effort for a single comment or off-hand reference.</p>\n<p>For this reason, I was brainstorming about a website where endorsed users (see below) can add annotations to EIPs in the form of comments, while everyone else can upvote/downvote them. These can be either structured (e.g. standard templates for “Compare with EIP X”, “Platform X uses this EIP”, “See X for an in-depth analysis”, “Be careful of X while implementing this EIP”, which can be machine-readable) or free-form. The annotations can refer to the EIP as a whole or to specific parts of it.<br>\nTo avoid spam/malicious annotations, I’m taking inspiration from arXiv’s endorsement system. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All EIP authors and core contributors are automatically endorsed</li>\n<li>Endorsed users can endorse n other users</li>\n<li>Non-endorsers users can petition to be manually endorsed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What do you think?

However, the lack of standardization across these programs has led to inefficiencies, confusion, and difficulties in managing and tracking grants across different protocols and networks. Hence I propose the creation of a unified Grant Program Standard, comprising a standardized interface and a grant registry contract. This standard aims to harmonize the processes around grant issuance, management, and tracking, ensuring a seamless experience for all participants and contributors involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, each grant program operates with its own set of rules, interfaces, and management protocols, leading to a fragmented landscape that hinders interoperability. This lack of uniformity creates several issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Inconsistent Grant Tracking</strong>: Different standards make it challenging to track grants across various platforms, leading to missed opportunities, duplicated efforts, and weak backward compatibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Complex Management</strong>: Grantees and program managers struggle with keeping the communication of their grants updated, increasing the administrative burden and potential for errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Transparency</strong>: Without a common on-chain standard, it is difficult for the community to monitor, aggregate, and audit grant programs, which can impact trust and accountability.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To address these issues, I propose the adoption of a standardized interface based on the most common fields that are crucial for the grant lifecycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Interface</strong></p>\n<p>This interface will serve as the foundational layer for all grant programs, ensuring that key information is recorded and accessible in a consistent manner across the Ethereum ecosystem:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">/// Grant Interface\nid: uin256           // Grant unique identifier\nnetwork: uint256     // Blockchain network where the grant is being developed\ngrantee: address     // Address of the person responsible for delivering and receiving the grant award\nprotocol: string     // Name of the protocol/community that issued the grant\nproject: string      // Name/Title of the project or company that received the grant\nexternalLinks[]: string // Link that redirects to the grant proposal, discussion or relative\nstartDate: uint256   // Start date for the grant development\nendDate: uint256.    // Expected completion date for the grant\nstatus: enum(Status) // Current status of the grant\ndisbursements: Disbursement // Disbursement stages based on milestones\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">/// Disbursement Struct\nfundingTokens: address[]   // Tokens that will be disbursed in this stage\nfundingAmounts: uint256[]  // Amounts of tokens to be disbursed in this stage\ndisbursed: bool[]          // Indicates if the disbursement has been made in this stage\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">/// Status Enum\nProposed,        // The grant has been proposed but not yet approved (Default)\nApproved,        // The grant has been reviewed and approved\nInProgress,      // The project is actively being worked on\nCompleted,       // The project has been completed and deliverables submitted\nCancelled,       // The grant was cancelled\nRejected         // The grant proposal was reviewed and rejected\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Grant Registry Contract</strong></p>\n<p>To complement the standardized interface, I propose the development of a Grant Registry Contract. This contract will act as a universal registry where all grants, regardless of the issuing protocol or network, can be registered, tracked, and managed. Similar to how the multicall3 works.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Universal Registration</strong>: Allows any grant program to register their grants using the standardized interface.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Management</strong>: Provides functionalities for program managers to update the status of grants, track progress, and manage funding distribution.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency and Audibility</strong>: Enables the community to view grant details, track funding allocations, and monitor progress, enhancing trust and accountability.</li>\n<li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Facilitates cross-chain and cross-protocol grant management, breaking down silos and enabling seamless interaction between different grant programs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Consideration: Use of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)</strong></p>\n<p>The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) offers a decentralized, trustless, and on-chain method to create verifiable attestations, making it an attractive option. By utilizing EAS, we could theoretically record and verify key events, such as grant approvals, disbursements, and project completions, directly on the blockchain. However, one significant challenge in applying EAS within this context is the lack of mutability due to its reliance on static schemas.</p>\n<p>In the proposed grant management system, flexibility is crucial, especially regarding the management of disbursement stages, milestone achievements, and potential changes in project scope or funding requirements. The static nature of EAS schemas limits the ability to modify attestations once they are created, which conflicts with the dynamic needs of a typical grant lifecycle where adjustments are often necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Community Feedback</strong>: I encourage feedback on the proposed interface and grant registry contract. Any suggestions for improvements or additional features are welcome.</li>\n<li><strong>Implementation Draft</strong>: Upon reaching a consensus, the next step will be to draft a detailed EIP and begin the implementation process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Looking forward to your thoughts and contributions!</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/grant-program-standardization-interface-and-registry-contract/20791\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/grant-program-standardization-interface-and-registry-contract/20791","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 15:29:08 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20791"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/grant-program-standardization-interface-and-registry-contract/20791.rss","#text":"Grant Program Standardization: Interface and Registry Contract"}}]}}}
