Unlike traditional locking mechanisms, our system represents locked funds as NFTs, enabling seamless transfer of control to another owner by simply transferring the NFT to a new wallet address. This unique approach opens up innovative use cases, such as ‘vested’ payments to third parties like influencers, where tokens are transferred but remain inaccessible for a specified period or until certain conditions are met.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Flexible Locking Conditions:</strong> Our system supports a variety of locking conditions, including time periods, token price thresholds (using AMMs or Chainlink price feeds), market capitalization limits, token burn thresholds, multisig unlock conditions, and even custom conditions using EventSig to check specific pre-defined conditions on external contracts. These conditions can be combined using AND, OR operators to create sophisticated locking strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity Management:</strong> One of the most significant applications of our system is in locking liquidity. Project developers can now access a portion of their token’s locked liquidity for pre-approved uses, either through community governance voting or by meeting predefined minimum liquidity requirements. This feature introduces a new level of flexibility and control over locked liquidity that was previously unavailable.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy Lock Info Access:</strong> Users can easily check the locking information associated with an NFT by accessing the metadata URL attached to the NFT. This provides transparency and visibility into the locking conditions and status of locked funds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>Our NFT-based flexible token locking system introduces a paradigm shift in token locking and liquidity management, offering unprecedented flexibility and control to token holders and project developers. We believe that this system has the potential to unlock new possibilities in decentralized finance and token economics, and we welcome feedback and collaboration from the community to further refine and develop this innovative concept.</p>\n<p><strong>Discussion Points:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are your thoughts on using NFTs to represent locked funds?</li>\n<li>How can flexible token locking systems benefit decentralized finance projects?</li>\n<li>What additional locking conditions or features would you like to see in such a system?</li>\n<li>How can we ensure the security and integrity of locked funds and NFT representations?</li>\n<li>Are there any potential regulatory or compliance challenges associated with this approach?</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>5 posts -

In traditional finance systems, payment references are often included in wire transfers and other types of electronic payments, making it easy for users and merchants to manage and reconcile their transactions.</p>\n<p>By extending the existing ERC20 token standard with payment reference capabilities, this proposal will help bridge the gap between traditional finance systems and the world of decentralized finance, providing a more seamless experience for users, merchants, and service providers alike.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>\n<p>Any contract complying with EIP-20 when extended with this ERC, MUST implement the following interface:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">// The EIP-165 identifier of this interface is 0xxxxxxx - to be updated once ERC number is assigned\n\ninterface IERCXXXX {\n\nfunction transfer(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata paymentReference) external returns (bool);\n\nfunction transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata paymentReference) external returns (bool);\n\nevent Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount, bytes indexed paymentReference);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>These <code>transfer</code> and <code>transferFrom</code> functions MUST emit <code>Transfer</code> event with paymentReference parameter.</p>\n<p><code>paymentReference</code> parameter MAY be empty - example: <code>emit Transfer(From, To, amount, \"\");</code></p>\n<p><code>paymentReference</code> parameter is not limited in length by design, users are motivated to keep it short by calldata and log data gas costs.</p>\n<p>Transfers of 0 amount MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the <code>Transfer</code> event.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"parameter-name-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#parameter-name-5\"></a>Parameter name</h2>\n<p>The choice to name the added parameter paymentReference was made to align with traditional banking terminology, where payment references are widely used to associate and reconcile transactions with specific orders, invoices or other financial records.</p>\n<p>The paymentReference parameter name also helps to clearly communicate the purpose of the parameter and its role in facilitating the association and reconciliation of transactions. By adopting terminology that is well-established in the financial industry, the proposal aims to foster a greater understanding and adoption of the extended ERC20 token standard.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"backwards-compatibility-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#backwards-compatibility-6\"></a>Backwards Compatibility</h1>\n<p>This extension is fully backwards compatible with the existing ERC20 token standard. The new functions can be used alongside the existing transfer and transferFrom functions. Existing upgradable ERC20 tokens can be upgraded to include the new functionality without impact on the storage layout; new ERC20 tokens can choose to implement the payment reference features based on their specific needs.</p>\n<p>ERC20 requires its <code>Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value) </code> event to be emitted during transfers, thus there will be duplicitous data logged (from, to, amount) in two events.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"security-considerations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#security-considerations-7\"></a>Security Considerations</h1>\n<p>Payment reference privacy: Including payment references in token transfers may expose sensitive information about the transaction or the parties involved. Implementers and users SHOULD carefully consider the privacy implications and ensure that payment references do not reveal sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, implementers can consider using encryption or other privacy-enhancing techniques to protect payment reference data.</p>\n<p>Manipulation of payment references: Malicious actors might attempt to manipulate payment references to mislead users, merchants, or service providers. This can lead to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Legal risks</strong>: The beneficiary may face legal and compliance risks if the attacker uses illicit funds, potentially impersonating or flagging the beneficiary of involvement in money laundering or other illicit activities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Disputes and refunds</strong>: The user might discover they didn’t make the payment, request a refund or raise a dispute, causing additional administrative work for the beneficiary.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To mitigate this risk, implementers can consider using methods to identify proper sender and to generate unique and verifiable related payment references.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7699-erc20-payment-reference-extension/19826\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7699-erc20-payment-reference-extension/19826","pubDate":"Fri, 26 Apr 2024 18:58:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-19826"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7699-erc20-payment-reference-extension/19826.rss","#text":"ERC-7699: ERC20 Payment reference extension"}},{"title":"About the RIPs category","dc:creator":"matt","category":"RIPs","description":"<p>This category is for Rollup Improvement Proposals.</p>\n<p>The goal of the RIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for Rollups in Ethereum ecosystem.

Such genericity will enable curves such as Ed25519 and Babyjujub (with the use of isogeny we will describe later), Palla,Vesta, Starkcurve, etc.</p>\n<p>The proposal includes two precompiles, taking curves parameters as calldata.<br>\nThe first one is very comparable to RIP7212 and EIP6565, only taking those extra p,a,b parameters.<br>\nThe second them uses extra values (namely 2^128.P and 2^128Q), to provide a GLV comparable speedup, which is 50% asymptotically (less in full solidity, but ZK version will benefit largely from it).</p>\n<p>As of now there is a huge traction on P256, being the first FIDO curve implemented in WebAuthn. Ed25519 shall follow, and is superior in all ways (Schnorr based, no hidden seed constant,MPC friendly).</p>\n<p>This precompile also solve the ‘hacky’ use of ecrecover (as implemented for Schnorr based Dapps, such as Ambire Wallet, and secure MPC uses relying on Musig2). This cunning use of ecrecover in fact enables DSM.</p>\n<p>Implementing DSM at lower levels (for ZKEVM or nodes) only requires to implement Montgomery multiplications to emulate prime fields. (It is how it is done by Lambda for ZKsync right now). This is how are implemented most generic libraries (OpenSSL, libECC, Bolos, etc.).</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox githubpullrequest\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/pull/18/files#diff-1991105bd164aa9e87619fa8426d5978f420c7033b30393f07a3b7afd09df7f3\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/pull/18/files#diff-1991105bd164aa9e87619fa8426d5978f420c7033b30393f07a3b7afd09df7f3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com/ethereum/RIPs</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\">\n\n\n\n    <div class=\"github-icon-container\" title=\"Pull Request\">\n      <svg width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"github-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11 11.28V5c-.03-.78-.34-1.47-.94-2.06C9.46 2.35 8.78 2.03 8 2H7V0L4 3l3 3V4h1c.27.02.48.11.69.31.21.2.3.42.31.69v6.28A1.993 1.993 0 0 0 10 15a1.993 1.993 0 0 0 1-3.72zm-1 2.92c-.66 0-1.2-.55-1.2-1.2 0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2 0 .65-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2zM4 3c0-1.11-.89-2-2-2a1.993 1.993 0 0 0-1 3.72v6.56A1.993 1.993 0 0 0 2 15a1.993 1.993 0 0 0 1-3.72V4.72c.59-.34 1-.98 1-1.72zm-.8 10c0 .66-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2-.65 0-1.2-.55-1.2-1.2 0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2zM2 4.2C1.34 4.2.8 3.65.8 3c0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2 0 .65-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2z\"></path></svg>\n    </div>\n\n  <div class=\"github-info-container\">\n\n\n\n      <h4>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/pull/18/files#diff-1991105bd164aa9e87619fa8426d5978f420c7033b30393f07a3b7afd09df7f3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">adding DSM RIP</a>\n      </h4>\n\n    <div class=\"branches\">\n      <code>ethereum:master</code> ← <code>rdubois-crypto:master</code>\n    </div>\n\n      <div class=\"github-info\">\n        <div class=\"date\">\n          opened <span class=\"discourse-local-date\" data-format=\"ll\" data-date=\"2024-04-19\" data-time=\"17:12:59\" data-timezone=\"UTC\">05:12PM - 19 Apr 24 UTC</span>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"user\">\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/rdubois-crypto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">\n            <img alt=\"rdubois-crypto\" src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3fd3904f3c4dca6da8c87951d28db31afc71eba9.jpeg\" class=\"onebox-avatar-inline\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEBE9\">\n            rdubois-crypto\n          </a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"lines\" title=\"4 commits changed 2 files with 155 additions and 0 deletions\">\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/pull/18/files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">\n            <span class=\"added\">+155</span>\n            <span class=\"removed\">-0</span>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  <div class=\"github-row\">\n    <p class=\"github-body-container\">Double Scalar multiplication is the core operation for non-pairing based ECC pro<span class=\"show-more-container\"><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/pull/18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" class=\"show-more\">…</a></span><span class=\"excerpt hidden\">tocols (signature, ciphering, key exchange).

This opcode would return the <code>randao</code> value for a specified block/slot. (It could also be something like PREVRANDAO(n) to keep consistency).</p>\n<p>I read through the EIP, articles, and this discussion here: <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4399-supplant-difficulty-opcode-with-random/7368\" class=\"inline-onebox\">EIP-4399: Supplant DIFFICULTY opcode with RANDOM</a>. This lead me to think that many people wanted this extended functionality of <code>prevrandao</code> to be able to input a specific block.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this feasible?</strong><br>\nIf so, I think it could serve a purpose for smaller protocols to finally have secure on-chain randomness without any oracle integration. Larger protocols may continue to want off chain oracles, because there does appear to be relatively cheap attacks (block reward opportunity cost) to refuse to publish a block, or get 2^n bits/attempts per proposer that a malicious actor owns.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is it needed</strong><br>\nI’ve written an opinion piece <a href=\"https://medium.com/@alexbabits/why-block-prevrandao-is-a-useless-dangerous-trap-and-how-to-fix-it-5367ed3c6dfc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a> discussing the current failure of the <code>prevrandao</code> use case, and a potential fix with <code>RANDAO(n)</code>.</p>\n<p>In short, <code>block.prevrandao</code> has minimal use cases because the value it uses must be from a block that already exists. There is no way to “delay” the request for randomness to a later unknown time in the future when the randomness production should be revealed. The return value it uses must be from a block that already exists, and it’s <code>randao</code> value is determined by the immediate previous block that the transaction was finalized in. Using <code>block.prevrandao</code> can be taken advantage of in a simple manner. A malicious function can call the target protocol’s <code>getRandomness</code> type of function, which uses <code>block.prevrandao</code> as the powerhouse to generate it’s random number for users. This malicious function can revert if the generated random number is unfavorable, and only choose to execute when the number generated is favorable (see medium post).</p>\n<p>In contrast, if we had <code>RANDAO(n)</code>, this appears to be a step forward in achieving more secure on chain randomness. I’ve built a coin flip game to demonstrate the use case for <code>RANDAO(n)</code>.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"js\"><code class=\"lang-js\">// This doesn't compile because randao(n) doesn't exist.\n// DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION\n\nmapping(address =&gt; uint256) public usersBlockNumber;\n\nerror FailedEthTransfer();\nerror IncorrectPayment();\nerror AlreadyHasBlockNumber();\nerror NotMatured();\n\nfunction setUsersBlockNumber() public payable {\n    // User must not have a block number.\n    if (usersBlockNumber[msg.sender] != 0) revert AlreadyHasBlockNumber();\n\n    // User must pay in advance (0.01 ETH to play).\n    if (msg.value != 1e16) revert IncorrectPayment();\n\n    // Let the users block number be 4 epochs after this call.\n    usersBlockNumber[msg.sender] = block.number + 128;\n}\n\nfunction generateAndUseRandomness() public payable {\n    // Get user's block number.\n    uint256 usersBlock = usersBlockNumber[msg.sender];\n\n    // Must have a matured and valid block number associated with user.\n    if (usersBlock &lt; block.number) revert NotMatured();\n \n    // Generate random number from the block\n    randomNumber = (block.randao(usersBlock) % 100) + 1;\n\n    // Give user 0.02 ETH if won coinflip \n    // [51, 100] inclusive = 50 numbers = 50%.\n    if (randomNumber &gt; 50) {  \n        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: 2e16}(\"\");\n        if (!success) revert FailedEthTransfer();\n    }\n    \n    // Always set users block back to 0 after using randomness.\n    delete usersBlockNumber[msg.sender];\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice now the user has no way of manipulating the outcome after they have requested that a block be associated with them. The user cannot create a function that reverts when the randomness is unfavorable, because the randomness is not known at time of request, and can never be, because the request always references a block far into the future. At time of execution, the users block associated with them is always X distance away.</p>\n<p>We have the same security techniques as requesting a random number from Chainlink VRF, disallowing users to re-request randomness, and freezing any function calls for the user while they have a number associated with them but not yet used. Also, the depth of the request should be at least the maximum re-org depth I would guess. I’m unsure if a full 4 epochs of waiting time would be necessary for “lotteries” with less than the block reward value.</p>\n<p>If <code>RANDAO</code> were to use the slot instead of block, and the slot was empty, as mentioned in the original EIP-4399 discussion, it would have to look back further in the past to find a non-empty slot, or have some other technique. For this reason using the block number may be superior, even if the timing is not perfectly consistent, always having a valid number feels better?</p>\n<p>I am interested by what others have to say about the feasibility and impact or lack thereof for this new opcode that would act as an extension of <code>PREVRANDAO</code>.</p>\n            <p><small>11 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/expanding-eip-4399-prevrandao-with-randao-n/19741\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/expanding-eip-4399-prevrandao-with-randao-n/19741","pubDate":"Sun, 21 Apr 2024 21:33:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-19741"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/expanding-eip-4399-prevrandao-with-randao-n/19741.rss","#text":"Expanding EIP 4399 PREVRANDAO with RANDAO(n)"}},{"title":"ERC-7695: Ownership Delegation and Context for ERC-721","dc:creator":"ducthotran2010","category":"ERCs","description":"<p>Hi Magicians,</p>\n<p>I’m from the Axie community, currently, we’re currently grappling with scalability issues and want to encourage financial dApps for Axies without changing ownership due to lots of infrastructure and rewarding systems built on top of the ERC721 Axie standard.</p>\n<p>Therefore I would like to propose an extension for ERC-721 tokens to facilitate a broader range of dApps (involving renting, delegating actions, and collateral systems).

The motto of blockchains, “Verify, don’t trust!” tells you exactly that. DeFi apps today are not based on faith; they prevail because anyone can validate them.

Most analytics websites, Dune dashboards, and crypto reports are created using events as the most basic data primitive. Events are then transformed, combined, and grouped to create a metric in a chart or a table. Events are the building block of crypto data but are at risk of being undermined. To explain why this is happening, we need a good understanding of events’ inner workings.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-do-events-work-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#how-do-events-work-3\"></a>How do events work?</h2>\n<p>Skip this part if you have a good understanding of how events work.</p>\n<p>Events or Logs in EVMs are similar to code logs in any language. It’s one line in the code that, when the execution stumbles at it, will write the desired execution information in a ledger. A log record is used to surface information about a smart contract execution, like a token transfer or a change of ownership, so that it can be easily retrieved.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ede0a57073bf202d5c5284861c2a5c6eb256e30c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/ede0a57073bf202d5c5284861c2a5c6eb256e30c\" title=\"emit\"><img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/ede0a57073bf202d5c5284861c2a5c6eb256e30c_2_690x295.jpeg\" alt=\"emit\" data-base62-sha1=\"xWmsHeM6Zh2HGahqq9cxOrkfBcE\" width=\"690\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/ede0a57073bf202d5c5284861c2a5c6eb256e30c_2_690x295.jpeg, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/ede0a57073bf202d5c5284861c2a5c6eb256e30c_2_1035x442.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/ede0a57073bf202d5c5284861c2a5c6eb256e30c_2_1380x590.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F1F0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em>Example of the UniswapV3Factory contract code, which will emit the PoolCreated Event every time a pool is created.

Every node in the blockchain stores transaction receipts in the blocks. The back-end of analytics websites and data providers can then request the transaction receipts from any node and use this information to create the desired metrics.</p>\n<p>The solidity code is not what is stored in the blockchain. The function emit is compiled to a LOG opcode, and the node implementation dictates the contract execution flow when the LOG opcode is called. A block also includes some extra metadata to improve efficiency while querying receipts.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, retrieving data from events is much simpler than sourcing it from the state trie (Ethereum memory) while also allowing the retrieval of historical data, a much more complex task when using other sources since the state trie is constantly updated; you usually only have access to its latest state.</p>\n<p>This blog post from MyCrypto provides an excellent, in-depth explanation of events:</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://medium.com/mycrypto/understanding-event-logs-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-f4ae7ba50378\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/3/360db83263e79cba7951e7ba15aa4495131aa0f1.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"585858\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://medium.com/mycrypto/understanding-event-logs-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-f4ae7ba50378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" title=\"10:10PM - 04 March 2020\">Medium – 4 Mar 20</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/307;\"><img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/dd64e2151c9cb47e182b7f9d23757872f0b1d698_2_690x307.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"F4EFDD\" width=\"690\" height=\"307\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://medium.com/mycrypto/understanding-event-logs-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-f4ae7ba50378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Understanding event logs on the Ethereum blockchain</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Every transaction has an event log, but those event logs can be hard to read.</p>\n\n  <p>\n    <span class=\"label1\">Reading time: 6 min read</span>\n  </p>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<h2><a name=\"the-issue-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#the-issue-4\"></a>The issue</h2>\n<p>Events come at a cost. Each event incurs a minimum of 375 gas, with an additional 375 for each topic (32 bytes of indexed data) and eight gas for each byte in data (unindexed data). For instance, a Transfer event adds 1756 gas to the operation, while the entire transfer operation costs between 40,000 and 60,000 gas. The event emission cost is paid by the user when making a transaction.</p>\n<p>Because Ethereum is now expensive, this cost factor has led to discussions about making L1 transactions more affordable. Even though events represent a small fraction of a transaction cost, developers are already considering their removal, so their users don’t bear this cost. This creates a massive issue for data providers, leading them to centralized alternatives.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2c936f2231d1d3a551263c8ed2069c8d553848a0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/2c936f2231d1d3a551263c8ed2069c8d553848a0\" title=\"hayden\"><img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2c936f2231d1d3a551263c8ed2069c8d553848a0_2_587x499.jpeg\" alt=\"hayden\" data-base62-sha1=\"6mkSRj3VLhLx25FknzJWkrd9GIE\" width=\"587\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2c936f2231d1d3a551263c8ed2069c8d553848a0_2_587x499.jpeg, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2c936f2231d1d3a551263c8ed2069c8d553848a0_2_880x748.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2c936f2231d1d3a551263c8ed2069c8d553848a0_2_1174x998.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"0A0D0E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em>Heyden Adams, CEO of Uniswap, is polling about event removal in the next version of Uniswap. Even though the X poll is not a trustworthy source of truth, the fact that they consider it is troublesome. Uniswap V4 without events could tip the bucket to centralized solutions. Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1775907308372922464\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1775907308372922464</a></em></p>\n<p>Events solve two different problems. The first is obvious: easy access to execution data. Events store extra information in the receipts, making this data much more accessible. However, a second, often neglected, issue events solve is data curation. Knowing what to store is a challenging task. The blockchain generates an abundance of data, which can become overwhelming and hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights. Data curation is more suitable for those developing the protocol and deeply understanding its inner workings. When devs remove the events, they push this task to everyone further down in the data manipulation process. This is critical.</p>\n<p>Most alternatives to events are burdensome or rely on centralized data providers. Call traces, another outcome from transactions that are also decentralized, provide very limited access to execution data, and the actual state needs to be reconstructed from input parameters. This path is impractical, as any crypto data analyst who has ever tried it can attest, and it won’t be pursued given available centralized alternatives. Events can also be emulated by proprietary customized nodes that modify the deployed contracts and add fictitious events to the code. This approach requires centralized infrastructure to rewrite code, re-execute the blockchain, and deliver indexed events to consumers.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"potential-solutions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#potential-solutions-5\"></a>Potential Solutions</h2>\n<p>Events should be free. Even though end-users consume dashboards and charts, they shouldn’t bear the cost directly at each transaction. Events cost gas because every node needs to handle and store them in the receipts. Nodes would get bloated with useless events if they were free or much cheaper. We need to make log manipulation and storage optional. With free events, developers don’t need to remove them from their code, still maintaining the curation by protocol engineers and permanently written in the contract. Events are kept decentralized, although optional to anyone who wants to make use of them later.</p>\n<p>How can we do it? It’s time for an open-source node implementation dedicated to data applications. The initial “data node” MVP can be a fork of current execution nodes with some extra functionalities to handle data. In its most straightforward configuration, it will be responsible for treating the current events that exist today. This solution not only addresses the issue of event costs but also provides a platform for developers to freely manage and store crypto data in a format more suitable to their needs.</p>\n<p>The rationale is that if you’re a home-staker, you probably don’t care about storing events since you won’t do much with them and can run the existing node. Conversely, if you run a node to power some UI, you could care only about the events emitted by the protocol’s contracts in the UI. Lastly, if you’re a data provider, you care about most contracts and would store all; ultimately, this is part of your business anyway.</p>\n<p>We would also need to modify the current execution nodes. One alternative is implementing new opcodes for fictional/free events (Mnemonic FLOG) and keeping the current LOG opcode. FLOG would be ignored entirely by regular nodes. Still, on a “data node”, it would act similarly to the regular LOG opcodes, adding their output to some data structure (maybe in the same receipts) and indexing the relevant fields. Solidity compilers must also introduce functions and syntax that would be compiled to the new opcode. This proposal does not affect already deployed contracts, which would still spend gas on transactions. Only new contracts using the new opcode would benefit. Furthermore, it allows the ability to code payable events when necessary (a swap can have a free event, but a set_new_fee function can pay for it, storing it at every node). Alternatively, we can repurpose the current LOG opcodes to be free and ignored by regular nodes and make new opcodes for payable events that would follow the current log implementation.</p>\n<p>Other considerations must be made. Free events could be a potential vector for spammers’ contracts and others to abuse. Data consumers will require extra functionalities, like the ability only to track events from some contracts, some type of contracts ignore lists, or even some additional indexing. The “data node” team would be responsible for making design considerations providing the new customers of this node, data providers.</p>\n<p>One last alternative is to have special comments in solidity for fictional events. It doesn’t require any node change and keeps the curation by protocol developers, but it has the drawback that comments are not compiled to opcodes and, thus, are not deployed at the blockchain. The “data node” would only be able to act on it if it has access to this contract solidity source code, also needing re-execution of the new compiled version of the contract with the free log. Also, there is no guarantee that events are the same, as there is no way to verify comments onchain.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9095916513c041989ea6ff2e5574a7e391713738.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/9095916513c041989ea6ff2e5574a7e391713738\" title=\"standards\"><img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9095916513c041989ea6ff2e5574a7e391713738_2_690x391.jpeg\" alt=\"standards\" data-base62-sha1=\"kD3cCCLogJQ0UJFg4bE3VRg9eSk\" width=\"690\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9095916513c041989ea6ff2e5574a7e391713738_2_690x391.jpeg, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9095916513c041989ea6ff2e5574a7e391713738_2_1035x586.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9095916513c041989ea6ff2e5574a7e391713738_2_1380x782.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E1E1E1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#conclusion-6\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Simply removing events from the code is a terrible decision. It pushes UI development and analytics to proprietary products and platforms, centralizing the data-provider supply chain. Existing alternatives to events, like traces, are limited, burdensome, and onerous. However, protocol developers are also correct in trying to remove costs from their users. The only way to fight this tragedy of the commons situation is for the community to step forward and advocate for open-source, decentralized solutions. The existing data providers could also step forward and sponsor this idea, as their business relies entirely on that.</p>\n            <p><small>8 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/events-should-be-free/19712\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/events-should-be-free/19712","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Apr 2024 01:20:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-19712"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/events-should-be-free/19712.rss","#text":"Events Should Be Free"}},{"title":"Increasing contract size limit with increasing gas cost beyond 24.5Kb","dc:creator":"0xTraub","category":"Core EIPs","description":"<p>Vitalik’s <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-170</a> which set the current contract size limit at 24.5 Kb was written in 2016, over 8 years ago. Since then a lot has changed about the protocol, including the roadmap decision to include the verge and the purge. I think it is time to reconsider our current contract size limitations. As contracts get bigger and Dapps more complex, this limit becomes a bottleneck for many developers. The restriction has resulted in several design suggestions as well, with the Diamond-Standard being the most popular. However, writing and interacting with Diamond-contracts is a pain point for many developers, and it is not without its own issues. I  want to get started the conversation about how we can increase the contract size-limit without compromising on things like state-growth, decentralization, and security.</p>\n<p>My current idea is fairly simple. The current contract size limit should be doubled from ~24.5Kb to ~49Kb. However, 24.5Kb should remain as target, with additional bytes incurring an increasing gas cost per byte, up to the max limit.</p>\n<p>Current code cost is defined in the EVM as <code>code_deposit_cost = 200 * deployed_code_size </code></p>\n<p>Based on the memory expansion cost, this should put the equation as something like <code>200 * contract_size + floor(size^2 / 24500)</code></p>\n<p>I think that this cost should be defined either as a step-function, or more likely as an exponential increase beyond a floor, similar to the memory-expansion cost. A hard-cap should probably be maintained to guard against the DOS-Vector Vitalik lays out in <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-170</a>, but increased nonetheless. However, it could be possible to conceive of a proposal where exponentially increasing cost combined with block-gas-limits prevents against any security issues, and the cap can be removed entirely.</p>\n<p>A second potential proposal could be something akin to multi-dimensional EIP-1559, where a target amount of new code is set per-block and the gas cost of deployment dynamic with a target. However, this would be contingent upon other major consensus changes, and is not suggested in the interim.</p>\n<p>There’s definitely an appetite in the solidity community for increasing the limit, the question is how to do it with minimal consensus changes. Implementation would be fairly simple as its only a question of what the gas equation ought to be, and can be tweaked in the future as hardware requirements and further state-expiry proposals shift as well.</p>\n<p>There must be some reason why nobody has taken this question up? Contract size limitations are a major pain point for solidity developers. The only discussion i’ve seen on this forum is from 2019, pre-merge/1559 and discussion seems to have stalled out.</p>\n            <p><small>8 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/increasing-contract-size-limit-with-increasing-gas-cost-beyond-24-5kb/19708\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/increasing-contract-size-limit-with-increasing-gas-cost-beyond-24-5kb/19708","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Apr 2024 21:37:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-19708"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/increasing-contract-size-limit-with-increasing-gas-cost-beyond-24-5kb/19708.rss","#text":"Increasing contract size limit with increasing gas cost beyond 24.5Kb"}},{"title":"ERC-7694: Solana Storage Router","dc:creator":"sshmatrix","category":"ERCs","description":"<p>This standard is an extension to <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7700-cross-chain-storage-router-protocol/19853\">EIP-7700</a> introducing storage router for Solana.

In 2020, SmartWeave introduced an Arweave-based protocol that operates as a general lazy evaluator for data computation. By implementing smart blobs, this proposal aims to decouple state transitions (which occur on-chain, using blobs) from execution processes (which occur off-chain, using a SmartWeave instance), enhancing efficiency and reducing costs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this EIP addresses the isolation of the SmartWeave protocol within the Arweave network and the lack of DA guarantees in Arweave. Smart blobs provide a standardized framework for deploying a SmartWeave execution machine for any EVM network that supports EIP-4844.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protocol-design-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#protocol-design-5\"></a>Protocol design</h3>\n<p>The design of the proposal’s protocol is both a simple and straightforward <em><strong>computation protocol</strong></em>. State transitions (transactions) are posted as EIP-4844 transactions by the user on the EVM network and then submitted by the user or dApp to the sequencer. The sequencer captures the EVM on-chain transaction, decodes the transaction data, performs the corresponding off-chain execution, and then indexes the state changes in the cloud (cache) after transmitting the blob data to Arweave.</p>\n<p>To simplify the expansion of the protocol design, “blobvm” refers to an execution machine deployed according to the standards of this EIP. The terms “smart blob” and “blobvm smart contract” are used interchangeably.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"blobvm-transactions-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#blobvm-transactions-6\"></a>blobVM transactions</h3>\n<p>On the protocol level, blobVM distinguishes between 2 types of transactions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>type 1</code> : contract deployments</li>\n<li><code>type 2</code> : contract calls</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Transactions data structure MUST be as follows:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"contract-deployment-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#contract-deployment-7\"></a>Contract deployment</h4>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"json\"><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n  \"type\": 1,\n  \"sc\": [],\n  \"state\":[]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4><a name=\"contract-call-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#contract-call-8\"></a>Contract call</h4>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"json\"><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n  \"type\": 2,\n  \"inputs\": [],\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Data encoding</strong></p>\n<p>The properties <code>sc</code>, <code>state</code>, and <code>inputs</code> are initialized as listed below.

This is because to fetch the final state of the contract, an entity requiring this state must execute all past state transitions (transactions) of the required contract.</p>\n<p>The ability to do any non-deterministic behavior in the runtime would mean the possibility of different states on each re-evaluation (and so each time the contract’s state is fetched in a trustless way).</p>\n<p>The execution also has to be gas-metered to avoid resource abuse and DoS attacks.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7689-smart-blobs/19672\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7689-smart-blobs/19672","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 17:49:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-19672"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7689-smart-blobs/19672.rss","#text":"ERC-7689: Smart Blobs"}},{"title":"EIP-7685 General purpose execution layer requests","dc:creator":"matt","category":"Core EIPs","description":"<p>Discussion for <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8432\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Add EIP: General purpose execution layer requests by lightclient · Pull Request #8432 · ethereum/EIPs · GitHub</a></p>\n            <p><small>11 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7685-general-purpose-execution-layer-requests/19668\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7685-general-purpose-execution-layer-requests/19668","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 14:21:08 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-19668"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7685-general-purpose-execution-layer-requests/19668.rss","#text":"EIP-7685 General purpose execution layer requests"}},{"title":"ERC-5559: Cross-chain Write Deferral Protocol","dc:creator":"sshmatrix","category":"EIPs","description":"<p>The following proposal is a superseding version of <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-5559-cross-chain-write-deferral-protocol/10576\">EIP-5559: Cross-Chain Write Deferral Protocol</a>, aka <em>CCIP-Write</em>, replacing Ethereum L1 storage with L2 chains and cryptographically secure databases with an aim to cut gas costs and further privacy while retaining the secure aspects of on-chain storage.

Here’s a short summary of why EIP 3074 is a bad idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User funds at risk</strong>: One signature and you lose everything. Relies on wallets preventing this, and users understanding the new security model. Fragile assumptions. Hardware wallets won’t protect users unless their UX is rehauled</li>\n<li><strong>Dangerous lack of security controls</strong>: to enable use cases such as gas abstraction EIP 3074 requires giving full access to all of your assets. EIP 3074 is trust maximized. It is an all or nothing “sudo root” access model. This is unlike  4337’s trust minimized design where paymasters are incapable of stealing your funds</li>\n<li><strong>Confusing security model that’s harder for users to understand</strong>: EIP 3074 makes the EOA security model much harder to understand, even for experts, but especially for normal humans. Violates the principle of least surprise (see more below)</li>\n<li><strong>Doesn’t improve UX overall</strong>: because losing all of your funds to a scam is not good UX. The benefits EIP 3074 claims to provide can be achieved more safely in other ways</li>\n<li><strong>Other security problems</strong>: adds new authorization methods to an EOA while being incapable of revoking the old hardwired EOA key. Many potential problems with breaking dapp assumptions around EOAs. Needs more thorough auditing</li>\n<li><strong>Permissioned innovation</strong>:  dapp devs won’t be able to develop their own invokers since all wallets will whitelist them once users start getting scammed.</li>\n<li><strong>Creates two incompatible wallet stacks</strong>: This will fragment UX and liquidity even more</li>\n<li><strong>Unnecessary</strong>: given that account abstraction (ERC 4337) is already on mainnet and we are on the way to having gas efficient native account abstraction in the protocol and standardized on all the rollups</li>\n<li><strong>Enshrines friction and bloat</strong>: Instead of helping us on the path to account abstraction, EIP 3074 enshrines EOAs and adds an ugly layer of cruft to the protocol that we will never be able to get rid of. As soon as it gets in, the campaign for more kludgy EIPs built on top of it will start. Patches to patches to patches, all the way down.</li>\n<li><strong>Incompatible with inclusion lists</strong>: which we need to mitigate how easy it is now to censor transactions now with centralized block building</li>\n<li><strong>Strategically bad second order effects</strong>: promotes centralized solutions as the path of least resistance (eg centralized meta transaction relays, too big to fail monopoly around Metamask’s invoker contract)</li>\n<li>Credit for these arguments goes to various critics of EIP 3074 including:\n<ul>\n<li>Vitalik: <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/we-should-be-moving-beyond-eoas-not-enshrining-them-even-further-eip-3074-related/6538\">“we should be moving beyond EOAs not enshrining them”</a></li>\n<li>Yoav Weiss, EF security fellow and architect of 4337: <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/erc-4337-vs-eip-3074-false-dichotomy#ERC-4337-vs-EIP-3074-False-dichotomy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">“ERC 4337 vs EIP 3074”</a></li>\n<li>Ansgar @ EF researcher: one of the original EIP 3074 authors</li>\n<li>Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger</li>\n<li>Martin Köppelmann Gnosis co-founder</li>\n<li>Itamar Lesuisse: Founder and CEO of the Argent wallet</li>\n<li>Patricio @ Founder at POAP</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"why-is-it-a-problem-that-eip-3074-violates-the-principle-of-least-surprise-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#why-is-it-a-problem-that-eip-3074-violates-the-principle-of-least-surprise-1\"></a>Why is it a problem that EIP 3074 violates the principle of least surprise?</h2>\n<p>The general problem with losing the principle of least surprise is that the user expects a transaction to happen once, now.  With 3074 it becomes “the transaction may happen any number of times now or in the future unless the invoker enforces replay protection”.</p>\n<p>In addition there’s the issue of opaqueness (unlike a batching transaction type). From looking at the transaction, it’s impossible to know exactly what it’s going to do.   Maybe the invoker transfers the tokens as you requested but also sets an allowance for someone to withdraw more in the future.  Or maybe it sponsors your gas for some transaction but also delegates your governance tokens in some project to a malicious delegate who will silently collect a lot of voting power by sponsoring people’s transaction in some other protocol.</p>\n<p>Users won’t notice since they retain their tokens.  They just delegated their voting power to an attacker but are not affected directly.  Or maybe an invoker is an upgradable proxy that is safe now, but in the future it’ll change its implementation to do something else and reuse your old AUTH.  Easy to come up with scary scenarios.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"community-feedback-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#community-feedback-2\"></a>Community feedback</h2>\n<p><a
