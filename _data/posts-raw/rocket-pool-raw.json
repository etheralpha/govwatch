More information on this proposal can be found at <a href=\"https://rpl.rehab\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">rpl.rehab</a>. This rework includes an informational overview in RPIP-49 as well as a number of RPIPs (42-47, 59, 60) used to specify the various aspects.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"sentiment-poll-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#sentiment-poll-2\"></a>Sentiment Poll</h3>\n<p>The headline item here is that we’ve posted a sentiment poll below where you vote on whether to move the RPIP-49 tokenomics rework to a snapshot vote.</p>\n<p>The snapshot vote would be a vote on the tokenomics rework package as a whole. This means you will be voting on the direction and general contents of the rework, and the specific contents of the included RPIPs as written.</p>\n<p>However, we think it’s valuable to keep the RPIPs in a Living state rather than Finalized at this time. This will provide the flexibility to make <strong>minor</strong> adjustments in response to any issues discovered by the core team during implementation.</p>\n<p>There are several <a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-49#still-to-ratify-prior-to-saturn-1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">specific items</a> we are intentionally leaving flexible at this time, these items will be ratified prior to the launch of Saturn 1. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Saturn 2 Surplus Share Strategy</strong> - Determine how to manage surplus share in Saturn 2: Buy+Burn, Buy+LP, or higher voter_share?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deposit Strategy</strong> - A small amount of UX and gas research to help determine if we want a 2TX or 3TX deposit strategy for validator creation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Penalty System</strong> - Research and specify a MEV theft detection and penalizing system</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security Council NO commission changes</strong> - Determine when and how the council should use their limited power to change no_commission.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We foresee at least 2 follow-on votes - one for Surplus Share strategy and one to ratify the final states of the RPIPs.

This makes sense, since that is the definition of yield: returns per unit of account.</p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5190735fa057e53319ffa9b4fb2f579de6e85361.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"bDy9SbgxLbi3MRjF3vjJAs86U0N\" width=\"332\" height=\"38\" role=\"presentation\"></strong></p>\n<p>Next, we want to know how much a Rocket Pool Node Operator earns on a per ETH basis.<br>\nTo calculate this, it would be the eth_bond provided by the Node Operator times the standard staking yield, plus the yield earned by the borrowed ETH multiplied by the commission rate, where the “borrowed ETH” is just 32 ETH minus the ETH provided by the NO.</p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8256aadf7f89706d2d13b7ba735b9041fc34b0b2.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"iB1KPC2fbEs7cYDOcSHAx7vZx7k\" width=\"408\" height=\"38\" role=\"presentation\"></strong></p>\n<p>However, we want to know how much is earned per ETH invested, so we would divide this by the ETH provided by the Node Operator, which is the eth_bond.</p>\n<p>We now have our numerator and our denominator.

We have:</p>\n<p>((32/8) - 1)*0.14 + 1 = 1.42</p>\n<p>Again, this is what we expect - we recover the 42% increased ETH rewards which was used to advertise LEB8s.</p>\n<p>How about when the eth_bond is very small, say, 0.01 ETH?</p>\n<p>((32/0.01) - 1)*0.14 + 1 = ~ 448</p>\n<p>Again, this is what we expect, as per the above graph.</p>\n<p>As the eth_bond gets small, the 32/eth_bond term dominates, and the function looks like a 32/x function, where x is our independent variable - the Node Operator’s eth_bond.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"hurdle-rate-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#hurdle-rate-4\"></a>Hurdle Rate</h2>\n<p>Lido’s CSM is advertising at least 50% more returns for Node Operators compared to solo staking. To continue to be relevant in the liquid staking market, <strong>Rocket Pool must achieve returns that are more competitive than 1.5x the solo staking yield for its Node Operators,<br>\non a per ETH basis.</strong></p>\n<p>As you can see from the above, LEB4 at 14% commission achieves this goal, returning ~ 2x the solo staking return in pure ETH rewards, without accounting for the RPL income from RPL inflation.</p>\n<p>Once the protocol gets forced exits, the eth_bond can be reduced to 1.5 ETH, which would increase the ETH denominated yield to 3.85 times the solo staking yield!</p>\n<p>Another way to think about the above graph is - on the <strong>far right of the graph</strong> when eth_bond = 16, it <strong>maximizes value accrual for the RPL/ETH ratio.</strong></p>\n<p>On the far left of the graph, where we get into LEB range - <strong>it maximizes for protocol TVL</strong> - while also exposing Node Operators to much more borrowed ETH, and hence ETH denominated revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>LEB8 was smack dab in the middle of these two positions</strong> - optimizing for neither one.</p>\n<p>So <strong>what is the tradeoff space that Rocket Pool should be operating in?</strong></p>\n<p>Pay Node Operators in ETH by exposing them to more of the ETH yield through <strong>borrowed ETH, without overly constraining the size of the Node Operator set.</strong> This is the true commission for Node Operators.<br>\nIf we run out of demand for rETH (this is a long runway, in my opinion) then we reduce the rETH commission from 14% → 10%.</p>\n<p>Even at 10% commission for Node Operators, they would still be earning ~ 3x pure ETH rewards compared to solo stakers for LEB1.5s!</p>\n<h2><a name=\"part-2-rpl-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#part-2-rpl-5\"></a>Part 2: RPL</h2>\n<p>The second part of my proposal is to change the RPL collateral requirement from 10% of “borrowed eth”, to 10% of the “eth_bond”, or the ETH brought to the protocol by the Node Operator.</p>\n<p>This would represent a reduction in the RPL collateral required for LEB minipools. The reason for this reduction is simple. Node Operators have made it clear that they want to earn ETH, not RPL.</p>\n<p>By reducing the Node Operator’s required exposure to RPL, the ETH rewards that I detail above will dominate - making being a Rocket Pool NO far more attractive.</p>\n<p>I model what these returns would look like in various RPL performance situations below.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is Node Operators would be significantly more profitable in this proposal relative to solo stakers in pure ETH rewards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"so-why-rpl-at-all-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#so-why-rpl-at-all-6\"></a>So, why RPL at all?</h3>\n<p>RPL has served, and still would with this proposal, as a “shield” of decentralization for Rocket Pool, to put it a bit dramatically.</p>\n<p>RPL would still serve to help keep the protocol decentralized.</p>\n<p>This is likely due to ambiguity surrounding legal RPL’s status, and also large corporations’ unwillingness to go that far out on the risk curve by owning RPL, which is a requirement to be a Node Operator.</p>\n<p>The result is that quite a significant portion of Rocket Pool’s Node Operator set are home stakers, who have the freedom to invest their own funds however they wish.</p>\n<p>The other aspect is governance. RPL still has utility as a governance token.</p>\n<p>RPL would retain the same functionality and utility it has today, the only difference is Node Operators would now derive the vast majority of their returns from the commission on borrowed ETH - and not their exposure to RPL.</p>\n<p>Would this be negative for the RPL/ETH ratio?</p>\n<p>Potentially in the short term, but I do not think so in the long term. Prioritizing TVL growth for the protocol will have a greatly positive effect on the RPL/ETH ratio in the longer term horizon.</p>\n<p>Empirically, LDO is worth 5 times as much as RPL in ETH market cap terms. This is likely in part due to holders’ belief that owning LDO is a call option on Lido’s willingness to turn on the fee switch in the future.</p>\n<p>The take-away is this: <strong>if Rocket Pool had 22% market share - empirically, RPL/ETH ratio would be significantly higher than it is today.</strong></p>\n<p>I am not necessarily against turning on the fee switch for RPL - but turning it on today, when the protocol only has 4% of the liquid staking market, would be incredibly pre-mature.</p>\n<p>Rocket Pool should instead <strong>prioritize TVL growth</strong> by maintaining the 14% rETH commission (for now) and lowering the eth_bond for Node Operators, unlocking multiples of pure ETH yield relative to solo staking.</p>\n<p>An additional important point is that by turning on the fee switch for RPL, RPL’s valuation would then become sensitive to the ETH staking yield, which will likely continue to compress over time.</p>\n<p>The benefit of the proposal that I have detailed above is that it is not sensitive to the staking yield (as long as it remains positive!).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"so-what-do-returns-look-like-for-this-proposal-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#so-what-do-returns-look-like-for-this-proposal-7\"></a>So, what do returns look like for this proposal?</h2>\n<p>I have put together a model of forward looking returns, denominated in ETH.</p>\n<p>I make two assumptions.</p>\n<p>The first is that the vanilla ETH staking yield starts at 3.5% and declines to 2% linearly over the next five years, then remains at 2% terminally.</p>\n<p>The next assumption I make is that the RPL yield is 8%, which is what it was when I made this tool a year ago, although it has since climbed to 9% today.

We therefore present this as an alternative to the rework, and believe our proposal will lead to better outcomes for the entire Rocket Pool community.</p>\n<p>The fundamental difference between our proposals is in maintaining the essential RPL collateral requirement, which is critical for protecting Rocket Pool’s decentralized validator set. The rework proposal’s abandonment of this requirement, and lack of alternative safeguards, exposes the protocol to the risk of centralized takeover.</p>\n<p>Additionally, removing the collateral requirement, which has historically been the primary value driver for RPL, exposes the token to significant price risk. Without RPL collateral, the demand for RPL is likely to decrease sharply. We expect significant reductions in staked RPL should the rework proposal be adopted, leading to increased supply on the market and exacerbating the downward pressure on price.</p>\n<p>A lower price for RPL diminishes the protocol’s economic security, making it cheaper for malicious actors to acquire a controlling stake in the token. This increased affordability heightens the risk of governance attacks, as attackers can more easily accumulate enough tokens to influence or override protocol decisions. Consequently, the removal of the collateral requirement not only threatens the stability and value of RPL but also risks compromising the security and integrity of the entire governance system.</p>\n<p>We are not the only ones to reach this conclusion. NodeSet, in their <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/18qeZMb8r1ryxngh5b6XNew-Af_XUyMnm/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">review</a> of the tokenomics rework, also flagged the “extreme centralization risk” inherent to this approach. Despite receiving the same feedback from multiple parties the authors are nonetheless pushing forward with this risky and economically-flawed proposal.</p>\n<p>Instead of abandoning the RPL collateral requirement and the protection it provides, our proposal transforms it into a strategic asset, leveraging it to drive protocol growth while enabling RPL holders to earn yield on their RPL. This approach not only safeguards decentralization but also fuels expansion and rewards for the community.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Our proposal’s overarching aim is to position Rocket Pool as the premier choice in the Liquid Staking Token (LST) space, appealing to both Node Operators (NOs) and rETH holders. To achieve this, our strategy focuses on five critical pillars:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unlock TVL Growth by Enabling Efficient Scaling for NOs</strong>: Our approach removes the burdensome RPL exposure requirement, empowering NOs to scale their operations more efficiently. By decoupling NO performance from RPL price volatility, we create a more stable and attractive environment for potential operators.</li>\n<li><strong>Harness Competition to Optimize rETH’s APY</strong>: We leverage market competition among NOs to enhance rETH’s APY.</li>\n<li><strong>Introduce Scalable Bond Curves</strong>: Our proposal includes more scalable sublinear bond curves, enabling NOs to deploy more ETH from the pool. This innovation increases capital efficiency, allowing Rocket Pool to handle greater volumes and drive further growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhance Decentralization Protections</strong>: We introduce robust mechanisms to safeguard against centralization, ensuring the protocol remains decentralized and resilient. These protections are crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of Rocket Pool.</li>\n<li><strong>Allow RPL holders and pDAO to earn RPL yield</strong>: We give RPL holders and pDAO the opportunity to earn yield on their RPL, providing additional rewards to the community and ongoing protocol revenue to pDAO.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To achieve these objectives, we propose the implementation of a delegated staking system. This system empowers RPL holders to delegate their RPL to NOs, earning a share of validator commissions in return. This in turn allows NOs to scale up without any direct RPL exposure.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"components-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#components-2\"></a>Components</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"delegated-staking-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#delegated-staking-3\"></a>Delegated Staking</h2>\n<p>One major factor that has constrained Rocket Pool’s growth is the requirement for a single entity to provide ETH, RPL, and possess the technical ability to operate Ethereum validators. While one solution might be to abandon the collateral requirement entirely, this approach leaves the protocol vulnerable to centralized takeover, which is not a viable option.</p>\n<p>A more effective strategy is to separate these roles, allowing one party to provide the ETH and another to provide the RPL. The protocol has already taken initial steps in this direction with the introduction of whale marriages. However, whale marriages are inherently flawed because they are only accessible to large ETH and RPL holders, making them a centralizing force within the protocol.</p>\n<p>Delegated staking rectifies this issue by enabling any RPL holder—large or small—to participate in delegation and earn a share of validator rewards in exchange for providing the NO’s collateral. By democratizing whale marriages, we allow the entire Rocket Pool ecosystem to participate, rather than limiting involvement to large ETH/RPL holders.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"commission-structure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#commission-structure-4\"></a>Commission Structure</h3>\n<p>Similar to UARS, our proposal divides the validator commission (i.e. the rewards that do not go directly to rETH) into several shares:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Share name</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>no_share</td>\n<td>Paid to NO in ETH</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>delegate_share</td>\n<td>Paid to NO’s delegates in RPL (bought with delegate_share ETH)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>extra_reth_share</td>\n<td>Paid to rETH in ETH</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>recollateralization_share</td>\n<td>Used to purchase protocol-owned RPL when NO is undercollateralized</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The max_commission_rate parameter is set by the pDAO, controlling the maximum commission that NOs can charge and setting an upper limit on commissions at the protocol level. The current commission rate of 14% is higher than Lido but the full deposit pool demonstrates high demand at this price point. We propose leaving the max_commission_rate at 14% and reducing as necessary according to demand.</p>\n<p>Each NO sets their own no_share when establishing their node, which must be lower than the max_commission_rate.</p>\n<p>The remaining value - calculated as the difference between max_commission_rate and no_share - is strategically allocated between delegate_share and extra_reth_share, optimizing incentives for both NOs and delegates while enhancing rETH’s APY.</p>\n<p>Illustrative examples of the distribution:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ec74ad71d314c2f98578551939a53f19f915ca2b.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"xJMF8k2busp9wXbLL6jmjk6vyRB\" width=\"582\" height=\"266\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p>To attract delegation, NOs will need to increase their delegate_share. The only way to do this is by reducing their no_share, which also increases the extra_reth_share, thus enhancing rETH’s APY. This system incentivizes NOs to boost their validator rewards and delegates to increase their delegation rewards.</p>\n<p>Our proposal harnesses market forces and the rational self-interest of participants, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and increased rETH APY. This market-driven approach ensures sustainable and organic expansion of the Rocket Pool ecosystem.</p>\n<p>If a NO is undercollateralized - more on this in the next section - a portion of their rewards (recollateralization_share) is used to purchase protocol-owned RPL on behalf of pDAO, bringing them back to the minimum collateralization ratio automatically.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"collateralisation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#collateralisation-5\"></a>Collateralisation</h3>\n<p>We propose retaining the 10% of borrowed ETH collateral ratio, with modifications that simplify its maintenance for NOs. The collateral requirement provides numerous benefits to the protocol. Rather than abandoning it, we have designed our system to transform this requirement into an asset rather than a liability.</p>\n<p>To create new validators, a NO must be at or above the min_collateral_ratio. A NO who falls below this ratio will need to attract delegation or purchase their own RPL to create more validators.</p>\n<p>Fluctuations in RPL price can temporarily push a NO over the max_collateral_ratio. In this scenario, the NO cannot receive additional delegated RPL but can launch more validators if they have sufficient ETH. Launching new validators will reduce their collateralization ratio, bringing it below the maximum and allowing them to receive additional RPL delegation. This ensures the system never becomes deadlocked.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Can add validators</th>\n<th>Can receive delegation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Under min collateral</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/images/emoji/twitter/x.png?v=12\" title=\":x:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":x:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>In between min and max</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Over max collateral</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/images/emoji/twitter/x.png?v=12\" title=\":x:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":x:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>To further simplify the process for NOs, new NOs will not be required to provide collateral in advance for their first n validators. They can launch their validators without staked or delegated RPL, and their node will be collateralized with pDAO-owned RPL. This approach makes RPL collateral entirely invisible for new NOs, balancing the simplicity of onboarding with the necessary protection against centralization. The collateral requirement only becomes visible for larger NOs.</p>\n<p>While some NOs might attempt to use sock puppets and run multiple nodes to exploit the collateral-free validators, this strategy would prevent them from benefiting from the increased yield provided for lower ETH bonds. The economically rational decision would be to run as many validators as possible in a single megapool and attract delegation to reach the required collateral amount.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protocol-owned-rpl-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#protocol-owned-rpl-6\"></a>Protocol-owned RPL</h3>\n<p>If a NO is below the min_collateral_ratio and has not attracted sufficient RPL delegation (or purchased their own RPL), the protocol will act as the “delegate of last resort.” In this scenario, a share of the NO’s commission - the recollateralization_share - is used to purchase RPL on behalf of the pDAO, which is then automatically delegated to the NO. The automatic purchases continue until the NO has reached the minimum delegation. This guarantees that as long as the NO continues earning rewards, they will eventually reach the minimum collateralization level even if they cannot attract delegation.</p>\n<p>The RPL owned by the pDAO provides additional RPL yield to the protocol, potentially allowing RPL inflation to be reduced to zero in the future. This also gives the pDAO new tools to incentivize the type of decentralized NOs the protocol wishes to attract. Protocol-aligned NOs can be made more profitable than centralized entities, counterbalancing the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operators.</p>\n<p>For example, the pDAO can delegate to protocol-aligned operators (e.g., home stakers) at a lower delegate_share than the prevailing market rate non-aligned NOs are required to offer. This increases the profitability for that NO, giving home stakers a level playing field against centralized operators.</p>\n<p>While not a part of our current proposal, this lays the foundation for a future “community RPL pool” which automatically manages delegation to NOs and acts as a “delegate rewards smoothing pool”.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"sublinear-bond-curves-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#sublinear-bond-curves-7\"></a>Sublinear Bond Curves</h2>\n<p>To accelerate protocol growth, we propose building upon the foundation laid in the Megapools and Bond Curve RPIPs. Our research, summarized below, shows there is further room to safely enhance capital efficiency through the use of sublinear bond curves. This optimization allows NOs to deploy more ETH from the pool, driving greater protocol growth.</p>\n<p>We propose that depending on the total number of validators for a given node operator v, the total collateral requirement in ETH C(v) is given by: C(v) = C(1)*v^p</p>\n<p>For example, using C(1)=4 ETH and p=⅔:</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d.png\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d_2_624x312.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"4XeuSoxg3X500InGOlwj8xXNVYF\" width=\"624\" height=\"312\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d_2_624x312.png, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d_2_936x468.png 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEEEF4\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<p>Currently, about 35% of nodes run one validator, so there would be no change unless they added more validators.

The right axis/gray bars show the current distribution, e.g. about 1200 operators running one validator. The conclusion is that compared to the world of vanilla LEB4, relatively less collateral is needed as the number of validators per node increases.</p>\n<p>For efficiency and improved user experience we propose providing a list of bond amounts at rounded values, as opposed to implementing the curve in Solidity and allowing NOs to choose any point on the curve.</p>\n<p>We recommend introducing a cap on the total amount of ETH a node operator can borrow to limit protocol risk.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"deposit-queue-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#deposit-queue-8\"></a>Deposit Queue</h2>\n<p>We anticipate that our proposed changes will lead to significant growth in validator count. Therefore, it is crucial to address how we handle both full and empty deposit pool scenarios.</p>\n<p>Previously, the protocol increased the commission rate for a NO when the deposit pool was full. However, this system had a fundamental flaw: the increased commission applied for the lifetime of the validator, leading to two major issues. First, NOs were incentivized to wait for higher commissions before launching validators. Second, the extra commission was taken from rETH’s APY, effectively reducing returns for rETH holders.</p>\n<p>Our approach retains the benefits of incentivizing NOs to add validators while eliminating the drawbacks. To motivate NOs to add validators, the pDAO will delegate RPL to potential new NOs. The pDAO can offer to delegate at gradually reduced commission rates until the first NO accepts the offer, effectively providing a subsidy without the need for further coordination. This method ensures that NOs receive the necessary incentives to add validators quickly and efficiently, maintaining the overall effectiveness of the system.</p>\n<p>This new system offers two significant improvements over the old one:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The cost of the subsidy is paid from the pDAO’s RPL yield, not from rETH’s APY.</li>\n<li>The pDAO can remove the subsidy when it is no longer required, ensuring flexibility and efficiency.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In scenarios where the deposit queue is empty, and we have a queue of NOs ready to add validators as soon as protocol ETH becomes available, we propose several options depending on our optimization goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To optimize for decentralization, prioritize NOs with the lowest validator count</li>\n<li>To optimize for rETH APY, prioritize NOs with the lowest no_share.</li>\n<li>To optimize for TVL, prioritize NOs with the highest staked or delegated RPL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, we recommend adopting certain components from RPIP-59 Deposit Mechanics to ensure smaller NOs are not blocked behind larger ones and to give existing NOs priority for migration.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rpl-inflation-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#rpl-inflation-9\"></a>RPL Inflation</h2>\n<p>RPL inflation will be gradually reduced to 1.5% over approximately six months. Over time, as the pDAO accumulates sufficient protocol-owned RPL, we expect to see inflation reduced to zero. This strategy ensures long-term sustainability and value retention for RPL holders, contributing to the overall health and growth of the Rocket Pool ecosystem</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Our proposal aims to create a more robust, decentralized, and efficient Rocket Pool ecosystem. By addressing the fundamental issues of speculative risks, RPL rewards, collateral requirements, and system brittleness, we provide a comprehensive solution that fosters stability and growth. Our approach ensures that NOs can operate with confidence and predictability, while maintaining the protocol’s security and decentralization.</p>\n<p>We respect the authors of the opposing proposal and acknowledge the innovations they have introduced in the rework. These contributions are valuable and have the potential to significantly benefit the Rocket Pool community. We hope that, if our proposal passes, we can work together constructively with the rework team. Their expertise and continued input would be invaluable to the protocol, and we believe that collaboration will lead to the best outcomes for Rocket Pool.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enhance Rocket Pool for the entire community, ensuring a secure, decentralized, and thriving protocol. By combining the strengths of both proposals and working together, we can achieve the best possible outcomes for Rocket Pool’s future.</p>\n<p>We look forward to the community’s feedback, and will be in Discord if you have any questions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"disclaimers-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#disclaimers-11\"></a>Disclaimers</h2>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: Rocket Pool is a 1kx portfolio investment.</em></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article is for general information purposes only and should not be construed as or relied upon in any manner as investment, financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or similar advice.

We would like to suggest a slightly different approach, viewing our proposal not as a replacement but as an extension of the existing one.</p>\n<p>Given the timelines involved, we have attempted to strike a balance between getting the proposal in front of the community as soon as possible, while also providing sufficient detail to allow for an informed comparison.</p>\n<p>In brief, our primary disagreement with the existing rework proposal is that it prematurely abandons RPL’s primary value driver—the RPL collateral requirement for validators. We recognize that the proposed token rework contains other benefits, but we believe Houston’s new features can be better leveraged to further accelerate our main goal of maximizing rETH’s sustainable yield to position Rocket Pool as the most attractive LST in the space – <strong>we call this the “maxETH” strategy</strong>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"introduction-maxeth-3-reth-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#introduction-maxeth-3-reth-1\"></a>Introduction: “maxETH” &lt;3 rETH</h2>\n<p>One main reason Rocket Pool has become so popular is because of its alignment with Ethereum’s core values. However, this merited gravitation towards decentralization can only attract so much TVL, and the average user’s preferences are driven by three realities: high yields, deep liquidity, and DeFi utility. Since we believe that the former leads to the latter two, our primary goal is to maximize the rETH’s sustainable APY as it is the single most important attribute for any LST.</p>\n<p>The “maxETH” strategy has 3 main components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Align rETH growth with NO growth by adding a <strong>dynamic global commission</strong> structure based on deposit pool utilization</li>\n<li>Introduce <strong>RPL delegation</strong> to provide additional utility to RPL and allow stakers to select highly performant NOs from a Node Operator Performance Dashboard</li>\n<li>Safely accelerate protocol growth and reduce MEV theft risk by accelerating <strong>Bonding Curves</strong> adoption</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-changes-in-brief-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#proposed-changes-in-brief-2\"></a>Proposed Changes in Brief</h2>\n<p>The core of our proposal is a delegated staking system, described in more detail below.</p>\n<p>We propose to initially set the surplus_share to zero, increasing rETH APY.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-386x460uploadce1wjeitkxih1froxdedlev2v1vpng-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#h-386x460uploadce1wjeitkxih1froxdedlev2v1vpng-3\"></a><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/5/58a0544a029f0e36a73de54dc0e4fc01df05a681.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"cE1wjEItkXIH1frOXdeDlEV2V1v\" width=\"386\" height=\"460\" role=\"presentation\"></h2>\n<h2><a name=\"h-1-dynamic-global-commission-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#h-1-dynamic-global-commission-4\"></a>1. Dynamic Global Commission</h2>\n<p>Capital in the deposit pool is idle and does not contribute to rETH APY. When the deposit pool is full, 18k of that ETH is not earning rewards, dragging down the average APY. Thus, aiming for maximum capital utilization —an empty deposit pool—is doubly important for rETH APY.</p>\n<p>The protocol previously operated a dynamic commission rate that was set at the time of creation and applied for the lifetime of the validator. However, this approach led to gamification, as operators would skip a few days of rewards and wait for the deposit queue to fill up to lock in a 20% lifetime commission rate.</p>\n<p>This had a negative impact on rETH’s growth and APY. There was slower growth due to NO waiting games and lower overall rETH APY due to overcompensation to NOs.</p>\n<p>While gameable, this mechanism elegantly tied NO incentives to the protocol’s growth requirements, increasing rewards when necessary to attract new NOs.</p>\n<p>We propose a new implementation of the dynamic commission with one important change: the variable commission rate applies to all validators regardless of the prevailing rate at the time of initialization.</p>\n<p>This helps maximize rETH APY in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The protocol pays a higher commission only for as long as is necessary to attract new NOs</li>\n<li>An individual NO has less incentive to wait for the higher commission rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The prevailing commission rate would be set by a contract function. The function would calculate the desired position on the commission curve based on the available capacity of the deposit pool.

We fund the RPL staking rewards by purchasing RPL with earned ETH staking reward commissions. Thus, if the RPL price increases vs. ETH, then the RPL staking yield decreases and vice versa. This is true for the original proposal as well. Hence, the following assumes the current price relation of RPL and ETH. If the proposed minimum of 150 RPL per validator is staked, we end up with about 25% of the total RPL staked and consequently the highest yield. The peak income for stakers is at the kink of our commission split between node operators and stakers at 14.4k ETH in the deposit pool (see chart above).

RPL Delegation</h2>\n<p>Key to our proposal is the introduction of delegated staking.</p>\n<p>Houston introduced the concept of “whale marriages”, whereby one party can provide the RPL while another provides the ETH. This has previously been possible through the use of splitter contracts but technical complexity and poor UX led to limited uptake.</p>\n<p>Like many in the ecosystem, we believe this is of paramount importance to unlocking NO growth as it allows the protocol to onboard NOs who do not want to take on RPL exposure.</p>\n<p>We propose to introduce delegated staking, effectively a matchmaker for “whale marriages”. This provides a Schelling point where NOs can compete to attract delegators, and RPL delegators can make informed decisions about their delegations.</p>\n<p>The goal is to eliminate the friction of pairing these counterparties, unlocking the full potential of Houston.</p>\n<p>Should our proposal pass, we would follow up with a future proposal to integrate the existing penalty research into the delegation system, further increasing the incentive for NOs to perform and for delegators to choose performant NOs. This involves making NOs (and their delegators) liable for the cost of poor performance, ensuring the rETH APY approaches its theoretical maximum.</p>\n<p>To mitigate centralization risk a per-NO delegation cap would be applied, preventing any single NO from accumulating too much voting power (e.g. a cap of 1% would ensure that no single NO could have more than 1% of RPL supply delegated to them).</p>\n<p>In the future, we could also introduce the idea of separating reward delegation from voting delegation. An RPL staker could receive rewards from the NO that provides the highest yield, while still delegating their voting power to a community member who supports their ideals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"improving-performance-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#improving-performance-6\"></a>Improving Performance</h3>\n<p>Among notable ETH staking protocols, Rocket Pool c<a href=\"https://explorer.rated.network/?network=mainnet&amp;view=pool&amp;timeWindow=1d&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=15&amp;poolType=all\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">urrently has the lowest performance on Rated Network</a>, falling behind players such as Swell, EtherFi, Ankr, Lido, Stader, and Stakewise. While each missed attestation is relatively small, the aggregate effect of the missed attestations drags down rETH’s APY.</p>\n<p>We believe this can be corrected with a market design that incentivizes delegation to operators with strong performance, which in turn can reduce missed rewards and help increase rETH APY. Based on the assumptions in <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-incubator-submission-reth-protection-through-rpl-rerouting-deflation/2599\">ArtDemocraft’s research</a>, we could optimistically expect to see a potential APY increase of up to 0.07% simply due to performance improvements amongst the largest struggling NOs.</p>\n<p>To do this, we need to introduce a forcing function that encourages NOs to improve performance. The best way to do this is to create a direct link between performance and rewards.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/5/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1.png\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1_2_295x269.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ctT8jpEHMVezFjCLCLuBc1vkX9n\" width=\"295\" height=\"269\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1_2_295x269.png, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1_2_442x403.png 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1_2_590x538.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>As part of our proposal, a portion of the NO’s rewards will be shared with their delegators. The higher the NOs rewards (i.e. the fewer missed attestations), the more rewards received by their delegators. The more delegators an NO has, the more collateral they have for launching additional validators. Thus we introduce a positive feedback loop where operators with the best performance will likely attract more rewards. This introduces competition between NOs to miss the fewest attestations, which will increase the total amount of rewards, which will increase rETH’s APY.</p>\n<p>To allow RPL holders to make informed decisions when choosing delegates, we will introduce a Node Operator Performance Dashboard (NOPD). This will be built on publicly available data so we might see multiple NOPDs deployed by different parties.</p>\n<p>The variable nature of MEV makes it challenging to compare validator earnings side by side. We, therefore, propose making participation in the smoothing pool mandatory for those opting into delegation, reducing the inherent variability in rewards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"democratizing-whale-marriages-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#democratizing-whale-marriages-7\"></a>Democratizing Whale Marriages</h3>\n<p>Under the current system, Whale Marriages have some centralization risk, benefiting large RPL holders who can strike deals with node operators at scale. Our delegation system democratizes the process of providing RPL for delegation and gives smaller RPL holders just as much chance to take part as larger holders.</p>\n<p>It would be a lot of work for a polygamous NO to individually coordinate with 10,000 delegators providing 10 RPL each. This gives an advantage to the whale with 100k RPL, who would find it easier to match with a “marriage partner.” We believe that larger holders should not have an unfair advantage merely because they have more capital, and leveling the playing field provides more support for the Charter goal of prioritizing decentralization.</p>\n<p>By removing the friction of matching RPL and ETH counterparties through a simple dashboard, we can rapidly accelerate the rate at which ETH can be deployed, further accelerating rETH’s APY growth.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"reducing-risk-of-mev-theft-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#reducing-risk-of-mev-theft-8\"></a>Reducing Risk of MEV-theft</h3>\n<p>In addition to the above benefits, implementing delegation allows us to further reduce both the probability and impact of MEV theft. Delegated RPL provides additional capital which can be slashed to a) punish NOs, and b) make the protocol whole after MEV theft.</p>\n<p>As noted in the <a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-42\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bond Curves RPIP</a>, the current proposal does not fully protect against MEV theft. While the nature of MEV makes it challenging to achieve full protection, we believe we can improve upon the current proposal.</p>\n<p>In the current proposal, if a NO with a single 8 ETH minipool steals 20 ETH of MEV, rETH APY is lower than it should be.</p>\n<p>As part of the delegation system, delegators will stake their RPL against a NO’s megapool contract. This provides additional capital which can be used to slash NOs who steal MEV. This has three benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cost of MEV theft is increased, making it less likely to occur</li>\n<li>If MEV theft does occur, the protocol has a higher chance of recovering the stolen funds</li>\n<li>We do not need to force-exit the NO in order to recover the capital - we can immediately slash the staked RPL (and still force-exit the NO if more collateral is required, and might wish to do so as punishment)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>RPIP-42 notes that:</p>\n<p><em>&gt; “We willingly take on somewhat more MEV-theft risk for the smallest NOs”</em></p>\n<p>Our proposal allows the smallest NOs to attract delegated RPL, strengthening the anti-MEV-theft provisions. Thus, we provide further support for this goal without taking on additional MEV theft risk.</p>\n<p>With additional RPL collateral available for slashing misbehaving or poorly performing NOs, and sufficient buy-side demand for RPL, we believe the Bond Curves (RPIP-42) work could potentially be safely accelerated.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"delegation-parameters-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#delegation-parameters-9\"></a>Delegation Parameters</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5d5a77e88f85ca97306456a8686c31dfd130671c.png\" alt=\"Delegation Parameters\" data-base62-sha1=\"djQepiFASnNIAbAeVpD5rNEpCji\" width=\"445\" height=\"85\"></p>\n<p>The incentive to delegate RPL to the top-performing operators maintains RPL’s core utility and enhances the protocol’s overall validator rewards.

Updates to RPIP-42: Bond Curve Proposal</h2>\n<p>Currently, node operators need to put up a set amount of ETH per validator (e.g. 8 ETH collateral, 24 ETH borrowed) when launching validators. Also as suggested within RPIP-42, there is general alignment within the community that from a risk/reward perspective, lower amounts of collateral for incrementally borrowed ETH should be experimented with. We believe that the amount of reasonable collateral needed to slash an operator for misbehavior does not scale linearly with the amount of ETH they borrow from the deposit pool. For example, if they operate one validator, an example amount of collateral could be 4 ETH, but if they operate 8, there might only need to be 2 ETH per validator. The exact sublinear formula can be debated and explored at a later date.</p>\n<p>We propose that depending on the total number of validators for a given node operator v, the total collateral requirement in ETH C(v) is given by: C(v) = C(1)*v^p</p>\n<p>Using C(1)=4 ETH and p=⅔:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d.png\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d_2_624x312.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"4XeuSoxg3X500InGOlwj8xXNVYF\" width=\"624\" height=\"312\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d_2_624x312.png, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d_2_936x468.png 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEEEF4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Currently, about 35% of nodes run one validator, so for them there would be no change in collateral if they run a minipool.

Additionally, it enhances protocol security by directing ETH towards operators who can provide the strongest security guarantees, as indicated by their slashable collateral.</p>\n<p>To prevent centralizing forces in the deposit queue, we propose a mechanism where queue slots are reserved for new NOs. Additional protection avenues, such as limiting the number of slots per NO within a given timeframe, can be explored as part of further community discussion.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-5-rpl-collateral-for-node-operators-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#h-5-rpl-collateral-for-node-operators-12\"></a>5. RPL Collateral for Node Operators</h2>\n<p>Given the newly proposed RPL delegation system, we also propose some tweaks to the current RPL collateral design. A <strong>fixed</strong> amount of <strong>150 RPL</strong> will be required per validator, and this value will be static until the community or pDAO votes for a change.</p>\n<p>Whilst the specific value is open to debate, our rationale for 150 RPL as the initial value is twofold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At current price levels, this adds approximately 1 ETH in collateral value per validator. This significantly increases collateralization for node operators running multiple validators and counter-balances the reduction in ETH collateral per incremental validator proposed in Bond Curves (RPIP-42). The result is maintained overall network security.</li>\n<li>Taking the current validator count, the theoretical required RPL stake of 150 equates to around 25% of circulating supply. This minimum threshold is a 50% reduction versus the current stake ratio of 50% coming from the current RPL staking requirement, but we believe our new RPL yield mechanism attracts staking beyond this new minimum of 150, and hence the drop in RPL staked under our new proposal in practice will likely be much less than 50%. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSM2e2Et1kDDbtLQa85aJj91cbUoWUfBoGy8InxZuiYLmm3hnn_p7zFJ7OhBQcDRGZOdIj8PfKSKbO6/pub\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Please click this here if you’d like to see some simulations we made around % RPL staked, RPL price, and more.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Static RPL values make it easier for both delegators and operators to track. The amount of RPL required per validator will not change regardless of how much a single node operator earns. If a node operator becomes undercollateralized, for example, when it does not have enough delegated RPL for the number of validators, there will not be a forced exit.</p>\n<p>However, while a NO is undercollateralized, the full delegate_share is used to purchase RPL on the open market and stake it under the ownership of the pDAO. Once the node is sufficiently collateralized, the delegate_share reverts to the NO’s delegates. The pDAO continues to own the purchased RPL and benefit from its yield. A NO can not launch new validators while undercollateralized. One downside of an RPL delegation system is the elevated pressure on delegators to monitor their positions as they may temporarily be forfeiting their share to the pDAO.</p>\n<p>The primary motivation for choosing a static value is to simplify life for NOs and delegators and alleviate the burden of constantly checking collateralization levels. An alternative approach would be to retain the mechanism where the required RPL is based on the value of ETH borrowed from the protocol. We are open to discussing this, as it has advantages and disadvantages, but believe the simpler approach is more suitable for this entire proposal.</p>\n<p>A fixed amount of required RPL collateral minimizes the risk of prolonged periods where node operators lack sufficient delegations. This ensures a consistently optimal delegation market, allowing delegators to earn yields with the highest-performing node operators, thereby supporting <strong>maxETH’s goal of increasing rETH yields.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-6-introduce-protocol-owned-yield-as-part-of-the-surplus-share-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#h-6-introduce-protocol-owned-yield-as-part-of-the-surplus-share-13\"></a>6. Introduce protocol-owned yield as part of the surplus share</h2>\n<p>We believe protocol commissions should, at present, only go to node operators and RPL stakers. However, in the future, one alternative value capture mechanism that is to be explored is the introduction of a protocol-owned staking pool where pDAO stakes the respective surplus share to earn yield on behalf of the protocol’s newly owned ETH assets. The subsequent yield is then distributed to rETH holders. This staking pool would be equivalent to the “surplus_share” recipient when referencing current proposals. The pDAO, guided by RPL voters, could select operators with less market share or more decentralized infrastructure and therefore counteract any potential centralizing forces that might result from crowding around the most performant NOs. This new scheme potentially strengthens rETH’s long-term APY, the <strong>primary goal of MaxETH</strong>, while simultaneously building up protocol-owned assets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rpips-new-and-modified-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#rpips-new-and-modified-14\"></a>RPIPs - new and modified</h2>\n<p>Implementing this proposal would require two additional RPIPs, and modifications to multiple existing draft RPIPs. 1kx would provide the initial version of the new RPIPs and submit them to the community for discussion.

The community have invested significant time in research and analysis and are drafting Rocket Pool Improvement proposals: <a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-2024\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Tokenomics Rework | Rocket Pool Improvement Proposals</a>. The team have engaged RPIP authors to ensure feasibility and technical considerations.</p>\n<p>The team have been breaking down the draft RPIPs: assessing how they affect technical design; and determining the scope of changes to the protocol.</p>\n<p>From a development perspective we have been focused on Megapools, a crucial component of Saturn. Recently, we’ve had to adapt to the upcoming Ethereum EIP ‘Increased Max Effective Balance (EIP-7251)’. We’ve carefully reviewed how this EIP will impact Rocket Pool overall and specifically if it affects our Megapool implementation. As part of this effort, we’ve provided feedback to Ethereum researchers on EIP-7251. Meanwhile, we’ve been refining our initial Megapool prototype to bring it up to production-ready standards.</p>\n<p><strong>v2 Smart Node</strong><br>\nA notable mention is the Smart Node Version 2, a ground-up redesign aimed at significantly improving performance, maintainability, interoperability, and the overall experience for node operators.

As we eagerly anticipate the remainder of the year, we want to bring you up to speed on our roadmap progress.</p>\n<p>For the latest information, check out <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/u/darcius\">@darcius</a>’s comprehensive Medium article covering the Houston and Saturn Upgrades: <a href=\"https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-houston-upgrade-fa2de86118ad\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Rocket Pool — Houston Upgrade. Hello Rocket Poolers&nbsp;:) Today is our… | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium</a></p>\n<p><strong>Houston</strong><br>\nThe Houston upgrade is currently under audit. Our fantastic audit teams, Consensys Diligence and Sigma Prime have been working hard to break Houston. Those audits are now wrapping up. For Houston, we decided to include an additional audit team to give us flexibility and to get fresh eyes on the Rocket Pool codebase. ChainSafe has joined the audit line-up and are almost midway through their audit. As usual, all audit reports will be made publicly available before launch.</p>\n<p>In addition to audits, Houston is also being functionally tested (with the smartnode) on our private devnet. Once this process is complete and the audits are finalised, we will look to deploy Houston to the Holesky testnet so that everyone can give it a try!</p>\n<p><strong>RPIP-28 and RPIP-30</strong><br>\nThese RPIPs have been ratified by the pDAO for inclusion in the protocol. Kane has been working on the RPIP-30 changes so that they can be released in the next audit cycle. We would like to get Houston out the door and then we can lock in a release date.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RPIP-28 Deposit Under the Minimum - allows creating a new minipool even when under the minimum by supporting an atomic RPL stake and node deposit</li>\n<li>RPIP-30 RPL Staking Rework - aligns RPL reward spend with rETH capacity created.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Saturn</strong><br>\nThe Saturn upgrade is in the research and analysis phase. This is exciting because all options are on the table. A Rapid Research Incubation process has began (<a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-incubation-begins/2654\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Rapid Research Incubation Begins!</a>) to review the fantastic ideas submitted by the community. A big thank you to everyone that has submitted. The submissions are of a very high quality and we have no doubt that they will help inform the future of Rocket Pool.</p>\n<p>Once the incubation process has concluded we can start refining the ideas ready for design and implementation. Saturn has a long way to go but we are leveraging the collective knowledge and passion from this amazing community.</p>\n<p>We are looking forward to an exciting 2024.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q1-2024-roadmap-update/3044\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q1-2024-roadmap-update/3044","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Jun 2024 02:23:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-3044"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q1-2024-roadmap-update/3044.rss","#text":"Protocol Development - Q1 2024 Roadmap Update"}},{"title":"Bounties - June 2024","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Grants / Bounties","description":"<p>On April 24, the Rocket Pool protocol DAO passed <a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-39\">RPIP-39</a>, which allow the Grants Management Committee to pay out incentives to community members engaging with the bounty system. This breaks more complex bounties into three distinct parts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Bounty Proposal</strong><br>\nA high-level bounty idea that requires more work before it can be adopted by the GMC. The goal of the bounty proposal is to convince the GMC that this idea is worth the effort and funding to pursue. Proposal requirements are easy to meet to encourage community engagement. Bounty proposals are the ‘quick and dirty’ path for community members to suggest a bounty idea to the GMC.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounty Definition</strong><br>\nA detailed and well-defined bounty specification that can be adopted by the GMC. The goal of the bounty definition is to communicate the content and terms of the bounty to bounty hunters. Community members may provide a bounty definition alongside their bounty proposal, it may be created by the GMC, or submitted by a separate community member. Bounty definitions are the ‘tick all the boxes’ path for community members to get their bounty adopted by the GMC.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounty Support Contact</strong><br>\nAn individual who acts as a supporter and point of contact with bounty hunters for a given bounty. This may be the bounty proposal author, a member of the GMC, or another community member. The bounty support contact’s goal is to support and liaise with bounty hunters so that they are better able to deliver the work specified in the bounty definition. Bounty contacts are listed in bounty definitions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aside from the now streamlined proposal incentive, the GMC is now seeking assistance externally for bounty definitions and bounty supporters.</p>\n<p>On June 4, the GMC approved the following bounty incentives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proposal Incentive</strong> $50</li>\n<li><strong>Definition Incentive</strong> 2%, minimum $75</li>\n<li><strong>Support Incentive</strong> 2%, minimum $50</li>\n</ul>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>Currently the GMC is seeking a definition for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/round-11-call-for-bounty-applications-deadline-is-april-7/2776/4\">DAO Engagement Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find the bounty definition template <a href=\"https://github.com/rocketpoolgmc/rocketpool-gmc/blob/main/meta/bounty-definition-template.md\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in writing a definition please post your submission or questions here, or reach out to the GMC within their dedicated server.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a
