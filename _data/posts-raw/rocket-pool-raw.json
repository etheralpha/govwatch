We would like to suggest a slightly different approach, viewing our proposal not as a replacement but as an extension of the existing one.</p>\n<p>Given the timelines involved, we have attempted to strike a balance between getting the proposal in front of the community as soon as possible, while also providing sufficient detail to allow for an informed comparison.</p>\n<p>In brief, our primary disagreement with the existing rework proposal is that it prematurely abandons RPL’s primary value driver—the RPL collateral requirement for validators. We recognize that the proposed token rework contains other benefits, but we believe Houston’s new features can be better leveraged to further accelerate our main goal of maximizing rETH’s sustainable yield to position Rocket Pool as the most attractive LST in the space – <strong>we call this the “maxETH” strategy</strong>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"introduction-maxeth-3-reth-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#introduction-maxeth-3-reth-1\"></a>Introduction: “maxETH” &lt;3 rETH</h2>\n<p>One main reason Rocket Pool has become so popular is because of its alignment with Ethereum’s core values. However, this merited gravitation towards decentralization can only attract so much TVL, and the average user’s preferences are driven by three realities: high yields, deep liquidity, and DeFi utility. Since we believe that the former leads to the latter two, our primary goal is to maximize the rETH’s sustainable APY as it is the single most important attribute for any LST.</p>\n<p>The “maxETH” strategy has 3 main components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Align rETH growth with NO growth by adding a <strong>dynamic global commission</strong> structure based on deposit pool utilization</li>\n<li>Introduce <strong>RPL delegation</strong> to provide additional utility to RPL and allow stakers to select highly performant NOs from a Node Operator Performance Dashboard</li>\n<li>Safely accelerate protocol growth and reduce MEV theft risk by accelerating <strong>Bonding Curves</strong> adoption</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-changes-in-brief-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#proposed-changes-in-brief-2\"></a>Proposed Changes in Brief</h2>\n<p>The core of our proposal is a delegated staking system, described in more detail below.</p>\n<p>We propose to initially set the surplus_share to zero, increasing rETH APY.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-386x460uploadce1wjeitkxih1froxdedlev2v1vpng-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#h-386x460uploadce1wjeitkxih1froxdedlev2v1vpng-3\"></a><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/5/58a0544a029f0e36a73de54dc0e4fc01df05a681.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"cE1wjEItkXIH1frOXdeDlEV2V1v\" width=\"386\" height=\"460\" role=\"presentation\"></h2>\n<h2><a name=\"h-1-dynamic-global-commission-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#h-1-dynamic-global-commission-4\"></a>1. Dynamic Global Commission</h2>\n<p>Capital in the deposit pool is idle and does not contribute to rETH APY. When the deposit pool is full, 18k of that ETH is not earning rewards, dragging down the average APY. Thus, aiming for maximum capital utilization —an empty deposit pool—is doubly important for rETH APY.</p>\n<p>The protocol previously operated a dynamic commission rate that was set at the time of creation and applied for the lifetime of the validator. However, this approach led to gamification, as operators would skip a few days of rewards and wait for the deposit queue to fill up to lock in a 20% lifetime commission rate.</p>\n<p>This had a negative impact on rETH’s growth and APY. There was slower growth due to NO waiting games and lower overall rETH APY due to overcompensation to NOs.</p>\n<p>While gameable, this mechanism elegantly tied NO incentives to the protocol’s growth requirements, increasing rewards when necessary to attract new NOs.</p>\n<p>We propose a new implementation of the dynamic commission with one important change: the variable commission rate applies to all validators regardless of the prevailing rate at the time of initialization.</p>\n<p>This helps maximize rETH APY in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The protocol pays a higher commission only for as long as is necessary to attract new NOs</li>\n<li>An individual NO has less incentive to wait for the higher commission rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The prevailing commission rate would be set by a contract function. The function would calculate the desired position on the commission curve based on the available capacity of the deposit pool. We envision this function being executed by the oDAO, although it would be executable by anyone so long as there was sufficient time between invocations.</p>\n<p>The rate change function would be similar to that of a DeFi lending pool, where the commission would spike if the deposit pool hit a certain size. Some illustrative values are:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Deposit Pool Utilization</th>\n<th>Commission Rate</th>\n<th>NO’s share</th>\n<th>Staker’s share</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>5.9%</td>\n<td>1.18%</td>\n<td>4.72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50%</td>\n<td>9.5%</td>\n<td>1.9%</td>\n<td>7.6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80%</td>\n<td>12.2%</td>\n<td>2.44%</td>\n<td>9.76%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>For those who want a deeper explanation, the dynamic commission rate on ETH staking rewards grows linearly with the deposit pool size and can be parametrized as follows:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1cfe331337ade95b20d3f64e3232b6208404ebbc.png\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/1cfe331337ade95b20d3f64e3232b6208404ebbc\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1cfe331337ade95b20d3f64e3232b6208404ebbc.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"48tZk9RatuEGSFgwv0olUCIAL6I\" width=\"624\" height=\"100\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>d is the current deposit pool size in ETH, d_min and d_max the minimum/maximum values of those we consider (proposal: d_min=0 and d_max=18k) and c(d) the commission rate which is capped at c_max (proposal: 14%) and c_min (proposal: 5%).</p>\n<p>This overall commission rate is split between i) the node operators (NO commission), ii) the RPL stakers or more specifically delegators (stake commission) and iii) a protocol share (surplus share).

We propose a minimum share of 20%, a maximum of 70% and the kink at 80% if the maximum deposit pool size is reached (i.e. 14.4k ETH).</p>\n<p>ii) <strong>The stake commission share</strong> is the share of ETH rewards that gets swapped to RPL and paid out to stakers that are delegated to node operators. We propose that the initial stake commission rate equals the total commission minus the node operator commission (see i). See next for our rationale.</p>\n<p>iii) <strong>The protocol surplus share</strong>: we propose to leave this share at 0 for now for two main reasons: first, we want to maximize rETH yield by lowering the overall commission rate. Second, as mentioned in our previous forum reply, the protocol’s current TVL is not high enough to justify any sort of value capture. If Rocket Pool were to use the surplus share, we have a recommendation that we reference in point <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#6</span>.</p>\n<p>With that, the proposed commission share and its distribution is as follows:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/4/41293e281453be0424fdd72edfc1bedac0d7a080.png\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/41293e281453be0424fdd72edfc1bedac0d7a080\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/41293e281453be0424fdd72edfc1bedac0d7a080_2_624x468.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9iroFpeZ5GTKVjGzNAfB5poo0la\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/41293e281453be0424fdd72edfc1bedac0d7a080_2_624x468.png, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/4/41293e281453be0424fdd72edfc1bedac0d7a080.png 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/4/41293e281453be0424fdd72edfc1bedac0d7a080.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DBC6AE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The node operator commission share we propose (20-70%, blue area) is, on average, 3.2% when considering all deposit pool sizes, which is only slightly lower than the initially suggested 3.5% figure, as shown by the gray line. If the deposit pool is empty, the total commission will equate to ~5%, which boosts rETH’s APY by a notable 10% compared to the current product. A theoretically empty deposit pool would allow rETH to surpass stETH’s yield by a full 15 bps, which massively incentivizes more TVL for Rocket Pool. If the deposit pool is full, we’re temporarily over-incentivizing NOs to spin up new validators with higher commissions, ensuring our overall protocol efficiency stays high. This mechanism is a very powerful feedback loop that can lead to sustainable TVL growth.</p>\n<p>Combined with some assumption of gains for performance in general based on the research by <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-incubator-submission-reth-protection-through-rpl-rerouting-deflation/2599\">ArtDemocraft</a>, we could see rETH’s yield pass stETH over the long run, or at the very least a significant reduction in the current yield gap between stETH and rETH. This would make rETH one of the best-yielding LSTs:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e31494e3815ed1b82f49a4ae76d867b73203b1f9.png\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/e31494e3815ed1b82f49a4ae76d867b73203b1f9\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e31494e3815ed1b82f49a4ae76d867b73203b1f9_2_561x420.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"woQtRuOQj9X7NTNPzWnzaTfpzh7\" width=\"561\" height=\"420\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e31494e3815ed1b82f49a4ae76d867b73203b1f9_2_561x420.png, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e31494e3815ed1b82f49a4ae76d867b73203b1f9.png 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e31494e3815ed1b82f49a4ae76d867b73203b1f9.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E9D4B8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>For RPL stakers, the actual APY depends largely on the total amount of RPL staked and the price of RPL in terms of ETH. We fund the RPL staking rewards by purchasing RPL with earned ETH staking reward commissions. Thus, if the RPL price increases vs. ETH, then the RPL staking yield decreases and vice versa. This is true for the original proposal as well. Hence, the following assumes the current price relation of RPL and ETH. If the proposed minimum of 150 RPL per validator is staked, we end up with about 25% of the total RPL staked and consequently the highest yield. The peak income for stakers is at the kink of our commission split between node operators and stakers at 14.4k ETH in the deposit pool (see chart above). At that level and minimum stake ratio, stakers would earn over 10% APR:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6d4fcf8b21ef2e41d36d4f06abaabc81de06d673.png\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/6d4fcf8b21ef2e41d36d4f06abaabc81de06d673\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6d4fcf8b21ef2e41d36d4f06abaabc81de06d673_2_624x468.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"fB12lSM5OYsVRbVaK37ywBK4Nzl\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6d4fcf8b21ef2e41d36d4f06abaabc81de06d673_2_624x468.png, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6d4fcf8b21ef2e41d36d4f06abaabc81de06d673.png 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6d4fcf8b21ef2e41d36d4f06abaabc81de06d673.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEAF0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This is almost double the yield for stakers compared to the original proposal, represented by the orange line. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8AeEajfbfjcQAvdkpMhzmADiX1BJRf1oplEshhaINg/edit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Please click here for more simulation data and associated assumptions above.</a></p>\n<p>This change would introduce the following protocol parameters:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>min_commission</th>\n<th>Minimum commission rate</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>max_commission</td>\n<td>Maximum commission rate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>commission_change_min_interval</td>\n<td>Minimum time that must pass between changes to commission rate, in seconds.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>commision_relative_step</td>\n<td>Maximum amount that commission can be changed per update, expressed as a percentage of current rate</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The introduction of a dynamic global commission will contribute towards the <strong>maxETH initiative</strong> by minimizing protocol value capture, optimizing for node operator and staker payouts at varying deposit pool sizes, and prioritizing rETH yield payouts at all times.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2-rpl-delegation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#h-2-rpl-delegation-5\"></a>2. RPL Delegation</h2>\n<p>Key to our proposal is the introduction of delegated staking.</p>\n<p>Houston introduced the concept of “whale marriages”, whereby one party can provide the RPL while another provides the ETH. This has previously been possible through the use of splitter contracts but technical complexity and poor UX led to limited uptake.</p>\n<p>Like many in the ecosystem, we believe this is of paramount importance to unlocking NO growth as it allows the protocol to onboard NOs who do not want to take on RPL exposure.</p>\n<p>We propose to introduce delegated staking, effectively a matchmaker for “whale marriages”. This provides a Schelling point where NOs can compete to attract delegators, and RPL delegators can make informed decisions about their delegations.</p>\n<p>The goal is to eliminate the friction of pairing these counterparties, unlocking the full potential of Houston.</p>\n<p>Should our proposal pass, we would follow up with a future proposal to integrate the existing penalty research into the delegation system, further increasing the incentive for NOs to perform and for delegators to choose performant NOs. This involves making NOs (and their delegators) liable for the cost of poor performance, ensuring the rETH APY approaches its theoretical maximum.</p>\n<p>To mitigate centralization risk a per-NO delegation cap would be applied, preventing any single NO from accumulating too much voting power (e.g. a cap of 1% would ensure that no single NO could have more than 1% of RPL supply delegated to them).</p>\n<p>In the future, we could also introduce the idea of separating reward delegation from voting delegation. An RPL staker could receive rewards from the NO that provides the highest yield, while still delegating their voting power to a community member who supports their ideals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"improving-performance-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#improving-performance-6\"></a>Improving Performance</h3>\n<p>Among notable ETH staking protocols, Rocket Pool c<a href=\"https://explorer.rated.network/?network=mainnet&amp;view=pool&amp;timeWindow=1d&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=15&amp;poolType=all\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">urrently has the lowest performance on Rated Network</a>, falling behind players such as Swell, EtherFi, Ankr, Lido, Stader, and Stakewise. While each missed attestation is relatively small, the aggregate effect of the missed attestations drags down rETH’s APY.</p>\n<p>We believe this can be corrected with a market design that incentivizes delegation to operators with strong performance, which in turn can reduce missed rewards and help increase rETH APY. Based on the assumptions in <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-incubator-submission-reth-protection-through-rpl-rerouting-deflation/2599\">ArtDemocraft’s research</a>, we could optimistically expect to see a potential APY increase of up to 0.07% simply due to performance improvements amongst the largest struggling NOs.</p>\n<p>To do this, we need to introduce a forcing function that encourages NOs to improve performance. The best way to do this is to create a direct link between performance and rewards.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/5/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1.png\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1_2_295x269.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ctT8jpEHMVezFjCLCLuBc1vkX9n\" width=\"295\" height=\"269\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1_2_295x269.png, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1_2_442x403.png 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/577b081c0637f4ce7ef2a0df1a2ddd771dbf11e1_2_590x538.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>As part of our proposal, a portion of the NO’s rewards will be shared with their delegators. The higher the NOs rewards (i.e. the fewer missed attestations), the more rewards received by their delegators. The more delegators an NO has, the more collateral they have for launching additional validators. Thus we introduce a positive feedback loop where operators with the best performance will likely attract more rewards. This introduces competition between NOs to miss the fewest attestations, which will increase the total amount of rewards, which will increase rETH’s APY.</p>\n<p>To allow RPL holders to make informed decisions when choosing delegates, we will introduce a Node Operator Performance Dashboard (NOPD). This will be built on publicly available data so we might see multiple NOPDs deployed by different parties.</p>\n<p>The variable nature of MEV makes it challenging to compare validator earnings side by side. We, therefore, propose making participation in the smoothing pool mandatory for those opting into delegation, reducing the inherent variability in rewards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"democratizing-whale-marriages-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#democratizing-whale-marriages-7\"></a>Democratizing Whale Marriages</h3>\n<p>Under the current system, Whale Marriages have some centralization risk, benefiting large RPL holders who can strike deals with node operators at scale. Our delegation system democratizes the process of providing RPL for delegation and gives smaller RPL holders just as much chance to take part as larger holders.</p>\n<p>It would be a lot of work for a polygamous NO to individually coordinate with 10,000 delegators providing 10 RPL each. This gives an advantage to the whale with 100k RPL, who would find it easier to match with a “marriage partner.” We believe that larger holders should not have an unfair advantage merely because they have more capital, and leveling the playing field provides more support for the Charter goal of prioritizing decentralization.</p>\n<p>By removing the friction of matching RPL and ETH counterparties through a simple dashboard, we can rapidly accelerate the rate at which ETH can be deployed, further accelerating rETH’s APY growth.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"reducing-risk-of-mev-theft-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#reducing-risk-of-mev-theft-8\"></a>Reducing Risk of MEV-theft</h3>\n<p>In addition to the above benefits, implementing delegation allows us to further reduce both the probability and impact of MEV theft. Delegated RPL provides additional capital which can be slashed to a) punish NOs, and b) make the protocol whole after MEV theft.</p>\n<p>As noted in the <a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-42\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bond Curves RPIP</a>, the current proposal does not fully protect against MEV theft. While the nature of MEV makes it challenging to achieve full protection, we believe we can improve upon the current proposal.</p>\n<p>In the current proposal, if a NO with a single 8 ETH minipool steals 20 ETH of MEV, rETH APY is lower than it should be.</p>\n<p>As part of the delegation system, delegators will stake their RPL against a NO’s megapool contract. This provides additional capital which can be used to slash NOs who steal MEV. This has three benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cost of MEV theft is increased, making it less likely to occur</li>\n<li>If MEV theft does occur, the protocol has a higher chance of recovering the stolen funds</li>\n<li>We do not need to force-exit the NO in order to recover the capital - we can immediately slash the staked RPL (and still force-exit the NO if more collateral is required, and might wish to do so as punishment)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>RPIP-42 notes that:</p>\n<p><em>&gt; “We willingly take on somewhat more MEV-theft risk for the smallest NOs”</em></p>\n<p>Our proposal allows the smallest NOs to attract delegated RPL, strengthening the anti-MEV-theft provisions. Thus, we provide further support for this goal without taking on additional MEV theft risk.</p>\n<p>With additional RPL collateral available for slashing misbehaving or poorly performing NOs, and sufficient buy-side demand for RPL, we believe the Bond Curves (RPIP-42) work could potentially be safely accelerated.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"delegation-parameters-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#delegation-parameters-9\"></a>Delegation Parameters</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5d5a77e88f85ca97306456a8686c31dfd130671c.png\" alt=\"Delegation Parameters\" data-base62-sha1=\"djQepiFASnNIAbAeVpD5rNEpCji\" width=\"445\" height=\"85\"></p>\n<p>The incentive to delegate RPL to the top-performing operators maintains RPL’s core utility and enhances the protocol’s overall validator rewards.

Updates to RPIP-42: Bond Curve Proposal</h2>\n<p>Currently, node operators need to put up a set amount of ETH per validator (e.g. 8 ETH collateral, 24 ETH borrowed) when launching validators. Also as suggested within RPIP-42, there is general alignment within the community that from a risk/reward perspective, lower amounts of collateral for incrementally borrowed ETH should be experimented with. We believe that the amount of reasonable collateral needed to slash an operator for misbehavior does not scale linearly with the amount of ETH they borrow from the deposit pool. For example, if they operate one validator, an example amount of collateral could be 4 ETH, but if they operate 8, there might only need to be 2 ETH per validator. The exact sublinear formula can be debated and explored at a later date.</p>\n<p>We propose that depending on the total number of validators for a given node operator v, the total collateral requirement in ETH C(v) is given by: C(v) = C(1)*v^p</p>\n<p>Using C(1)=4 ETH and p=⅔:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d.png\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d_2_624x312.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"4XeuSoxg3X500InGOlwj8xXNVYF\" width=\"624\" height=\"312\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d_2_624x312.png, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d_2_936x468.png 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22bad26690223b2dcd606ded185d8c1c761c3a1d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEEEF4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Currently, about 35% of nodes run one validator, so for them there would be no change in collateral if they run a minipool.

The conclusion is that compared to the world of vanilla LEB4, relatively less collateral is needed as the number of validators per node increases.</p>\n<p>With slight updates to RPIP, we can efficiently lower the collateral requirement for larger node operators while reducing MEV-theft risk. This allows the protocol to support more demand at scale and ensure that the deposit pool remains empty, supporting maxETH’s main goal of maximizing rETH yields.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-4-optimize-deposit-queue-access-for-reth-apy-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#h-4-optimize-deposit-queue-access-for-reth-apy-11\"></a>4. Optimize Deposit Queue Access for rETH APY</h2>\n<p>We expect that the Houston upgrade, accelerated by our delegation proposal, will lead to significant increases in deposit pool utilization. This raises the question of how to handle an empty deposit queue.</p>\n<p>To address this, we propose prioritizing access to the queue based on the total RPL staked by a node operator (including delegated RPL). This approach ensures that those most committed to the protocol’s long-term health are given the first opportunity to serve the community. Additionally, it enhances protocol security by directing ETH towards operators who can provide the strongest security guarantees, as indicated by their slashable collateral.</p>\n<p>To prevent centralizing forces in the deposit queue, we propose a mechanism where queue slots are reserved for new NOs. Additional protection avenues, such as limiting the number of slots per NO within a given timeframe, can be explored as part of further community discussion.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-5-rpl-collateral-for-node-operators-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#h-5-rpl-collateral-for-node-operators-12\"></a>5. RPL Collateral for Node Operators</h2>\n<p>Given the newly proposed RPL delegation system, we also propose some tweaks to the current RPL collateral design. A <strong>fixed</strong> amount of <strong>150 RPL</strong> will be required per validator, and this value will be static until the community or pDAO votes for a change.</p>\n<p>Whilst the specific value is open to debate, our rationale for 150 RPL as the initial value is twofold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At current price levels, this adds approximately 1 ETH in collateral value per validator. This significantly increases collateralization for node operators running multiple validators and counter-balances the reduction in ETH collateral per incremental validator proposed in Bond Curves (RPIP-42). The result is maintained overall network security.</li>\n<li>Taking the current validator count, the theoretical required RPL stake of 150 equates to around 25% of circulating supply. This minimum threshold is a 50% reduction versus the current stake ratio of 50% coming from the current RPL staking requirement, but we believe our new RPL yield mechanism attracts staking beyond this new minimum of 150, and hence the drop in RPL staked under our new proposal in practice will likely be much less than 50%. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSM2e2Et1kDDbtLQa85aJj91cbUoWUfBoGy8InxZuiYLmm3hnn_p7zFJ7OhBQcDRGZOdIj8PfKSKbO6/pub\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Please click this here if you’d like to see some simulations we made around % RPL staked, RPL price, and more.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Static RPL values make it easier for both delegators and operators to track. The amount of RPL required per validator will not change regardless of how much a single node operator earns. If a node operator becomes undercollateralized, for example, when it does not have enough delegated RPL for the number of validators, there will not be a forced exit.</p>\n<p>However, while a NO is undercollateralized, the full delegate_share is used to purchase RPL on the open market and stake it under the ownership of the pDAO. Once the node is sufficiently collateralized, the delegate_share reverts to the NO’s delegates. The pDAO continues to own the purchased RPL and benefit from its yield. A NO can not launch new validators while undercollateralized. One downside of an RPL delegation system is the elevated pressure on delegators to monitor their positions as they may temporarily be forfeiting their share to the pDAO.</p>\n<p>The primary motivation for choosing a static value is to simplify life for NOs and delegators and alleviate the burden of constantly checking collateralization levels. An alternative approach would be to retain the mechanism where the required RPL is based on the value of ETH borrowed from the protocol. We are open to discussing this, as it has advantages and disadvantages, but believe the simpler approach is more suitable for this entire proposal.</p>\n<p>A fixed amount of required RPL collateral minimizes the risk of prolonged periods where node operators lack sufficient delegations. This ensures a consistently optimal delegation market, allowing delegators to earn yields with the highest-performing node operators, thereby supporting <strong>maxETH’s goal of increasing rETH yields.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-6-introduce-protocol-owned-yield-as-part-of-the-surplus-share-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#h-6-introduce-protocol-owned-yield-as-part-of-the-surplus-share-13\"></a>6. Introduce protocol-owned yield as part of the surplus share</h2>\n<p>We believe protocol commissions should, at present, only go to node operators and RPL stakers. However, in the future, one alternative value capture mechanism that is to be explored is the introduction of a protocol-owned staking pool where pDAO stakes the respective surplus share to earn yield on behalf of the protocol’s newly owned ETH assets. The subsequent yield is then distributed to rETH holders. This staking pool would be equivalent to the “surplus_share” recipient when referencing current proposals. The pDAO, guided by RPL voters, could select operators with less market share or more decentralized infrastructure and therefore counteract any potential centralizing forces that might result from crowding around the most performant NOs.

We’ve also developed and deployed new Houston features on the website. A successful beta testing phase was conducted in collaboration with our community, incorporating valuable feedback and bug fixes into our smart node. Additionally, our team has prioritised and resolved an important bug bounty issue in the Houston code.</p>\n<p>We’re excited that Houston is set to launch on June 17th!

As of now, the smart contracts have been deployed, and we’re in the process of voting on the ODAO upgrade proposal.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we’ve worked to merge our current Snapshot voting system with our new on-chain voting mechanism. This unified approach combines the benefits of gasless voting on Snapshot with the direct power of on-chain voting.

However, our focus on Saturn has intensified, and it now appears more likely that these features will be included in the Saturn release rather than being deployed beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Saturn</strong><br>\nSaturn has come through ideation with the community Rapid Research Incubation process (<a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-incubation-begins/2654\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Rapid Research Incubation Begins!</a>). The community have invested significant time in research and analysis and are drafting Rocket Pool Improvement proposals: <a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-2024\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Tokenomics Rework | Rocket Pool Improvement Proposals</a>. The team have engaged RPIP authors to ensure feasibility and technical considerations.</p>\n<p>The team have been breaking down the draft RPIPs: assessing how they affect technical design; and determining the scope of changes to the protocol.</p>\n<p>From a development perspective we have been focused on Megapools, a crucial component of Saturn. Recently, we’ve had to adapt to the upcoming Ethereum EIP ‘Increased Max Effective Balance (EIP-7251)’. We’ve carefully reviewed how this EIP will impact Rocket Pool overall and specifically if it affects our Megapool implementation. As part of this effort, we’ve provided feedback to Ethereum researchers on EIP-7251. Meanwhile, we’ve been refining our initial Megapool prototype to bring it up to production-ready standards.</p>\n<p><strong>v2 Smart Node</strong><br>\nA notable mention is the Smart Node Version 2, a ground-up redesign aimed at significantly improving performance, maintainability, interoperability, and the overall experience for node operators.

Our fantastic audit teams, Consensys Diligence and Sigma Prime have been working hard to break Houston. Those audits are now wrapping up. For Houston, we decided to include an additional audit team to give us flexibility and to get fresh eyes on the Rocket Pool codebase. ChainSafe has joined the audit line-up and are almost midway through their audit. As usual, all audit reports will be made publicly available before launch.</p>\n<p>In addition to audits, Houston is also being functionally tested (with the smartnode) on our private devnet. Once this process is complete and the audits are finalised, we will look to deploy Houston to the Holesky testnet so that everyone can give it a try!</p>\n<p><strong>RPIP-28 and RPIP-30</strong><br>\nThese RPIPs have been ratified by the pDAO for inclusion in the protocol.

We would like to get Houston out the door and then we can lock in a release date.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RPIP-28 Deposit Under the Minimum - allows creating a new minipool even when under the minimum by supporting an atomic RPL stake and node deposit</li>\n<li>RPIP-30 RPL Staking Rework - aligns RPL reward spend with rETH capacity created.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Saturn</strong><br>\nThe Saturn upgrade is in the research and analysis phase. This is exciting because all options are on the table. A Rapid Research Incubation process has began (<a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-incubation-begins/2654\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Rapid Research Incubation Begins!</a>) to review the fantastic ideas submitted by the community. A big thank you to everyone that has submitted. The submissions are of a very high quality and we have no doubt that they will help inform the future of Rocket Pool.</p>\n<p>Once the incubation process has concluded we can start refining the ideas ready for design and implementation. Saturn has a long way to go but we are leveraging the collective knowledge and passion from this amazing community.</p>\n<p>We are looking forward to an exciting 2024.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q1-2024-roadmap-update/3044\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q1-2024-roadmap-update/3044","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Jun 2024 02:23:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-3044"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q1-2024-roadmap-update/3044.rss","#text":"Protocol Development - Q1 2024 Roadmap Update"}},{"title":"Bounties - June 2024","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Grants / Bounties","description":"<p>On April 24, the Rocket Pool protocol DAO passed <a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-39\">RPIP-39</a>, which allow the Grants Management Committee to pay out incentives to community members engaging with the bounty system. This breaks more complex bounties into three distinct parts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Bounty Proposal</strong><br>\nA high-level bounty idea that requires more work before it can be adopted by the GMC. The goal of the bounty proposal is to convince the GMC that this idea is worth the effort and funding to pursue. Proposal requirements are easy to meet to encourage community engagement. Bounty proposals are the ‘quick and dirty’ path for community members to suggest a bounty idea to the GMC.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounty Definition</strong><br>\nA detailed and well-defined bounty specification that can be adopted by the GMC. The goal of the bounty definition is to communicate the content and terms of the bounty to bounty hunters. Community members may provide a bounty definition alongside their bounty proposal, it may be created by the GMC, or submitted by a separate community member. Bounty definitions are the ‘tick all the boxes’ path for community members to get their bounty adopted by the GMC.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounty Support Contact</strong><br>\nAn individual who acts as a supporter and point of contact with bounty hunters for a given bounty. This may be the bounty proposal author, a member of the GMC, or another community member. The bounty support contact’s goal is to support and liaise with bounty hunters so that they are better able to deliver the work specified in the bounty definition. Bounty contacts are listed in bounty definitions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aside from the now streamlined proposal incentive, the GMC is now seeking assistance externally for bounty definitions and bounty supporters.</p>\n<p>On June 4, the GMC approved the following bounty incentives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proposal Incentive</strong> $50</li>\n<li><strong>Definition Incentive</strong> 2%, minimum $75</li>\n<li><strong>Support Incentive</strong> 2%, minimum $50</li>\n</ul>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>Currently the GMC is seeking a definition for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/round-11-call-for-bounty-applications-deadline-is-april-7/2776/4\">DAO Engagement Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find the bounty definition template <a href=\"https://github.com/rocketpoolgmc/rocketpool-gmc/blob/main/meta/bounty-definition-template.md\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in writing a definition please post your submission or questions here, or reach out to the GMC within their dedicated server.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a

At the same time the classifications for critical bugs were changed (see <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231211081935/https://immunefi.com/bounty/rocketpool/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">cached bounty page</a>) and partially downgraded to high based on $-value.  In detail:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Used to be classified as critical ($500k bounty) and was changed to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Direct theft of any user funds (with value &gt; $250,000), whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Still critical ($500k bounty) and:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Direct theft of any user funds (with value &lt; $250,000), whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now high ($25k bounty)</p>\n<p>The same change was made for:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Permanent freezing of funds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My initial impression was that this is about reducing cost, given that the payout either remains the same or is reduced significantly, however langers assured me that this is not the case and the goal was to have more sensible payouts. To check sensibility, I had a quick look at some other staking protocol programs for comparison:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/staderforeth/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stader</a>: Linear scaling (10%) with $100k minimum and $1m maximum for theft or permanent freezing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/stakewise/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stakewise</a>: $200k fixed for loss of user funds, independent of $-impact</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/lido/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido</a>: Linear scaling (1%) for loss of user funds with $100k min and $2m maximum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is worth noting that the bug bounty is fully run by the team and not the pDAO. So these are just my two cents and not meant as a formal proposal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling payout with the potential impact is a fine thing to do, but I believe that a minimum payout of $25k for critical bugs as described here puts Rocket Pool in a comparatively bad position and I would like to see minimum increased significantly.</li>\n<li>Scaling can go both ways. Especially in the context of making a change from fixed to scaled, increasing payout for very high impact at the same time are better optics that make it clear what the change is about.</li>\n<li>Big payout jumps based on impact should be avoided, as they create perverse incentives for whitehats. Impact of a bug can fluctuate over time with ETH value, RPL value or factors like number of minipools in a certain state. Here, the payout would 20x if an impact goes from $240k to $260k, so there is a strong incentive for a potential whitehat to sit on a known issue until the treshold is met. Linear scaling doesn’t produce strong incentives to wait like that, because payouts are kept proportional to impact changes.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/immunefi-bug-bounty-changes/2987\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/immunefi-bug-bounty-changes/2987","pubDate":"Mon, 20 May 2024 11:54:00 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2987"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/immunefi-bug-bounty-changes/2987.rss","#text":"Immunefi Bug Bounty Changes"}},{"title":"2024-05 IMC Members Selection","dc:creator":"Valdorff","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Hi All,</p>\n<p>We will be selecting nine IMC members (the full committee) for a 5/9 multisig out of a pool of 12 nominees.</p>\n<p>In order to help inform your choices, please refer to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IMC nominee statements in <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/2024-05-imc-nomination-thread/2959/18\">IMC Nomination Thread </a></li>\n<li>Supplementary hard metrics below</li>\n<li>You may also ask questions of nominees - I suggest doing that in this thread so others can benefit from the discussion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Per RPIP-10, we’re now ready to have the vote go up, and I will request it in the next few days.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For full voting process, see the “Management Committee Selection” section of <a href=\"https://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/blob/main/RPIPs/RPIP-10.md#management-committee-selection\">RPIP-10 </a>.</li>\n<li>Important note: vacancies that occur get filled by going down the list from previous selections.

I will purposely give a broad set here, without presenting my own opinion. For context, IMC’s current spend is ~$350k/period (periods are 28 days). It was somewhat higher when the RPL ratio was higher because we’ve been trying to run lean to preserve runway. It fluctuates somewhat with ETH price, as we track most expenses in ETH (and a couple in RPL).</p>\n<p>What are some paths we could take?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IMC could provide on the order of 8E=$24k/period incentives to rETH/BOLD\n<ul>\n<li>Context: this would be about a tenth of our total rETH/ETH mainnet spend</li>\n<li>Context: this would be a bit over half our L2 rETH/ETH spend</li>\n<li>Context: this would be half our spend on PancakeSwap’s mainnet rETH/ETH concentrated liquidity</li>\n<li>Context: this would be 3.5x our spend on RPL/ETH</li>\n<li>Can the IMC do this: This is a lot. I’d want an explicit voted pDAO direction for this.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>IMC could provide on the order of 2.5E=$7.5k/period incentives to rETH/BOLD\n<ul>\n<li>Context: this would be similar to the spend on RPL/ETH</li>\n<li>Context: this would be about half the spend of rETH/ETH on <em>one</em> L2</li>\n<li>Can the IMC do this: The IMC charter doesn’t cover USDlike at all, though it does talk about “access to rETH across major DeFi protocols” and “build rETH exchange volume”. This is an amount I’d feel comfortable moving on with either strong support in forums and other casual channels <em>or</em> a vote.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We could provide funds for stability pool incentives\n<ul>\n<li>The rough expectation is that incentives here improve the peg and thus ten to reduce interest rates indirectly</li>\n<li>In a leverage cascade, a healthy stability pool acts as a buffer\n<ul>\n<li>The IMC is generally not a big fan of leverage (and especially incentivizing it) due to the potential for cascades.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Can the IMC do this: I think this would need a vote, either to have someone else do it, or to tell the IMC to do it despite being a bit outside the usual remit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nothing\n<ul>\n<li>We determine we won’t provide incentives at this time due to some combo of being USDlike, encouraging leverage, etc</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There would be some open questions: Do we provide more budget to IMC for this? Does IMC have control at all, eg, to spend less if they judge that appropriate? Should we explore starting aggressive and ramping down instead of uniform? What level do we actually want (the bullets are rough examples, not the only options)?</p>\n<p>For now, I’m looking for high level vibes, and we can figure out details if there’s enough interest to make that sensible.</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/liquity-incentive-vibe-check/2975\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/liquity-incentive-vibe-check/2975","pubDate":"Fri, 10 May 2024 03:54:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2975"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/liquity-incentive-vibe-check/2975.rss","#text":"Liquity Incentive Vibe Check"}},{"title":"Interval 22 post-mortem","dc:creator":"Patches","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Disclaimer first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What follows is my interpretation of the events that led to interval 22 producing what social consensus has deemed a bugged tree</li>\n<li>Financial impact is so trivial that even if we set up a way to correct it, the gas cost of doing so would greatly exceed the the remuneration</li>\n<li>RPL rewards were correct, only the smoothing pool was impacted</li>\n<li><strong>Voting against v9 will not fix anything, this issue is present in all previous versions</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Interval 22 was just completed and, as <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/u/langers\">@langers</a> mentioned in the protocol channel on discord:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>rewards are safe but the calculation doesn’t align with the <code>v8</code> spec for this interval (22), impact on node operators is insignificant (~0.000001 ETH per minipool opted into the Smoothing Pool) but we are letting you know.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The disparity arises from a few attestations which were included more than 32 slots after their assignment. These attestations arrived late, and the rolling-records implementation of treegen in watchtower treated them as missed, while the non-rolling-records implementation of treegen in watchtower <em>and</em> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/u/ramana\">@ramana</a> 's independent implementation treated them as valid.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-of-events-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#timeline-of-events-1\"></a>Timeline of events</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The treegen spec in its original form didn’t establish a deadline for attestations, it established a methodology for counting attestations that set an implicit limit to one epoch.</li>\n<li>v6 updated this methodology to make the boundary explicitly inclusive</li>\n<li>Joe created the rolling-records implementation to enforce that deadline, but forgot to update the non-rolling-records implementation</li>\n<li>Deneb included <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7045\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-7045: Increase max attestation inclusion slot</a> which extended the deadline for attestation inclusion, making the non-rolling-records implementation trivially aligned with the beacon spec, but leaving the rolling-records implementation and ramana’s implementation correct per the rewards spec - albeit tacitly diverging from social consensus and the beacon spec</li>\n<li>A preview tree detected the issue, but Ramana nor I realized the spec still specified a 32 slot deadline, so Ramana updated his implementation to match the non-rolling-records implementation</li>\n<li>An unrelated bug in treegen forced the oDAO off of rolling records for interval 21, so the interval 21 tree actually diverged from the spec, but matched ‘social consensus’ and the beacon spec</li>\n<li>The bug in step 6 was fixed and the oDAO switched back to rolling-records for interval 22 and produced a tree that matched the spec but not social consensus nor the beacon spec</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The result of this is that no matter which specification you believe is correct (the one that follows the written language of the v8 RPIP, or the one that follows the unwritten social consensus on how to handle late attestations), at least one interval was finalized with the <em>other</em> methodology.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"updating-the-spec-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#updating-the-spec-2\"></a>Updating the spec</h2>\n<p>The spec says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Look at the attestations in the subsequent blocks with matching <code>slotIndex</code>, <code>committeeIndex</code>, and <code>position</code>. Start at the block directly after <code>slotIndex</code>, and look up to 1 Epoch away (<code>BeaconConfig.SlotsPerEpoch</code>) from <code>slotIndex</code>.\n<ol>\n<li>If one was recorded in <em>any of these blocks</em>, this attestation was successful. Calculate the <code>minipoolScore</code> for this attestation as described below.</li>\n<li>If the attestation was not found, it was missed. Add it to a running list of <code>missedAttestations</code>.</li>\n<li>The boundary is inclusive, so if an attestation for slot <code>n</code> is found in slot <code>n + BeaconConfig.SlotsPerEpoch</code> then it was successful. If it was found in slot <code>n + BeaconConfig.SlotsPerEpoch + 1</code>, it is too late and should be considered missed.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is, in my view, overly descriptive, and <strong>we can simply amend the spec to say that attestations are considered valid if they are valid for the fork in which they’re assigned</strong>, with an explanation that EIP-7045 in Deneb changed the criteria from a 32 slot deadline to a deadline at the end of the epoch following the assignment.</p>\n<p>Please opine on how you think this should be corrected in the following sentiment poll:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/interval-22-post-mortem/2974/1\">Click to view the poll.</a></p>\n<p>I am explicitly in favor of amending the RPIPs via errata. We can have this done in a day.</p>\n<p>The alternative is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Correcting treegen to consistently follow the spec in both implementations (quick)</li>\n<li>Passing an RPIP to create a new version of the rewards spec that updates attestation criteria (3 weeks)</li>\n<li>Releasing a new version of watchtower to the odao (2 to 6 weeks depending on the timing)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the financial scope of the change, if we can’t fix this via errata, I would probably prefer correcting treegen to match the spec as-is and wait until a v10 proposal is created for some other reason and piggy-back the attestation eligibility changes into that proposal.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that even if you are an absolute purist, it is too late to amend intervals 22 and 21 for consistency. If we have to go the new-RPIP route, the benefits of a clean history will not be retroactive.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/interval-22-post-mortem/2974\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/interval-22-post-mortem/2974","pubDate":"Thu, 09 May 2024 17:21:38 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2974"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/interval-22-post-mortem/2974.rss","#text":"Interval 22 post-mortem"}},{"title":"Round 13 - GMC Call for Retrospective Applications - Deadline is June 7","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Grants / Bounties","description":"<p>This thread is for applications for Rocket Pool’s May 7, 2024 - June 7, 2024 retrospective awards.
