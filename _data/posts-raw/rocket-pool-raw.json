Protocols, founders and whales often hold high concentration positions in governance tokens due to liquidity mismatch between value of what they own and what can be realized. Trading these positions results in high slippage and price impacts - they’re often forced holders until it’s too late and the bear market has begun. Fyde Treasury Protocol provides a solution to mitigate these various issues.</p>\n<p>Enabling treasuries, such as Rocket Pool’s, to diversify a portion of their native token holdings through the Fyde Liquid Vault without introducing sell pressure from open market or OTC sales. In doing so token issuers also benefit from increased liquidity pathways for their native token and the creation of yield, while preserving governance of deposited tokens.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"abstract-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#abstract-4\"></a>Abstract:</h3>\n<p>This proposal outlines a pilot program for Rocket Pool to deposit a portion of its RPL token holdings into the Fyde Liquid Vault on a trial basis, receiving TRSY in return thus enhancing treasury resilience. Fyde offers features like instant withdrawal and market liquidity, providing a simplified and sustainable approach to treasury management.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation:</h3>\n<p>Protocols focus on creating liquidity for their native token which can be notoriously difficult. Issues such as impermanent loss can be mitigated in the short-term through liquidity incentives however this does not fix the problem over the long-term. Token liquidity should actually be seen as a by-product of what token treasuries actually need - which is portfolio liquidity and this can be achieved much more efficiently than for an individual token (e.g. ETFs vs individual stocks). Fyde creates an on-chain liquid vault where users can deposit governance tokens, and in return, receive increased liquidity, diversification, and yield - while still being able to retain governance rights.</p>\n<p>Fyde Protocol addresses the complexities of crypto treasury management for DAOs and protocols, promoting long-term growth and sustainability. By leveraging Fyde’s Liquid Vault, Rocket Pool intends to enhance treasury resilience, increase liquidity, improve token distribution and optimize operational efficiency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#specification-6\"></a>Specification:</h3>\n<p>The proposal suggests depositing a percentage of Rocket Pool’s RPL treasury holdings (or core contributor positions) into Fyde’s Liquid Vault as a pilot program. A deposit of between 5 000 to 15 000 RPL (~$100k to $300k as of 01/05/24) is recommended, with an intention of maintaining the deposit for 3-6 months.</p>\n<p>This suggestion is aligned with our target concentration of RPL within the vault. Recent deposit sizes from DAO and protocol clients have ranged between $100k to $300k.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Step</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n<th>Rocket Pool/ Fyde</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Proposal review</td>\n<td>Rocket Pool</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Follow-up call</td>\n<td>Rocket Pool/ Fyde</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Confirm the proposal &amp; seed deposit amount</td>\n<td>Rocket Pool</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Fyde to whitelist RPL (Done)</td>\n<td>Fyde</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Deposit seed</td>\n<td>Rocket Pool</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Comarketing</td>\n<td>Rocket Pool/ Fyde</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Explore additional collaboration</td>\n<td>Rocket Pool/ Fyde</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"benefits-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#benefits-7\"></a>Benefits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Liquidity: Depositing RPL into Fyde’s Liquid Vault increases liquidity and trading volume across DEXs/CEXs through new pairs.</li>\n<li>Ecosystem liquidations: RPL grant recipients can deposit into Fyde, receiving a less volatile asset which can be liquidated to fund expenditures as needed.</li>\n<li>Diversification: Fyde enables Rocket Pool to diversify its treasury holdings, enhancing overall resilience and allowing the Rocket Pool to better grow across market cycles.</li>\n<li>Distribution: Tokens included in the Fyde Liquid Vault benefit from 35+ new direct trading pairs as tokens can be swapped without routing through WETH/ USDT - our vault becomes the cheapest place to execute swaps at scale</li>\n<li>No Lock-ups: Deposits are non-custodial and can be withdrawn instantly, providing flexibility to Rocket Pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"considerations-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#considerations-8\"></a>Considerations:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited Day 1 Liquidity: Fyde plans to implement LP token buyback programs to facilitate liquidity. Initial liquidity may be limited until these measures are enacted upon the FYDE issuance in Q2 2024.</li>\n<li>Execution Size: Due to Fyde’s recent launch, large deposit sizes will need to be scaled over time.</li>\n<li>Exchange Rate: Withdrawn amounts of RPL are subject to prevailing exchange rates and risk concentration targets within the vault.</li>\n<li>Short-Term Performance: TRSY is designed to capture broad market performance. As a result, there may be times when RPL outperforms TRSY.

Sei is the fusion between Ethereum and Solana but faster with cheaper transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m proposing to deploy Rocketpool on Sei Network to achieve and reach more within the decentralized finance space (we all share this goal)!

This integration will allow developers building on other LayerZero-supported chains to seamlessly connect to and build on Sei V2.</em></p>\n<p>Dear Rocket Community! <strong>Let’s go beyond together and open up new horizons in the DeFi landscape!</strong></p>\n<p>Interested? <img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/images/emoji/twitter/point_down.png?v=12\" title=\":point_down:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":point_down:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> I’ve compiled what’s important to know about Sei below <img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/images/emoji/twitter/point_down.png?v=12\" title=\":point_down:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":point_down:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">:</p>\n<p><strong>What is SEI Network?</strong></p>\n<p>Sei, a Layer-1 blockchain, aims to be the fastest network for exchanging digital assets. It features novel technological features built into its blockchain. Namely, Twin-Turbo Consensus and transaction parallelization, which increase transaction efficiency and throughput. Since launching its mainnet in August 2023, Sei has seen an ecosystem of native projects launch and a community emerge. To maintain momentum, Sei must successfully deploy the features planned for the Sei V2 upgrade. EVM compatibility could unlock new opportunities by expanding Sei’s developer ecosystem and enabling established EVM protocols to deploy on Sei. Optimistic transaction parallelization will ease the developer experience, while SeiDB improves the network’s performance across the board. Post-V2, sights can be set on the Parallel Stack. The stack could enable further growth in Sei’s ecosystem and validator usage as Layer-2 EVM rollups are launched by developers seeking an improved user experience and novel design space. All these planned features could lead to more activity on the network as it continues to mature and differentiate itself from other competing Layer-1 networks.</p>\n<p><strong>Optimistic Parallelization.</strong></p>\n<p>To further elaborate on the execution environment, we must highlight Sei’s rollout of optimistic parallelization. By enabling transactions to be processed in parallel rather than sequentially, Sei v2 enables significantly increased throughput and reduced transactions fees. This architecture diverges from traditional, sequential blockchain processing seen traditionally with the EVM, where transactions are confirmed one after another, leading to potential bottlenecks as the network’s usage grows. Sequential transactions therefore present anti-network effects–parallelization alleviates such growing pains.</p>\n<p><em>Key Numbers</em>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork/status/1770159112866963540?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork/status/1770159112866963540?s=20</a></p>\n<p>Sei v2 utilizes optimistic parallelization, where transactions are processed in parallel under the assumption that they will not conflict or interfere with each other’s state changes. This approach optimistically assumes that concurrent transactions can access and modify the blockchain state without creating inconsistencies. If conflict arises, then sequential re-execution of the transactions is needed. Deterministic execution requires developers to assign the parts of state that can be accessed, but these assignments require more developer overhead.</p>\n<p><em>To learn more about it</em>: <a href=\"https://forum.sei.io/t/optimistic-concurrency-control/28?ref=blog.sei.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimistic Concurrency Control - Standards and RFCs - Sei Developer Forum</a></p>\n<p><strong>What is SeiDB?</strong></p>\n<p>More transactions also means more problems, specifically around state management. If a blockchain cannot effectively manage high throughput at the state/storage level, it encounters another bottleneck. This undermines the advantages initially gained from employing a parallel execution environment.</p>\n<p>That’s where SeiDB comes in.</p>\n<p>Sei Labs has redesigned their database for high-performance storage, making sure that information is organized, stored, and accessed efficiently.</p>\n<p>Operationally, efficiency and performance is achieved by separating state store (SS) and state commit (SC). This bifurcation is designed to optimize Sei for two requirements: handling vast historical data and processing new transactions efficiently.</p>\n<p>SS pertains to historical data. By organizing data as raw key values while minimizing unnecessary metadata, SeiDB ensures that historical records–encompassing transactions, state changes, and other relevant data–are stored in a compact and accessible manner. This makes it easier to conduct auditing, transaction verification, and node synchronization. Such storage efficiency helps mitigate potential issues related to state bloat, ensuring that Sei remains scalable and efficient as it grows, not falling subject to diminishing performance from scale.</p>\n<p>SC deals with the processing and validating of new transactions by performing state changes in-memory and streamlining access to the most recent state information. This way, SeiDB reduces the need for intensive Input/Output operations, enabling faster transaction validation and commitment.</p>\n<p>The above architecture positions Sei in a place to aptly deal with high-volume applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>The heightened activity in the prior bull market exposed some limitations in blockchain technology as networks experienced high gas fees and slow transaction speeds. However, in the recent bear market, Sei emerged with technological innovations that hoped to address these limitations. Sei Labs created a Layer-1 network with the goal of becoming the fastest network for exchanging digital assets. Sei’s built-in blockchain technologies, such as Twin-Turbo Consensus and transaction parallelization, enable reduced transaction latency and increased transaction throughput.</p>\n<p>Sei v2’s efficient design is meant to introduce an influx of applications that have not been previously possible due to the limited EVM design space. SVM and MoveVM chains will act as the direct architectural competitors to Sei going forward since they’ve been able to introduce unique applications like onchain order books. More parallelized EVMs will invariably be introduced in the coming months as well. Solana also has a parallelized EVM L2 called Neon, which has so far gained very little traction. This puts Sei in a strong position because it, ideally, enables high-throughput applications while simultaneously bringing forward a familiar developer environment.</p>\n<p><strong>SEI V2 (EVM Compatible) is set to go live on mainnet before the end of this Q2.

Unfortunately, node operators using this new feature are **no longer able to claim rewards** if they have an RPL withdrawal address. *Only* the RPL withdrawal address is able to claim their rewards. This includes both RPL *and* Smoothing Pool ETH rewards.\n\nThis RPIP proposes to generalize the rewards tree, changing *nodes* to *claimers*. The tree will now specify the amount of RPL and Smoothing Pool ETH available to individual claimers, where:\n- If a node does not have an RPL withdrawal address set, their node address is the claimer address (same as today).\n- If a node *does* have an RPL withdrawal address set, the node's rewards will be split in two:\n  - One claimer will be the node's primary withdrawal address, which will have the node's ETH portion of the rewards.\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n  This file has been truncated. <a href=\"https://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/blob/rewards_v10/RPIPs/RPIP-53.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">show original</a>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>The full details are covered in there but to summarize, in Houston we added a special setting called an “RPL withdrawal address” in accordance with <a href=\"https://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/blob/rewards_v10/RPIPs/RPIP-31.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RPIP-31</a>. It’s distinct from the <em>primary</em> withdrawal address (the one you have today). If you have the RPL withdrawal address set, then all RPL rewards you claim will go to that address and all Smoothing Pool ETH you claim will go to your primary withdrawal address.</p>\n<p>The problem, though, is that if you have an RPL withdrawal address set, <em>you can’t claim rewards anymore</em> as the node operator. Only the RPL withdrawal address is allowed to claim rewards. This is fine for RPL rewards but since the Smoothing Pool ETH is tied to the claiming system, it means only the RPL withdrawal address can claim Smoothing Pool ETH on your behalf. Bummer.</p>\n<p>v10 proposes a fix to that via a small tweak to the rewards tree spec, which (thanks to a quirk in the contracts), doesn’t require any contract changes and doesn’t affect nodes that don’t have an RPL withdrawal address set. Here’s the TLDR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No contract changes</li>\n<li>Nodes without an RPL withdrawal address are unchanged</li>\n<li>Nodes with an RPL withdrawal address will be removed from the tree, and in their place will be 2 entries:\n<ul>\n<li>1 for the primary withdrawal address, with the ETH</li>\n<li>1 for the RPL withdrawal address, for the RPL</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Yes, having tree entries that aren’t node operators actually works and yes, you can only claim for those entries from the entry address itself. Like I said, weird quirk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has an interesting side effect too: if the RPL withdrawal address is set, nodes with the same one will have their RPL aggregated into a single entry within the rewards tree so claiming it will only take a single transaction instead of <code>n</code> transactions (<code>n</code> being the number of nodes with that particular address set). Same story for ETH rewards. It reduces O(n) operations down to O(1) which is compelling for entities that plan to use this setup but are being blocked by linearly scaling gas costs.</p>\n<p>That being said, this also has some important ramifications. For example, it means nodes with the RPL withdrawal address set can no longer <code>claimAndStake</code>, and they can’t claim from the node address anymore - claims have to be done from both the primary withdrawal address and the RPL withdrawal address.</p>\n<p>Instead of rehashing the entire proposal here I think that’s probably a fair summary.

We agreed to execute the research study for $33,300 including research participant incentives. We now wish to make a request for retrospective funding of $16,700 to bring us up to the original cost for the work.</p>\n<p>Our goal for the research was to improve the experience of node operators, increase the number of people becoming node operators, and therefore increase the security of Ethereum overall. These are bold but achievable end results, however just having the research findings is not enough to make that so; the end users of our research (Rocket Pool core team, GMC and wider community) must be able to adequately action the findings. And due to the nature of user research in large distributed organizations like Rocket Pool, it can time for findings to turn into action, and results.</p>\n<p>As a measure to evidence the effectiveness of our research, we anonymously surveyed GMC recipients to collect feedback on the research. Three people filled out the survey. Specific feedback we received from members of the GMC and community included:</p>\n<p><em>“Very high quality work.

First, it ensures that NOs are getting paid enough to want to be with RP (the <code>node_operator_commission_share</code>). Next it pays vote-eligible staked RPL enough to ensure governance is very expensive to attack (the <code>voter_share</code>). Finally - the remaining revenue is “surplus”.

Additionally, we consider how the current indirect model compares to the proposed direct revenue approach. Next, we analyze the proposed tokenomics rework and assess the risks associated with each component individually and in totality. Lastly, we evaluate the impact of these proposed changes on NodeSet’s work before suggesting an alternative proposal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>The current tokenomics proposal that has received the most attention fundamentally changes the relationship between RPL and the protocol and, therefore, the relationships between stakeholders in the system. Our findings indicate that the proposed new dynamics may be less healthy than existing dynamics because they create a financialized shareholder class that is economically incentivized to exploit the other actors (NOs, rETH holders) who make the system run, necessarily changing the makeup of these groups over time. In turn, this is likely to eventually lead to systemic instability and a transformation of RP into a protocol dominated by ungovernable large actors.</p>\n<p>While RPL exists today as a utility token with an indirect revenue model fundamentally tied to node operation, the new proposals shift it towards an asset that can be priced more concretely by the market through ETH revenue accrual, opening it to increased levels of speculator ownership rather than participant ownership. Although this may make RPL more attractive to some, it does so by taking value from existing and future NOs, and for many scenarios, there is little change in terminal valuation versus existing tokenomics. Potential mitigations are suggested to prevent the optimization of the RPL/ETH ratio from overshadowing these and other serious risks associated with the proposed tokenomics changes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, these changes would significantly impact NodeSet’s ability to grow Rocket Pool with Constellation. Altering tokenomics after the upcoming release of Constellation might, at worst, prevent its operation. At best, these changes would reduce its positive impact and delay future development to focus on complying with new changes to RP. Therefore, we suggest a different path.</p>\n            <p><small>23 posts - 12 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/nodeset-review-of-rpl-tokenomics/2869\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/nodeset-review-of-rpl-tokenomics/2869","pubDate":"Tue, 26 Mar 2024 19:32:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2869"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/nodeset-review-of-rpl-tokenomics/2869.rss","#text":"NodeSet Review of RPL Tokenomics"}},{"title":"Adjust terminal user interface size to make it suitable for smartphones","dc:creator":"Dinolawer","category":"Node Operator Experience","description":"<p>This is a rather simple and small request but that would enable safer and easier remote acces.</p>\n<p>I used to be able to open the TUI (terminal user interface) on my phone, but this functionality has been gone since some time.

Discussions have centered around the operational aspects of this integration. While the RP team is supportive of the SSV integration, their focus remains primarily on Houston, Saturn, and megapools. Despite the general support within the GMC, the GMC is keen on gauging community sentiment. The estimated costs for this endeavor, including bounty work and audit expenses, stand at approximately $50k.</p>\n<p>Should the protocol seek to integrate SSV?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858/1\">Click to view the poll.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Commitment</strong><br>\nGiven the intricacies and dependencies involved, there is a strong case for having a dedicated party extremely knowledgeable of both RocketPool and SSV to undertake this project.

Within this time frame, we welcome submissions from any number of teams or individuals who are prepared to present an MVP focused on SSV integration. We encourage early submissions to foster a collaborative environment. As soon as we receive the first qualifying MVP submission, a subsequent period of two weeks will commence, during which other participants can still submit their versions of the MVP for consideration. Following this two-week window, one team will be selected and awarded one-third of the total bounty prize. This chosen team will then have the exclusive option to undertake the complete project, thereby claiming the remaining portion of the bounty. This approach ensures a competitive yet collaborative atmosphere, driving innovation while maintaining a focus on delivering a high-quality, functional integration of SSV with Rocket Pool.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does the community see this approach as feasible, or are there any suggestions to make this process more efficient?</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858","pubDate":"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:41:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2858"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858.rss","#text":"SSV Integration"}},{"title":"Grant Idea - Rocket Pool Summit Program","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Grants / Bounties","description":"<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>Create a budget for Rocket Pool meetup events where community members can meet in approved locations (cities) twice a year, and be reimbursed up to a certain amount for their expenses.</p>\n<p>Right now ETH Denver is the primary event for the Rocket Pool community.
