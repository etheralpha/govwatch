But we decided to do that anyway.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Beside the Q2 Position document, we have decided to produce a short document containing some reflections on our AVC experience and some additional reccomendations we have for the future of MakerDAO’s AVCs, in case MakerDAO’s AVC will be re-activated one day.  <br><br>\nThis document will simply take the form of a forum reply to this thread, posted by the KISS AVC member and moderator (Dai-vinci).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, the unanimity of <strong>AVC members have decided to terminate the KISS AVC</strong> after the end of Q2 2024. <br><br>\nTherefore, after the end of all Q2 2024 activities listed above:<br> <br><br>\n<strong>4.I)</strong> All KISS AVC members will use the the recently approved Paragraph 5.2.1.5 of MIP113  (see <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#5-2-1-5\" class=\"inline-onebox\">MIPs Portal</a>) to voluntarily relinquish their recognized status.<br><br><br>\n<strong>4.II)</strong> After this, the KISS AVC will remain (for lack of better words) orphaned. We kindly ask that MakerDAO governance facilitators consider delete the KISS AVC forum and the 2 Discord channels after all members have relinquisihed their position. <br><br><br>\nThe reason for this termination is to formally cut any link between the 2023+2024 KISS AVC experience and any form of new involvement that AVC members might decide to have with MakerDAO in the future (such as, e.g., the formation of a fresh new AVC).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>To the attention of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/votewizard\">@votewizard</a>.</p>\n<p>Please let us know if you agree on the procedure (4) above.</p>\n<p>We do not want to create bureaucratic headaches. Our goal is a clear concrete implementation of the KISS AVC shutdown (i.e., the points 4.I and 4.II) can be modified to follow the best practices and indications of Facilitators.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/kiss-avc-winddown-procedure-proposal/24264\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/kiss-avc-winddown-procedure-proposal/24264","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 19:56:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24264"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/kiss-avc-winddown-procedure-proposal/24264.rss","#text":"KISS AVC winddown procedure proposal"}},{"title":"MIPs Portal Ongoing Issue","dc:creator":"ldr","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>An ongoing unidentified issue is affecting the MIPs Portal frontend at <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/\">https://mips.makerdao.com/</a></p>\n<p>This is leading to some MIPs appearing blank, and others displaying out of date information.</p>\n<p>Until this has been resolved, please consider the GitHub repository at <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/mips\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - makerdao/mips: Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs)</a> to be the canonical source of truth.</p>\n<p>TechOps are investigating possible issues and we will provide an update once one is available.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/mips-portal-ongoing-issue/24259\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/mips-portal-ongoing-issue/24259","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 13:05:46 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24259"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/mips-portal-ongoing-issue/24259.rss","#text":"MIPs Portal Ongoing Issue"}},{"title":"Stability Scope Parameter Changes #13; Under STA Article 3.3","dc:creator":"rema","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h2><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>BA Labs continues with observations of market dynamics and monitoring internal systems. In the past weeks since the recent rate cuts, main development is in the external rate environment which has notably dropped, including the defi protocols and cefi funding rates. Main impact on the internal system had thus been an increase in DAI supply and stablecoin reserves which is a product of DSR being very attractive rate and positions being refinanced to cheaper alternatives across defi space.</p>\n<p>On March 8, 2024, article 3.3 in the Stability Scope was enacted by the Stability Facilitators by initiating an accelerated governance cycle to implement non-standard changes to the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), Stability Fees (SFs) of Maker Core Vaults, and the Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY.</p>\n<p>Since then, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> has been following market developments and Maker Protocol dynamics closely. We have provided regular data, analyses, and parameter change proposals, with the main goal of aiding Maker Governance in navigating protocol and market changes and managing Stability Scope parameters.</p>\n<p>For an overview of <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> work regarding Stability Scope parameter change proposals and protocol dynamic analyses since the March 8 Accelerated Proposal, refer to the links below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-8-accelerated-proposal/23909\">Impact Analysis: March 8 Accelerated Proposal (March 20, 2024)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-11-under-sta-article-3-3/23910\">Stability Scope Parameter Changes #11; Under STA Article 3.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-20-parameter-change-proposal/24131\">Impact Analysis: March 20 Parameter Change Proposal (April 19, 2024)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-12-under-sta-article-3-3/24132\">Stability Scope Parameter Changes #12; Under STA Article 3.3</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"maker-exposure-trends-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#maker-exposure-trends-2\"></a>Maker Exposure Trends</h2>\n<p>The area chart below measures DAI debt exposure distribution over time. We have created four categories to track exposures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cash RWA (T-bill Exposure): BlockTower Andromeda (RWA015-A) &amp; Monetalis Clydesdale (RWA007-A)</li>\n<li>Crypto: ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, WSTETH-A, WSTETH-B, WBTC-A, WBTC-B, WBTC-C, Spark D3M, and Morpho D3M</li>\n<li>Legacy: 6s Capital, New Silver, ConsolFreight, Harbor Trade Credit, Fortunafi, H. V. Bank, BlockTower S3, BlockTower S4</li>\n<li>Stablecoins: PSM(USDC), Coinbase Custody, half of GUNI-DAI/USDC 0.01%, and half of GUNI-DAI/USDC 0.05%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since our last exposure update, on April 19, the most notable change has been the increase in Stablecoin exposure as a result of DSR being very attractive, and some positions being refinanced to cheaper alternatives across the defi space. This, in turn, resulted in more capital being deployed to Cash RWA since the target Cash Stablecoin exposure has exceeded the 30% threshold.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e272166d12b48f6273185fda53ba732e67f43bca.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wjel4vb7ePqN7vXFjaWtfHHZmMG.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e272166d12b48f6273185fda53ba732e67f43bca_2_624x267.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"wjel4vb7ePqN7vXFjaWtfHHZmMG\" width=\"624\" height=\"267\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e272166d12b48f6273185fda53ba732e67f43bca_2_624x267.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e272166d12b48f6273185fda53ba732e67f43bca_2_936x400.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e272166d12b48f6273185fda53ba732e67f43bca.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DFC9DF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/\">Makerburn</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"dsr-changes-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dsr-changes-3\"></a>DSR Changes</h2>\n<p>As seen in the chart below, over the last few months, there has been an upward trend of DAI in the DSR. The DSR utilization is currently at 38.1%. Since the main source of new DAI is from PSM, which is then deposited into the DSR, the protocol profit generation has been decreasing. This will likely change assuming this proposal is implemented, since crypto lending will become more attractive which will likely result in increased exposure, which yields more compared to Coinbase Custody and Cash RWA.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/9/190c7845166e7b36c78dc67d4502de140f5a7851.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3zAEuSizj0OnOikZ69lpryXh0BP.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/190c7845166e7b36c78dc67d4502de140f5a7851_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"3zAEuSizj0OnOikZ69lpryXh0BP\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/190c7845166e7b36c78dc67d4502de140f5a7851_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/190c7845166e7b36c78dc67d4502de140f5a7851_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/9/190c7845166e7b36c78dc67d4502de140f5a7851.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/\">Makerburn</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"external-rates-environment-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#external-rates-environment-4\"></a>External Rates Environment</h2>\n<p>As seen on the charts below, the cefi funding rates and defi borrowing rates are in a downward trend which will likely remain until market sentiment changes and price dynamic starts to increase.

The whitehat hacker demonstrated it was possible to force a blank page to be stored into the CDN cache for a given URL in the Governance Portal, which could lead to some or all of the Governance Portal pages being inaccessible by the users, depending of the extent to which the vulnerability could have been exploited.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"actions-taken-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#actions-taken-2\"></a>Actions taken</h2>\n<p>Upon receiving the report we started a root cause analysis between TechOps and Jetstream, with the goal of better understanding the attack vector and potential mitigation steps.</p>\n<p>During the investigation phase we found that the vulnerability was unusual in nature, given that we were unable to find documentation on similar cases. It also proved difficult to assess whether the root cause was related to the frontend application code or its hosting infrastructure configuration such as CDN provider. As a result it took us longer than usual to identify a root cause, despite back-and-forth with the whitehat hacker. Given that no user and protocol funds were at risk and the whitehat hacker was willing to collaborate, we took over a week to find consensus on mitigation steps and implement them accordingly. The process involved multiple internal escalations, outreach to various software/infra vendors, testing various fixes and discussion with the whitehat hacker.</p>\n<p>On April 19th we marked the vulnerability report as valid, but did contest the ‘critical severity’ label. Immunefi’s mediation team ended up investigating the report and related discourse, with the outcome of the report being indeed of critical severity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"improvements-implemented-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#improvements-implemented-3\"></a>Improvements implemented</h2>\n<p>Jetstream implemented several improvements to enhance application (Governance Portal) security, particularly related to headers. One enhancement involved modifying the middleware to ensure that only request headers are returned in the NextResponse.next.request object. This adjustment streamlines header management, improving efficiency and reducing potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, Jetstream refined the response headers by removing request headers from them entirely. Now, the response headers solely contain the Content Security Policy (CSP).</p>\n<p>TechOps implemented a worker (specific software) for the infrastructure that rewrites and removes unnecessary headers from all requests coming to specific endpoints thus making it impossible to bring down the Governance Portal sending corrupted requests.</p>\n<p>This change has been implemented for all MakerDAO websites and subdomains that are managed and controlled by TechOps Services EA.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"planned-improvements-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#planned-improvements-4\"></a>Planned improvements</h2>\n<p>In addition to the fixes that have already been implemented, there are a couple of improvements that we agreed to make. They are mainly related to the process of reporting, escalating and trying to avoid bottlenecks whenever high priority bug issues are reported:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve the inbound process of the bug bounty program through a more granular definition of system component stewards.</li>\n<li>Automate notification and alerting process, facilitating fast response.</li>\n<li>Narrow the scope of ‘critical’ web application bugs by improving its definition as part of the bug bounty program terms.</li>\n<li>More granularly define what’s considered out-of-scope for the bug bounty program.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"closing-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#closing-5\"></a>Closing</h2>\n<p>Based on the above we authorize <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/psychonaut\">@psychonaut</a> (as steward of the bug bounty program) to proceed with the bounty payout.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/jetstream-ea\">@jetstream-ea</a> and <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/techops-services-ea\">@techops-services-ea</a> teams for collaborating on the issues and making it possible to resolve it in a proper manner.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/post-mortem-for-immunefi-bug-report-29806/24239\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/post-mortem-for-immunefi-bug-report-29806/24239","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 10:09:25 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24239"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/post-mortem-for-immunefi-bug-report-29806/24239.rss","#text":"Post-Mortem for Immunefi bug report #29806"}},{"title":"BlockTower Credit - Monthly Report (04/1/24 - 04/30/24)","dc:creator":"BlockTower","category":"General Discussion","description":"<h3><a name=\"preamble-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#preamble-1\"></a>Preamble</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">Title: BlockTower Credit Monthly Arranger Report\nPeriod: 03/31/2024- 04/30/2024\nPosted: 05/07/2024\nAuthor: @BlockTower\nTags: @Recognized-Delegates @Aes @roo\nIlks: RWA012-A, RWA013-A\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a name=\"references-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#references-2\"></a>References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-collateral-onboarding-application-blocktower-credit-arranger/16900/1\">BlockTower Credit (Arranger) Collateral Onboarding Application</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocktower-credit-commercial-and-legal-risk-assessment-part-i/18790\">BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part I</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocktower-credit-commercial-and-legal-risk-assessment-part-ii/18791\">BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part II</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-blocktower-credit-transaction-documents/19019\">BlockTower Credit Legal Transaction Documents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"executive-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#executive-summary-3\"></a>Executive Summary</h3>\n<p>During this reporting period, we sourced and settled 3 new assets.

Cohort Analysis</h1>\n<p>In the following analysis, we classify wallets by their cohort month, which groups those who first interacted with the protocol in the same month. The Cohort tenure metric is defined as the number of months since a wallet’s cohort month (1 represents the first month, 2 the second, and so forth). It is important to consider that all the cohorts from May 2023 to November 2023 have been grouped together in the November Cohort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conservative-growth-patterns-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conservative-growth-patterns-3\"></a>Conservative growth patterns</h2>\n<p>After reaching the peak of supplied amounts in February 2024 (~$4.1B), the total supply has been falling since then to reach ~$2.8B in April 2024 (Chart 1). The main reason why the total supply has been dropping is the down market we are currently witnessing, with BTC price falling by ~14% from its peak and ETH falling by ~20% from its peak. The pattern is slightly different from total borrows (Chart 4), that have reached their peak in March 2024 (~$1.65B) and plunged to ~$1.2B in April 2024.</p>\n<p>While this metric alone is not enough to provide an overall assessment of the protocol’s growth, the remaining ones give a clearer picture of SparkLend’s status. Since January 2024, the new cohorts have been supplying less amounts as percentage of total supplies (Chart 2). This is due to two main factors, (i) the positive retention patterns of the May-November cohort and (ii) the decreasing number of new wallets opening positions on SparkLend (Chart 7).</p>\n<p>In contrast with the previous analysis, we can see that the number of new wallets is decreasing steadily since January. This may be due to (i) the down market not attracting new users to DeFi protocols or (ii) SparkLend being less attractive compared to other Blue-Chip lending markets. We can see that up to date, supplied and borrowed amounts have been dropping in the range of 40% - 60% for new cohorts (Charts 3 and 6).</p>\n<p>With the exception of the February cohort, the Large wallets dominance per cohort tenure has been steady for each individual cohort (Chart 8).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"supplied-and-borrowed-amounts-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#supplied-and-borrowed-amounts-4\"></a>Supplied and borrowed amounts</h2>\n<p>Regarding total amounts supplied in April 2024, $423M (or 15.2%) came from the February cohort, followed by the March (7.9%) and the January ones (7.4%), with respectively $219M and $206M. Except for the May-November cohort (+26%) all new cohorts’ supplied amounts have been dropping, such as January (-63%), February (-46%) and March (-42%).</p>\n<p>The largest cohorts by amount supplied are the same cohorts dominating borrowing, with March borrowing $125M (10.3%), February borrowing $109M (9%) and January still borrowing $87M (7.3%). The January and February cohorts are the ones that dropped the most, both down 60% since they started using SparkLend.</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the cohorts.</p>\n\nChart 1.

Segmentation Analysis</h1>\n<p>The segmentation analysis conducted was primarily focused on assessing what types of positions/strategies SparkLend users are deploying. In order to understand how they were calculated, refer to the previously conducted Segmentation Analysis. To summarize briefly, here are the identified segments:</p>\n\nIdentified Segments <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h2><a name=\"still-bullish-sentiment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#still-bullish-sentiment-6\"></a>(Still) Bullish sentiment</h2>\n<p>In the last analysis, we used individual wallet positions to assess the sentiment of SparkLend users towards the crypto market. It is very interesting to note that most wallets are still exhibiting bullish behavior, with the largest positions being Long ETH LST ($1.5B) and Long Type 1 ($510M), together accounting for ~73% of the total supply in April (Charts 9 and 10). The third-largest position is the Recursive ETH LST (~$495M), roughly ~18% of total. It is also worth noting that the wallets in the highest supply bucket (&gt;$100M) all have long positions (Chart 12).</p>\n<p>Short positions have dropped consistently in March and April (now totaling ~$8.5M) down significantly from February when they were ~$93M. They are now ~0.3% of total supply, consistently dropping from their December 2023 peak, when they were ~4%.</p>\n<p>The wallet count per position strategy (Chart 11) highlights a predominance of ETH and (w)BTC long positions (483) as well as long ETH LST (167). There are only 10 wallets displaying strictly short strategies. On average, wallets in the lower supply amount buckets tend to have long ETH/(w)BTC positions, while those in the higher tend to have larger Long ETH LST positions. The strategies dominated by large wallets (Chart 14) are Short Type 1, Supply Only Stablecoins and recursive ETH LST. This is mainly due to a low number of wallets employing these strategies.</p>\n<p>A comparison between the current state of health rates (Chart 16) and the previous analysis shows Recursive ETH LST having lower debt-weighted health rates (down from 1.09 on 1 March to 1.02 on 1 May). On the other hand, Short strategies have a slightly higher health rate (1.52 vs. 1.42) as well as Long ETH LST (2.15 vs. 2.08).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"behavioral-analysis-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#behavioral-analysis-7\"></a>Behavioral analysis</h2>\n<p>Interesting insights can be drawn from how users are interacting with the protocol. First of all, the need for active management can be predominantly seen in Short Type 1 and Diversified Borrower segments, as well as the Recursive ETH LST (Chart 17), which by definition would need to continuously adjust to market conditions. We can also see that, on average, a high number of events are performed by wallets with lowest and highest health rate (Chart 18), while average health rates on average perform fewer actions. This can indicate that those in these categories must execute more actions to maintain their strategies. There is also a positive relation between how much users supply to the protocol and the number of actions they perform (Chart 19), meaning that the more someone supplies, the more likely they are to execute more actions.</p>\n<p>This distribution highlights a behavioral tendency towards active management in strategies perceived as higher risk, evidenced by the need for more events per month and a lower health rate associated with short positions and recursive ETH LST strategies. Particularly, a wallet in the “Other” category performed the highest amount of actions in a month (39).</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the segments.</p>\n\nChart 9: Supply Amount Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 10: Percentage Supply Amount Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 11: Wallet Count Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 12: Percentage Supply Amount Per Supply Amount Bucket <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 13: Wallet Count Per Supply Amount Bucket <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 14: Top 10 Large Wallet Supply Percentage Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 15: Borrow Per Health Rate <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 16: Debt-Weighted Health Rate Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 17: Events Per Month Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 18: Events Per Month Per Health Rate <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 19: Events Per Month vs Supply Amount <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-external-capital-analysis-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-3-external-capital-analysis-8\"></a>3. External Capital Analysis</h1>\n<p>The aim of this analysis is assessing how SparkLend users are behaving outside SparkLend, through an assessment on the external capital held and their cross-protocol usage. We define as external capital as the assets held outside the protocol that could be used to protect individual positions. External capital can either be passive (idle in the wallet) or active (used in other protocols). The data refers to a snapshot taken on 1 May.</p>\n<p>In total, SparkLend users are holding approximately $5.8B in other protocols (Chart 20), $1.35B of which is in Maker (~24% of total). Looking at other lending protocols, $135M is supplied on Compound v3 and 354M on Aave v3, (30% up from 1 March). Other important protocols used by SparkLend wallets are Lido, Stakefish, and Morpho Aave. Together, Morpho AAVE (v1 and v3) has a supply from SparkLend users of ~$635M across 33 wallets.</p>\n<p>By looking at the passive external capital per asset (Chart 21), we can see that users hold WBTC ($147M), GNO ($143M), WETH ($94M), and MKR ($84M) with sDAI raising its popularity from the previous analysis ($60M from $51M). There are 1063 wallets that hold ETH idle, as well as USDC (303 wallets), and DAI (330 wallets). The other stablecoins are falling behind DAI and USDC, with USDT ($16M, 168 wallets), USDe ($11M, 71 wallets) and sUSDe ($8M, 12 wallets). Next, we assess the passive external capital relative to debt (Chart 22) and we can see that 55.8% of users have enough passive external capital to cover 25% of their debt, while 10.1% have a buffer of more than 500%. In general, 27.5% of wallets have enough external capital to cover the total debt exposure.</p>\n<p>What would require more attention is the current passive external capital as percentage of debt (Chart 23), since 83.6% of total debt (up from 78.6% on 1 March) is covered by only 25% of capital held in wallets, which was previously 66.2% in December and 78.6% in March. In case of price drops or changing market conditions, this might have negative effects over the protocol’s health. On the other hand, 9.8% of total debt is fully collateralized by capital held in wallets (down from 18.8% on 1 March). Looking at the 50 largest wallets (Chart 24), we can see that on average they have less passive external capital compared to their debt positions, with only 12% of them having enough to cover their debt.</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the external dynamics.</p>\n\nChart 20: Wallets' Active External Capital Per Protocol <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 21: Wallets' Passive External Capital Per Asset <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 22: Wallets' Passive External Capital Over SparkLend Borrow (Percentage of Wallets) <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 23: Wallets' Passive External Capital Over SparkLend Borrow (Percentage of Debt) <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 24: Large Wallets' Passive External Capital vs Protocol Borrow <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-9\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The current analysis highlights a more conservative growth pattern for SparkLend during the observed period. While the protocol continues to attract user interaction, the decrease in total supplied and borrowed amounts across the cohorts suggests a cautious approach by users in response to market downturns and/or the protocol’s attractiveness. This shift is marked by a significant reduction in the engagement of new cohorts and a stronger retention within earlier cohorts, indicating a reliance on established users through less favorable market conditions.</p>\n<p>The segmentation analysis reveals that despite a broader market downturn, a significant portion of SparkLend users maintain bullish sentiment, particularly in long positions with substantial investments in ETH LST and Type 1 assets. At the same time, the significant drop in short positions reflects a withdrawal from riskier strategies, aligning with the overall conservative trend observed in the cohort analysis. This behavior suggests that while SparkLend users continue to use the protocol, there is a tangible shift towards safety in response to market volatility.</p>\n<p>In terms of external dynamics, the analysis highlights a robust interaction with other protocols, although there’s an increase in passive external capital relative to debt, which could pose a risk in adverse market shifts. This condition requires a more detailed monitoring of capital buffers to prevent potential liquidations, especially in a volatile market.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"future-work-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#future-work-10\"></a>Future Work</h1>\n<p>BA Labs plans to keep monitoring user metrics to ensure the protocol’s stability, by further providing quarterly analyses on the most important dynamics and suggestions on how to tackle potential issues. At the same time, we plan to automate this kind of analyses in order to get live data on user behavior to promptly respond to changing market conditions.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236","pubDate":"Tue, 07 May 2024 13:56:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24236"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236.rss","#text":"Sparklend User Metrics & Growth Analysis - Report #2"}},{"title":"Update for AVC Members Regarding Governance Proposal","dc:creator":"votewizard","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>Hello Maker community,</p>\n<p>I’d like to provide an update regarding the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-spxx-mip-amendment-subproposal/23971\">governance proposal</a> that may bring changes to the governance structure and impact the AVC members.

Growth of USDe supply has plateaued over the past few weeks as funding rates have remained depressed, with circulating supply now down roughly ~90 million from the peak. In addition to the direct impact of lower sUSDe yield from funding, this may have been driven by lower price of ENA, which factors into users’ expected returns from points farming. Slower growth of USDe may also have a reflexive impact reducing expected points yields, as the current sats program is scheduled to last for 5 months or until reaching 5 billion USDe supply, so slower growth implies the program will spread a fixed allocation of ENA across a longer time period (and therefore a lower expected ENA token per point conversion ratio).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/8/587e5e1b98813549e801cfb7a95dea78d3bfe1a9.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/cCQL2DU9y8OHZ116XBvAGyjLQbT.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/8/587e5e1b98813549e801cfb7a95dea78d3bfe1a9_2_624x223.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"cCQL2DU9y8OHZ116XBvAGyjLQbT\" width=\"624\" height=\"223\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/8/587e5e1b98813549e801cfb7a95dea78d3bfe1a9_2_624x223.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/8/587e5e1b98813549e801cfb7a95dea78d3bfe1a9.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/8/587e5e1b98813549e801cfb7a95dea78d3bfe1a9.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"070707\"></a></div><br>\n<a href=\"https://defillama.com/stablecoin/ethena-usde\">Defillama</a><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/c/0c2ef986720e341c9a412b32dca502a7aa2f8006.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1JMn5RoNXGjB8GBiClD3igswOHk.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/c/0c2ef986720e341c9a412b32dca502a7aa2f8006_2_624x392.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1JMn5RoNXGjB8GBiClD3igswOHk\" width=\"624\" height=\"392\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/c/0c2ef986720e341c9a412b32dca502a7aa2f8006_2_624x392.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/c/0c2ef986720e341c9a412b32dca502a7aa2f8006.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/c/0c2ef986720e341c9a412b32dca502a7aa2f8006.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F1FAF5\"></a></div><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethena\">Coingecko ENA</a><p></p>\n<p>Ethena Labs CEO Guy offered some commentary on recent market events in a <a href=\"https://x.com/leptokurtic_/status/1780218968789209216\">twitter thread</a>, which may be useful for additional context.</p>\n<p>Ethena also implemented signed custodian attestations of custody balances, which substantially improves transparency and assurance for USDe reserves.

However, with the recent increase in transparency on custody holdings we recommend to reduce the proportional rate targets somewhat, lowering the base spread vs DSR from 120% to 100%, and slope from 7% per 100 million DAI exposure to 5%. Along with the recent reduction in DSR from 13% to 10%, this yields the new allocation benchmark target profile below.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/c/fc638d4990049c7827668c2da1990f755358df0e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/A0JBUH6viyuhcUljjE9lmIBiVki.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/c/fc638d4990049c7827668c2da1990f755358df0e_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"A0JBUH6viyuhcUljjE9lmIBiVki\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/c/fc638d4990049c7827668c2da1990f755358df0e_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/c/fc638d4990049c7827668c2da1990f755358df0e_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/c/fc638d4990049c7827668c2da1990f755358df0e.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F8F7\"></a></div><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16wakVCF7uBkaXp6VkqF_AIsSMyJ-iiakrvjIa81OtSE/edit?usp=sharing\">USDe Morpho Benchmarks and Reallocation Workbook</a><p></p>\n<p>The current average borrow rate of 21.39% is below target, but still above the 18.4% minimum threshold for 300 million DAI exposure that would support a reduction in exposure.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"susde-pools-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#susde-pools-4\"></a>sUSDe Pools</h4>\n<p>sUSDe collateral has been showing consistently lower returns versus USDe collateral pools. Considering that USDe earns 20 sats per day while sUSDe only earns 5 sats per day, users are likely to have higher willingness to pay for leveraging USDe collateral, particularly in times when the sUSDe cash yield is low. With Pendle fixed yield tokens indicating over 30% yield on USDe through July while sUSDe funding rates trend around 5% (plus yield of ~7-10%+ from sats program with Pendle implied pricing), this trend may continue unless funding rates rise substantially or user expected points yields decline.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/c/bca760cf6da38c73681bc03c95b37e83af0af375.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"qUUmYeJG71xsc9Hjfz0a2zv2L2Z\" width=\"535\" height=\"278\" role=\"presentation\"><br>\n<a href=\"https://app.pendle.finance/earn/fixed-yield/0x42862f48eade25661558afe0a630b132038553d0/markets/0x19588f29f9402bb508007feadd415c875ee3f19f/deposit?chain=ethereum\">Pendle USDe PT</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/c/9cfbdc825082f7f514ff82156fbaa90aa11afb91.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"moK5Wx7hSeDQMUr7r6kAZs3E3EB\" width=\"489\" height=\"358\" role=\"presentation\"><br>\n<a href=\"https://app.ethena.fi/dashboards/yields\">Ethena sUSDe Cash Yield</a></p>\n<p>The implication from this is that it will likely be more valuable to reallocate funds from sUSDe pools to USDe pools, to achieve higher returns while maintaining equal or lower risk.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-77-lltv-pools-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-77-lltv-pools-5\"></a>77% LLTV Pools</h4>\n<p>The 77% LLTV pools have consistently lagged returns offered by other pools. While they also bear lower risk, the overall risk vs return has not been favorable for the past few weeks. Given users’ clear preference for higher leverage pools, and consistent underperformance of 77% LLTV pools, we believe they no longer make sense to receive significant allocations from the Spark DAI vault.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-945-lltv-pools-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-945-lltv-pools-6\"></a>94.5% LLTV Pools</h4>\n<p>94.5% pools have often delivered returns below comparable 91.5% or 86% LLTVs. The most likely cause here is due to these pools’ smaller size, which makes it relatively less efficient for users to manage their positions or rebalance across pools to optimize borrowing costs. Users may be effectively discounting the borrow rate due to this increased operational overhead and risk of rate volatility.</p>\n<p>Maker is somewhat constrained in the ability to deploy more funds to these high leverage pools due to risk concerns. Given that the pools have limited excess return on average, and it is not recommended to increase exposure any further (which could help improve pool efficiency and performance), we believe the 94.5% LLTV pools present a suboptimal risk vs reward tradeoff and the Spark DAI vault’s allocation to these pools should be significantly reduced.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"updated-vault-allocation-framework-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#updated-vault-allocation-framework-7\"></a>Updated Vault Allocation Framework</h3>\n<p>We recommend substantially reducing allocations to 77% and 94.5% LLTV pools given the performance concerns noted above. The Spark DAI vault should leave de-minimis allocation of funds just to keep these pools in a semi-active state in case allocation to the pools becomes strategically important in the future. For example, if Ethena exposure grows it may make sense to re-enable the 77% pools to manage risk, or if Ethena’s risk profile improves materially the 94.5% pools could be suitable to receive a large enough allocation to achieve market efficiency.</p>\n<p>In addition to the previously described vault allocation benchmark scheme, which is concerned with total funds deployed to the Spark DAI vault via the DDM, we propose an additional benchmarking framework to align asset allocation between the four remaining pools with active support: USDe and sUSDe pools at 86% and 91.5% LLTV.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"intra-vault-pool-benchmarking-framework-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#intra-vault-pool-benchmarking-framework-8\"></a>Intra-vault Pool Benchmarking Framework</h4>\n<p>Funds should be allocated between pools to optimize risk adjusted borrow rates per pool. This will account for differences in pool LLTV as well as the risk and liquidity profiles of USDe vs sUSDe. The reallocation process will be subject to rate limits, to avoid causing excessive impact on borrower UX or destabilizing interest rate models. Each pool will also be subject to minimum balance thresholds to maintain adequate size for market efficiency.</p>\n<p>To calculate the adjusted borrow rate used for allocation, first we take the lower of each pool’s optimal borrow rate or current borrow rate. Then, we divide the resulting rate by the pool’s LLTV. Finally, we divide the rate for sUSDe pools by one plus the percent of total vault assets allocated to sUSDe raised to the power of two. A formula expression of this is shown below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>adjusted borrow rate = min(optimal borrow rate, current borrow rate) * if(sUSDe collateral pool, 1 + (percent of vault allocated to sUSDe)^2, 1) / pool LLTV</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Funds should be reallocated towards the active pool with the highest adjusted borrow rate. Reallocations will be drawn from inactive pools and active pools with lower adjusted borrow rates. For inactive pools, the amount withdrawn per reallocation action should be selected to result in a utilization of 93%. For active pools, the amount withdrawn per reallocation should be the lowest of: (1) 10% of total assets supplied to the pool, (2) an amount resulting in pool utilization of 90%, or (3) an amount where there is no longer any other active pool with a higher adjusted return.</p>\n<p>Finally, reallocations are subject to minimum pool balances, and if a pool is at or below the relevant minimum balance threshold no further reallocation withdrawals should be processed from that pool. We recommend a minimum target balance of 10 million DAI per pool for active pools, and a minimum target balance of 1 million DAI for inactive pools.</p>\n<p>These benchmarks have been incorporated into the following reallocation worksheet, which should help simplify the process of calculating amounts to be reallocated. Specific reallocation actions are expected to be triggered on a roughly weekly basis, with amounts to reallocate reconciled by BA Labs according to the above framework and then implemented by the allocator multisig. Actions may be more or less frequent in practice depending on market conditions and borrower behavior. An example reallocation action using pool data from 3 May is shown below.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/3/a3f258acdd7e5e608b478d3ae23e1b507716eca2.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nol3fwa5ykjbusA7L6NG4b8UkF4.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/3/a3f258acdd7e5e608b478d3ae23e1b507716eca2_2_624x268.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"nol3fwa5ykjbusA7L6NG4b8UkF4\" width=\"624\" height=\"268\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/3/a3f258acdd7e5e608b478d3ae23e1b507716eca2_2_624x268.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/3/a3f258acdd7e5e608b478d3ae23e1b507716eca2.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/3/a3f258acdd7e5e608b478d3ae23e1b507716eca2.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EAE6E6\"></a></div><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16wakVCF7uBkaXp6VkqF_AIsSMyJ-iiakrvjIa81OtSE/edit?usp=sharing\">USDe Morpho Benchmarks and Reallocation Workbook</a><p></p>\n<p>Over time, reallocating between pools should help achieve a better risk adjusted return, and may potentially allow the vault to achieve the upper bound thresholds needed to support further increases in capital allocation beyond 300 million DAI.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#next-steps-9\"></a>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>We plan to begin using this framework for reallocation actions beginning next week.

They are facing significant legal costs on a monthly basis and are running out of resources to defend themselves.

Their 2024 trials are setting important precedents for developers, privacy protocols, and the crypto industry more broadly. Alexey’s first trial took place on March 26 of this year (with verdict and further potential legal action scheduled for mid-May), and Roman’s trial is scheduled for late September.</p>\n<p>The government’s attempt to criminalize Roman and Alexey for a third party’s misuse of open-source software is unjust and unlawful.

Justice DAO is advocating on their behalf and helping to raise funds for their legal defense. However, time and money are running out and we need support from influential protocols and organizations within the Ethereum ecosystem.

The Launch Project has been very successful in supporting the contributors related to the products coming in Launch Season, while handling the rebrand process and helping to get early stage tests of longer term projects off the ground. In this sense, the Launch Project’s mission, set out by Governance, is almost accomplished. It will wind down to open up a new chapter for Maker, subject to Governance approval.</p>\n<p>Once Launch Season is over, it is time for Governance to replace the Launch Project with a decentralized and transparent solution for the medium term, which can scale up all of the initial SubDAOs efficiently in parallel, while also handling large scale investments into the long term Endgame Projects, including Atlas Governance, AI tools and NewChain.</p>\n<p>In the short term I will propose one last increase in the Launch Project total budget to ensure it has a wide margin of funding available during the critical summer and fall months of the Launch Season, as it would otherwise likely run out of funds at the most critical part of the launch.</p>\n<p>Once Launch Season is complete the Launch Project must begin the wind-down process, handing over its support workstreams to successor Atlas processes that are similar to the current Governance Security project process (PRO11).Transparency will be the key focus of the new processes. Each new workstream budget should cover a delimited and well-defined portion of the responsibilities the Launch Project currently takes care of.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/preparing-to-decentralize-the-launch-project-after-launch-season/24193\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/preparing-to-decentralize-the-launch-project-after-launch-season/24193","pubDate":"Tue, 30 Apr 2024 18:23:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24193"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/preparing-to-decentralize-the-launch-project-after-launch-season/24193.rss","#text":"Preparing to decentralize the Launch Project after Launch Season"}},{"title":"What type of data does makerDAO analyze","dc:creator":"cryptoShreekar","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Hey guys, just trying to learn onchain analysis and dune, so was just curious as to what type of metrics makerDAO analyzes.

This integration will allow developers building on other LayerZero-supported chains to seamlessly connect to and build on Sei V2.</em></p>\n<p>Interested? <img src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/images/emoji/twitter/point_down.png?v=12\" title=\":point_down:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":point_down:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> I’ve compiled what’s important to know about Sei below <img src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/images/emoji/twitter/point_down.png?v=12\" title=\":point_down:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":point_down:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">:</p>\n<p><strong>What is SEI Network?</strong></p>\n<p>Sei, a Layer-1 blockchain, aims to be the fastest network for exchanging digital assets. It features novel technological features built into its blockchain. Namely, Twin-Turbo Consensus and transaction parallelization, which increase transaction efficiency and throughput. Since launching its mainnet in August 2023, Sei has seen an ecosystem of native projects launch and a community emerge. To maintain momentum, Sei must successfully deploy the features planned for the Sei V2 upgrade. EVM compatibility could unlock new opportunities by expanding Sei’s developer ecosystem and enabling established EVM protocols to deploy on Sei. Optimistic transaction parallelization will ease the developer experience, while SeiDB improves the network’s performance across the board. Post-V2, sights can be set on the Parallel Stack. The stack could enable further growth in Sei’s ecosystem and validator usage as Layer-2 EVM rollups are launched by developers seeking an improved user experience and novel design space. All these planned features could lead to more activity on the network as it continues to mature and differentiate itself from other competing Layer-1 networks.</p>\n<p><strong>Optimistic Parallelization.</strong></p>\n<p>To further elaborate on the execution environment, we must highlight Sei’s rollout of optimistic parallelization. By enabling transactions to be processed in parallel rather than sequentially, Sei v2 enables significantly increased throughput and reduced transactions fees. This architecture diverges from traditional, sequential blockchain processing seen traditionally with the EVM, where transactions are confirmed one after another, leading to potential bottlenecks as the network’s usage grows. Sequential transactions therefore present anti-network effects–parallelization alleviates such growing pains.</p>\n<p><em>Key Numbers</em>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork/status/1770159112866963540?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork/status/1770159112866963540?s=20</a></p>\n<p>Sei v2 utilizes optimistic parallelization, where transactions are processed in parallel under the assumption that they will not conflict or interfere with each other’s state changes. This approach optimistically assumes that concurrent transactions can access and modify the blockchain state without creating inconsistencies. If conflict arises, then sequential re-execution of the transactions is needed. Deterministic execution requires developers to assign the parts of state that can be accessed, but these assignments require more developer overhead.</p>\n<p><em>To learn more about it</em>: <a href=\"https://forum.sei.io/t/optimistic-concurrency-control/28?ref=blog.sei.io\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimistic Concurrency Control - Standards and RFCs - Sei Developer Forum</a></p>\n<p><strong>What is SeiDB?</strong></p>\n<p>More transactions also means more problems, specifically around state management. If a blockchain cannot effectively manage high throughput at the state/storage level, it encounters another bottleneck. This undermines the advantages initially gained from employing a parallel execution environment.</p>\n<p>That’s where SeiDB comes in.</p>\n<p>Sei Labs has redesigned their database for high-performance storage, making sure that information is organized, stored, and accessed efficiently.</p>\n<p>Operationally, efficiency and performance is achieved by separating state store (SS) and state commit (SC). This bifurcation is designed to optimize Sei for two requirements: handling vast historical data and processing new transactions efficiently.</p>\n<p>SS pertains to historical data. By organizing data as raw key values while minimizing unnecessary metadata, SeiDB ensures that historical records–encompassing transactions, state changes, and other relevant data–are stored in a compact and accessible manner. This makes it easier to conduct auditing, transaction verification, and node synchronization. Such storage efficiency helps mitigate potential issues related to state bloat, ensuring that Sei remains scalable and efficient as it grows, not falling subject to diminishing performance from scale.</p>\n<p>SC deals with the processing and validating of new transactions by performing state changes in-memory and streamlining access to the most recent state information. This way, SeiDB reduces the need for intensive Input/Output operations, enabling faster transaction validation and commitment.</p>\n<p>The above architecture positions Sei in a place to aptly deal with high-volume applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>The heightened activity in the prior bull market exposed some limitations in blockchain technology as networks experienced high gas fees and slow transaction speeds. However, in the recent bear market, Sei emerged with technological innovations that hoped to address these limitations. Sei Labs created a Layer-1 network with the goal of becoming the fastest network for exchanging digital assets. Sei’s built-in blockchain technologies, such as Twin-Turbo Consensus and transaction parallelization, enable reduced transaction latency and increased transaction throughput.</p>\n<p>Sei v2’s efficient design is meant to introduce an influx of applications that have not been previously possible due to the limited EVM design space. SVM and MoveVM chains will act as the direct architectural competitors to Sei going forward since they’ve been able to introduce unique applications like onchain order books. More parallelized EVMs will invariably be introduced in the coming months as well. Solana also has a parallelized EVM L2 called Neon, which has so far gained very little traction. This puts Sei in a strong position because it, ideally, enables high-throughput applications while simultaneously bringing forward a familiar developer environment.</p>\n<p><strong>SEI V2 (EVM Compatible) is set to go live on mainnet before the end of this Q2. (Before the end of June). And Sei V2 Code is COMPLETE! We are closer than ever to the V2 update!</strong></p>\n<p>Dear Maker Community!

The main goal of this work is to provide useful data and input that can help safely navigate the Maker Protocol during the period in which SFs, the DSR, and the Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY are subject to out-of-scope decision making processes under article 3.3.</p>\n<p>For example, on March 20, we posted <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-8-accelerated-proposal/23909\">Impact Analysis: March 8 Accelerated Proposal</a>. Based on the findings of this analysis, <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-11-under-sta-article-3-3/23910\">we proposed</a> an overall decrease of SFs, the DSR, and the Spark Effective DAI Borrow Rate by 2 percentage points.</p>\n<p>Article 3.3 in the Stability Scope states that once market risks have subsided, the Dai Savings Rate and Base Rate should be reverted to their ordinary values. However, since March 8, wider market changes, as well as changes to internal Maker governance procedures and Scope related language, have resulted in previous Stability Scope parameters becoming relatively outdated. Before returning to a more normal Stability Scope procedure for determining rates, we believe that MakerDAO first needs to define and implement new ways to adapt to increased market volatility in order to minimize the risk of additional Out-of-Schedule Executive Votes.</p>\n<p>We are currently working on updating the rate system language in the Stability Scope, including a new iteration of the Exposure Model. Our objective is to make sure that the system as a whole will be able to adjust rates more gradually and effectively in the future. However, this will require some more research and development time.</p>\n<p>Until the new rate system language has been ratified by Maker governance, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> will continue to provide regular updates on Maker Protocol dynamics and provide parameter change proposals if we believe that any additional changes need to be made.</p>\n<p>With this post, we aim to review competitive rates in DeFi as well as the resulting protocol dynamics following the most recent parameter change proposal from March 20, 2024.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"impact-analysis-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#impact-analysis-2\"></a>Impact Analysis</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"exposure-over-time-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#exposure-over-time-3\"></a>Exposure Over Time</h2>\n<p>The chart below shows the change in DAI supply from March 20 (time of most recent parameter change proposal) to April 18 (time of writing).

On the other hand, both Maker Core Vaults and the Spark DAI Market have experienced negative flows, bringing crypto collateral exposure down to ~43.37%.</p>\n<p>As it relates to Ethena exposure benchmarks, in the current market environment, it seems as if the weighted average borrow rate of the Morpho Spark DAI Market will not exceed the “max borrow rate” of 38.07% in the near future. In fact, at the time of the analysis, the weighted average borrow rate is slightly below the “min borrow rate”, which should justify an exposure reduction if we do not see any changes soon. Note, however, that since this framework is relatively new, we expect to make iterative changes to the target rate benchmark formula over time, and as such, these requirements may change. Nevertheless, based on the broad heuristics of the new Allocation Benchmark, we can conclude that additional Morpho Spark DAI Vault allocations may not happen within the shorter term.</p>\n<p>To incentivise inflows to Maker Core Vaults and the Spark DAI market, an additional reduction in Stability Fees (SFs) and the Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY may at this point in time be justifiable. From a liquidity perspective, and considering that is unlikely that Ethena exposure will increase in the near future, lowering rates at this point in time seems more sustainable.</p>\n<p>Despite the most recent DSR rate reduction, we have seen DSR utilization increase over time. At the time of the analysis, DAI in the DSR measured ~1.68 billion, with a DSR utilization rate of 33.59%. If Maker governance decides to lower SFs and the Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY, it may therefore be prudent to also lower the DSR.</p>\n<p>Finally, comparing Maker rates with competitors in the DeFi Ecosystem, it is clear that Maker is currently more expensive, which can be seen as another relevant reason for an additional rate reduction.</p>\n<p>Based on the findings of this analysis, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> will soon propose parameter changes in accordance with article 3.3 in the Stability Scope. In a separate forum post, we will propose a decrease in the Stability Fees, Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY, and the DSR.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-20-parameter-change-proposal/24131\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-20-parameter-change-proposal/24131","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Apr 2024 12:16:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24131"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-20-parameter-change-proposal/24131.rss","#text":"Impact Analysis: March 20 Parameter Change Proposal"}},{"title":"Atlas Axis Update | Monday April 22 - 8 pm CET (6pm UTC)","dc:creator":"Le_Bateleur","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p><strong>Zoom link</strong>: <a href=\"https://zoom.us/j/93540012501?pwd=Y21rK0syZnF2RUJFaVZtMWVBaWdKQT09\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Launch Meeting - Zoom</a></p>\n<p>Hello everyone! <img src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/images/emoji/twitter/wave.png?v=12\" title=\":wave:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wave:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>It’s been a while since our last workshop!

The main goal is to replace AVCs with new and more focused community roles with the Atlas Working Group and new Spark community governance committees.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-future-of-avcs-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#the-future-of-avcs-1\"></a>The future of AVCs</h1>\n<p>Aligned Voter Committees (AVC) were an interesting experiment that has been ongoing for a year at this point. The AVCs successfully proved it was possible to use small-scale incentives of MKR tokens to draw active community members into deep governance involvement. Now that the community has progressed closer to Launch Season, and there is increasingly a need for more practical and flexible execution of Endgame concepts, the AVCs are starting to be less effective in producing useful results that help move the project forward.</p>\n<p>I believe a major reason is that the concept was based on AVCs getting significant amounts of support and having functional AI governance tools available to them. In practice it has not been possible yet to provide this level of support.</p>\n<p>The most important results from AVCs have already been delivered. Ultimately, we can consider the initiative a success, and then use what we learned from it to create new replacement structures that synergize better with Launch Season.</p>\n<p>An evolution of the concept of should be reintroduced in the future when it is possible to provide the necessary level of support to fully realize the vision of comprehensive and knowledgeable community oversight by non-expert volunteer participants. More on this at the end of this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"atlas-community-committee-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#atlas-community-committee-2\"></a>Atlas Community Committee</h1>\n<p>The first replacement to the AVC is the Atlas Community Contributors, which will be based on the successful effort that is now being led by Atlas Axis and a small group of delegates to build out the Atlas v2. The Atlas Community Contributors will be a way for current AVC members, or new community contributors, to get compensated for delivering useful work that supports the work being done by the Atlas v2 effort on a part time basis.</p>\n<p>Depending on the availability of appropriate candidates, the Community workstream may be composed of different groups (ie, Drafters, Reviewers and Researchers), each with different levels of compensation commensurate with the required skill level. Atlas Axis will provide specifics concerning the Atlas Community workstream at a later time.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"spark-community-marketing-committee-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spark-community-marketing-committee-3\"></a>Spark Community Marketing Committee</h1>\n<p>The Spark Community Marketing Committee will be a group of community members that will control a budget of SPK tokens, and use it for interesting community marketing initiatives that have support in the broader spark community. There will be checks and balances on how the funds are spent to ensure they actually have a reasonable chance at creating meaningful adoption of Spark products, and the committee will be encouraged to use polls to get SPK holder sentiment for what initiatives will work best or be in line with the values of Spark.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"spark-community-purpose-committee-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spark-community-purpose-committee-4\"></a>Spark Community Purpose Committee</h1>\n<p>A key pillar of SubDAOs like Spark is that they’re incentivized to develop a tangible purpose rooted in fundamental human values that helps make their brand, their values and their community real and deep, beyond just a simple business where everyone is in it for the money.</p>\n<p>This purpose can be charitable causes, scientific research, open source AI development, etc. Whatever it is, it must be public goods that externalize their benefits, and the purpose must genuinely reflect the values of the SubDAO community.</p>\n<p>The Spark Community Purpose Committee will be a group of community members that have control over a small budget of SPK tokens to experiment with tangible ways to develop a public-good purpose. The Committee’s work will involve learning how the purpose interacts with the SubDAOs community spirit, and the SubDAOs governance and workforce performance.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"new-forms-of-long-term-community-oversight-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#new-forms-of-long-term-community-oversight-5\"></a>New forms of long-term community oversight</h1>\n<p>Once we get to the end of Endgame phase 2 - the moment when all of the initial six SubDAOs have been launched - the plan is to develop a new version of the Atlas, built from scratch from the ground up to be the basis for the immutable long term governance of Endgame Maker.</p>\n<p>This will also be the opportunity to build AI capabilities and AI assistant tools into the core of how the Atlas works, which makes it the right time to once again look into how we can effectively build up a community oversight function similar to, or inspired by, the AVCs - but this time with the level of support, resources and tools that they need to fully carry out their function in governance.</p>\n            <p><small>11 posts - 9 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-future-of-avcs-atlas-and-spark-community-committees/24112\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-future-of-avcs-atlas-and-spark-community-committees/24112","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 11:26:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24112"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-future-of-avcs-atlas-and-spark-community-committees/24112.rss","#text":"The future of AVCs, Atlas and Spark community committees"}}]}}}
