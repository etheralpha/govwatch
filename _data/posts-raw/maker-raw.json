Product Information</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product:</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Investment Strategy</strong></em><br>\nUSTB offers Qualified Purchasers access to short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills. USTB’s investment objective is to seek current income as is consistent with liquidity and stability of principal, targeting returns in line with the federal funds rate.</p>\n<p>The Fund is sub-advised by <a href=\"https://www.federatedhermes.com/us/campaigns/site.do\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Federated Hermes</a>, an ~$800B AUM asset manager. The majority of the assets they manage are deployed in Money Market strategies. <a href=\"https://www.federatedhermes.com/us/about/people/susan-hill.do\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Susan Hill, CFA</a> is the Portfolio Manager responsible for executing the Fund’s mandate. She brings decades of investing experience managing assets for institutions and is specifically responsible for overseeing ~$300B in fixed-income assets.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Legal Structure</strong></em><br>\nUSTB is a separate series of Superstate Asset Trust (a Delaware Statutory Trust). USTB is a private fund pursuant to Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. USTB is only available to a limited subset of potential investors that meet the criteria outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum. Investors must undergo AML, KYC, and sanctions compliance checks.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fund Mechanics</strong></em><br>\nInvestors may purchase Shares of USTB via USDC or USD (“cash”) which may be issued in the form of ERC-20 tokens. This tokenized ownership is composable and transferable where one Share is represented by one USTB token on Ethereum. Transferring the USTB token effectively transfers ownership of the underlying share of the Fund. Investors who complete onboarding may identify Ethereum addresses to an AllowList, a smart contract managed by Superstate Inc. that approves KYC’d entities to interact with USTB tokens.</p>\n<p>Daily NAV/S (also available <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x289B5036cd942e619E1Ee48670F98d214E745AAC\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">onchain via Chainlink</a>), transparent holdings, yield, and more are available via the Investor Portal or by visiting: <a href=\"https://superstate.co/ustb\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Superstate - USTB Fund</a></p>\n<p><em><strong>Service Providers Overview</strong></em><br>\nUSTB’s U.S. Treasury Bills are held in custody in a segregated custodial account at an OCC-charted financial institution, <a href=\"https://www.umb.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UMB Bank</a> in the name of USTB.</p>\n<p>USTB is audited annually by Ernst &amp; Young LLP (“EY”), ensuring the accuracy of accounting for investors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navconsulting.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">NAV Fund Services</a> calculates the Fund’s NAV/S daily based on holdings and activity, providing rapid data delivery to Superstate through their API.

Describe the underlying asset:</strong></p>\n<p>USTB’s investment mandate ensures at least 95% of the portfolio is invested in short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills. Up to 5% of the portfolio at any time can be held in cash to facilitate liquidity; however, given the highly liquid nature of the portfolio, cash positions are kept at a minimum at all times. Additionally, USTB’s mandate is to maintain an average portfolio duration of one year or less.</p>\n<p>See below for a table of current holdings sorted by Maturity Date (also on the <a href=\"https://superstate.co/ustb#holdings\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USTB page here</a>).

How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>USTB shares may be issued as a yield-bearing ERC-20 token, USTB token, or as Book Entry shares. Each USTB token is one share in USTB, and the number of shares issued (USTB tokens minted) is equal to the Purchase Amount ($) divided by the Net Asset Value per share (NAV/S) on a given Market Day. Market Days are when both the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are open.</p>\n<p>USTB token has 6 decimal places, with 1.000000 (1e6 on Ethereum) representing one unit of USTB. The NAV/S started at $10 and increases daily due to the Fund’s investments accruing interest. NAV/S is calculated by a reputable third party, NAV Fund Services, by dividing the total Assets Under Management (AUM) by the total number of shares in the Fund. This calculation occurs once per market day and reflects the price per share of USTB based on its underlying asset prices.</p>\n<p>Investors redeeming USTB may elect to receive USDC or USD equivalent to the number of shares/tokens times the NAV/S on a given Market Day. USTB functions similarly to Lido’s wstETH, where your token balance remains static unless you mint, burn, or transfer. The NAV/S increases over time, allowing investors to redeem a share of USTB for an increasing amount of U.S. Dollars or USDC.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the yield and token mechanics, <a href=\"https://docs.superstate.co/ustb/income-fees-and-yield\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></p>\n<p>Qualified purchasers seeking to invest must first complete a standard KYC/AML onboarding process administered by a proprietary Investor Portal developed by Superstate Inc. Upon successful onboarding, investors’ Ethereum addresses are added to an AllowList smart contract. The AllowList ensures that only approved addresses can mint, transfer, or receive USTB. This AllowList is administered by a Fireblocks MPC, requiring m of n signatures to add or remove addresses. View the onchain AllowList contract <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x42d75C8FdBBF046DF0Fe1Ff388DA16fF99dE8149\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here.<br>\n</a><br>\nUSTB is freely transferable between shareholders’ Ethereum addresses on the AllowList using transfer or transferFrom functions. Each function checks that the sender and receiver are both on the AllowList and authorized for that specific token. If either address is not on the AllowList, the transaction will fail. In addition to facilitating peer-to-peer secondary market transactions from wallet to wallet, future DeFi integrations will facilitate lending and borrowing or swaps subject to AllowList constraints and enable more onchain USTB utility.</p>\n<p><strong>12.

What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary Liquidity</strong><br>\nUSTB offers daily liquidity each Market Day and we process purchases/redemptions at 9:00 AM ET. Market Days are when both the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are open.</p>\n<p><strong>Purchases</strong><br>\nInvestors can purchase USTB by either transferring USDC to a client-specific USTB Purchase Address (which is a Circle deposit address) or by initiating a bank wire to USTB’s custodian with a unique memo attributing the purchase to the investor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If funds are received before 9:00 AM ET on a Market Day, the investor will receive USTB at the prior Market Day’s closing NAV/Share, minted shortly after 9:00 AM ET.</li>\n<li>If funds are received after 9:00 AM ET, the investor will receive USTB at the next available NAV/Share, shortly after 9:00 AM ET on the next Market Day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Purchases are viewable in the Investor Portal, and you will receive confirmation emails when a purchase has been initiated and completed. Gas fees to transfer USDC or bank fees to wire U.S. Dollars for purchases are the responsibility of the investor.</p>\n<p><strong>Redemptions</strong><br>\nInvestors can redeem from USTB by either transferring USTB to the token contract or by calling the <code>burn()</code> function on the token.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a redemption request is received before 9:00 AM ET on a Market Day, tokens/shares will be redeemed at that Market Day’s closing NAV/Share. The investor will receive USDC or USD on the same day (T+0).\n<ul>\n<li>For redemptions before the cutoff time (9:00 AM ET), we instruct Federated Hermes, USTB’s sub-advisor, at 9:00 AM ET to sell securities, aiming to settle by 1:00 PM ET.</li>\n<li>This allows UMB Bank to wire USD back to Circle, returning USDC to Spark the same day (T+0).</li>\n<li>We anticipate this will occur the majority of the time, given the assets in the Fund.</li>\n<li>If U.S. Treasury Bills don’t settle before the wire cut-off, USDC will be returned the following Market Day.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If a redemption request is received after 9:00 AM ET on a Market Day, tokens/shares will be redeemed at the next Market Day’s closing NAV/Share.

Gas fees to transfer USTB to the token contract address are the responsibility of the investor.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s PPM and Investment Agreement allow up to T+2 for redemptions as a conservative buffer. However, since inception, over $150M in gross redemptions have been processed, with each one settled to clients either within T+0 or T+1 with no interruptions in our ability to process redemptions.</p>\n<p><strong>14. Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>As a convenience to shareholders, purchases and redemptions may be made with USDC or fiat (USD), resulting in two unique, but similar, flows of funds.</p>\n<p>All subsequent responses will focus solely on USDC, as the Sky Ecosystem does not intend to engage with fiat rails.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98628-usdc-flow-of-funds-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98628-usdc-flow-of-funds-4\"></a>USDC Flow of Funds</h4>\n<p><em><strong>AllowList</strong></em><br>\nSpark will undergo Superstate’s KYC/AML onboarding process and once approved may add Ethereum addresses to the AllowList, identifying one address as the Primary AllowList Address where all USTB tokens will be minted. AllowList addresses can be changed at any time via the Superstate Investor Portal.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Purchases</strong></em><br>\nTo initiate a purchase of USTB, Spark will transfer USDC to their USTB Purchase Address, which is a unique Circle deposit address provided after successful onboarding and available in the Superstate Investor Portal at all times.</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of USDC, Circle Financial converts USDC to USD (“cash”) and sends it to the Custodian, UMB Bank. Once the cash has settled, Federated Hermes is instructed to deploy capital per the mandate.</p>\n<p>Tokens are minted shortly after 9:00 AM ET every day, so depending on when purchases are made it will either be T+0 or T+1. Each token is a 1:1 representation of the number of shares resulting from a purchase.</p>\n<p>The quantity of shares issued/tokens minted is calculated by dividing the dollar value of USDC (or cash) by the Market Day’s NAV. Superstate pays gas fees for minting USTB tokens to Spark’s Primary AllowList Address.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Redemptions</strong></em><br>\nRedemptions can be initiated one of two ways: 1) call the token’s <code>burn()</code> function or 2) transfer the tokens to the USTB Contract Address: 0x43415eB6ff9DB7E26A15b704e7A3eDCe97d31C4e. Instructions for redeeming shares from the USTB are available in the Superstate Investor Portal at all times.</p>\n<p>Upon the receipt of a redemption request, Superstate Inc. instructs Federated Hermes to sell U.S. Treasury Bills. The proceeds of this sale are settled in cash at UMB Bank, which then wires to Circle. Circle mints the corresponding amount of USDC and automatically sends it back to the USDC Proceeds Address designated and controlled by the DAO. The USDC Proceeds Address can be updated in the Investor Portal at any time.</p>\n<p>Gas fees to burn or transfer USTB are paid by Spark.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/3/b3f5696c4b8cd770550ba6569891255281f5a01d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pFZg5QvZZDKfNNZQWR5BOqeTbkN.png?dl=1\" title=\"|625.0666666666666x391\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/3/b3f5696c4b8cd770550ba6569891255281f5a01d_2_690x431.png\" alt=\"|625.0666666666666x391\" data-base62-sha1=\"pFZg5QvZZDKfNNZQWR5BOqeTbkN\" width=\"690\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/3/b3f5696c4b8cd770550ba6569891255281f5a01d_2_690x431.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/3/b3f5696c4b8cd770550ba6569891255281f5a01d_2_1035x646.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/3/b3f5696c4b8cd770550ba6569891255281f5a01d_2_1380x862.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDF0EF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>15.

Legal Structure</h2>\n<p><strong>1.  Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong><br>\nUSTB is a private fund pursuant to Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. USTB is organized as a Series in a Delaware Statutory Trust (DSTA) and is available to qualified purchasers who meet the criteria outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum. Potential investors must undergo AML, KYC, and sanctions compliance review. The Fund is currently available to Qualified Purchasers in the United States, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and Bermuda as well as jurisdictions that permit reverse inquiry by qualifying investors. Superstate continues to expand access to the USTB in additional jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>Superstate Inc. is a Delaware corporation. Superstate Inc. is currently an Exempt Reporting Adviser (“ERA”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in reliance on the private fund adviser exemption under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Information about Superstate Inc. can be found by visiting the SEC website <a href=\"http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">www.adviserinfo.sec.gov</a> and searching for our firm name.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>USTB is exempt from SEC registration by operating consistent with Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act and is only available to qualified purchasers who meet certain criteria as outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum. USTB is offered pursuant to 506(c) exemption of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 and has filed Form D available <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2004367/000200436724000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here.</a></p>\n<p>Superstate Inc. as an ERA is subject to inspection and examination by the SEC.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, and exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>USTB is exempt from registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a private fund per Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act and is only available to qualified purchasers who meet certain criteria as outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum. The Fund is offered pursuant to 506(c) exemption of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 and has filed Form D available <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2004367/000200436724000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here.</a></p>\n<p>USTB is designated by the Bermudian Monetary Authority (“BMA”) as an Overseas fund pursuant to Section 5A of the Investment Funds Act 2006.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>USTB is bankruptcy-remote from Superstate Inc. and is organized as a separate Series of Superstate Asset Trust, a Delaware Statutory Trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (“DSTA”).</p>\n<p>Superstate Asset Trust structure affords each Superstate Fund (USTB and USCC) with limitation on inter-series liability. Each Superstate Fund is established as an independent and separate Series from each other that is bankruptcy remote. This structure ensures that shareholders’ investments are both separate from Superstate Inc.'s balance sheet and are siloed from each other.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong><br>\nInvestors in USTB are the owners of USTB and are granted shareholder rights as detailed in the Fund’s offering materials (shared with <a href=\"mailto:GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial\">GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial</a>, over email on 08/28/2024). Each shareholder benefits from the inter-series limitation of liability provided by the DSTA, meaning they are siloed from liabilities arising from other series issued by Superstate Asset Trust.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or Sky</strong><br>\n<strong>USTB’s Investment Manager is a fiduciary to USTB and therefore is required to act in its best interests.</strong></p>\n<p>Steakhouse Financial is a member of the <a href=\"https://superstate.co/blog/superstate-industry-council-welcomes-second-cohort\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Superstate Industry Council</a>, collaborating with Superstate and other members to help increase the adoption of tokenized assets across the ecosystem. Their participation in the SIC is non-compensatory and they provide objective feedback to help the entire space grow, not just Superstate’s products/roadmap.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong><br>\nOn Market Days, NAV Fund Services will provide the NAV per share, reflecting the valuation of the securities in the portfolio, net of expenses, on a per-share basis. When investors purchase or redeem USTB, the transaction is recorded at the applicable NAV per share for that Market Day.</p>\n<p>Any gain realized between the redemption proceeds and the original purchase amount is subject to taxation at the investor’s applicable tax rate.</p>\n<p>USTB does not distribute dividends or make other distributions, so the primary tax consequence arises from the gain or loss realized on redemption. No taxes are withheld on any transactions within the Fund.</p>\n<p>USTB intends to operate in a manner that allows it to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, USTB is not expected to be subject to federal income tax liability and investors are responsible for fulfilling their tax obligations and are advised to consult with a tax advisor. NAV Fund Services will prepare a Schedule K-1 annually for each investor, detailing their share of the Fund’s gains or losses for the year. Foreign investors will also receive a Form 1042-S reflecting that none of the Fund’s income is considered ECI.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98628-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98628-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-6\"></a>V.

Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Account Information</strong><br>\nInvestors receive monthly statements prepared by USTB’s NAV Calculation Agent, NAV Fund Services (see example below). In addition, the Investor Portal gives investors transparency into their current balances, historical transactions, fund details, and securities holdings.</p>\n<p>For transparency, members of the Spark Star can share the monthly statements on the public forum. Also, multiple users can be added to the Investor Portal with either Admin or Team (read-only) privileges to get real-time access to all information available related to Spark’s position and underlying exposures.</p>\n<p><strong>Fund Information</strong><br>\nMore helpful fund statistics such as daily NAV/S, AUM, performance, and weekly holdings are publicly available at the following link, which the Sky community can easily access at any time: <a href=\"http://superstate.co/ustb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">superstate.co/ustb</a>. We also provide USTB’s unaudited financials through the Investor Portal.</p>\n<p>We have partnered with Chainlink to bring our <a href=\"https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/ustb-nav\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">NAV/S API onchain</a> and it can easily integrate with tools developed by Powerhouse (such as Connect and the RWA Reporting Tool for BA Labs). Superstate is also working with Chainlink to provide real-time visibility into underlying assets via Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves oracle.

Each day the NAV per share increases based on the net income of the fund: the excess Treasury Bill interest income over any USTB expenses or the management fee. At the end of the year, NAV prepares the annual financial statements and prepares tax filings for all investors who owned shares during the prior fiscal year. The daily NAV is available per API and is published on our website.</p>\n<p>Ernst &amp; Young LLP, one of the ‘Big Four’ accounting firms, performs annual financial statement audits for USTB. The first audit of USTB will be for FY 2024 and will begin in January 2025. The audit will be conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAS”), as established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”).</p>\n<p>The results of this audit should be completed by March 2025 and will be made available to Spark for review.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p>The USTB token uses blockchains to deliver a secure and seamless investment experience. USTB’s infrastructure ensures scalability, security, and compliance. Here’s a summary of the implementation:</p>\n<p><strong>a) Onchain Overview:</strong></p>\n<p><em>AllowList Proxy</em> -<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x42d75c8fdbbf046df0fe1ff388da16ff99de8149\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> https://etherscan.io/address/0x42d75c8fdbbf046df0fe1ff388da16ff99de8149</a><br>\n<em>USTB Token Proxy</em> - <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x43415eB6ff9DB7E26A15b704e7A3eDCe97d31C4e\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://etherscan.io/address/0x43415eB6ff9DB7E26A15b704e7A3eDCe97d31C4e</a><br>\nChainlink USTB Oracle -<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x289B5036cd942e619E1Ee48670F98d214E745AAC\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> https://etherscan.io/address/0x289B5036cd942e619E1Ee48670F98d214E745AAC</a></p>\n<p>Our smart contracts are designed to be flexible, allowing for upgrades as needed. Key functions, like minting tokens and managing the allowlist, are securely controlled by the Superstate Admin Address to ensure proper oversight and compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>b) USTB:</strong></p>\n<p>A standard Upgradable OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation with a few changes:</p>\n<p>USTB verifies that all holders are on the Superstate-controlled AllowList and are authorized for the specific token.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Burn</strong> - Investors can call the burn function or transfer their USTB token to the contract address to initiate a redemption</li>\n<li><strong>Mint</strong> - Superstate can call the mint function to mint new USTB token shares when investors subscribe to USTB</li>\n<li><strong>Encumber functionality</strong> (see our docs: <a href=\"https://docs.superstate.co/superstate/smart-contracts#encumber\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Smart Contracts | Superstate</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>c) Transfers:</strong></p>\n<p>USTB tokens can be freely transferred between Ethereum addresses on the AllowList using <code>transfer</code> or <code>transferFrom</code> functions. Each transaction is verified to ensure both sender and receiver are on the AllowList and authorized for the specific token.</p>\n<p><strong>d) AllowList:</strong></p>\n<p>Adds/Removes Ethereum addresses to/from the AllowList with certain permissions. Right now, only the first two booleans in the <code>Permission</code> struct are used. <code>Permission.disallowed</code> means the entity is onboarded to USTB.</p>\n<p>Ethereum addresses are also grouped by their Entity ID. Entity IDs are how Superstate identifies investors The USTB token contract calls <code>getPermission</code> on the AllowList contract to see if the sender and receiver of USTB token are permitted to hold it.</p>\n<p>Only the Superstate Admin Address can make any changes to the AllowList, using the following functions <code>setEntityIdForAddress</code>, <code>setEntityIdForMultipleAddresses</code>, <code>setPermission</code>, <code>setEntityPermissionAndAddresses</code>, and <code>setNthPermission</code>. We call these functions when onboarding or offboarding an investor.</p>\n<p>We only add Ethereum addresses for investors who have successfully completed our KYC / Investment Agreement processes.</p>\n<p><strong>e) USTB Oracle:</strong></p>\n<p>Chainlink is responsible for putting the USTB NAV/S price onchain. The Oracle contract uses the AggregatorV3Interface:</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#functions-in-aggregatorv3interface\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/1/a1ba340d4dcc99d51a3d7351da77583ec4509cf8.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"375BD2\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#functions-in-aggregatorv3interface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chainlink Documentation</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/2/f22b907f3210aad29bf6568772454c87be003e0c_2_690x362.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF2FC\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#functions-in-aggregatorv3interface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockchain Oracles for Connected Smart Contracts | Chainlink Documentation</a></h3>\n\n  <p>API reference for using Chainlink Data Feeds in smart contracts.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>This oracle provides the most up-to-date USTB NAV/S price and functions like other Chainlink oracles.</p>\n<p><strong>f) Additional Technical Products and Services:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Onboarding:</em> We’ve developed a proprietary onboarding tool that simplifies the process of onboarding to USTB, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.</p>\n<p><em>Investor Portal:</em> Superstate’s Investor Portal allows Investors to manage and track their portfolio with ease, offering real-time access to account information.</p>\n<p><em>APIs for Real-Time Data:</em> Our APIs offer instant access to NAV/S, ensuring Investors have the most current information at their fingertips.</p>\n<p><em>Fireblocks:</em> We utilize Fireblocks m/n MPC infrastructure to implement admin controls, requiring approval for minting tokens or adding an address to the AllowList.</p>\n<p><em>Internal Reconciliation:</em> We conduct thorough internal reconciliation reporting, daily, to ensure all token balances and financial metrics are accurate and consistent.</p>\n<p><em>Public Website:</em> Our website provides detailed fund information such as holdings, yield, and NAV and serves as a central resource for investors.</p>\n<p>Superstate’s technical implementation is built to support secure, transparent, and user-friendly investment products, meeting the needs of modern clients.

Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the Spark Star and Sky ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>USTB offers investors stability and peace of mind, delivering uncorrelated returns in a simple ERC-20. Sub-advised by Federated Hermes, USTB brings 50+ years of professional asset management on-chain. USTB’s portfolio manager, Sue Hill, has 30+ years of experience and is directly responsible for managing $300B+ AUM across multiple funds.</p>\n<p>By onboarding to USTB, the Sky ecosystem may easily access other products offered by Superstate Inc., including USCC and future offerings.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, USTB promises supreme transparency. Today, anyone can see USTB’s holdings, daily NAV, yield, and more by visiting: <a href=\"https://superstate.co/ustb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://superstate.co/ustb<br>\n</a>We have partnered with Chainlink to create a Proof Of Reserve oracles on-chain. These transparency features easily integrate into existing and future Sky infrastructure developed by Powerhouse, BA Labs, and Steakhouse Financial.</p>\n<p>Superstate Inc. organizes and manages the Superstate Industry Council (SIC), a collective of leading traditional and digital asset institutions dedicated to advancing tokenization in traditional finance and capital markets. We are proud to welcome 10+ prominent institutions, in our most recent cohort, bringing the total number of members to 35. See below for a few examples of recently added members:</p>\n<p>Arbelos Markets<br>\nAxelar Foundation (Interop Labs)<br>\nCopper<br>\nFlow Traders<br>\nFlowdesk<br>\nGemini<br>\nHidden Road<br>\nKBit<br>\nLaser Digital<br>\nNonco<br>\nOffchain Labs<br>\nRepublic Digital<br>\nSteakhouse<br>\nWakem Capital<br>\nXapo Bank</p>\n<p>SIC members may contribute their expertise and resources to the Sky ecosystem, expanding utility to Spark and future Stars.

Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>We are currently exploring integrations with major DeFi protocols including Morpho, Uniswap, Euler, Pendle, and more. USTB is currently integrated with major custodians including Fireblocks, BitGo, Anchorage, and more are on the way.</p>\n<p>Our vision for Superstate is to make our products widely accessible across different ecosystems and protocols to benefit onchain investors. We are actively engaging with lending protocols, DEXs, and various blockchain networks to ensure our products are available where they will provide the most utility possible in a compliant manner.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other Stars?</strong></p>\n<p>Superstate recently launched the <a href=\"https://superstate.co/uscc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Superstate Crypto Carry Fund</a> (“USCC”), a private, tokenized fund for qualified purchasers, offering exposure to the crypto “cash-and-carry” trade. USCC provides risk-managed exposure to crypto basis, leveraging price differences between spot and futures markets for Bitcoin and Ether while optimizing yield and risk across basis opportunities, staking, and U.S. Treasury securities.</p>\n<p>USCC is a series of a Delaware Trust, separate from Superstate, ensuring assets are bankruptcy remote. The Fund is opportunistically managed, with a current 30-day yield of 14.13% (as of 08/28/2024) and a legal structure consistent with USTB. It offers daily liquidity, low fees, and subscription and redemption via fiat or USDC. By onboarding to USTB, Spark and future Stars could more seamlessly access USCC and other future products managed by Superstate Inc.</p>\n<p>As shared above, Superstate will be launching additional tokenized financial products in the future and will collaborate with Spark or other Stars to understand what other strategies/exposures might be suitable.</p>\n<p>As we build secondary markets, we’ll also engage Spark and other Stars to understand how they can get better utility and capital efficiency by integrating our products across various protocols or systems, subject to legal and regulatory constraints.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98628-glossary-of-terms-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98628-glossary-of-terms-8\"></a>Glossary of Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AllowList Addresses:</strong> Ethereum addresses that are approved to interact with send / receive USTB tokens, listed by Investors or Superstate Inc.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Primary AllowList Address:</strong> The main address designated by Investors for core receiving and custodying USTB token .</li>\n<li><strong>Secondary AllowList Address:</strong> Additional addresses with specific roles or permissions, often for auxiliary functions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>USTB Purchase Address:</strong> Client-specfic Circle address used specifically for purchasing and subscribing to USTB with USDC.</li>\n<li><strong>USDC Proceeds Address:</strong> Client-specfic Ethereum address where USDC proceeds from redemptions are deposited.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-ustb/24974\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-ustb/24974","pubDate":"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:04:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24974"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-ustb/24974.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - USTB"}},{"title":"Real-World Asset Report - 2024-07","dc:creator":"steakhouse","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>Below you will find the July 2024 update on Maker’s Real-World Asset exposure.

While we had a strong enough argument to seek preliminary discovery, the Buyer Trade Finance Agreement (BTFA) does not entirely circumvent the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR) requirements in Australia. The PPSR ensures transparency regarding who has a security interest in goods through registration or possession.</em></p>\n<p><em>Despite these challenges, there is still potential for claims against the Liquidator if the documents reveal that he was aware of any wrongdoing by Hanhwa concerning our goods. Similarly, we may have claims against Directed if it is shown that they were aware of the BTFA when acquiring the goods before liquidation.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Court has not yet delivered a judgment, which is an unusual delay. The delay could indicate that the Registrar is carefully considering which documents should be provided, but it is difficult to determine the exact cause. The Registrar may simply have a heavy workload.</em></p>\n<p><em>With Hanhwa director now bankrupted and out of the picture, our straightforward claim has become more complex. Our chances of success against the Liquidator and Directed will largely depend on the Registrar’s decision on our preliminary discovery application and the documents produced. Once we have access to these documents, we will be able to provide a more informed opinion.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your continued patience and support.

Built on the oldest and most profitable decentralized finance protocol. Powering a scalable ecosystem of <strong>Stars</strong>.</h3>\n<p>After more than 2 years of meticulous work by the ecosystem, Sky is here! MakerDAO is now Sky, and the long anticipated upgrades to the protocol and ecosystem - known by the codename Endgame - are now coming to life.</p>\n<p>Decentralized Finance is at an inflection point. The industry has successfully matured and scaled and, with the right push, is poised to begin providing large scale value to regular people. By focusing on delivering innovative ways for everyday users to unlock the inherent benefits of DeFi, Sky will do its part in bringing the benefits of DeFi to the mass market.</p>\n<p>With Sky, the Maker Protocol has used its decentralized governance processes to upgrade and extend itself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Two upgraded tokens: USDS and SKY</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new website and DeFi app: Sky.money (maintained by an independent entity)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Brand new killer feature: Native Token Rewards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ecosystem scalability breakthrough: Stars (Formerly known as SubDAOs) are small, specialized, decentralized ecosystems within the broader Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next chapter of DeFi starts with the introduction of Sky and continues with rapid releases of all of the core features of Sky outlined above. Here’s what’s next for Sky:</p>\n<p><em>All of the features mentioned in this post have been approved by the governance process and specified in the Atlas: <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP107#7-1-1-newgovtoken-newstable-token-rewards\" class=\"inline-onebox\">MIPs Portal</a></em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-token-and-product-launch-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-token-and-product-launch-3\"></a>Token and Product Launch</h1>\n<p>Token and Product Launch is on September 18, and this is the moment everything goes live.</p>\n<p>This release will introduce the foundational elements of Sky.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-usds-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-usds-4\"></a>USDS</h2>\n<p>The upgraded stablecoin of the Sky Ecosystem is USDS.</p>\n<p>USDS can be upgraded from Dai or converted from USDC at a 1:1 ratio, on Sky.money and other frontends. USDS can also be converted back to Dai. Upgrading is optional.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>USDS will have access to SKY Token Rewards from the moment it launches. These rewards are built into the Sky Protocol, which means that the user doesn’t have to get exposed to external protocols with unknown risk. All eligible users are doing is using USDS you own inside the Sky Protocol itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The SKY Token Reward will be distributed at a rate of 600 million SKY per year, across participating USDS holders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>USDS users can also choose to instead get the regular Savings Rate, which has already been successfully used by billions of dollars for several years.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sky Token Rewards and Savings Rate are restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-sky-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-sky-5\"></a>SKY</h2>\n<p>The Governance Token of the Sky Ecosystem is SKY.</p>\n<p>MKR holders can upgrade their MKR to SKY, and SKY can also be converted back to MKR. Upgrading is optional.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Users get 24,000 SKY per MKR when they upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At Launch, the Smart Burn Engine will move to target the SKY/USDS market with all of its current liquidity and all future automatic liquidity acquisition from Protocol Surplus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At later stages of Sky Launch Season, SKY will gain additional features including Sealed Activation and Regular Activation, which gives eligible users USDS and Token Rewards for committed participation in Sky Governance. These functionalities are restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-skymoney-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-skymoney-6\"></a>Sky.money</h2>\n<p>Sky.money is a decentralized gateway to the Sky Ecosystem and provides access to the key features of the Sky Protocol, including upgrading Dai to USDS, and MKR to SKY.</p>\n<p>Sky.money also enables eligible users to access the Sky Protocol to use USDS to earn SKY tokens as Native Token Rewards and to get the Savings Rate on USDS.</p>\n<p>It is designed to be as easy and simple to use as possible and to set a standard for other projects that provide access to the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-early-bird-bonus-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-early-bird-bonus-7\"></a>Early Bird Bonus</h2>\n<p>Until September 18, users can sign up on Sky.money for the Early Bird Bonus. Once SKY tokens become available as Token Rewards, those who signed up in advance for the Early Bird Bonus, and are eligible, will receive double the SKY Token Rewards for a month after September 18. The Early Bird Bonus is restricted in some countries including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-features-coming-shortly-after-september-18-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-features-coming-shortly-after-september-18-8\"></a>Features coming shortly after September 18</h1>\n<p>After the core elements described above go live, Sky will focus on bringing the next round of innovations to market. The following are expected to be live soon after the initial 18 September launch date.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-sealed-activation-launch-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-sealed-activation-launch-9\"></a>Sealed Activation Launch</h1>\n<p>Soon after the launch of USDS, SKY, Sky.money and Token Rewards, the Sealed Activation feature will launch.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation encourages long term governance participation by enabling MKR and SKY holders to Seal their tokens behind an Exit Fee in return for Rewards.</p>\n<p>Both SKY and MKR can be Sealed.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-sealed-activation-rewards-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-sealed-activation-rewards-10\"></a>Sealed Activation Rewards</h2>\n<p>Eligible users that have Sealed their MKR or SKY receive Activation Rewards. Initially, Activation Rewards are only available in the form of USDS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>25% of all protocol stablecoin surplus earned by the Maker Protocol is distributed proportionally as Activation Rewards to Sealed MKR and SKY.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the Spark Star launches, Sealed Activation users will also be able to choose to receive SPK tokens.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15% of all SPK tokens earmarked for Token Rewards are distributed proportionally as Activation Rewards to Sealed Activation users that have chosen to receive SPK yield.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sealed Activation is restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-unsealing-exit-fee-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-unsealing-exit-fee-11\"></a>Unsealing Exit Fee</h2>\n<p>In exchange for the benefits of using Sealed Activation, and to encourage long term commitment and governance participation, Sealed SKY and MKR tokens pay a 5% Exit Fee when they are Unsealed.</p>\n<p>This fee is burned by the protocol, and is subtracted from the principal that was originally Sealed. Token Rewards earned from Sealing are unaffected by the Exit Fee.</p>\n<p>The Exit Fee begins at 5% when Sealed Activation launches, and increases by 1% every 6 months for the next 5 years until it reaches 15%, which is the permanent Exit Fee.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-sky-regular-activation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-sky-regular-activation-12\"></a>SKY Regular Activation</h1>\n<p>A couple of weeks after the launch of Sealed Activation, alongside Skylink and Spark launch, SKY will also get a new feature called Activation. This is a less committed version of Sealed Activation, where SKY holders receive Activation Rewards, but don’t have to Seal their tokens behind and Exit Fee. SKY can be freely Activated and Deactivated instantly, at any time.</p>\n<p>Initially when Activation launches, SKY holders will be eligible to get 15% of the total SPK supply as Activation Rewards.</p>\n<p>SKY Regular Activation is restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-skylink-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-skylink-13\"></a>Skylink</h1>\n<p>Skylink is designed to be the multichain solution of the Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>After the launch of Sealed Activation Skylink will launch and begin connecting USDS, SKY and other Sky Ecosystem tokens from Ethereum Mainnet to major L2s.</p>\n<p>Skylink makes all of the core Sky features available on the L2s and blockchains it is deployed to, including: Native USDS, Native Sky Savings Rate, Native Token Rewards, native 1:1 conversion between USDC and USDS.</p>\n<p>Skylink deployments to additional L2s and L1s will follow later.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-spark-the-first-sky-star-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spark-the-first-sky-star-14\"></a>Spark: the first Sky Star</h1>\n<p>Formerly known as SubDAOs, Stars are smaller, specialized, decentralized ecosystems that exist within the broader Sky Ecosystem and are tied to the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<p>Spark is the first Star. The launch of the Spark Governance Token - the SPK token - and the start of multichain (via Skylink) SPK Token Rewards are hotly anticipated elements of the new system.</p>\n<p>All Star tokens, including the SPK token of Spark, are distributed primarily through the Sky Token Rewards that USDS can access. Only a small amount of SPK will be distributed to contributor teams, enabling a much more decentralized and diverse token distribution.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-sparklend-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-sparklend-15\"></a>SparkLend</h2>\n<p>Spark specializes in providing high quality, easy to use DeFi products backed by the economic scale of the Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The main product of Spark is SparkLend, available on <a href=\"http://spark.fi\">spark.fi</a></p>\n<p>SparkLend is a modern lending engine where users can directly self-generate USDS using crypto as collateral.</p>\n<p>SparkLend launched a year ago, and is already very popular, currently around the 10th biggest DeFi platform by TVL in the world.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98600-spk-airdrop-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spk-airdrop-16\"></a>SPK Airdrop</h3>\n<p>Eligible users of SparkLend are already able to pre-farm the SPK Airdrop today, which will grant them SPK tokens distributed out in a single Airdrop when SPK launches.</p>\n<p>Eligible users of SparkLend can check the SPK tokens they’ve accrued so far on <a href=\"https://spark.blockanalitica.com/v1/ethereum/airdrop/\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Spark | Block Analitica</a></p>\n<p>The SPK Airdrop is separate from the SPK Token Rewards, described below.</p>\n<p>SPK Airdrop will be restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-allocation-system-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-allocation-system-17\"></a>Allocation System</h2>\n<p>In addition to maintaining its own lending protocol, Spark also specializes in allocating capital to the broader DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This is done through the Allocation System, which is an upcoming mechanism in the Sky Protocol that allows Stars to borrow from Sky at a cheaper rate, and then allocate it to the best protocols and platforms in the broader DeFi Ecosystem</p>\n<p>As an example, Spark currently controls a Morpho Lending Market system that is used to allocate hundreds of millions of USD towards the Ethena sUSDe tokenized perpetual swap basis trade.</p>\n<p>Spark has also announced the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/announcement-spark-tokenization-grand-prix-request-for-proposal/24631\">Spark Tokenization Grand Prix</a>, which ultimately will give Spark the ability to deploy billions of MakerDAO collateral into the safest and best developed tokenized RWA assets through the Allocation System. For the time being, the final decisions still require approval by governance.</p>\n<p>MakerDAO has years of experience being the leading RWA protocol, and this expertise and responsibility is being handed over to Spark, in order to make future RWA related innovation move faster.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-spark-tokenomics-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spark-tokenomics-18\"></a>Spark Tokenomics</h2>\n<p>The moment Spark Launches, the SPK token will be available as Token Rewards for eligible USDS users both on Ethereum mainnet and L2s. Token Rewards on L2s will have very low transaction fees. Eligible Sealed Activation users will also be able to get SPK tokens the moment Spark launches.</p>\n<p>SPK Token Rewards are separate from the SPK Airdrop, described above.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-spk-reward-distribution-rates-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spk-reward-distribution-rates-19\"></a>SPK Reward distribution rates</h2>\n<p>As specified by the governance process, the rate of SPK distribution will be 1 billion tokens per year the first 2 years. This will halve every 2 years until a total of 4 billion SPK tokens have been distributed after 10 years.</p>\n<p>This total distribution will be divided as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>USDS users will receive Token Rewards at a rate of 700 million SPK tokens per year</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activated SKY will receive SPK Activation Rewards at a rate of 150 million SPK tokens per year</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sealed SKY or MKR will receive SPK Activation Rewards at a rate of 150 million SPK tokens per year.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This rate will remain in place for the first two years following Spark launch, after which all rates will halve, as described above.</p>\n<p>SPK Token Rewards are restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-spk-activation-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spk-activation-20\"></a>SPK Activation</h2>\n<p>The SPK token will have built in Activation Rewards from the moment it launches. SPK Activation will be available both on Ethereum mainnet and L2s.</p>\n<p>Activated SPK will receive SKY Activation Rewards at a rate of 80 million SKY per year, available for eligible users.</p>\n<p>SPK Token Rewards are restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-spark-governance-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spark-governance-21\"></a>Spark Governance</h2>\n<p>Spark will have a community governance mechanism controlled by SPK token voting. Over time Spark Governance will run all aspects of Spark autonomously, within the framework of the Sky Star ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-legal-structures-in-the-sky-ecosystem-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-legal-structures-in-the-sky-ecosystem-22\"></a>Legal structures in the Sky Ecosystem</h1>\n<p>Proactively and securely dealing with legal and regulatory risks has always been a top priority for the ecosystem, and as the industry keeps growing and the opportunities increase, so does legal and regulatory risk and complexity. The legal structure strategy in the Sky Ecosystem has been intended to ensure Sky Governance maintains the ability to make decentralized decisions without being influenced by leverage from external entities.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-ip-ownership-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-ip-ownership-23\"></a>IP Ownership</h2>\n<p>Key IP of the Sky Ecosystem will be held in a foundation that is still in progress, modelled after the approach used for the Dai Foundation, and expanded to cover the new usecases necessary with Sky.</p>\n<p>Specific information about this foundation will be published later, as some of the legal details still need to be finalized and providing too much information early could just increase confusion. The intention is to ensure that Sky Governance retains critical decision making power over all crucial IP assets relevant to the Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-skymoney-maintenance-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-skymoney-maintenance-24\"></a>Sky.money maintenance</h2>\n<p>The Sky.money domain will be owned by the dedicated IP foundation in time for the September 18 launch, and the Foundation then assigns an entity to operate and maintain a website and DeFi app on the domain.</p>\n<p>The entity currently doing this is Skybase, which is an independent private crypto and fintech company that is owned by companies connected to my own (Rune) holding company. Skybase is designed to be able to handle all of the legal, technical and marketing requirements that is needed to effectively operate Sky.money.</p>\n<p>It does not earn any money directly from these operations, and instead is just set up to be funded through the Launch Project.</p>\n<p>The initial scope of Skybase is very limited to just maintaining Sky.money, but it is set up to be maximally independent, separate, resilient, compliant and above board in how it handles this responsibility.</p>\n<p>I’m currently working on ideas for proposals about how the scope of Skybase, and other similar to entities, can be expanded to improve the ability of the Sky Ecosystem to offer DeFi products that are easy to use, and more smoothly integrated into users existing financial systems and applications while still providing a DeFi experience at their core. However, this will only be relevant if Sky Launch Season is a success.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-support-the-sky-launch-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-support-the-sky-launch-25\"></a>Support the Sky launch!</h1>\n<p>The potential of DeFi is enormous, and the entire financial system as we know it might be reshaped in the coming decades to be more decentralized, transparent, efficient and fair.</p>\n<p>Sky is here to do its part, and as a decentralized ecosystem there are many ways you can help too.</p>\n<p>If you’re a builder in the DeFi space, you can learn how to integrate and gain benefits and support on the Sky X account: <span class=\"mention\">@SkyEcosystem</span></p>\n<p>If you want to be a part of the launch, go to Sky.money and check out the new brand and sign up for the Early Bird Bonus</p>\n<p>Don’t forget to follow <span class=\"mention\">@SkyEcosystem</span> on X, as there will be a lot of really exciting updates and releases leading up to the full launch of Sky on September 18!</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959","pubDate":"Tue, 27 Aug 2024 12:25:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24959"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959.rss","#text":"Sky has arrived!"}},{"title":"Article on Tokenization Process of RWA","dc:creator":"Akira_Maker","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p><em>Hi everybody!</em></p>\n<p><em>I’ve written an article on the Tokenization Process of RWAs.</em></p>\n<p><em>The article is meant as a learning tool for myself and others that might be interested in the development of RWAs.</em></p>\n<p><em>I am happy to receive critique or remarks on the work and suggestions to further research.</em></p>\n<p><em>The article can also be read on mirror here: <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0xF13166E10e9A4DcD56eBe102789a52e8b58aD1dC/NECseyfkIz2KC3J7kvgdV8vMXQkLz5f4QNo99lfWaX8?referrerAddress=0xF13166E10e9A4DcD56eBe102789a52e8b58aD1dC\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">A Breakdown of RWA Tokenization — Akira</a></em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98587-introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Tokenizing RWAs as a concept is fairly easy to understand at a fundamental level. It is the process of creating a digital token on the blockchain that is linked to a real-world asset off-chain.

If you already know these basic concepts, you can scroll down to the section: Tokenization Process. And for those that could use a recap, here is a quick rundown of the concepts and principles that are needed to understand the tokenization process.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-rwa-categorization-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-rwa-categorization-3\"></a><strong>RWA Categorization</strong></h3>\n<p>We can differentiate between a RWA with these three traits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Asset Location: On-Chain or Off-Chain</li>\n<li>Collateral Location: On-Chain or Off-Chain</li>\n<li>Backing type: Direct or Indirect</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/Quillhash/Real-World-Assets\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">QuillHash</a></p>\n<p><strong>Asset Location</strong></p>\n<p>This refers to whether the asset being tokenized is on-chain or off-chain. Since RWAs are typically off-chain, it generally makes sense to focus on assets with an off-chain location. An example of on-chain assets being tokenized are wrapped tokens like WBTC or WETH, though these are not considered RWAs.</p>\n<p>There are rare cases where an asset’s location is on-chain from the start, such as certain intellectual properties, patents, or copyrights.

Unlike traditional contracts, smart contracts are written in code, typically using the Solidity programming language. These contracts are stored on the blockchain, ensuring they are secure, transparent, and immutable.</p>\n<p>To create a smart contract, developers often use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Once deployed, a smart contract functions as a set of predefined actions that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. This process eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, making the contract fully transparent and accessible for anyone to verify.</p>\n<p>In short, smart contracts are self-executing agreements where the terms are embedded in code, ensuring that they are enforced and executed automatically without the need for intermediaries.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-token-standards-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-token-standards-5\"></a><strong>Token Standards</strong></h3>\n<p>Token standards are a set of rules or protocols that dictate how tokens are created, issued, and behave on a blockchain. These standards ensure that tokens can interact seamlessly with smart contracts, wallets, and other applications within the same ecosystem. Each blockchain may have its own token standards, but the most well-known ones are from the Ethereum blockchain, where the concept of token standards became widely popular.</p>\n<p>• <strong>ERC-20:</strong> The most widely used standard for fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and support basic functions like transfers and balance checks. For example, each DAI token is identical in value and function to another DAI.</p>\n<p>• <strong>ERC-721:</strong> The standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which represent unique assets like digital art or collectibles. Each token has a distinct value and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis with another token.</p>\n<p>• <strong>ERC-1155:</strong> A versatile standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens within the same contract, commonly used in gaming for managing various token types, such as in-game currency and unique items.</p>\n<p>• <strong>ERC-1400:</strong> A standard designed for security tokens, representing traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds. It includes features for regulatory compliance, such as restricting transfers to authorized users.</p>\n<p>• <strong>ERC-3643:</strong> An evolution of ERC-1400, ERC-3643 is a standard specifically tailored for regulated security tokens. It enhances compliance features, including more sophisticated access controls and automated compliance checks, making it ideal for institutional and regulated markets. This standard is often used for RWAs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-oracles-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-oracles-6\"></a><strong>Oracles</strong></h3>\n<p>Oracles are used to bring real-world information onto the blockchain securely. Since blockchains operate as isolated systems, they can’t access data outside their network on their own. Oracles serve as the bridge between the blockchain and the outside world, enabling smart contracts to interact with external information, such as real-world events, asset prices, or other data feeds.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98587-tokenization-process-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-tokenization-process-7\"></a><strong>Tokenization Process</strong></h2>\n<p>Now that we’ve covered the fundamental concepts, let’s explore the practical steps involved in tokenizing a RWA, using the example of a U.S. Treasury Bond (T-bill). This process will demonstrate how a T-bill can be accurately represented on the blockchain, legally compliant, and ready for trading or investment.</p>\n<p>When tokenizing an RWA, an entity first purchases the asset and holds it in reserve. The entity then develops and issues tokens that represent the RWA. These tokens can be transferred and traded on blockchain platforms. As a result, the tokens not only reflect the value of the underlying RWA but also gain the inherent benefits of blockchain technology, such as transparency, transaction speed, and immutability.</p>\n<p>As I aim to cover the whole process of tokenization, I will not deep dive into each step but rather provide a concise and to-the-point overview of the process. For a more in depth analysis of a specific step, I will publish new articles to cover these areas. If you have any subject recommendation you want me to cover, feel free to write to <a href=\"https://x.com/Akira1924445\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Akira1924445</a> on <a href=\"http://X.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X.com</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-1-asset-identification-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-1-asset-identification-8\"></a>1. Asset Identification</h3>\n<p>The first step in the tokenization process is choosing the right asset, with careful consideration of its asset location. When selecting an asset, it’s important to consider factors such as stability, liquidity, market demand, and the asset’s potential for generating returns. T-bills, with their off-chain location, are often selected for tokenization due to their high security, backed by the U.S. government, and predictable returns.</p>\n<p>Key factors to consider when choosing a T-Bill for tokenization include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maturity Period:</strong> T-Bills come with varying maturities, typically ranging from a few days to one year. Longer maturities generally offer higher returns but may involve greater exposure to interest rate changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Interest Rate Environment:</strong> The current interest rate environment influences the purchase price of T-Bills. An inverse relationship exists where rising interest rates generally lead to lower T-Bill prices. Selecting T-Bills during favorable interest rate conditions can enhance the attractiveness of the tokenized product.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> “On-the-run” T-Bills, which are the most recently issued, tend to be more liquid and are typically preferred for tokenization. Higher liquidity ensures that the tokenized T-Bills are easier to trade on secondary markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Market Demand:</strong> Understanding the demand for T-Bills in the market is crucial. High demand for these secure, short-term investments can make the tokenized product more appealing to investors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-2-legal-and-regulatory-compliance-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-2-legal-and-regulatory-compliance-9\"></a>2. Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h3>\n<p>It’s essential that the tokenization of RWAs adheres to both local and international financial regulations. This requires establishing a legal framework that officially recognizes digital tokens as legitimate representations of the underlying RWA. For T-bills, compliance with SEC regulations, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, is paramount.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-3-choosing-the-blockchain-platform-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-3-choosing-the-blockchain-platform-10\"></a>3. Choosing the Blockchain Platform</h3>\n<p>Selecting the appropriate blockchain platform is crucial for the success of the tokenization project. The chosen platform must support the type of tokens being issued and offer the necessary scalability, security, and community support. Ethereum is often selected due to its extensive support for financial instruments and smart contract functionality, making it a strong choice for tokenizing T-bills, especially in projects requiring a robust ecosystem and liquidity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-4-token-standards-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-4-token-standards-11\"></a>4. Token Standards</h3>\n<p>The next step involves choosing or developing a token standard that best suits the characteristics of the asset being tokenized. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.erc3643.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-3643</a> standard is commonly used for tokenizing assets on the Ethereum blockchain, particularly for RWAs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-5-collateralization-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-5-collateralization-12\"></a>5. Collateralization</h3>\n<p>While T-bills are already considered one of the safest financial instruments due to government backing, understanding the Backing Type is crucial in the tokenization process. In this case, the T-bills provide direct backing for the tokens, meaning each token represents a direct claim on the T-bill’s value. This direct backing type ensures that the tokens maintain their value, as they are directly tied to the government-issued T-bills. For instance, the smart contract might ensure that each token is redeemable for a portion of the T-bill’s face value upon maturity, maintaining a 1:1 ratio.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-6-smart-contract-development-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-6-smart-contract-development-13\"></a>6. Smart Contract Development</h3>\n<p>Smart contract development is the next critical step in the tokenization process. The smart contract governs the creation, transfer, and management of the tokens. It mints digital tokens that represent fractional ownership of the T-bill, allowing multiple investors to hold parts of the same bill. The contract also defines the rules for token transfers, any ownership restrictions, and the distribution of interest payments to token holders. For example, for a T-bill with a $10,000 face value, the smart contract could issue 10,000 tokens, each representing $1 of the T-bill’s value. As the T-bill matures and pays interest, the smart contract automatically distributes payments to token holders.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-7-oracles-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-7-oracles-14\"></a>7. Oracles</h3>\n<p>Oracles play a crucial role in providing the smart contract with real-time data, ensuring that the tokenized T-bill accurately reflects its market value and any interest payments. An oracle service can provide real-time data on the current market value of T-bills, interest rate changes, and other relevant financial information. Continuous data feeds are essential for reflecting any changes in the T-bill’s value or the issuance of interest payments, ensuring transparency and accuracy.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-8-token-distribution-and-sale-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-8-token-distribution-and-sale-15\"></a>8. Token Distribution and Sale</h3>\n<p>Once the tokens are minted, they need to be distributed to investors or sold on a marketplace. Initial distribution might involve a private sale to institutional investors or a public Initial Token Offering (ITO) allowing retail investors to participate. After the initial sale, the tokens can be traded on secondary markets, providing liquidity to token holders. This allows investors to enter and exit positions as needed, without waiting for the T-bill’s maturity. For instance, the tokenized T-bills could be listed on a decentralized exchange (DEX) where they can be traded like any other cryptocurrency, with the smart contract ensuring that the underlying value remains intact.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-9-security-and-audits-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-9-security-and-audits-16\"></a>9. Security and Audits</h3>\n<p>Conducting security audits of smart contracts and the overall system architecture is essential to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors. Implementing best practices for secure smart contract development and deploying contracts on testnets for thorough testing are critical steps in ensuring the security and reliability of the tokenization process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98587-implications-and-future-developments-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-implications-and-future-developments-17\"></a><strong>Implications and Future Developments</strong></h2>\n<p>Tokenizing a T-bill represents just one example of how traditional financial instruments can be brought into the blockchain era. This not only democratizes access to government-backed securities but also opens up new avenues for trading and investment in these traditionally stable assets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Future Trends:</strong> As blockchain technology evolves, we might see the tokenization of a broader range of government securities and even cross-border trading of tokenized assets, creating a global market for T-bills.</li>\n<li><strong>Potential Challenges:</strong> Regulatory compliance remains a significant challenge, particularly as governments and financial institutions adapt to the idea of blockchain-based securities. However, the ongoing development of legal frameworks should help mitigate these challenges over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98587-conclusion-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-conclusion-18\"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Tokenizing RWAs like T-bills is a transformative process that bridges traditional financial instruments with the advantages of blockchain technology. By carefully selecting the right assets, ensuring legal compliance, and utilizing robust blockchain platforms and smart contracts, entities can create digital tokens that represent secure and liquid investments. The tokenization of T-bills not only offers enhanced transparency, speed, and accessibility but also opens up new opportunities for global investors and financial innovation.</p>\n<p>As the tokenization process continues to evolve, the potential for broader adoption of blockchain-based securities is immense. However, navigating regulatory landscapes will be crucial in ensuring the successful integration of these digital assets into the global financial system. The future holds exciting possibilities for expanding the tokenization of government securities, potentially leading to a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98587-vision-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-vision-19\"></a><strong>Vision</strong></h2>\n<p>In Japanese, the name Akira signifies brightness, clarity, and truth, principles that guide my approach to exploring the complexities of crypto, blockchain, and RWAs.

During the analyzed period, the normalized ETH borrows across these protocols show a very similar pattern for both Aave v3 and Spark, opposed to the path followed by Aave v2 and Compound v3. It is very interesting to note that both Aave v3 and Spark currently have active Lido rewards, while the other two markets don’t. Even though reward distribution differs between the Aave v3 and Spark, the result is likely similar: Spark directly subsidizes loopers by rewarding WETH borrowing; Aave’s supply rewards lead to higher supply yields, attracting more supply, which lowers borrow utilization and rates, thereby enabling more stETH looping, effectively constituting an ‘indirect subsidy’ for loopers.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/e/beb6fb04dd67aa6222f1be44131f91baf5ad0592.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/rd8KI24TTL8UMPAaP0j1nxDFXuq.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beb6fb04dd67aa6222f1be44131f91baf5ad0592_2_624x248.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"rd8KI24TTL8UMPAaP0j1nxDFXuq\" width=\"624\" height=\"248\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beb6fb04dd67aa6222f1be44131f91baf5ad0592_2_624x248.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beb6fb04dd67aa6222f1be44131f91baf5ad0592_2_936x372.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beb6fb04dd67aa6222f1be44131f91baf5ad0592_2_1248x496.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"232223\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98555-wsteth-supply-analysis-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98555-wsteth-supply-analysis-8\"></a>wstETH Supply Analysis</h2>\n<p>While reward distribution policies might have a similar impact on loopers, the effect on total stETH supply differs.

At the same time, the USD value of their supply declined during the campaign period, only to sharply increase after they ended.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/5/75f15441d16cc39e6b7f37ae6d486a405e005991.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gPmUnpOHpmqwb0Euhwmbik7i3xD.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/5/75f15441d16cc39e6b7f37ae6d486a405e005991_2_624x207.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gPmUnpOHpmqwb0Euhwmbik7i3xD\" width=\"624\" height=\"207\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/5/75f15441d16cc39e6b7f37ae6d486a405e005991_2_624x207.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/5/75f15441d16cc39e6b7f37ae6d486a405e005991_2_936x310.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/5/75f15441d16cc39e6b7f37ae6d486a405e005991_2_1248x414.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"212220\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This comparison suggests that the true effects of the reward campaign might have a delayed effect that cannot yet be measured.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98555-conclusion-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98555-conclusion-11\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The new Lido incentives correspond to larger WETH borrow and larger wstETH supply over Spark, which is especially fueled by the loopers segment. This is especially significant when looking at the other asset classes, which have followed the opposite trend both in supply and borrow.</p>\n<p>Compared to other lending markets, the increase of wstETH supply is significantly larger over the analyzed period, while WETH borrows are in line with leading lending markets that have also implemented Lido Incentives.</p>\n<p>A similar pattern can be observed when comparing the previous incentive campaign and the new one, with a stabilized growth of loopers and slight decline in USD supply. The analysis highlights the possibility that the campaign might have a delayed effect which has not yet taken place.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lido-incentives-analysis/24941\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lido-incentives-analysis/24941","pubDate":"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 15:52:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24941"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lido-incentives-analysis/24941.rss","#text":"Lido Incentives Analysis"}},{"title":"[Aug 23, 2024] Proposal Changes to Spark for Upcoming Spell","dc:creator":"PhoenixLabs","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-98553-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98553-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Phoenix Labs proposes the following changes to SparkLend grouped by individual polls:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>[Mainnet] Oracle Upgrade to ETH, wstETH, rETH and weETH markets to use Aggor</li>\n<li>[Mainnet] Remove WBTC/BTC from kill switch</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98553-rational-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98553-rational-2\"></a>Rational</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98553-mainnet-oracle-upgrade-to-eth-wsteth-reth-and-weeth-markets-to-use-aggor-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98553-mainnet-oracle-upgrade-to-eth-wsteth-reth-and-weeth-markets-to-use-aggor-3\"></a>[Mainnet] Oracle Upgrade to ETH, wstETH, rETH and weETH markets to use Aggor</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/aggor\">Repository with 2 audits</a></p>\n<p>Aggor is an oracle aggregator which combines Chronicle and Chainlink price feeds to ensure liveness of the market even in the event of malicious price print by 1 of the 2 providers.

Product Information</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Describe the product</p>\n<p>MYUSD is a multi-chain tokenized note secured by mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), short-term US Treasuries, bank demand deposits, and low risk onchain strategies. The yield is distributed to holders by continuous rebases of the token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Describe the underlying asset</p>\n<p>The underlying assets are a combination of US residential Mortgage Servicing Rights, US 1-Month Treasury Bills, and bank demand deposits. The T-Bills shall be kept in a brokerage account as MSR transactions typically require a 1-month lead time. In-kind subscriptions (USDC, DAI) are kept in low risk on-chain strategies until deployed.</p>\n<p>MYUSD intends to purchase mostly MSRs that are Government-Backed, with certain positions in the U.S. treasuries and low-risk crypto yielding strategies for liquidity management.</p>\n<p>Since market conditions fluctuate suddenly and frequently, the portfolio holdings may change and this list is not indicative of future portfolio composition. These portfolio holdings are not intended to be and do not constitute recommendations that others buy, sell, or hold any of the assets or strategies described.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</p>\n<p>Yield is transferred continuously with a rebasing mechanism. This means an address’ token balance increases with every block. All tokens (on all the various chain deployments) follow the same rebase schedule.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</p>\n<p>The Issuer, Onsen MYUSD Limited, is registered in Cayman Islands</p>\n<p>The Offshore Feeder, Onsen Assets Mortgage Servicing Rights Fund Ltd., is registered in the British Virgin Islands. It is recognized by the Financial Services Commission of the British Virgin Islands as a private mutual fund pursuant to the section 55(2) of SIBA. Although the Offshore Feeder is recognised, it is not subject to supervision by the Commission or any regulator outside the BVI.</p>\n<p>The Master Fund, Onsen Assets Mortgage Servicing Rights Fund L.P., is registered in the State of Delaware. The business and purpose of the Master Fund is to acquire, own, hold, finance, refinance, sell, pledge, and otherwise encumber or dispose of, mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) for GSEs on a flow and bulk basis pursuant to one or more Excess Spread Agreements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</p>\n<p>There are no concentration limitations for buying MSR portfolios. MSRs would need to be custodied by U.S. regulated master servicer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</p>\n<p>We use forward Swaptions to hedge the outsized interest rate decline risks beyond the rate forward curve. This would allow us to ensure the yields are locked in for the duration of the MSRs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc).

They are invested in low risk, liquid strategies and are used as a pool from which MYUSD can be redeemed. Incoming deposits are automatically included in these reserves and invested in the same strategies. The protocol maintains a target level for the amount of assets available on-chain. As additional deposits are made, the protocol manually deploys a portion of the capital into select MSR pools. Conversely, as more redemptions occur, the protocol redeems select MSR pools and adds capital back to the reserves. Through this method, most of the incoming deposits and redemptions can be effectively matched against each other on-chain which reduces the amount of MSR pool trades that need to take place.</p>\n<p>MYUSD tokens can be redeemed 1:1 for select stablecoins. Redemptions also work via the TokenGateway contract. Normally, they are a two step process. The first step is the initiation which burns user’s MYUSD tokens. After a timeout period passes the claim is then automatically processed for the user and the stablecoin of their choosing is sent to them. The user can also opt for a “fast” redemption which happens instantly. This will incur a fee. Both the fee and the timeout period length are updatable by the multisig contract which controls the TokenGateway contract. In times of low reserve balances, redemptions can take longer as off-chain assets will need to be unwound. As new assets become available the existing redemption requests are served on a first come first served basis.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98526-contract-calls-to-redeem-myusd-for-dai-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-contract-calls-to-redeem-myusd-for-dai-5\"></a>Contract calls to redeem MYUSD for DAI:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>MYUSD.approve(TokenGateway, myUsdAmount)</li>\n<li>TokenGateway.initiateRedeem(myUsdAmount, DAI)</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98526-contract-calls-to-fast-redeem-myusd-for-dai-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-contract-calls-to-fast-redeem-myusd-for-dai-6\"></a>Contract calls to fast redeem MYUSD for DAI:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>MYUSD.approve(TokenGateway, myUsdAmount)</li>\n<li>TokenGateway.fastRedeem(myUsdAmount, DAI)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency?

Technical Description</h1>\n<p>MYUSD is a multi-chain yield-bearing stablecoin backed by a basket of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). The yield is distributed to holders by continuous rebases of the token.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98526-deposits-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-deposits-15\"></a>Deposits</h2>\n<p>Deposits into MYUSD are initiated via a TokenGateway contract which has the ability to mint new MYUSD tokens. The TokenGateway contract accepts select stablecoins (USDC, DAI) and mints new MYUSD tokens to the user at a 1:1 ratio. The tokens immediately start rebasing at the protocol’s ongoing rate. The TokenGateway contract has a limit on how many tokens it can mint. This limit is updatable by the multisig contract which controls it.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98526-contract-calls-to-issue-myusd-with-dai-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-contract-calls-to-issue-myusd-with-dai-16\"></a>Contract calls to issue MYUSD with DAI:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>DAI.approve(TokenGateway, daiAmount)</li>\n<li>TokenGateway.issue(DAI, daiAmount)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98526-reserve-balances-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-reserve-balances-17\"></a>Reserve balances</h2>\n<p>The protocol keeps a portion of its assets on-chain in stablecoins. They are invested in low risk, liquid strategies and are used as a pool from which MYUSD can be redeemed. Incoming deposits are automatically included in these reserves and invested in the same strategies. The protocol maintains a target level for the amount of assets available on-chain.</p>\n<p>As additional deposits are made, the protocol manually deploys a portion of the capital into select MSR pools. Conversely, as more redemptions occur, the protocol redeems select MSR pools and adds capital back to the reserves.</p>\n<p>Through this method, most of the incoming deposits and redemptions can be effectively matched against each other on-chain which reduces the amount of MSR pool trades that need to take place.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98526-redemptions-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-redemptions-18\"></a>Redemptions</h2>\n<p>MYUSD tokens can be redeemed 1:1 for select stablecoins. Redemptions also work via the TokenGateway contract. Normally, they are a two step process. The first step is the initiation which burns user’s MYUSD tokens. After a timeout period passes the claim is then automatically processed for the user and the stablecoin of their choosing is sent to them.</p>\n<p>The user can also opt for a “fast” redemption which happens instantly. This will incur a fee. Both the fee and the timeout period length are updatable by the multisig contract which controls the TokenGateway contract. In times of low reserve balances, redemptions can take longer as off-chain assets will need to be unwound. As new assets become available the existing redemption requests are served on a first come first served basis.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98526-contract-calls-to-redeem-myusd-for-dai-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-contract-calls-to-redeem-myusd-for-dai-19\"></a>Contract calls to redeem MYUSD for DAI:</h4>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>MYUSD.approve(TokenGateway, myUsdAmount)</li>\n<li>TokenGateway.initiateRedeem(myUsdAmount, DAI)</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98526-contract-calls-to-fast-redeem-myusd-for-dai-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-contract-calls-to-fast-redeem-myusd-for-dai-20\"></a>Contract calls to fast redeem MYUSD for DAI:</h4>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>MYUSD.approve(TokenGateway, myUsdAmount)</li>\n<li>TokenGateway.fastRedeem(myUsdAmount, DAI)</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/f/5f1a9705fa8cd27c4ab9b9d5483e34ea8f5872d6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dzkkmeIDodquZqPOdCB3MH05VVI.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/f/5f1a9705fa8cd27c4ab9b9d5483e34ea8f5872d6.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"dzkkmeIDodquZqPOdCB3MH05VVI\" width=\"499\" height=\"413\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98526-makerdao-integration-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-makerdao-integration-21\"></a>MakerDao integration</h2>\n<p>MakerDao should also use the TokenGateway contract to enter and exit MYUSD.

This period was marked by volatile macroeconomic conditions, significant cryptocurrency price swings, as well as key developments within the Maker Ecosystem. In this update, we explore recent trends across legacy finance, the cryptocurrency markets, and MakerDAO’s internal dynamics.</p>\n<p>Given the heightened volatility in recent months, we have decided to return to a monthly update cadence. In our <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/market-overview-march-to-june-2024/24539\">last update</a>, we mentioned a shift to quarterly updates. However, the recent market turbulence has underscored the need for more frequent updates to keep the Maker community informed and to provide additional context for our decision-making process, particularly in relation to our proposed parameter changes in Maker Core and SparkLend.</p>\n<p><em>Note that all market commentary and competitive data is updated as of August 14-16, 2024.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98501-legacy-finance-conditions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98501-legacy-finance-conditions-2\"></a>Legacy Finance Conditions</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98501-july-fomc-meeting-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98501-july-fomc-meeting-3\"></a>July FOMC Meeting</h3>\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20240731a1.pdf\">July 31 FOMC meeting</a>, a decision was made to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25%-5.50%. In the press release it was stated that “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent”. During the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20240731.pdf\">press conference</a>, Powell stated that “a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table”, if inflation continues to fall, and “the broad sense of the Committee is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate but that we’re not quite at that point yet”. The next FOMC meeting will be held on <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm\">September 17-18, 2024</a>. Furthermore, the 2024 Economic Policy Symposium, <a href=\"https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/jackson-hole-economic-symposium/\">“Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,”</a> will be held August 22-24, where perhaps some additional context might be shared.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98501-us-unemployment-rate-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98501-us-unemployment-rate-4\"></a>US Unemployment Rate</h3>\n<p>On August 2, 2024, a heightened US unemployment rate of 4.3% (the highest level since October 2021) from the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf\">July employment report</a> triggered the so-called Sahm Rule, created by economist <a href=\"https://claudiasahm.com/about/\">Claudia Sahm</a>. According to the Sahm Rule, early stages of a recession are signaled when the three-month moving average of the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE\">national unemployment rate (U3)</a> rises by 0.50 percentage points or more relative to the minimum of the three-month averages from the previous 12 months. However, <a href=\"https://stayathomemacro.substack.com/p/sahm-thing-more-on-the-sahm-rule\">Claudia Sahm herself recently stated</a> that a recession is not imminent. She suggests that the Sahm rule is likely overstating the labor market’s weakening due to an unusual shift in labor supply caused by the pandemic and US immigration. However, she also means that the risk of a substantial weakening or a recession in the next several months is elevated, which adds to the case for the Fed to begin cutting rates.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/e/beeaf6599ce859ac082cb50d5da2d812be14e1f4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/reW7FTrRPxj6EpQ7AL8OU8XTVl2.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beeaf6599ce859ac082cb50d5da2d812be14e1f4_2_624x292.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"reW7FTrRPxj6EpQ7AL8OU8XTVl2\" width=\"624\" height=\"292\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beeaf6599ce859ac082cb50d5da2d812be14e1f4_2_624x292.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beeaf6599ce859ac082cb50d5da2d812be14e1f4_2_936x438.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/e/beeaf6599ce859ac082cb50d5da2d812be14e1f4.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EFF2F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME#\">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98501-unwinding-of-the-japanese-yen-jpy-carry-trade-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98501-unwinding-of-the-japanese-yen-jpy-carry-trade-5\"></a>Unwinding of the Japanese Yen (JPY) Carry Trade</h3>\n<p>Going into the weekend of August 2 - 4, following the <a href=\"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2024/k240731a.pdf\">decision from the BoJ</a> to raise its policy rate to 0.25%, a considerable amount of forced derisking occurred as a result of the unwinding of the JPY FX carry trade (e.g. short JPY/long USD).

Before the approval of an ETF conversion for ETHE, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust was used by a subset of ETHE holders to acquire ETH at a discounted rate. This has led to speculation that such holders might be realizing profits. Additionally, the Grayscale ETHE carries a significantly higher fee of 2.5% compared to its competitors, another reason to expect continued ETHE outflows. The chart below illustrates that outflows from ETHE have been notably faster than those from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has faced similar outflows for comparable reasons. 19 days after the ETHE ETF launch, only 71.4% of the ETH remains, a level of outflow that took 35 days to reach for GBTC. August 12 marked the first day with no outflows from ETHE. However, subsequent outflows will likely continue for some time.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/4/74fafdb19ab5d961f5d7c1913ed013f890e293bb.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gGR8cwBYdJJYC0DV9nueghHsS0P.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/4/74fafdb19ab5d961f5d7c1913ed013f890e293bb_2_350x409.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gGR8cwBYdJJYC0DV9nueghHsS0P\" width=\"350\" height=\"409\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/4/74fafdb19ab5d961f5d7c1913ed013f890e293bb_2_350x409.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/4/74fafdb19ab5d961f5d7c1913ed013f890e293bb_2_525x613.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/4/74fafdb19ab5d961f5d7c1913ed013f890e293bb_2_700x818.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F9F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://farside.co.uk/eth/\">Farside</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98501-funding-rate-trends-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98501-funding-rate-trends-11\"></a>Funding Rate Trends</h3>\n<p>As of August 15, 2024, the Funding Rate Benchmark was 2.89%.

We are inviting qualified entities to submit proposals that address the objectives outlined <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-tokenization-grand-prix-parameters-objectives/24825\">here</a> in preparation for the launch of the SparkDAO.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we are seeking proposals that provide the highest capital efficiency with exposure to three month or lower duration US T-Bills and high liquidity, with liquidity being measured by time to redemption to USDC and the amount of friction/slippage. A sound legal structure with bankruptcy remoteness, clear description of tax implications, and any strategic value the asset manager can add to the Spark &amp; Maker ecosystem will also be key considerations. An initial allocation of up to $1bn is contemplated, with the potential to scale to meet future demand.</p>\n<p>We are requesting that all proposals be submitted by 20 September, 2024 to ensure the initial legal, technical, and operational work required to onboard the assets managers can be completed in a timely manner. After all proposals are submitted, the Grand Prix committee will review the offerings and propose the selections to MKR governance, which will recommend which asset managers will be onboarded. MakerDAO reserves the right to accept or reject any and all proposals for any reason, or for no reason, at any point prior to MakerDAO entering into a written contract with the RFP applicant. This RFP does not constitute an offer by MakerDAO to enter into a contract.

MakerDAO reserves the right to request clarification of, or corrections to, RFP responses, and to reject any and all RFP responses, or to cancel the RFP in its entirety at MakerDAO’s sole discretion.</p>\n<p>All persons or firms who respond in any manner to this RFP (including having any contact with MakerDAO), irrespective of whether they submit a proposal, shall be deemed to have agreed to the foregoing terms.</p>\n<p><strong>Please submit the following:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The completed “Grand Prix Application” on the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/c/spark-subdao/spark-tokenization-grand-prix/102\">forum</a> with the tag [Spark Tokenization Grand Prix] with the title in the form of “Tokenization Grand Prix Application - [Applicant Name]”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additional fee concessions, incentives, or other terms to the email address, <a href=\"mailto:GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial\">GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial</a>, which will be kept confidential until the winners are selected.

The final section focuses on MakerDAO’s SubDAO, Spark’s new initiative, The Spark Tokenization Grand Prix. The article is designed to inform and support the community and interested parties in understanding and engaging with this exciting development.</p>\n<p>RWAs refer to physical or traditional financial assets that are brought onto the blockchain through a process called tokenization. This process converts assets into digital tokens that can be represented on-chain. While tokenization offers several advantages, it also presents some challenges. Some of the advantages include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased Liquidity</strong>: Liquidity refers to the efficiency with which an asset can be converted into another form, such as fiat currency or a stablecoin, without a significant loss in value.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, ensuring visibility for all.</li>\n<li><strong>Trustless System</strong>: Smart contracts automate and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Transaction Costs</strong>: Trading on a blockchain can significantly lower costs compared to traditional methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Fractional Ownership:</strong> High-value assets can be divided into smaller portions, making them more accessible to a broader range of investors. This approach has been effectively applied in tokenized real estate, allowing the general public to participate in such investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, the challenges of tokenizing RWAs can also be significant. Sébastien Derivaux, co-founder of Steakhouse Financial, discusses in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEAo2tjEOV8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">podcast</a> the early RWA work at MakerDAO and the challenges associated with investing in RWAs from a decentralized protocol. Some of the challenges highlighted in the podcast are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Requirements</strong>: Compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations is complex.</li>\n<li><strong>Communicating Complex Financial Concepts</strong>: It’s challenging to ensure that non-experts can make informed decisions in a decentralized environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Institutional Adoption</strong>: Integrating RWAs into institutional frameworks faces hurdles due to regulatory uncertainties and infrastructure limitations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"types-of-rwas-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#types-of-rwas-2\"></a>Types of RWAs</h3>\n<p>There are many use cases for RWAs, with stablecoins being one of them. As the market for RWAs continues to grow, we can expect an even broader range of tokenized assets in the future. The following are just a few examples of what kinds of assets can be tokenized on the blockchain, with a lot more expected to emerge in the future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real Estate</strong>: This includes residential, commercial, and industrial properties. Real estate tokenization allows investors to own fractional shares of properties, providing liquidity and diversification.</li>\n<li><strong>Commodities</strong>: Physical commodities such as precious metals (gold, silver), agricultural products (grains, coffee), energy resources (oil, natural gas), and others can be tokenized to facilitate trading and investment.</li>\n<li><strong>Art and Collectibles</strong>: Tokenization of art, rare collectibles, and memorabilia enables fractional ownership and investment opportunities in traditionally illiquid markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Intellectual Property (IP)</strong>: This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other forms of intellectual property rights. Tokenization allows creators to monetize their IP assets and investors to participate in revenue-sharing agreements.</li>\n<li><strong>Equity and Securities</strong>: Shares of private companies, stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments can be tokenized to increase liquidity, streamline transactions, and enable global access to capital markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Revenue-Generating Contracts</strong>: Contracts with predictable revenue streams, such as leases, royalties, and licensing agreements, can be tokenized to provide investors with recurring income opportunities.</li>\n<li><strong>Deeds and Titles</strong>: Tokenization of deeds, titles, and ownership certificates for real estate, vehicles, and other assets can streamline transfer processes and enhance transparency in ownership records.</li>\n<li><strong>Carbon Credits and Renewable Energy Assets</strong>: Environmental assets such as carbon credits, renewable energy certificates (RECs), and carbon offsets can be tokenized to facilitate trading and investment in sustainable initiatives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/Quillhash/Real-World-Assets?tab=readme-ov-file#types-of-rwas-\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Quillhash</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"underlying-asset-us-treasury-bonds-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#underlying-asset-us-treasury-bonds-3\"></a><strong>Underlying asset: U.S. Treasury Bonds</strong></h3>\n<p>RWAs can derive value from yield-bearing assets and can help stabilize protocols through risk diversification. One of the most prominent examples of RWA tokenization in the crypto space is the tokenization of U.S. Treasury Bonds, also known as T-Bills. These government-issued instruments are used to borrow money from individuals, organizations, and institutions to fund various projects, offering lenders a yield in return. T-bills are typically considered low-risk investments, as they are backed by the U.S. government, with repayment guaranteed unless the government defaults.</p>\n<p>MakerDAO now has over <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3704473/6249361/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2 billion DAI</a> invested in RWAs and has significantly increased its revenue streams by introducing RWAs into its portfolio. The development of the revenues can be seen in the graph below created by Steakhouse Financial, an ecosystem actor in MakerDAO.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/d/6ddfa57966dbb23e2bd437369da1a95b967deba6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fFZcFTeZjJIkIFX7rAWXVjomo0m.png?dl=1\" title=\"MakerDAO revenue from 2021 - today in DAI millions\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/d/6ddfa57966dbb23e2bd437369da1a95b967deba6_2_690x195.png\" alt=\"MakerDAO revenue from 2021 - today in DAI millions\" data-base62-sha1=\"fFZcFTeZjJIkIFX7rAWXVjomo0m\" width=\"690\" height=\"195\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/d/6ddfa57966dbb23e2bd437369da1a95b967deba6_2_690x195.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/d/6ddfa57966dbb23e2bd437369da1a95b967deba6_2_1035x292.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/d/6ddfa57966dbb23e2bd437369da1a95b967deba6_2_1380x390.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FCFBFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The full dashboard from Steakhouse Financial can be found <a href=\"https://dune.com/steakhouse/makerdao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. As shown in the graph, the decision to invest in tokenized T-bills has been a game changer for MakerDAO’s revenues. Since July 2023, revenues have increased significantly, and throughout 2024, they have consistently been above 20 million DAI each month.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-spark-tokenization-grand-prix-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#the-spark-tokenization-grand-prix-4\"></a>The Spark Tokenization Grand Prix</h2>\n<p>The Spark Tokenization Grand Prix is a competitive initiative designed to discover and reward innovative projects in the tokenization of RWAs. The Grand Prix, which begins today (August 12, 2024), focuses on two key aspects: liquidity and capital efficiency, with an asset focus on short-duration US T-Bills and similar tokenized products.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"liquidity-vs-capital-efficiency-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#liquidity-vs-capital-efficiency-5\"></a><strong>Liquidity vs. Capital Efficiency</strong></h3>\n<p>Spark and MakerDAO are seeking projects that either maximize liquidity for frequent rebalancing or enhance capital efficiency with higher yields and less frequent rebalancing. Although these goals might seem at odds, successful projects will find a balance, ensuring that liquidity-focused products still offer attractive yields and yield-focused products maintain sufficient liquidity. The focus on T-bills and similar tokens highlights the need for assets that can deliver consistent returns while being easily tradable.</p>\n<p>In addition to these two focus areas, other criteria are essential to being competitive in the pool of RWAs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Legal Structure</strong>: Projects should present a solid legal framework that ensures bankruptcy remoteness, compliance with domestic and international regulations, and clarity regarding the jurisdiction and relevant regulatory authorities.</li>\n<li><strong>Cost Structure</strong>: Applicants must detail their fee structures, including management and transaction fees, any potential discounts, guarantees on the fee structure duration, and additional incentives.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: A crucial factor is how quickly and smoothly products can be redeemed for fiat-backed stablecoins.</li>\n<li><strong>Taxation</strong>: Projects need to explain the potential tax implications, ensuring transparency and compliance.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic Considerations</strong>: The competition also evaluates the broader strategic value a project brings to Spark and MakerDAO. This includes how the project aligns with and supports the growth and diversification goals of these platforms, as well as its potential for offering or developing products suitable for Spark or future SubDAOs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"liquidity-in-rwa-tokenization-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#liquidity-in-rwa-tokenization-6\"></a><strong>Liquidity in RWA Tokenization</strong></h3>\n<p>Liquidity is a fundamental concept in financial markets, referring to how easily an asset can be converted into cash or another form of value, such as stablecoins, without a significant loss in value. In the context of RWAs on the blockchain, liquidity is especially crucial. The ability to trade these tokenized assets efficiently and at scale directly impacts their attractiveness and viability within DeFi protocols.</p>\n<p>The focus on tokenizing assets like T-bills in the Spark Tokenization Grand Prix underscores the importance of liquidity. Liquidity enables the rapid rebalancing of portfolios, provides immediate access to funds, and helps stabilize the system during periods of volatility. Without sufficient liquidity, RWAs could become a bottleneck, limiting the protocol’s ability to respond to market conditions and potentially leading to inefficiencies or losses.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-in-liquidity-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#challenges-in-liquidity-7\"></a><strong>Challenges in Liquidity</strong></h3>\n<p>Tokenizing RWAs presents unique liquidity challenges. Unlike purely digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, RWAs are linked to physical or traditional financial assets, which inherently have lower trading volumes and are often subject to complex regulatory requirements. These factors can make it difficult to create a liquid market for RWAs, as the transfer of ownership may involve both on-chain and off-chain processes, increasing friction.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the integration of RWAs into DeFi platforms often leads to a fragmentation of liquidity across different blockchain networks. This fragmentation occurs because various institutional investors might prefer different blockchain platforms based on their specific needs for security, compliance, and transaction efficiency. As a result, assets can become confined to specific networks, creating “liquidity islands” where assets are not easily transferable or utilized across different platforms.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"solutions-in-liquidity-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#solutions-in-liquidity-8\"></a><strong>Solutions in Liquidity</strong></h3>\n<p>To address these liquidity challenges, several strategies can be followed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocols:</strong> Developing robust cross-chain interoperability solutions is essential for enabling the seamless transfer of assets between different blockchain networks. Protocols that facilitate interaction between isolated blockchain ecosystems can help reduce liquidity fragmentation and allow for greater integration and liquidity flow across diverse platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>Standardization of Token Protocols:</strong> Implementing standardized token protocols across different blockchain networks ensures compatibility and interoperability, which enhances liquidity. Existing standards, such as ERC-20 and ERC-721 on Ethereum, provide a foundation that can be extended to other blockchains, promoting harmonized tokenization practices and improving cross-chain operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and Aggregators:</strong> Decentralized exchanges that support multi-chain trading can aggregate liquidity from various blockchain networks, creating a unified marketplace for tokenized RWAs. This approach can help eliminate liquidity islands by enabling the free trade of assets across different chains.</li>\n<li><strong>Regulatory Clarity and Compliance Automation:</strong> Establishing clear regulatory frameworks and embedding automated compliance features within smart contracts are crucial for reducing legal barriers to tokenization and cross-chain asset transfer. Regulatory clarity will encourage more institutional participation, while compliance automation will streamline operations within the DeFi ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity Pools and Incentives:</strong> Creating dedicated liquidity pools for tokenized RWAs and offering incentives for liquidity providers can enhance overall market liquidity. By rewarding liquidity providers, platforms can attract more participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of tokenized RWAs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Spark Tokenization Grand Prix places a strong emphasis on liquidity in its evaluation criteria. Projects that can develop products offering quick and smooth redemption processes for fiat-backed stablecoins, while addressing the aforementioned challenges, are likely to excel in the competition.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"capital-efficiency-in-rwa-tokenization-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#capital-efficiency-in-rwa-tokenization-9\"></a>Capital Efficiency in RWA Tokenization</h3>\n<p>Capital efficiency refers to how effectively an investment can use its capital to generate returns. With the Spark Tokenization Grand Prix looking to invest $1 billion in tokenized T-bills, the focus is not just on whether to invest in T-bills, but rather on which tokenized T-bills to choose and how these choices can overcome capital efficiency challenges. Given that the Grand Prix emphasizes capital efficiency as a key criterion for successful projects, selecting the right tokenized T-bills becomes crucial.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"yield-in-capital-efficiency-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#yield-in-capital-efficiency-10\"></a><strong>Yield in Capital Efficiency</strong></h3>\n<p>For tokenized T-bills, capital efficiency is directly tied to the yield of the underlying T-bill. The yield of the underlying asset depends on several key factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest Rates</strong>: When interest rates rise, the yield on the underlying T-bill generally increases, enhancing the profitability of the tokenized T-bill. Conversely, when interest rates fall, the yield decreases, potentially reducing returns.</li>\n<li><strong>Supply and Demand Dynamics</strong>: High demand for T-bills, especially during economic uncertainty, can drive yields down, while increased supply from government issuance can push yields up, affecting the capital efficiency of the tokenized version.</li>\n<li><strong>Inflation Expectations</strong>: Higher inflation expectations can lead investors to demand higher yields on T-bills to compensate for the reduced purchasing power, thereby influencing the returns on tokenized T-bills.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Conditions</strong>: Strong economic growth and favorable global economic factors can lead to higher yields, whereas economic slowdowns typically result in lower yields, impacting the efficiency of the capital deployed in tokenized T-bills.</li>\n<li><strong>Monetary Policy Expectations</strong>: Market expectations regarding future Federal Reserve actions can influence the yield on T-bills as investors adjust their strategies, which in turn affects the capital efficiency of the tokenized asset.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While distributors of tokenized RWAs can’t change these factors, there are other factors that can be optimized to make RWA investments more capital-efficient.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cost-management-in-capital-efficiency-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#cost-management-in-capital-efficiency-11\"></a><strong>Cost Management in Capital Efficiency</strong></h3>\n<p>The efficiency of capital deployment in RWAs is also significantly influenced by the costs associated with the investment. These costs include management fees, transaction fees, and other operational expenses incurred throughout the investment process. High fees can erode returns, making the investment less capital-efficient. Therefore, selecting RWA products with competitive fee structures is essential to maximizing net returns. For example, lower management fees can directly increase the overall yield of the tokenized T-bill, while minimizing transaction costs can reduce the friction of buying, selling, or managing these assets.</p>\n<p>The Spark Tokenization Grand Prix places a strong emphasis on capital efficiency as a key criterion for evaluating projects. Projects that can demonstrate the ability to maximize returns while maintaining sufficient liquidity and minimizing risk are likely to be highly competitive.

This will result in custody being split across multiple jurisdictions including Hong Kong and Singapore, compared with current US based custody. Bitgo has disclosed that this change implements a partnership with Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem; as such we can infer that Justin Sun will have significant influence or control over the joint venture managing WBTC. This change in control is expected to take place in 60 days.</p>\n<p>This bears some similarity to the previous situation concerning control of the TUSD stablecoin, which was discussed in the Maker forum <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/tusd-is-undergoing-a-material-change-to-its-ownership-structure-is-there-a-process-for-reducing-exposure-in-the-event-of-a-material-change/5691\">here</a>. Since TUSD was placed into Justin Sun’s control, it has seen market deterioration in operational processes and transparency, including the resignation of the previous management team, suspension of real time proof of reserves, and several significant depegs caused by interruptions in redemption service. We have also seen other Sun affiliated projects show worrying signs of possible misappropriation, such as the substitution of Huobi’s USDT reserves with stUSDT, a Sun controlled RWA project that purports to hold a reserve of US treasury bills but has not provided clear audits or evidence that the backing exists. On the whole, we find that Sun’s involvement as a controlling interest in the new WBTC joint venture presents an unacceptable level of risk.</p>\n<p>We also note that Bitgo itself seems to have had some negative developments recently, including a failed acquisition by Galaxy Digital where Galaxy backed out for undisclosed reasons. This, along with the unexpected decision to divest from the WBTC product, may be indications of financial distress within Bitgo, and reflects negatively on Bitgo’s counterparty risk. While some of the risk factors are somewhat speculative, it makes sense to err on the side of caution given the critical role WBTC collateral plays within defi.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"recommended-actions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#recommended-actions-2\"></a>Recommended Actions</h3>\n<p>Given the upcoming change in control, BA Labs believes WBTC collateral integrations on Maker and SparkLend present an elevated level of risk.

The LitePSM job is a convenience service funded by MakerDAO to execute permissionless functions that take care of bookkeeping in LITE-PSM-USDC-A.

The <code>fill()</code> function doesn’t seem to be the problem. There is still 3M Dai in the litePSM, so the decision is to wait for more devs from Dewiz to confirm the findings and suggest a path forward.</li>\n<li>2024-08-05 8:16AM UTC: 2 Dewiz devs confirm the issue is in the <code>CRON_LITE_PSM_JOB</code>. The issue is not an accounting issue, but a configuration issue in the job, as explained further below. Dewiz confirms <code>litepsm.fill()</code> can be called permissionlessly to fix the issue, as it would mint Dai to MAX DC. The date for deploying a fix is discussed, but no decision is taken at that moment.</li>\n<li>2024-08-05 8:28AM UTC: <code>litepsm.fill()</code> is called by an EA and the issue is solved for now.</li>\n<li>2024-08-05 1:56PM UTC: a logic to define correctly the parameters for the <code>CRON_LITE_PSM_JOB</code> is defined, documented and agreed upon. Redeploying the job with the new parameters will fix the issue fully. It is decided that no code changes in the job are needed and redeploying is not needed before the LitePSM Migration Phase 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"root-cause-analysis-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#root-cause-analysis-3\"></a>Root cause analysis</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>line</code> (max DC): Set to 50M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>gap</code>: Set to 20M</li>\n<li><code>buf</code>: Set to 20M</li>\n<li><code>fill</code>: Set threshold at 15M DAI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The initial migration of 20M + <code>buf</code> set to 20M made the normalized debt (<code>art</code>) for LITE-PSM-USDC-A be 40M. Since DC-IAM <code>line</code> is set to 50M, the value of the target pre-minted amount (<code>rush()</code>) would be <code>50M - 40M = 10M</code>. However, <code>fill</code> threshold is set to <code>15M</code> and therefore the keeper network job would never be executed.</p>\n<p>While the values were defined by BA Labs, Dewiz takes full responsibility for this mishap, because we failed to make ourselves clear regarding how the keeper network job configuration parameters would affect the execution.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#solution-4\"></a>Solution</h2>\n<p>For the reason outlined above, <code>fill()</code> had to be called manually by an EA collaborator, so LITE-PSM-USDC-A could reach the desired target debt of 50M.</p>\n<p>To make it clear, the keeper network job has 3 threshold parameters:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>rushThreshold</code>: the minimum Dai liquidity that is needed (<code>rush()</code>) in order for the job to call <code>fill()</code>.</li>\n<li><code>gushThreshold</code>: the minimum Dai excess liquidity (<code>gush()</code>) in order for the job to call <code>trim()</code>.</li>\n<li><code>cutThreshold</code>: the minimum Dai accumulated as swap fees (<code>cut()</code>) in order for the job to call <code>chug()</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given that DC-IAM is activated for LITE-PSM-USDC-A, moving forward, Dewiz suggests that the values of <code>buf</code> and DC-IAM <code>gap</code> and <code>rushThreshold</code> for the keeper network job such that:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">(gap % rushThreshold) == 0 &amp;&amp; rushThreshold &lt;&lt; gap &lt;= buf\n</code></pre>\n<p>In other words, the value for <code>rushThreshold</code> should be a divisor of and also significantly smaller (i.e. 10x) than <code>gap</code>, which should be less than or equal to <code>buf</code>.</p>\n<p>Also notice that when <code>gap &lt; buf</code>, the following rule must be enforced:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">(buf - gap) % rushThreshold == 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Otherwise the last possible <code>fill()</code> would not be triggered by the job, since <code>rushThreshold</code> would not be met.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"final-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#final-considerations-5\"></a>Final considerations</h2>\n<p>The design of the keeper network job is supposed to prevent calls to the bookkeeping functions of LITE-PSM-USDC-A to be called too frequently, which could cost a lot in terms of gas to the Maker Protocol. Having minimum thresholds for the respective calls to be made means that there could be up to <code>threshold - 1</code> of needed/excess liquidity or non-ingested swap fees at a given time.</p>\n<p>We discussed some possibilities to refactor the job, so the same issue does not happen again:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Change the behaviour of the job if it is too close to the active debt ceiling or to zero, making it ignore the thresholds: this could bring back the keeper network spamming problem when these conditions are met.</li>\n<li>Add a fallback time interval in which the job would be called if required, regardless of the threshold: this would be a significant refactor, increasing the complexity and potentially the gas costs of executing the job.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For now, being mindful of the values set for the parameters seems to be the best way forward. If we have other instances of LitePSM in the future, the keeper network job will have to be reworked to deal with multiple contracts, and we might then consider adding option 2. above.</p>\n<p>We also encourage integrators to bundle the swap with a <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@h3li0s/S1ZnJzFSC#Refill-Dai-Buffer\"><code>fill</code> call</a> if the Dai liquidity available at any given moment is not enough. While this increases the gas costs of the transaction, it will mostly be applicable only to very large swaps.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-job-post-mortem/24841\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-job-post-mortem/24841","pubDate":"Fri, 09 Aug 2024 15:42:23 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24841"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-job-post-mortem/24841.rss","#text":"LitePSM Job Post-Mortem"}},{"title":"LITE-PSM-USDC-A Phase 2 (Major Migration): Proposed Parameters","dc:creator":"rema","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h1><a name=\"lite-psm-usdc-a-phase-2-major-migration-proposed-parameters-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#lite-psm-usdc-a-phase-2-major-migration-proposed-parameters-1\"></a>LITE-PSM-USDC-A Phase 2 (Major Migration): Proposed Parameters</h1>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The data and information presented here is provided for informational purposes only, on an “as is” basis, and without warranty of any kind.

We proposed reducing the delay to 16 hours to be able to assess new parameter changes and react promptly, if needed. Shortly thereafter, we proposed to increase the GSM Pause Delay to 30 hours. This duration aimed to minimize the risk of hostile governance attacks via malicious spells, while still enabling fasted execution compared to the previous 48-hour delay.</p>\n<p><strong>GSM Changes during the LitePSM Migration Plan:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> For the initial phase of the LitePSM migration, we proposed lowering the GSM Pause Delay to 16 hours.

We aim to significantly enhance the value proposition for DAI liquidity providers on Uniswap V4 by using our advanced rehypothecation features to allow DAI LPs to rehypothecate idle funds (outside the current tick) to the DSR. We will also support rehypothecation to SparkLend itself. <a href=\"https://x.com/bunni_xyz/status/1821198979771826506\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Announcement</a></p>\n<p>About Bunni v2</p>\n<p>Bunni v2 builds on the solid foundation of Uniswap v4 by offering several unique features that set it apart in the DeFi space:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shapeshifting Liquidity: Provide liquidity in any shape, allowing for tailored liquidity distributions that optimize fee income and minimize impermanent loss.</li>\n<li>Dynamic Liquidity Shifting: Automatically adjust liquidity positions using TWAP or Chainlink oracles based on market conditions.</li>\n<li>ERC-20 Wrapped LP Tokens: Simplify liquidity management by converting non-fungible Uniswap V3 positions into fungible ERC-20 tokens, which can be easily used as collateral.</li>\n<li>Rehypothecation: Allows idle assets in liquidity positions to be deployed into yield-generating protocols like the DSR, Aave, or Gearbox, maximizing earning potential for liquidity providers.</li>\n<li>am-AMM: Optimizes performance by auctioning the right to set swap fees, minimizing losses from informed trades and maximizing revenue, with proceeds benefiting liquidity providers and pool managers essentially trading for free opening the door for arbitrage opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rehypothecation: A Catalyst for DAI Liquidity</p>\n<p>Our rehypothecation feature is particularly relevant for DAI liquidity providers. Here’s how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Idle Asset Utilization: Idle assets in liquidity positions can be deployed into yield-generating protocols like the DSR, Aave, and Gearbox to maximize liquidity providers’ earning potential.</li>\n<li>Enhanced Yields: DAI liquidity providers can significantly boost their returns by earning additional yield from these external protocols.</li>\n<li>Increased TVL and Protocol Profits: Deploying idle assets into yield-generating activities benefits liquidity providers and increases the total value locked (TVL) and profitability of the protocols involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Collaboration Opportunity</p>\n<p>We understand that AllocatorDAOs must actively engage in market-making against DAI, with at least 10% of their total portfolio. See <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp8-mip-amendment-subproposals/20761/7#h-7212-cash-stablecoin-market-making-requirements-81\">7.2.1.2: Cash Stablecoin Market Making Requirements.</a> Utilizing some of the POL to do this on Bunni v2 seems reasonable, considering our advantages in LP returns. We also have additional features specifically designed for market makers, such as our open-source am-AMM implementation, <a href=\"https://x.com/boredGenius/status/1773029505831174632\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bid Dog</a>. This would benefit AllocatorDAO market-making because, as the pool manager, they can trade without fees.</p>\n<p>Benefits for AllocatorDAOs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Returns: By earning additional yield from the DSR on idle DAI, AllocatorDAOs can significantly boost their overall returns on their holdings.</li>\n<li>Increased Capital Efficiency: The rehypothecation feature ensures that assets not currently used for trading are actively generating yield, improving the capital efficiency of the AllocatorDAOs’ portfolio.</li>\n<li>Automated Management: The process is fully automated, reducing the need for manual management and allowing AllocatorDAOs to benefit from additional yields without extra effort.</li>\n<li>Risk Mitigation: Utilizing the DSR for rehypothecation ensures that idle assets are deployed into a secure and stable yield-generating environment, mitigating risks associated with more volatile yield opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next Steps</p>\n<p>We invite you to try our testnet, which recently went live at Bunni.xyz. There, you can get a hands-on feel for how this would work. We are excited about the potential for this integration and look forward to further discussions on how we can bring these ideas to life. We hope to go live on mainnet the same day as Uniswap v4.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/enhancing-dai-liquidity-provision-with-bunnis-rehypothecation-features/24823\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/enhancing-dai-liquidity-provision-with-bunnis-rehypothecation-features/24823","pubDate":"Wed, 07 Aug 2024 16:45:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24823"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/enhancing-dai-liquidity-provision-with-bunnis-rehypothecation-features/24823.rss","#text":"Enhancing DAI Liquidity Provision with Bunni's Rehypothecation Features"}},{"title":"Analysis of Recent Market Downturn and Liquidations in MakerDAO Core System and SparkLend Protocol","dc:creator":"definikola","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Due to the recent substantial market decline, the SparkLend protocol experienced more liquidations in the past few days than it had over the entire previous year, while MakerDAO Core system experienced the most liquidations since April this year.
