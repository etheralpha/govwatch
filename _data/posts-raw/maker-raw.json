The budget that an AD is responsible for accumulates in the AD buffer. It cannot be spent until it contains at least 1 month’s worth of budget. Once monthly, all ADs can request payments from their buffers. An AD’s monthly payment request can be any amount as long as there is still at least one month worth of budget remaining after the payments are made. Payments can be requested to multiple addresses at once and can include the address that controls the AD’s PDM. ADs can include descriptions of what the payments are for, which can include personal compensation, compensation to team contributors, research expenses, and more. The Governance Facilitators then include the payments in the next Executive Spell. PDs must only use the full amounts of their budgets if they are contributing significant, best in class work towards the development of the Atlas, and their budget use must generally be scaled according to their level of Atlas contributions.</p>\n<h6><a name=\"atl26341-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#atl26341-12\"></a>ATL2.6.3.4.1</h6>\n<p>An AD buffer stops accumulating when it contains 3 months of an AD’s budget.

The reduction in budget is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 AD budget at 75% voting activity. If an AD falls below 75% voting activity over the last 6 months, it loses qualification for AD income and any AD budget rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest AD by total amount of MKR delegated to their Seasonally Active PDM.

This must be done at a level that adequately protects the Maker Ecosystem from physical risk posed by the potential for attacks against ADs. If there’s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the operational security of an AD has been compromised, or that they have failed to follow best practice or otherwise made operational security errors, FacilitatorDAOs must immediately derecognize the AD. As specified in 2.6.3.4.3 part of the AD Buffer can be confiscated and used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor responsibly provided useful information for determining that the operational security of an AD was compromised. GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of the whistleblower bounty.</p>\n<p>To support the security of the protocol, PDs and RDs must use the PagerDuty emergency tool to deal with spell related emergencies. The operational security requirements of ADs must conform to enable high opsec, best practice use of PagerDuty by ADs.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-bootstrapping-edit-proposal/24557\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-bootstrapping-edit-proposal/24557","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Jun 2024 15:37:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24557"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-bootstrapping-edit-proposal/24557.rss","#text":"Atlas bootstrapping Edit proposal"}},{"title":"Request for Assistance with Recovering Stolen ETH Transferred into MakerDAO","dc:creator":"emcee72","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p><strong>Dear MakerDAO Support Team,</strong></p>\n<p>I hope this message finds you well.

The debt ceiling for this vault is at zero, Drop redemptions have been submitted, and there are no additional actions for Maker to take at this time.</p>\n<p>This loan remains backed by a portfolio of Revenue Based Financing assets, in which each asset is a loan to a business (typically a small business or SaaS company), itself collateralized by a percentage of that business’s gross revenues.</p>\n<p>Fortunafi is failing a number of covenants: the co-investor ratio (now almost at zero), the YoY growth rate, and the minimum Fortunafi Tin investment (however, there are two additional affiliated entities which own Tin tokens, and if included, these would increase the ownership percentage above that covenant’s threshold). As mentioned above, the minimum tin percentage is also failing.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"harbor-trade-rwa-004-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#harbor-trade-rwa-004-9\"></a>Harbor Trade (RWA-004)</h2>\n<p>The Harbor Trade transaction still has 1.6mm Dai outstanding from the vault as of the end of May, and the workout process for the portfolio is ongoing. The DAO has reduced the debt ceiling to zero and submitted a redemption for its holdings.</p>\n<p>The vault’s three assets (totaling $2.1mm) are in default. These defaulted assets collateralize the $1.8mm in aggregate Drop token market value and were issued by a single consumer electronics company, which has in turn pledged its receivables as collateral.</p>\n<p>The default began in April 2023 and Harbor Trade is currently engaged in a workout process to recover as much value as possible for the transaction. As of May 2024, Steakhouse <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/harbor-trade-credit-workout-process/24367\">has requested funding for legal expenses</a> from the DAO to assist Harbor Trade in the recovery as it begins litigation in Germany.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"consolfreight-rwa-003-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#consolfreight-rwa-003-10\"></a>ConsolFreight (RWA-003)</h2>\n<p>The ConsolFreight portfolio currently consists of delinquent and defaulted assets. One delinquent asset remains with a balance of $196k alongside two default assets (Hanhwa) totaling approximately $1.9mm. These $2.1M in assets support 1.9M (market value) in Drop tokens, of which $1.7M belong to Maker’s vault.</p>\n<p>The legal process for the defaulted loans (Hanhwa) is still ongoing. In late May, ConsolFreight provided an update on the recovery process:</p>\n<p><em>We remain optimistic that the Court will grant our request for the Liquidator and Directed to provide many, if not most, of the documents we have sought through our subpoenas and preliminary discovery application. A separate application for preliminary discovery has been filed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Regarding our argument on “actual or apparent possession” of the goods that the Liquidator sold upon his appointment, we faced some challenges. While we had a strong enough argument to seek preliminary discovery, the Buyer Trade Finance Agreement (BTFA) does not entirely circumvent the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR) requirements in Australia. The PPSR ensures transparency regarding who has a security interest in goods through registration or possession.</em></p>\n<p><em>Despite these challenges, there is still potential for claims against the Liquidator if the documents reveal that he was aware of any wrongdoing by Hanhwa concerning our goods. Similarly, we may have claims against Directed if it is shown that they were aware of the BTFA when acquiring the goods before liquidation.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Court has not yet delivered a judgment, which is an unusual delay. The delay could indicate that the Registrar is carefully considering which documents should be provided, but it is difficult to determine the exact cause. The Registrar may simply have a heavy workload.</em></p>\n<p><em>With Hanhwa director now bankrupted and out of the picture, our straightforward claim has become more complex. Our chances of success against the Liquidator and Directed will largely depend on the Registrar’s decision on our preliminary discovery application and the documents produced. Once we have access to these documents, we will be able to provide a more informed opinion.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your continued patience and support. We will keep you informed of any further developments.</em></p>\n<p>As a reminder, on August 24th of 2023, Steakhouse and ConsolFreight <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/consolfreight-rwa-003-cf4-drop-default/21745\">alerted</a> MakerDAO that the pools largest position, Hanhwa, was expected to default. The balance of the affected position is roughly 1.8mm out of the 2.5mm portfolio (as of October 2023 month-end). There is not currently a good estimate for expected recovery, but it is very possible the Drop token is impacted.

This current total pool size is $146,500,000.</p>\n<p>In the period 14 March to 18 March, the DAI necessary to be paired dropped from 49,892.39 to 49,889.63 and from 49,890.20 to 49,886.15 in the period 18 March to 29 March, following the trend highlighted in the previous analyses. The same could be seen for 29 March to 14 June, where the DAI necessary to be paired dropped from 74,855.79 to 74,851.59. This time, the drop is also primarily due to the growth in the pool liquidity size, which comes from SBE’s transactions. In the last period, there had also been some visible impact on the market, which resulted in spikes. That could be primarily explained by a fast price movement or gaps in the maker price.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/c/ec69870cfe91fa23e855db306f526833bda0c845.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xJoM26IQe5HNM23v1LqgyEZzSpD.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/c/ec69870cfe91fa23e855db306f526833bda0c845_2_689x425.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"xJoM26IQe5HNM23v1LqgyEZzSpD\" width=\"689\" height=\"425\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/c/ec69870cfe91fa23e855db306f526833bda0c845_2_689x425.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/c/ec69870cfe91fa23e855db306f526833bda0c845_2_1033x637.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/c/ec69870cfe91fa23e855db306f526833bda0c845.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F4F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"distribution-of-delay-periods-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#distribution-of-delay-periods-6\"></a>Distribution of Delay Periods</h1>\n<p>From 14 March 2024 to 18 March 2024 (4.29 days), the SBE executed 15 actions, equal to the theoretical maximum of 15 transactions given <code>hop</code> 26,280.

At <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/introducing-atlas-axis-gait-kick-off-call-jan-29-8pm-cet/23501\">Atlas Axis</a>, our mission is to prepare the foundational infrastructure necessary for this future.</p>\n<p>Driving our efforts is the recognition that a paradigm shift in governance necessitates a corresponding transformation in how ecosystem intelligence is generated. The Atlas is a modular structure composed of collaboratively generated and constantly evolving atomic parts. The efficacy of the Atlas as a whole will depend on the extent to which its parts undergo a “trial by fire” through critical scrutiny and refinement of ideas sourced from the community.</p>\n<p>Today, we are a small team laying the groundwork for the Atlas to serve as the ecosystem’s “Grand Central” of data and knowledge. We are looking for exceptional full-time collaborators to join the founding team of Atlas Axis. Scaling our capacity is critical, as it opens the door to the integration of additional Atlas workstreams and collaborators.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>\n<p>As a founding team member, you will play a critical role in driving forward all key deliverables, from conducting research to gather raw data for the Atlas, to enhancing Atlas core infrastructure and meta-rules; from coordinating Alignment Conservers and other ecosystem stakeholders, to drafting and reviewing Atlas data.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You should be well familiar with the Atlas (gen1, starting <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>) and MakerDAO.

We’re grinding through mountains of data and need intense focus to navigate the multiple interconnections among data points.</li>\n<li>Obsessive about learning and tackling complex problems.</li>\n<li>Strong organizational skills. Meticulous, detail-oriented. A sixth sense for “things being out of order”.</li>\n<li>Exceptional ability to read, analyze and synthesize large volumes of information. Adept at pattern recognition. Strong working memory a must.</li>\n<li>Excellent communication skills.</li>\n<li>Especially, you must write rather quickly (not counting chatGPT). We are a writing-heavy team and we ourselves are learning the Atlas as we build it. This means we have to hash out, in text, fine-grained arguments with one another.</li>\n<li>You must be familiar with wringing meaning out of precise facets of language. Working with the Atlas, you’ll find that seemingly insignificant changes to syntax can transform the logic of a provision. Hopefully, you find this exciting.</li>\n<li>Notion! We’re building out our entire workflow in Notion, so you’ve got to be comfy using it.</li>\n<li>Self-starter. What this means is that you observe and listen deeply so that you can “read between the lines.” We can have a sync, and you can go away with confidence to get from point A to Z with minimal additional direction. You can discern what is needed.</li>\n<li>The above likely means you have operations experience.</li>\n<li>Non-binary thinker. The Atlas presents innumerable, complex legal and ethical issues that cannot be grasped with black-or-white thinking.</li>\n<li>You’re a proud generalist. No hesitation to wear whatever hat is needed. As a founding team member, you’ll be working toward the moonshot with us, but the day to day will involve admin; research; stakeholder coordination; workflow optimization; data input, creation and review; preparation of documentation; etc.</li>\n<li>Culture is key to our future. We look for highly capable colleagues, yes, but also kindness. We look for people who feel sincere love for the mission, people who want to build for a future whose full bloom they will not live to see.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p>\n<p>We offer highly competitive compensation (DAI and MKR), with bonus potential.

We introduce a USDC migration plan from PSM-USDC-A and Coinbase Custody (RWA014-A) to LITE-PSM-USDC-A and a subsequent offboarding plan for PSM-USDC-A. Next, we elaborate on the motivations driving the migration. Relevant information regarding integrations with the LITE-PSM-USDC-A is included. Thereafter, we provide a parameter overview and proposed parameter changes for each phase of the planned migration. Formal parameter proposals and corresponding Scope language change recommendations will be provided in separate forum posts for each phase individually.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In 2020 the concept of the Peg Stability Module (PSM) was first introduced as a mechanism, contributing to the price stability of DAI. Over time the USDC PSM became a building block for DeFi, with many protocols integrating the PSM into their products for its deep liquidity and low fees. A few years later, after Coinbase Custody <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip81-coinbase-usdc-institutional-rewards/17703\">proposed MIP81</a>, Maker’s USDC liquidity also became a source of revenue for MakerDAO.</p>\n<p>Building upon that experiment, MakerDAO has been collaborating with Circle and Coinbase towards an evolution of that traditional custody setup. The outcome of that work is the Lightweight Peg Stability Module (LitePSM), which allows for the custodied funds to be held in the LitePSM contract as opposed to relying on centralized exchanges or RWA trustees. This way the LitePSM balance acts as a price stability mechanism for DAI, deep liquidity source for DAI/USDC and also generates higher-tier marketing rewards from Coinbase.</p>\n<p>As explained in the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-lite-psm/blob/5df953b2956033c1d9690f6730d3d62dd6fbe660/README.md\">LITE-PSM-USDC-A repository</a>, the Lightweight Peg Stability Module implementation (LITE-PSM-USDC-A/LitePSM) is heavily inspired by previous PSM designs, including the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-psm/blob/v2/src/psm.sol\">current PSM</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-psm/blob/v2/src/psm.sol\">PSM v2</a>. The objective of LITE-PSM-USDC-A is to replace PSM-USDC-A as a facility through which users can swap Dai for USDC — either with no slippage, or with swap fees enabled. One of the most exciting new features for regular users and integrations is much higher gas efficiency while interacting with the module. Below, we briefly explain the most relevant features and functionalities that <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code> enables. For a more detailed technical description of the new LitePSM, refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-lite-psm/blob/5df953b2956033c1d9690f6730d3d62dd6fbe660/README.md\">Lightweight Peg Stability Module (PSM) implementation Github repository</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"new-features-and-functionalities-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#new-features-and-functionalities-3\"></a>New Features and Functionalities</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"new-custody-functionality-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#new-custody-functionality-4\"></a>New Custody Functionality</h2>\n<p>The LitePSM design allows for the PSM <code>gem</code> balance to be held in a different address, with the main constraint being that <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code> should be able to freely move any amount of <code>gem</code> on behalf of the custody address. For Coinbase Prime to distribute USDC rewards to MakerDAO, they need to be custodians of the assets which are used to calculate the USDC reward amount. This requirement is similar to the current Coinbase Custody (RWA014-A) solution, whereby MakerDAO sends USDC from the PSM to Coinbase Custody in connection with the Coinbase Institutional USDC Rewards Program. However in the new system design, all funds are custodied onchain without reliance on TradFi banks and RWA trustees.</p>\n<p>USDC will be kept in a Coinbase Web3 Wallet (W3W) which will not be able to perform any transactions after the setup because at least 1 key shard will be burnt.</p>\n<p>This will be further explained in the separate forum post specifically dedicated to the legal related items and included in the DAO Resolution which will be included in one of the future executive votes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"gas-efficiency-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#gas-efficiency-5\"></a>Gas Efficiency</h2>\n<p>Previous PSM implementations (including PSM-USDC-A) are relatively gas intensive since they directly manipulate the <code>vat</code> on every swap through the minting and burning of DAI. With the purpose of reducing gas costs, the LitePSM is designed to maintain a fixed-sized amount of pre-minted DAI (<code>buf</code>). This design reduces the PSM swap to two ERC20 token transfers in a pool of DAI and the PSM-supported stablecoin. The pre-minted DAI can only be released and enter circulation when new LitePSM stablecoin deposits have been made. The DAI in the (<code>buf</code>) is not considered as circulating supply, and can instead be thought of as a portion of the available debt ceiling supply, but in the pre-minted form.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"no-fees-for-authorized-parties-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#no-fees-for-authorized-parties-6\"></a>No Fees for Authorized Parties</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-psm/blob/v2/README.md\">dss-psm</a> design allows Maker Governance to set optional fees in both directions of a PSM swap. These fees are controlled by the parameters <code>tin</code> and <code>tout</code>. The new LitePSM design will also utilize these parameters for setting optional fees for permissionless swaps. However, the new design also enables authorized parties to swap using the functions <code>buyGemNoFee</code> and <code>sellGemNoFee</code>. This new design offers Maker Governance greater flexibility in setting PSM fees. For example, Maker Governance can set positive <code>tin</code> and <code>tout</code> for permissionless swaps while offering zero fees to authorized actors, which can be used by future AllocatorDAOs responsible for market making and arbitraging with various external markets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"additional-corresponding-features-and-parameter-changes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#additional-corresponding-features-and-parameter-changes-7\"></a>Additional Corresponding Features and Parameter Changes</h2>\n<p>Since the LitePSM has the pre-minted DAI in the (<code>buf</code>), the <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#10-2-3-debt-ceiling-breaker\">LINE_MOM GSM Exception</a> is not sufficient to temporarily disable the module, therefore the PSM_MOM will be deployed which will have the ability to halt swaps on the LitePSM.</p>\n<p>The GSM delay will be reduced during the first phase of the migration process in order to allow for a faster reaction time in case of unwanted events.</p>\n<p>The Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) will be increased, as the long-term plan is to remove this feature from the system and the LitePSM module is not supported by the ESM. There is still some value of maintaining the module until the full deployment of the Allocation System as part of the Endgame, but the threshold should be increased in order to prevent hostile activation when the module should not be used.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"lite-psm-usdc-a-parameters-overview-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#lite-psm-usdc-a-parameters-overview-8\"></a>LITE-PSM-USDC-A Parameters Overview</h1>\n<p>Below, we list LitePSM parameters that need to be determined by Maker Governance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Toll/Fee In (<code>tin</code>): <code>tin</code> is a percentage fee applied when trading the collateral asset into the PSM in exchange for DAI.</li>\n<li>Toll/Fee Out (<code>tout</code>): <code>tout</code> is the percentage fee applied when trading DAI into the PSM in exchange for the collateral asset.</li>\n<li><code>DC-IAM line</code> (Maximum Debt Ceiling): The maximum amount of debt the LITE-PSM-USDC-A can accrue.</li>\n<li><code>DC-IAM gap</code> (Target Available Debt): The target gap between the debt usage and the Debt Ceiling.</li>\n<li><code>DC-IAM ttl</code> (Ceiling Increase Cooldown): The minimum time requirement before it is possible to increase the debt ceiling.</li>\n<li><code>buf</code>: A fixed-sized amount of pre-minted Dai which LITE-PSM-USDC-A is designed to maintain most of the time. Note, however, that when a user calls <code>buyGem</code>, the amount of DAI available can be temporarily larger than <code>buf</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"lite-psm-usdc-a-migration-plan-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#lite-psm-usdc-a-migration-plan-9\"></a>LITE-PSM-USDC-A Migration Plan</h1>\n<p>There are four main goals that need to be considered when deciding on how migration will be processed and parameter values chosen during different phases of the migration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure DAI peg stability through the migration process</li>\n<li>Minimize the negative impact on existing integrations with PSM-USDC-A and incentivize their migration to the LITE-PSM-USDC-A</li>\n<li>Have a test period for the new module with low exposure and potential damage in case of unwanted outcomes</li>\n<li>Maximize the yield generated on stablecoin reserves while achieving above items</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed plan only refers to the first migration, specifically to what currently exists. The later migrations, including wrapper for NST &amp; LitePSM (DAI) and LitePSM (NST) at a later stage can repeat similar steps based on the outcomes of this migration and potentially be improved.</p>\n<p>The target date for Phase 1 part of the migration process is expected to be included in the executive vote on July 11, but could be postponed, which will be communicated in this forum post in such a case. The duration of Phase 1 and Phase 2 is an estimate. Formal proposals for each of the migration phases will be in the form of a separate forum posts, which will follow the regular governance process. The proposal for Phase 1 of migration will also be subject to an onchain governance poll in order to authorize the deployment of LITE-PSM-USDC-A and the migration process. Various parameter values defined in this forum post might change in the formal proposals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"migration-in-phases-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#migration-in-phases-10\"></a>Migration in Phases</h3>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 - Test period (approximate 4 week duration), included in July 11 spell</strong></p>\n<p>The main goal of Phase 1 is to have a low exposure period and additionally give integrators sufficient time to become familiar with the LitePSM and start migrating their solutions from PSM-USDC-A.

This collaboration aims to enhance the functionality and reach of both platforms by supporting BounceBit’s native assets, BBTC and BBUSD, which are Liquidity-Secured Derivatives (LSD) from Ceffu. The integration will enable effective funding rate arbitrage and yield generation for these assets, aligning with the strategic goals of both entities to foster innovation and growth in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"background-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#background-1\"></a>Background</h3>\n<p>BounceBit’s unique CeDeFi infrastructure blends centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to provide parallel yield generation. Users can earn original CeFi yield while utilizing LSD for BTC staking and on-chain farming, known as restaking in Bitcoin. This ecosystem offers three types of yield for Bitcoin holders: original CeFi yield, node operation rewards from staking BTC on the BounceBit chain, and opportunity yield from participating in on-chain applications and the Bounce Launchpad.</p>\n<p>BBTC and BBUSD have been developed as part of a strategic initiative to leverage the stability and security of LSD mechanisms provided by Ceffu. The primary goal is to facilitate seamless and profitable interactions in arbitrage and lending/borrowing scenarios on the BounceBit chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"value-to-the-community-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#value-to-the-community-2\"></a>Value to the Community</h3>\n<p>Integrating MakerDAO’s lending and borrowing services with BounceBit will bring significant value to the community through several use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Utility and Liquidity</strong>: BBTC and BBUSD holders can leverage their assets for yield farming, staking, and arbitrage within a secure and efficient framework.</li>\n<li><strong>Premium Yield Generation</strong>: Users can participate in premium yield generation strategies such as funding rate arbitrage through Ceffu’s MirrorX solution, enabling access to deep liquidity on multiple asset markets with reduced counterparty risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Asset Management</strong>: Users gain access to diversified asset management services, allowing them to choose strategies that best fit their risk tolerance and investment goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Security and Compliance</strong>: The integration will adhere to high standards of security and regulatory compliance, ensuring user trust and system integrity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"additional-information-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#additional-information-3\"></a>Additional Information</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stablecoin Support</strong>: BBUSD is backed 1:1 by USDT and FDUSD in Ceffu, enhancing its stability and reliability. Stablecoins from various EVM-compatible Chains, such as FDUSD on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) and USDT on Ethereum, can be bridged into the BounceBit ecosystem. Once transferred, these tokens are uniformly mapped and represented as BBUSD within BounceBit.</li>\n<li><strong>KYC Requirements</strong>: KYC is only required for very large customers to participate in CeDeFi activities, maintaining ease of access while ensuring compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"proposal-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposal-4\"></a>Proposal</h3>\n<p>We propose that MakerDAO deploy its lending and borrowing protocols on the BounceBit chain to support BBTC and BBUSD. This deployment will allow BounceBit users to leverage their assets for additional financial operations, such as yield farming and arbitrage, within the safe and efficient framework provided by MakerDAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"technical-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#technical-considerations-5\"></a>Technical Considerations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asset Compatibility</strong>: BounceBit will ensure that BBTC and BBUSD are fully compatible with MakerDAO protocols by aligning with the technical requirements of MakerDAO. This includes adapting the asset management to integrate smoothly with MakerDAO’s operations on both testnet and mainnet.</li>\n<li><strong>Security and Compliance</strong>: User contributions to Total Value Locked (TVL) are securely managed by Mainnet Digital’s regulated custodial services, assuring both compliance and safety. These assets are then mirrored via Ceffu’s MirrorX service, a key integration by BounceBit that maintains on-chain visibility and transparency of these assets. All integrations will adhere to the highest standards of security and regulatory compliance, with regular audits and reviews to maintain system integrity and user trust.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"implementation-phases-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#implementation-phases-6\"></a>Implementation Phases</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initial Testing on Testnet</strong>: Deploy MakerDAO protocols on the BounceBit testnet for initial integration testing and to gather user feedback.</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment on Mainnet</strong>: Following successful testnet trials and necessary adjustments, deploy the protocols on the BounceBit mainnet.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"expected-outcomes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#expected-outcomes-7\"></a>Expected Outcomes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced utility and liquidity for BBTC and BBUSD on the BounceBit platform.</li>\n<li>Expanded opportunities for users to engage in lending, borrowing, and arbitrage.</li>\n<li>Strengthened collaboration between BounceBit and MakerDAO, setting a precedent for future cooperative efforts within the DeFi ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>BounceBit’s infrastructure is meticulously architected to elevate Bitcoin’s status from a passive asset to an active, yield-generating instrument. By offering an integrated platform where Bitcoin holders can capitalize on the strengths of both CeFi and DeFi, BounceBit is pioneering a new chapter in asset optimization and financial innovation within the blockchain space. We believe this proposal aligns with the strategic goals of both MakerDAO and BounceBit, offering substantial benefits to our users and the broader DeFi community.

In addition to the standard features of Aave v3, Spark has a close integration with the core Maker protocol to facilitate deep liquidity and low, stable DAI borrowing rates.</p>\n<p>To date, the Sparklend mainnet deployment has restricted listings to a very limited number of assets including the largest and most lindy liquid staking tokens, which keeps the overall risk exposure of the market low. However, with the recent growth of restaking activity in defi, there is now a growing opportunity to take advantage of unmet borrowing demand by listing liquid restaking tokens (LRTs).</p>\n<p>Etherfi’s weETH is the largest and most liquid LRT on the market currently, with over $4 billion in TVL. Etherfi also stands out as the only large LRT with withdrawals fully enabled, which helps ensure stable liquidity and a strong peg vs underlying ETH. Given these features, and current low level of competition for borrowing USD stablecoins using LRT collateral, listing weETH offers an attractive growth opportunity to increase total DAI borrow volume on Sparklend.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"fundamental-risk-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#fundamental-risk-3\"></a>Fundamental Risk</h3>\n<p>This section covers fundamental and qualitative risk factors for Etherfi, Eigenlayer, and weETH.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"technical-risk-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#technical-risk-4\"></a>Technical Risk</h4>\n<p>Both Etherfi and Eigenlayer have gone through significant auditing and code review processes. Eigenlayer has undergone 4 audits plus an audit competition, while Etherfi has also undergone 4 audits plus an audit competition. Eigenlayer and Etherfi also offer bug bounty programs through Immunefi, with maximum payouts of $2 million and $200,000 respectively. While the auditing and bounty provisions are adequate, the maximum caps for bounties may be on the low end considering the amount of value secured in the protocols. In each case, the maximum bounty payout is well below 0.01% of the protocols’ TVL.</p>\n<p>Etherfi and Eigenlayer have both been operating without exploits or bugs for roughly 1 year. Given the significant time integrated TVL during this period, they have accrued a decent level of technical lindyness. However, each protocol has seen upgrades over this period particularly to support AVS, which opens up the possibility of bugs being introduced into the protocols. So we can only rely on historical time and TVL as evidence of security to a limited degree.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"validation-and-slashing-risk-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#validation-and-slashing-risk-5\"></a>Validation and Slashing Risk</h4>\n<p>As a liquid restaking token, weETH is subject to validation risk and slashing conditions for not only Ethereum protocol staking, but also staking via Eigenlayer AVS. Currently, Eigenlayer does not have slashing enabled for AVS staking, so there is no direct threat of slashing from operator failures during restaking. AVS slashing is not expected to be enabled in the near future, but over the medium term this will present an additional operational risk to LRTs like weETH.</p>\n<p>Etherfi currently has a whitelisting process to accept operators to validate for the protocol. Once whitelisted by the team (based on the team’s assessment of operator performance history and infrastructure), operators can place bids in ETH to earn the right to operate an Etherfi validator. There are plans to open up validation to more operators over time but the exact details to remove whitelisting have not been shared at present. As Etherfi onboards with more AVS, the operational overhead for validating for weETH is expected to increase significantly, and operator management may present a key challenge for scaling the protocol and minimizing slashing risk.</p>\n<p>Etherfi has also entered into certain restaking agreements with AVS which commit them to providing certain amounts of restaked value (eg. <a href=\"https://x.com/ether_fi/status/1771228157548384672\">Ethos</a>). This may help boost weETH returns, but also represents a significant commitment on the part of token holders due to restaking operational risks and lack of clarity over returns. If Etherfi is unable to provide the agreed upon restake amount, weETH holders may also lose the potential benefits of AVS rewards or token distributions.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"centralization-and-admin-risk-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#centralization-and-admin-risk-6\"></a>Centralization and Admin Risk</h4>\n<p>Etherfi recently launched their governance token ETHFI via an airdrop to stakers. However, at present key admin authorities over the protocol are controlled by a 4 of 7 multisig, with 3 signers from the core team and 4 external signers. Most controls sit behind a 3 day timelock, with the exception of AVS related actions which are not subject to timelock due to their active state of development and deployment. The timeline for renouncing centralized admin authorities or transferring them to the DAO is somewhat unclear, with a <a href=\"https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/governance/governance-roadmap\">stated plan</a> to deploy full DAO governance in the coming months. The ETHFI governance token is immutable and has a fixed supply.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"redemptions-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#redemptions-7\"></a>Redemptions</h4>\n<p>Etherfi stands out as the only large LRT to offer redemptions to ETH. This provides a key arbitrage mechanism in cases where weETH falls below the value of underlying ETH holdings, as users can buy up discounted weETH and then unstake. This is similar to other LSTs like stETH and rETH, where activation of redemptions has significantly improved their resilience and peg strength. As an example, stETH saw persistent discounts vs peg of up to 7% before redemptions were enabled, but since then the stETH price has consistently stayed within 0.5% of underlying value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether\">Coingecko stETH</a></p>\n<p>Eigenlayer introduces an additional 1 week withdrawal delay for restaked ETH, so we can expect that redemptions may provide somewhat lower price support for weETH versus traditional LSTs. Because of the additional Eigenlayer withdrawal delay, we estimate that fully withdrawing from weETH will take roughly 1 week longer than withdrawing from comparable LSTs like rETH or stETH. The result is that LRTs like weETH are likely to face larger discounts in a broad based market crash vs traditional LSTs like rETH and stETH, as the redemption arbitrage loop has a greater duration and therefore a lower yield to maturity for a given discount.</p>\n<p>EtherFi also maintains a pool of liquid ETH inside the protocol to service withdrawals within 24 hours of user requests. Historically, this has amounted to roughly 2-3% of total ETH backing, and currently it is somewhat higher at roughly ~120,000 ETH. This represents an additional source of available liquidity to service withdrawals immediately, which can help prevent weETH from trading below redemption value during a market crash.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"market-risk-and-liquidity-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#market-risk-and-liquidity-8\"></a>Market Risk and Liquidity</h3>\n<p>This section discusses market and liquidity risk factors and process for determining appropriate asset specific parameters.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"weeth-liquidity-profile-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#weeth-liquidity-profile-9\"></a>weETH Liquidity Profile</h4>\n<p>weETH has several onchain sources of liquidity via DEX pools, in addition to the primary market liquidity provided through minting and redemptions. The largest DEX for weETH on mainnet is Uniswap v3, with $84 million TVL in weETH&lt;&gt;ETH pool and $29 million TVL in weETH&lt;&gt;wstETH pool. Balancer also offers an additional liquidity source, with $46 million in a weETH&lt;&gt;rETH pool and $15 million in a LRT pool including weETH, Renzo’s ezETH, and Swell’s rswETH.</p>\n<p>However, the selection of pair assets makes some of these pools less resilient in case of broad market downturns or buildups in the Ethereum staking withdrawal queue. For example, the LRT Balancer pool provides limited assurance as neither ezETH or rswETH are currently redeemable, so any weETH sold through this pool would need to rely on limited secondary market liquidity for these tokens to swap into ETH or stablecoins. If a withdrawal queue builds up, then this could lead to broad based depegs across LSTs like wstETH and rETH, which would also drag down weETH price and make the weETH&lt;&gt;LST pools less useful.</p>\n<p>The Uniswap weETH&lt;&gt;ETH pool is arguably the most resilient and useful of the liquidity pools as it doesn’t have any reliance on other LSTs/LRTs. However, we note that there is only roughly 20,000 worth of ETH held in the pool available to buy weETH below peg, and it is highly concentrated within ~0.5% of current price. The weETH&lt;&gt;wstETH pool is similarly concentrated, with all wstETH buy side liquidity within 0.2% of current price.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7a415b19932c0105c82fdb6b720bb01b0cc2cae3\">Uniswap Info (v3 weETH&lt;&gt;ETH 0.05%)</a></p>\n<p>Taking aggregated liquidity across all sources from Cowswap, we see that sales up to around ~40,000 weETH can be executed with low market impact, but beyond this point liquidity drops off precipitously. Also note that because liquidity is highly concentrated around redemption price and relies partly on pairs with other LSTs/LRTs, we can expect the market depth to be much lower in cases where weETH trades below par or if there is broad based stress across staked ETH tokens.</p>\n<p>The biggest source of off-peg liquidity (eg. 1-10% away from redemption rate of weETH) is on Balancer, which holds significant liquidity in a composable stable pool, a pool type which provides concentrated liquidity but continues to provide at least some liquidity over the entire range of possible prices. We see the primary Balancer pool with rETH offers liquidity to sell roughly ~3,600 weETH with up to 1% price discount, ~500 additional weETH to reach 2% discount, ~250 to reach 3% discount, and only another ~650 weETH sold to reach all the way to 10% divergence from peg. This demonstrates just how thin liquidity gets below peg, even in the largest pool that provides for full range weETH liquidity on mainnet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1igwzRTyOSpPqVTyRmeAHIDAJwgdDSXPyFlrI4Qy8WX4/edit?usp=sharing\">Data: weETH on Sparklend Mainnet</a></p>\n<p>There are fairly significant pools of onchain leverage using weETH as collateral, which could potentially represent a demand on liquidity in a depeg event. Morpho has ~$15 million of ETH borrowed against weETH at up to 86% LTV, using live oracle pricing through Redstone. Aave has ~$595 million of ETH borrowed against weETH at up to 95% LTV (along with very small amounts of stablecoins collateralized by weETH), but in this case uses fixed pricing where eETH is assumed to always equal 1 ETH, which may lower the risk of sudden cascading liquidations. However, Aave users would still face some liquidation risk, as LST and LRT depegs would tend to push up the utilization and borrow rate for Aave ETH above rate of return for staking, which could push positions into liquidation over time via negative net interest accruals.</p>\n<p>To summarize, DEX liquidity for weETH is ample in normal conditions but may become exhausted during market crashes. The most important source of liquidity for weETH remains the primary market redemptions process. Deeper liquidity over a wider range below peg would help increase efficiency of the redemption arbitrage process during depegs, and provide additional assurance against disorderly flash crashes.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"oracle-settings-and-price-deviation-risk-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#oracle-settings-and-price-deviation-risk-10\"></a>Oracle Settings and Price Deviation Risk</h4>\n<p>weETH can be priced using live market pricing via oracle, or via exchange rate pricing as measured by the weETH to eETH ratio in the wrapping, considering eETH to be worth a fixed 1 ETH value based on redeemability. Aave currently uses an exchange rate pricing mechanism for weETH on their deployment, while Morpho uses live pricing.</p>\n<p>Live pricing has the advantage of potentially liquidation positions earlier in a depeg, before the price of weETH potentially falls further, and can also better account for the possibility of permanent impairments due to technical or slashing losses. But on the other hand, this also creates additional risk of liquidating at excessively low prices during a flash crash, as liquidations and oracle updates can lead to a negative feedback loop of lower prices creating more selling pressure creating further price drops. This sort of event was recently seen on Renzo’s ezETH, which crashed to below 0.8 ETH before quickly recovering.</p>\n<p>On balance, we believe using an exchange rate pricing mechanism rather than live oracle pricing is more appropriate for weETH. While the availability of redemptions may help reduce depeg risk, there is still a possibility of flash crashes occurring as it can take some time for bidders to step in to purchase weETH below par and arbitrage redemptions, while liquidations can happen immediately. Using exchange rate pricing eliminates the risk of liquidating positions based on short term price wicks, which can negatively impact UX and may even result in bad debt to the protocol depending on how low the price falls temporarily.</p>\n<p>However, using exchange rate pricing does create a few new risks. weETH trading at a discount to the exchange/redemption rate results in a higher effective liquidation threshold, as the fair market value of collateral will be lower than suggested by the protocol. And if the weETH discount is larger than the liquidation penalty for weETH collateral, this would halt the liquidation process as liquidating unsafe positions would no longer be profitable (the value of debt repaid would be greater than immediately achievable value of collateral received). weETH parameters such as liquidation threshold (LT), maximum loan to value ratio (LTV), and liquidation penalty should be set with this in mind to account for any reasonably foreseeable, persistent weETH price discounts.</p>\n<p>Our primary mode of evaluating maximum potential discount is by assessing arbitrage profitability from purchasing and redeeming discounted weETH. We make aggressive assumptions that 30% of staked ETH collateral on Aave, Maker, and Compound result in net withdrawals, and 10% of remaining staked ETH is withdrawn, resulting in roughly ~40 days to fully clear the staking withdrawal queue. Then, we compare LST withdrawals vs LRTs like weETH, based on the assumptions that the Eigenlayer withdrawal period puts LRTs towards the end of the exit queue and that arbitrageurs will demand more excess return to unstake LRTs versus traditional LSTs. The resulting estimates are shared below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ODf3MSsz-d_G_VGNgIUvgRlrfJ5O6mvqYRbY1av3nY/edit?usp=sharing\">LST Liquidity Risk</a></p>\n<p>We estimate that LRTs like weETH may experience mid single digit percent discounts based on these arbitrage assumptions, versus low single digit discounts for LSTs like stETH. This suggests that liquidation penalty and liquidation threshold should be set more conservatively for weETH vs Spark’s LST markets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"weeth-parameters-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#weeth-parameters-11\"></a>weETH Parameters</h3>\n<p>The following parameters are proposed based on current market and liquidity conditions for weETH. We recommend to list weETH in isolation mode to prevent it from being used to borrow ETH on equal terms with stETH and rETH, which have a materially lower fundamental and liquidity risk profile. Current omnipool lending protocols like Sparklend cannot charge differential borrowing rates depending on collateral used, so allowing weETH to borrow ETH may not lead to increased ETH supply yield or protocol revenue until substantially all wstETH and rETH collateralized ETH borrowers have been displaced from the protocol. Until this threshold is reached, allowing this would result in increased protocol and liquidity risk with all value being leaked to consumer surplus of weETH collateral users.</p>\n<p>Isolation mode will allow weETH to only be used to borrow DAI, where the risk premia versus alternative collaterals can be equalized through the use of more conservative LTV and liquidation threshold parameters. Due to the significant impact of points earned on weETH, we recommend to disable borrowing as any supply yield earned would likely be less valuable than Etherfi and Eigenlayer points.</p>\n<p>Isolated debt ceiling is set to limit tail risk from unutilized borrowing capacity, with the debt ceiling roughly equaling Maker’s surplus buffer. However, if weETH collateral shows strong demand with the limit being utilized fully, the debt ceiling and supply cap max parameters can be progressively increased. Liquidation threshold is also set conservatively to account for potential price divergence, accommodating up to roughly 8% additional discount vs wstETH. Better liquidity depth below peg or demonstrated peg resilience during a broad based market crash would support raising LT and LTV closer towards parity with Spark’s wstETH and rETH parameters.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimal

One delinquent asset remains with a balance of $196k alongside two default assets (Hanhwa) totaling approximately $1.9M. These $2.1M in assets support 1.9M (market value) in Drop tokens, of which $1.7M belong to Maker’s vault.</p>\n<p>The legal process for the defaulted loans (Hanhwa) is still ongoing. In late May, ConsolFreight provided an update on the recovery process:</p>\n<p><em>We remain optimistic that the Court will grant our request for the Liquidator and Directed to provide many, if not most, of the documents we have sought through our subpoenas and preliminary discovery application. A separate application for preliminary discovery has been filed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Regarding our argument on “actual or apparent possession” of the goods that the Liquidator sold upon his appointment, we faced some challenges. While we had a strong enough argument to seek preliminary discovery, the Buyer Trade Finance Agreement (BTFA) does not entirely circumvent the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR) requirements in Australia. The PPSR ensures transparency regarding who has a security interest in goods through registration or possession.</em></p>\n<p><em>Despite these challenges, there is still potential for claims against the Liquidator if the documents reveal that he was aware of any wrongdoing by Hanhwa concerning our goods. Similarly, we may have claims against Directed if it is shown that they were aware of the BTFA when acquiring the goods before liquidation.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Court has not yet delivered a judgment, which is an unusual delay. The delay could indicate that the Registrar is carefully considering which documents should be provided, but it is difficult to determine the exact cause. The Registrar may simply have a heavy workload.</em></p>\n<p><em>With Hanhwa director now bankrupted and out of the picture, our straightforward claim has become more complex. Our chances of success against the Liquidator and Directed will largely depend on the Registrar’s decision on our preliminary discovery application and the documents produced. Once we have access to these documents, we will be able to provide a more informed opinion.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your continued patience and support. We will keep you informed of any further developments.</em></p>\n<p>As a reminder, on August 24th of 2023, Steakhouse and ConsolFreight <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/consolfreight-rwa-003-cf4-drop-default/21745\">alerted</a> MakerDAO that the pools largest position, Hanhwa, was expected to default.

Its goal is generating optimal Base Rates which depend on the real economy, centralized exchanges, and Maker’s collateral dynamics. The way this model will be implemented makes it possible to change the suggested parameters at any time. The final goal of the model is the automation of Stability Fees through an oracle-based implementation.</p>\n<p>In short, the FiRE generates the Base Rate using a Low-Risk Rate (the 3M T-bills) at 0% Crypto Exposure (percentage of DAI backed by crypto collateral) which increases until Target Crypto Exposure, where it will be equal to the Benchmark Rate (the funding rates on CEXs), scaled by a multiplier. After the Target Crypto Exposure, the rate increases at a larger rate, to reach a maximum (in this case 50%) at 100% Crypto Exposure. The final output of the model will be the Base Rate, which will then be used to calculate Stability Fees and various borrowing rates across AllocatorDAOs as part of the Endgame.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/7/c7a192edba2c465c65b535f98b730d7bb8bae35f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/su1bBypCwApg5ib1FtNT291lCuX.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/7/c7a192edba2c465c65b535f98b730d7bb8bae35f_2_624x363.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"su1bBypCwApg5ib1FtNT291lCuX\" width=\"624\" height=\"363\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/7/c7a192edba2c465c65b535f98b730d7bb8bae35f_2_624x363.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/7/c7a192edba2c465c65b535f98b730d7bb8bae35f_2_936x544.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/7/c7a192edba2c465c65b535f98b730d7bb8bae35f.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAFAFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The resulting stability fees will be the generated Base Rate plus spreads for different Liquidation Ratios and Vault Types or other future factors depending on the activity of AllocatorDAOs.</p>\n<p>Since we believe this would be an innovative approach to stability fee calculation, we are requesting the community’s feedback to comment, criticize, praise, or question this model, in order to improve it and make it a unique example in the DeFi landscape.

As an example, AAVE has adjusted GHO’s borrow rate and the Slope parameters of its markets based on the changes in DSR (<a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-stewards-borrow-rate-update/16956\">Proposal 1</a>, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stablecoin-ir-curve-amendment-on-aave-v2-and-v3-05-13-2024/17692\">Proposal 2</a>, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stablecoin-ir-curve-amendment-on-aave-v2-and-v3-04-22-2024/17450\">Proposal 3</a>…). Exposure to crypto collateral is a very important parameter for Maker, since it can affect peg stability and profit estimation, by affecting the average yield that could be earned by the protocol.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, Maker’s approach to stability fees can be categorized into three phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjustment of the Stability Collateral Yield Benchmark and Yield Collateral Yield Benchmark</li>\n<li>Adjustment based on the Exposure Model</li>\n<li>Adjustment based on external rate environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first approach was unsuccessful because it relied solely on the Yield Collateral Yield Benchmark and the Stability Collateral Yield Benchmark, ignoring the potential external rates achievable in crypto markets. This oversight could result in DAI losing its peg. The second approach, while more accurate, failed to react promptly to sudden changes. The third approach, which successfully priced in borrow rates, presents a philosophical challenge for the Maker protocol and cannot be automated.</p>\n<p>In the DeFi ecosystem, this protocol is viewed as the rate “maker”, setting a standard that others should follow for rate expectations as the largest source of liquidity. However, the latest approach positions the protocol, to a certain extent, as a rate “taker”.</p>\n<p>Consequently, BA Labs is proposing a new framework for stability fee calculation that would position the protocol as a leader in DeFi rate management and in general be more reactive to the external rate environment. This framework would be responsive to developments in the real economy, centralized exchanges, and Maker itself. We suggest naming this framework the Fintegrate Rate Engine (FiRE), as it integrates various financial dimensions with the goal of becoming an automated, oracle-based model during the Endgame Initiative.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"fire-the-new-interest-rate-model-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#fire-the-new-interest-rate-model-3\"></a>FiRE - The new Interest Rate

This suggests that as Federal Reserve interest rates decline, investors turn to alternative yield sources, which in turn positively affect crypto prices, funding rates, and crypto exposure.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/a/fa657ac684f0b0b65c01b987d2576c93719fdf17.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zJ6MLP4j4S5UbHALGiRYA7nElPp.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/a/fa657ac684f0b0b65c01b987d2576c93719fdf17_2_624x420.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"zJ6MLP4j4S5UbHALGiRYA7nElPp\" width=\"624\" height=\"420\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/a/fa657ac684f0b0b65c01b987d2576c93719fdf17_2_624x420.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/a/fa657ac684f0b0b65c01b987d2576c93719fdf17_2_936x630.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/a/fa657ac684f0b0b65c01b987d2576c93719fdf17.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F9F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"historical-backtesting-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#historical-backtesting-17\"></a>Historical Backtesting</h2>\n<p>We first show the time series of input parameters and compare them to the historical Stability Fees for the ETH-C vault.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/6/3611bb502e2020fb72c165c709e2bab7eaeeb0ad.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7IjLWS0B64vP0w4mF8ZszpTC3Ip.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/6/3611bb502e2020fb72c165c709e2bab7eaeeb0ad_2_624x295.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"7IjLWS0B64vP0w4mF8ZszpTC3Ip\" width=\"624\" height=\"295\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/6/3611bb502e2020fb72c165c709e2bab7eaeeb0ad_2_624x295.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/6/3611bb502e2020fb72c165c709e2bab7eaeeb0ad_2_936x442.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/6/3611bb502e2020fb72c165c709e2bab7eaeeb0ad.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>We will now show the Interest Rates backtested during the same period and plotted against the actual stability fees experienced by Maker vaults’ users:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/a/ba782fedad83eee0f7d5475d9fbdd5e4a0d57870.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qBAjbtbZDt1cIFUhTshA4pVqL4s.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/a/ba782fedad83eee0f7d5475d9fbdd5e4a0d57870_2_624x337.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"qBAjbtbZDt1cIFUhTshA4pVqL4s\" width=\"624\" height=\"337\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/a/ba782fedad83eee0f7d5475d9fbdd5e4a0d57870_2_624x337.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/a/ba782fedad83eee0f7d5475d9fbdd5e4a0d57870_2_936x505.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/a/ba782fedad83eee0f7d5475d9fbdd5e4a0d57870.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F8F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>When “zooming-in” the last 8 months, we can clearly see (even though in hindsight) that the model would have returned an Interest Rate that when applied to Stability Fees could have avoided the need for the “Accelerated Proposal”.

By incorporating the suggested parameters, we believe we would be able to propose stability fees that would mirror the market status correctly, in order to minimize the risk of having emergency situations or and/or further accelerated proposals.</p>\n<p>What is important to point out is that this model can be tweaked to reflect new parameters based on the market environment. Let’s suppose that the governance would decide to consider an alternative financial product as the Low-Risk Rate; this can be done by simply changing the Low-Risk Rate calculation methodology.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, once the Endgame will get into the later stages, this model has the potential to become fully automated and oracle-based, in order to respond directly to changes in the broader environment.</p>\n<p>This is why we are as well requesting the community’s feedback, so that this Interest Rate Model could improve Maker’s competitive advantage in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n            <p><small>8 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/fintegrate-rate-engine-fire-introduction-assessment-and-request-for-feedback/24383\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/fintegrate-rate-engine-fire-introduction-assessment-and-request-for-feedback/24383","pubDate":"Wed, 29 May 2024 15:06:34 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24383"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/fintegrate-rate-engine-fire-introduction-assessment-and-request-for-feedback/24383.rss","#text":"Fintegrate Rate Engine (FiRE): Introduction, assessment, and request for feedback"}},{"title":"MIP102c2-SPXX: MIP Amendment Subproposal","dc:creator":"rune","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h1><a name=\"mip102c2-spxx-mip-amendment-subproposal-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#mip102c2-spxx-mip-amendment-subproposal-1\"></a>MIP102c2-SPXX: MIP Amendment Subproposal</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"preamble-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#preamble-2\"></a>Preamble</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">MIP102c2-SP#: \nMIP to be amended: MIP101, MIP104, MIP106, MIP108, MIP113\nAuthor(s): @Rune\nContributors:\nGeneral Edit or Article 1 Edit: General Edit\nTags:\nStatus: Formal Submission\nDate Proposed: 2024-05-29\nDate Ratified: &lt;yyyy-mm-dd&gt;\nForum URL: \n</code></pre>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>This MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact.
