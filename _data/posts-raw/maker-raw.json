Given MakerDAO’s significant role in the ecosystem; I wanted to start a discussion on how MakerDAO could contribute to this emerging sector.</p>\n<p>Currently; many users in the DeFi space face risks related to smart contract vulnerabilities; liquidity crises, and even market volatility. While platforms like Nexus Mutual and Cover Protocol offer insurance-like products; there is still a lot of; room for growth and inno;vation.</p>\n<p>This brings me to MakerDAO’s unique position. With its well-established governance framework, a diverse community, and a stablecoin that i;s widely trusted; MakerDAO could potentially offer more robust and accessible insurance solutions.</p>\n<p>One idea I have been contemplating is the creation of a new insurance product or feature within MakerDAO’s ecosystem. T;his could be similar to how DAI provides stability; but focused on providing insurance coverage for various DeFi activities. For example; we ;could explore creating a pooled insurance fund backed by DAI; where users can contribute DAI to earn rewards and simultaneously provide insurance coverage.</p>\n<p>What do you think are the biggest challenges in implementing DeFi insurance through MakerDAO?

Token Rewards earned from Sealing are unaffected by the Exit Fee.</p>\n<p>The Exit Fee begins at 5% when Sealed Activation launches, and increases by 1% every 6 months for the next 5 years until it reaches 15%, which is the long term Exit Fee.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"newgovtoken-launch-airdrop-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#newgovtoken-launch-airdrop-13\"></a>NewGovToken Launch Airdrop</h2>\n<p>The NewGovTokens accumulated by early adopters during the Brand Reveal will unlock in the Launch Airdrop when Sealed Activation launches, so that they can instantly be used to get the benefits of Sealed Activation.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"newbridge-launch-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#newbridge-launch-14\"></a>NewBridge Launch</h1>\n<p>Following the launch of Sealed Activation, the first version of NewBridge will launch, connecting NewStable, NewGovToken and other Maker Ecosystem tokens from Ethereum Mainnet to major L2s. The real name of NewBridge will be unveiled at the Brand Reveal.</p>\n<p>NewBridge enables low cost native Token Rewards on the supported L2s, giving low cost access to all users.</p>\n<p>Bridges to additional L2s and L1s will follow later.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"spark-a-maker-subdao-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spark-a-maker-subdao-15\"></a>Spark, a Maker SubDAO</h1>\n<p>The pinnacle of Launch Season is the much anticipated launch of SparkDAO, the launch of the SPK token and the start of multichain-enabled SPK Token Rewards.</p>\n<p>Spark focuses on providing innovative lending and DeFi products that can meet proven market demand at scale through the economic power of MakerDAO.</p>\n<p>Spark is the first of Maker’s SubDAOs. It is a specialized, independent community, deeply tied to the Maker Ecosystem, but with autonomy and unique business models.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"sparklend-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#sparklend-16\"></a>SparkLend</h2>\n<p>The main product of Spark is SparkLend, available on <a href=\"http://spark.fi\">spark.fi</a></p>\n<p>SparkLend is a modern lending engine where users can directly generate Dai, and in the future, NewStable, at predictable rates, using crypto as collateral. SparkLend launched a year ago, and is already very popular and widely used in the ecosystem, currently sitting as the 9th biggest DeFi platform by TVL in the world.</p>\n<p>Users of SparkLend are already able to farm the Spark airdrop today, which will grant them SPK tokens when Spark fully launches.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"perpetual-swap-yields-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#perpetual-swap-yields-17\"></a>Perpetual Swap yields</h3>\n<p>Spark also controls a Morpho Lending Market system that is used to allocate hundreds of millions of USD towards the Ethena sUSDe tokenized perpetual swap basis trade.</p>\n<p>During bull markets this is a unique opportunity for generating value, but it is very cyclical and therefore synergizes well with Sparks broad access to diversified capital deployment opportunities.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"real-world-assets-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#real-world-assets-18\"></a>Real World Assets</h3>\n<p>Spark has announced the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/announcement-spark-tokenization-grand-prix-request-for-proposal/24631\">Spark Tokenization Grand Prix</a>, which will give Spark the ability to deploy billions of MakerDAO collateral into the safest and best developed tokenized RWA assets.</p>\n<p>MakerDAO has years of experience being the leading RWA protocol, and this expertise and responsibility is being handed over to Spark, in order to make future RWA related innovation move faster.</p>\n<p>Having access to RWA and the opportunities available in traditional finance complements the on-chain lending business model well, as it allows Spark to shift its exposure to whichever environment has the best risk-adjusted return.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"spark-tokenomics-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spark-tokenomics-19\"></a>Spark Tokenomics</h2>\n<p>The moment Spark Launches, the SPK token will be available as Token Rewards for NewStable users both on Ethereum mainnet and L2s. Token Rewards on L2s will have very low transaction fees. Sealed Activation users will also be able to get SPK tokens the moment Spark launches.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"newgovtoken-regular-activation-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#newgovtoken-regular-activation-20\"></a>NewGovToken Regular Activation</h3>\n<p>When Spark launches, NewGovToken will also get a new feature called Activation. This is a less committed version of Sealed Activation, where NewGovToken holders receive Activation Rewards, but don’t have to Seal their tokens behind and Exit Fee. NewGovToken can be freely Activated and Deactivated instantly, at any time.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"spk-reward-distribution-rates-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spk-reward-distribution-rates-21\"></a>SPK Reward distribution rates</h2>\n<p>The rate of SPK distribution will be 1 billion tokens per year the first 2 years. This will halve every 2 years until a total of 4 billion SPK tokens have been distributed after 10 years.</p>\n<p>This total distribution will be divided so NewStable users will receive Token Rewards at a rate of 700 million SPK tokens per year, Regularly Activated NewGovToken will receive SPK Activation Rewards at a rate of 150 million SPK tokens per year, and Sealed NewGovToken or MKR will receive SPK Activation Rewards at a rate of 150 million SPK tokens per year. This rate will remain in place for the first two years following Spark launch, after which all rates will halve, as described above.</p>\n<p>SPK Token Rewards will not be available to US residents and VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"spk-activation-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spk-activation-22\"></a>SPK Activation</h2>\n<p>The SPK token will have built in Activation Rewards from the moment it launches. SPK Activation will be available both on Ethereum mainnet and L2s.</p>\n<p>Activated SPK will receive NewGovToken Activation Rewards at a rate of 80 million NewGovToken per year.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"spk-pre-farming-airdrop-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spk-pre-farming-airdrop-23\"></a>SPK pre-farming airdrop</h2>\n<p>It is currently possible to farm SPK tokens in advance of the launch of Spark.

Over time Spark Governance will run all aspects of Spark autonomously, within the framework of the Maker SubDAO ecosystem.</p>\n<p>At launch, SPK token holders will initially only manage Community Marketing and the Spark Purpose System. As time progresses and the Spark community strengthens, Maker will delegate additional responsibilities to the SPK token holders.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-marketing-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#community-marketing-25\"></a>Community Marketing</h3>\n<p>The SPK token holders will be able to vote on community marketing grants to provide interesting, unique grass roots initiatives that can help promote the adoption of Spark Products, or increase the ecosystem around Spark.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"spark-purpose-system-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spark-purpose-system-26\"></a>Spark Purpose System</h3>\n<p>A key pillar of SubDAOs like Spark is that they must have a tangible purpose rooted in fundamental human values. This can be a charitable cause, scientific research, open source AI development - whatever it is, it must be a public good that benefits everyone, and it must reflect the values of the SubDAO community. The SPK token holders will have a small portion of SPK tokens available to provide as grants and payments in accordance with the principles of the Purpose System.</p>\n<p>It will be up to the Spark community to figure out what their shared purpose and vision is, and to take positive action that realizes this vision.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"phase-2-scaling-up-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#phase-2-scaling-up-27\"></a>Phase 2: Scaling up</h1>\n<p>Once the basic primitives of Endgame are in place through the rollouts of Phase 1, Phase 2 focuses on scaling them up vertically and horizontally.</p>\n<p>This means more SubDAOs, such as RWA-focused or gaming-focused SubDAOs that cater to different communities and business models. In total 6 SubDAOs will launch during Phase 2 - each will cater to different market segments.</p>\n<p>It also means more bridges, such as bridges to all major, popular L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism or Base, or to other popular L1s like Solana.</p>\n<p>Finally, during Phase 2, the governance responsibilities of SubDAOs will grow to include full autonomy of all SubDAO activities, within the boundaries set by MakerDAO. The delegation of full governance autonomy will happen slowly and deliberately as the SubDAO communities grow to become more capable.</p>\n<p>The delegation of SubDAO governance responsibilities will be accompanied by <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ea-status-update-1-3-detailing-the-powerhouse-vision/24586\">powerful user interfaces</a> and AI tools that help streamline and simplify governance decisions, making it possible for people who aren’t full time experts to still provide valuable input and oversight of the SubDAOs decisions.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"phase-3-newchain-28\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#phase-3-newchain-28\"></a>Phase 3: NewChain</h1>\n<p>The final technical iteration of Endgame occurs in Phase 3 with the creation of NewChain - a stand-alone L1 blockchain that will host the core tokenomics and governance mechanics of Maker Core and the SubDAOs, and be a hotspot for RWA, DeFi and inter-blockchain bridging through the NewBridge system.</p>\n<p>NewChain is an extension of the existing Maker ecosystem, and the launch of NewChain does not mean that Maker is leaving Ethereum. All of the user-facing products that exist on Ethereum today will remain, and more will be launched on Ethereum and other L1 Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>NewChain will be built several years out in the future as a fork of a suitable best-in-class blockchain codebase. Which codebase to use will be decided after a long period of research to ensure that the best possible architecture is chosen.</p>\n<p>When NewChain is live, the SubDAO ecosystem will gain the ability to scale infinitely, with many more SubDAOs getting created at a much higher frequency.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"phase-4-final-endgame-29\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#phase-4-final-endgame-29\"></a>Phase 4: Final Endgame</h1>\n<p>Final Endgame is the moment that all technical and foundational governance mechanisms have been completed, and there are no more developments to make beyond the permanent dynamics of Maker Core and the SubDAO Ecosystem.

SparkLend is uniquely positioned to be the growth engine for stETH adoption. This unique positioning is due to the e-mode “high ltv” looping being exclusive to wstETH, rETH, and ETH.</p>\n<p>SparkLend boasts the second-largest amount of borrowable ETH available with 239k deposited (830m USD) at the time of writing. This ETH market is almost entirely devoted to wstETH looping which means that nearly 100% of rewards expenditures on the ETH market will result in increased market share for Lido.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#background-2\"></a>Background</h2>\n<p>Spark is the first Maker subDAO, with a mission to accelerate the growth and adoption of the DAI by integrating top DeFi solutions. Since its inception, Spark has launched three products: SparkLend, Spark Cash &amp; Savings, and Spark Conduits. SparkLend, in particular, has become one of the top three lending markets in DeFi, with 40,000 ETH available for borrowing.</p>\n<p>Maker has a long-standing partnership with Lido, having been one of the first protocols to onboard wstETH as collateral for DAI loans. SparkLend continues this alignment by being the most compatible lending protocol with Lido for wstETH looping. This is achieved by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>SPK Rewards on ETH Supply Side</strong>: SparkLend offers SPK rewards to those who supply ETH, incentivizing participation and liquidity in the market.</li>\n<li><strong>Restricted Asset Set in ETH e-mode</strong>: SparkLend restricts the set of allowed assets in the ETH e-mode to wstETH, rETH, and ETH. This strategic limitation benefits Lido’s market share by focusing on assets that promote Lido.</li>\n<li><strong>Low ETH Reserve Factor</strong>: SparkLend’s ETH market has the lowest take rate, 5%, improving the rate for suppliers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These measures ensure that SparkLend is closely aligned with Lido, reinforcing the long-standing partnership and supporting the growth of Lido’s ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposal-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposal-3\"></a>Proposal</h2>\n<p>Phoenix Labs has initiated a program of 225 wstETH provided by Lido over 90 days, to be paid as incentives on the SparkLend ETH market borrow side.

There is no such thing as a module that is easy to build when billions are at stake.</p>\n<p>It was definitely a humbling experience, and we probably would have not seen it through if it were not for the guidance and the patience of some senior members with extensive experience with the Maker Protocol.</p>\n<p>We are proud to present the Maker Community a brand new implementation that will allow for cheaper swaps and also become a source of revenue for the protocol.</p>\n<p>As explained in the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-lite-psm-usdc-a-introduction-and-overview/24512\">introduction post by BA Labs</a>, the migration from the existing PSM to LitePSM will happen in phases. They will co-exist for a while, but we strongly encourage users and integrators to switch to LitePSM as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#overview-2\"></a>Overview</h2>\n<p>A Peg Stability Module (PSM) is a facility through which users can freely swap Dai for stablecoins with no slippage. MakerDAO Governance can enable swap fees, though, which are computed as revenue for the protocol.</p>\n<p>This module is heavily inspired by the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-psm/blob/7d717d88d6b6dfcb346119369647969df6cadad3/src/psm.sol\">current PSM</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-psm/blob/273e4811890fff425b5e3c5f054b2d4d693590fe/src/psm.sol\">PSM v2</a> and some other PSM prototypes within MakerDAO repositories.</p>\n<p>The issue with those implementations is that swapping through them can be quite gas intensive, because they manipulate the <code>Vat</code> (MakerDAO’s main accounting module) directly on every swap.</p>\n<p>To help alleviate this problem, <code>DssLitePsm</code> aims to be more gas efficient. The strategy is to allow users to swap in a <strong>pool</strong> of pre-minted Dai and stablecoins, reducing the swap to 2 ERC-20 token transfers with little overhead.</p>\n<p>The required bookkeeping is done <em>off-band</em> (not to be confused with <em>off-chain</em>), through a set of permissionless functions that aim to keep the pool operating under the predefined constraints, and incorporate the accumulated swap fees into the protocol’s surplus buffer.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is a new requirement – related to MakerDAO Endgame – to allow authorized parties to swap through the PSM without paying any fees, even if they have been activated by Governance. Apart from the existing permissionless <code>buyGem</code> / <code>sellGem</code> functions, this iteration introduces <code>buyGemNoFee</code> / <code>sellGemNoFee</code> permissioned counterparties.</p>\n<p>There is also a new security feature that can be useful in extreme scenarios.  Through an executive spell, MakerDAO Governance can temporarily halt swaps in LitePSM in any direction or in both at the same time. As in other important modules in the Maker Protocol, there is a special Mom contract that can bypass the GSM delay and halt as soon as the corresponding spell obtains enough votes.</p>\n<p>At the same time, in this version <code>gem</code> balance <strong>can</strong> be held in a different address to allow the protocol to receive yield from stablecoins that require the custody of the assets to be segregated.

The only constraint is that <code>DssLitePsm</code> <strong>should</strong> be able to freely move any amount of <code>gem</code> on behalf of such address.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, LitePSM fosters Maker Protocol’s operational decentralization, as it reduces the dependency on an arranger with <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/out-of-schedule-executive-to-fortify-elasticity-of-on-chain-1-1-liquidity-of-usdc/21168/58\">manual actions as in Coinbase Custody</a>, while maintaining the ability to obtain yield on holdings.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-lite-psm/tree/2598e2efcb079a27b5580ea416f1c7b27ede4e84\">repository</a> to see it in detail.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"architecture-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#architecture-3\"></a>Architecture</h2>\n<p>A simplified diagram of the <code>DssLitePsm</code> architecture:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">                                                buyGemNoFee /\n                                           ╭────────────────────────  🤴\n ╭─────────╮                               │    sellGemNoFee     Permissioned\n │         │       transferFrom            │                         User\n │   Gem   ◄────────────────────────────╮  │\n │         │                            │  │\n ╰────▲────╯                            │  │\n      │                                 │  │\n      │                                 │  │\n      │ approve ·····╮                  │  │\n      │              ╎                  │  │\n╭─────┴────╮         ╎          ╭───────┴──▼───╮\n│          │         ╎          │              │     buyGem /\n│  Pocket  │         ╰·········&gt;│  DssLitePsm  ◄────────────────────  🧑\n│          │                    │              │     sellGem         User\n╰──────────╯                    ╰─┬──┬──┬──▲─▲─╯\n                                  │  │  │  │ │\n                                  │  │  │  │ │\n                 frob             │  │  │  │ │\n     ╭────────────────────────────╯  │  │  │ │\n     │                               │  │  │ │\n     │                               │  │  │ │\n     │                               │  │  │ │ fill / trim / chug\n     │                   join / exit │  │  │ ╰──────────────────────  👷\n     │                               │  │  │                        Keeper\n     │                               │  │  │\n╭────▼────╮          ╭───────────╮   │  │  │           ╭─────────────────╮   \n│         │   move   │           │   │  │  │   file    │                 │   \n│   Vat   ◄──────────┤  DaiJoin  ◄───╯  │  ╰───────────│  DssLitePsmMom  │   \n│         │          │           │      │     (halt)   │                 │   \n╰─────────╯          ╰─────┬─────╯      │              ╰─────────────────╯   \n                           │            │\n                           │            │\n               mint / burn │            │\n                           │            │ transfer / transferFrom\n                           │            │\n                      ╭────▼────╮       │\n                      │         │       │\n                      │   Dai   ◄───────╯\n                      │         │\n                      ╰─────────╯\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a name=\"design-and-constraints-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#design-and-constraints-4\"></a>Design and constraints</h3>\n<p>These are the main constraints that guided the design of this module:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Seggregated gem holding: the ability to hold gems in a different address to allow the Maker Protocol to receive yield on deposits.</li>\n<li>Gas efficiency: make swaps as cheap in terms of gas as possible, without sacrificing security and readability.</li>\n<li>Backwards compatibility: the new implementation should not break integrations with the current one.</li>\n<li>Permissioned no-fee swaps: specific actors are allowed to use the PSM for swaps without paying any swap fees.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part of the Dai liquidity available in <code>DssLitePsm</code> is technically unbacked Dai.

The main drawback of this approach is that it can be very gas intensive.</p>\n<p><code>DssLitePsm</code> flips this process on its head and allow bookkeeping to be performed outside the main flows. It sets a predefined amount of Dai that can be permissionlessly pre-minted, so swaps can boil down to mostly 2 token transfers.</p>\n<p>The maximum amount of Dai pre-minted at once is defined by the contract parameter dubbed <code>buf</code>. At any point in time, there might be either missing or excess pre-minted Dai in the contract.</p>\n<p>When Dai is missing, users will be interested in the following functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>function rush() external view returns (uint256)</code>: returns the amount of missing Dai. If it returns a value greater than zero, then a call to <code>fill()</code> described below is possible.</li>\n<li><code>function fill() external returns (uint256)</code>: replenishes LitePSM with pre-minted Dai.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, when there is excess of Dai, there are the following functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>function gush() external view returns (uint256)</code>: returns the amount of Dai in excess. If it returns a value greater than zero, then a call to <code>trim()</code> described below is possible.</li>\n<li><code>function trim() external returns (uint256)</code>: burns the excess pre-minted Dai from LitePSM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also at any point in time, users can check how much in swap fees is accumulated in the contract, using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>function cut() external view returns (uint256)</code>: returns the amount of Dai is currently sittig in the contract as collected swap fees.</li>\n<li><code>function chug() external returns (uint256)</code>: incorporates the outstanding swap fees into the Protocol surplus buffer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To keep gas usage as low as possible, the functions for selling gems allow users to take pre-minted Dai up to the whole Dai balance, even if part of it consists of collected fees. This can tempoprarily prevent Maker Protocol from collecting the fees, until more Dai is pre-minted into LitePSM.</p>\n<p>While all bookkeeping functions are permissionless, there is very little incentive for users to call them. For that reason, there is a set of keepers that will do it on a regular basis.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"swap-functions-return-a-value-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#swap-functions-return-a-value-9\"></a>Swap functions return a value</h3>\n<p>The original <code>DssPsm</code> swap functions <code>buyGem</code> and <code>sellGem</code> do not return anything. On <code>DssLitePsm</code> they return <code>daiIn</code> and <code>daiOut</code>, respectively, to indicate the amount of Dai swapped in or out as the result of the call.</p>\n<p>This is especially useful when swap fees are enabled. Since they are always paid in Dai, the caller can know exactly how much Dai was returned/consumed by the transaction without having to query additional data.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"no-gemjoin-adapter-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#no-gemjoin-adapter-10\"></a>No <code>GemJoin</code> adapter</h3>\n<p>The original <code>DssPsm</code> uses a <code>GemJoin</code> adapter, while <code>DssLitePsm</code> has some of its functionalities baked into the same contract.</p>\n<p>Previously, to be able to query the <code>gem</code> address, callers would be required to chain 2 different calls:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">psm.gemJoin().gem()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now it is possible to query <code>gem</code> directly as well:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">litePsm.gem()\n// Alternatively\nlitePsm.gemJoin().gem()\n</code></pre>\n<p>The latter is possible because <code>litePsm.gemJoin()</code> returns the address of the contract itself (<code>address(this)</code>).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"no-emergency-shutdown-support-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#no-emergency-shutdown-support-11\"></a>No Emergency Shutdown support</h3>\n<p>Linked to the point above, <code>DssPsm</code>’s <code>GemJoin</code> has its own <code>live</code> parameter, which can be set to <code>0</code> during Emergency Shutdown. To keep the interface compatibility, <code>DssLitePsm</code> implements a <code>live</code> getter which can be called like:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">litePsm.live()\n// Alternatively\nlitePsm.gemJoin().live()\n</code></pre>\n<p>It returns the value of <code>vat.live</code>, which is expected to be <code>1</code> for the time being, since the Emergency Shutdown threshold will be increased significantly when on-boarding LitePSM.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"token-balances-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#token-balances-12\"></a>Token balances</h3>\n<p>To query the original PSM <code>gem</code> balance, the user needs to call:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">gem.balanceOf(psm.gemJoin())\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is no need to query the Dai balance, since it is minted on-demand into the specified user address.</p>\n<p>For LitePSM, the balance is held in the <code>pocket</code> address and there might be pre-minted Dai sitting in the <code>DssLitePsm</code> contract itself:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">// Gem balance of LitePSM\ngem.balanceOf(litePsm.pocket())\n// Pre-minted Dai balance of LitePSM\ndai.balanceOf(litePsm)\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a name=\"known-limitations-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#known-limitations-13\"></a>Known Limitations</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-potential-front-running-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-1-potential-front-running-14\"></a>1. Potential Front-Running</h3>\n<p><code>DssLitePsm</code> relies on pre-minted Dai. It is designed to keep a fixed-sized amount (<code>buf</code>) of it available most of the time.  However, when users call <code>buyGem</code>, the amount of Dai available will be temporarily larger than <code>buf</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario A:</strong> a user might observe the outstanding amount of Dai and wish to call <code>sellGem</code> to receive the total of Dai in return. In that scenario, there is a possibility of a transaction calling any of the permissionless bookkeeping functions to front-run them, causing the swap to fail, as the Dai liquidity would be lower than the required amount.</p>\n<p>The scenario A above is not possible with the current PSM implementation because each swap is “self-balancing”, so no off-band bookkeeping is required.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario B:</strong> a large swap might front-run another one, even if unintentionally. Imagine there is <code>10M</code> Dai outstanding in <code>DssLitePsm</code>. If Alice – who wants to swap <code>8M</code> – and Bob – who wants to swap <code>3M</code> – submit their transactions at the same time, only the first one will be executed.</p>\n<p>The scenario B above is not possible with the current PSM implementation because <code>sellGem</code> is able to mint Dai on-the-fly to fulfill the swap, given that there is enough room in the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>Notice how the same issue happens in <code>buyGem</code>, however the amount of <code>gem</code> deposited into <code>DssLitePsm</code> is only bounded by the debt ceiling, while the amount of <code>Dai</code> will tend to gravitate towards <code>buf</code>.</p>\n<p>The consequence is that anyone willing to call <code>sellGem</code> with a value larger than <code>buf</code> should take care of potential front-running transactions by bundling it with an optional liquidity increase (<code>fill</code>).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-no-slippage-protection-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-2-no-slippage-protection-15\"></a>2. No Slippage Protection</h3>\n<p>Swaps in <code>DssLitePsm</code> are generally not subject to slippage. The only exception is when there is a MakerDAO Governance proposal to increase the swapping fees <code>tin</code> and/or <code>tout</code>. That is done through an Executive Spell, which is an on-chain smart contract that can be permissionlessly <em>cast</em> (executed) after following the Governance process.</p>\n<p>If Alice sends a swap transaction and a spell increasing the fees is cast before her transaction, she will either pay more Dai when buying gems or receive less Dai when selling gems than the originally expected.</p>\n<p>This is a highly unlikely scenario, but users or aggregators are able to handle this issue through a wrapper contract.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"gas-savings-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#gas-savings-16\"></a>Gas Savings</h2>\n<p>At this point, an attentive reader might be wondering:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, by doing all these changes, how much gas is saved on swaps?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We actually got some estimate for you :drum_with_drumsticks::drum_with_drumsticks::drum_with_drumsticks::</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Operation</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">PSM</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">LitePSM</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Savings</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>buyGem</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">145,030</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">78,867</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"><span>-45.62%</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sellGem</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">284,620</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">93,742</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"><span>-67.06%</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The numbers above are generated by Foundry when running <code>forge test --gas-report</code>. These are the median values obtained from the test suites of the respective repositories. This gives us a ballpark estimation, however the actual gas usage might vary.</p>\n<p>The permissioned functions <code>buyGemNoFee</code> and <code>sellGemNoFee</code> have a small gas overhead because they need to check whether the caller is authorized to call them or not. That check comes at a cost of 1 extra <code>SLOAD</code> plus some computation to get the correct slot for the mapping.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#security-17\"></a>Security</h2>\n<p>This is a relevant change to the Maker Protocol, and as usual security is taken very seriously, being a priority from the start. Security assumptions changed with the change of design: In the previous version the trusted <code>Vat</code> was in charge of ensuring 100% collateralization, in the new version the PSM itself is responsible to maintain it (governance can still control the size of it by the amount of collateral granted to the PSM vault, as well as its debt ceiling, aka <code>line</code>).</p>\n<p>The code was made in plain solidity for this very reason, as was the 100% coverage test suite.

A separate application for preliminary discovery has been filed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Regarding our argument on “actual or apparent possession” of the goods that the Liquidator sold upon his appointment, we faced some challenges. While we had a strong enough argument to seek preliminary discovery, the Buyer Trade Finance Agreement (BTFA) does not entirely circumvent the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR) requirements in Australia. The PPSR ensures transparency regarding who has a security interest in goods through registration or possession.</em></p>\n<p><em>Despite these challenges, there is still potential for claims against the Liquidator if the documents reveal that he was aware of any wrongdoing by Hanhwa concerning our goods. Similarly, we may have claims against Directed if it is shown that they were aware of the BTFA when acquiring the goods before liquidation.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Court has not yet delivered a judgment, which is an unusual delay. The delay could indicate that the Registrar is carefully considering which documents should be provided, but it is difficult to determine the exact cause. The Registrar may simply have a heavy workload.</em></p>\n<p><em>With Hanhwa director now bankrupted and out of the picture, our straightforward claim has become more complex. Our chances of success against the Liquidator and Directed will largely depend on the Registrar’s decision on our preliminary discovery application and the documents produced. Once we have access to these documents, we will be able to provide a more informed opinion.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your continued patience and support.

As SES and later Powerhouse, we have focused on providing operational support to MakerDAO, aligning with stakeholders to identify key needs and building open-source software tools to expedite and automate the process.</p>\n<p>Since the passage of the Endgame, Powerhouse is focused on supporting the launch season and building new open-source operational tools for MakerDAO to maintain decentralization while incorporating new governance AI tooling. Powerhouse is developing this Universal DAO Toolkit to be used by all DAOs, but right now our focus is on supporting MakerDAO. This post aims to highlight recent work for MakerDAO and explain how the infrastructure used to build tools for MakerDAO allows for rapid development of additional operational and governance applications. Here’s an outline of what’s to come:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RWA Reporting Tool</li>\n<li>Updated Maker expenses dashboard through Fusion</li>\n<li>Atlas Editor and Governance AI Tools (GAIT)</li>\n<li>Strengths of Using Powerhouse’s Document Models</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"rwa-reporting-tool-for-ba-labs-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#rwa-reporting-tool-for-ba-labs-2\"></a>RWA Reporting Tool for BA Labs</h2>\n<p>As part of the upcoming launch season, BA Labs is building a new risk dashboard. A key component of that is making the information about the RWAs that back Dai transparent and easy to understand. It was also important that BA Labs could access machine-readable data to automate as much as possible. Powerhouse has built a tool for Arrangers of RWAs to provide detailed reports on the transactions made with the Dai principal.</p>\n<p>The RWA Reporting Tool was built by Powerhouse in collaboration with BA Labs and will eventually utilize all four of Powerhouse’s applications.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Renown</em> for login and authentication</li>\n<li><em>Connect</em> for arrangers to report details of RWAs</li>\n<li><em>Switchboard</em> for easy data query in a GraphQL playground</li>\n<li><em>Fusion</em> for community dashboards and data visualization</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/2/f266a8f12009332eb800f091052667cb2a2fc49c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/yAnuJAZONjDf2m0KF9dnfuLSj2k.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Figure 1: A workflow through Powerhouse’s four applications\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/2/f266a8f12009332eb800f091052667cb2a2fc49c_2_690x384.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 1: A workflow through Powerhouse’s four applications\" data-base62-sha1=\"yAnuJAZONjDf2m0KF9dnfuLSj2k\" width=\"690\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/2/f266a8f12009332eb800f091052667cb2a2fc49c_2_690x384.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/2/f266a8f12009332eb800f091052667cb2a2fc49c_2_1035x576.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/2/f266a8f12009332eb800f091052667cb2a2fc49c_2_1380x768.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"343C4D\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>MakerDAO governance requires transparency. The RWA Reporting provides this transparency through an end-to-end flow that captures structured data. Every time Arrangers update RWA information, <em>Connect</em> records each edit and ties it to an Ethereum signer. This creates a full and detailed audit history that anybody can use to view and verify the validity of the transactions. The document also has edit permissions set, such that only addresses designated by MakerDAO governance can make changes to a particular RWA document. This identity authentication happens through the <em>Renown</em> app using an Ethereum address. Renown assigns a decentralized identifier (DID) with verifiable credentials that control access to the document through decentralized infrastructure.

This data structure undergirds Powerhouse’s core products, making it seamlessly integrated. The RWA Reporting Tool and soon the Atlas Editor are just the first tools that could be built using this architecture. Any business process can be built on top of this architecture, from grants programs to payroll to proposal collaboration.</p>\n<p>Powerhouse’s architecture comes with five strengths:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decentralization and Web 3</strong> - identity and reputation are achieved through Ethereum addresses, while the storage adapters enable any decentralized data storage protocol to plug directly into Powerhouse.</li>\n<li><strong>Massive Scalability</strong> - Powerhouse uses the same design that enables Web2 scalability with built-in micro-services compatibility (SaaS), event-sourcing and utilizes a CQRS design pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>State of the Art UX Practices</strong> - Document model reducers enable user interaction modeling beyond state schemas and a Flux-like design pattern saves front-end developers time with easy integration with React.js.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Collaboration Primitives</strong> - Powerhouse achieves the best of Google Docs and Github with the centralization with document commit histories with branching and merging similar to git, and a distributed data ownership structure with real-time collaboration.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduction of cost and shorter time-to-market</strong> - Powerhouse is open-source and optimized for automation and AI. Reusable components allow developers to build applications quickly, while our Model-Driven Development approach enables low-code development.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These strengths will allow developers to build customized applications to streamline operations across DAOs and other open organizations. Powerhouse’s ironclad commitment to open-source software development means best practices of the most successful organizations can be deployed in new organizations starting from scratch.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"coming-up-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#coming-up-6\"></a><strong>Coming up:</strong></h2>\n<p>This is the second of three update posts from Powerhouse.

In this post I will describe several related changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new feature: <strong>NewGovToken Activation</strong></li>\n<li>Changes to LockStaking, including renaming it to <strong>Sealed Activation</strong></li>\n<li>Renaming of SPK Staking to <strong>SPK Activation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below represents my current thinking about the topic and the final design will be subject to the community’s feedback and approval.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"new-feature-newgovtoken-activation-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#new-feature-newgovtoken-activation-1\"></a>New Feature: NewGovToken Activation</h1>\n<p>Activation is a new feature that will be available to NewGovToken holders. It is designed to incentivize governance participation in the long term among NewGovToken holders who do not wish to lock up their tokens long term with Sealed Activation (formerly LockStaking).</p>\n<p>NewGovToken holders can Activate or Deactivate their NewGovToken at any time, with no restrictions, cost, or additional risk. Later on it will be possible to delegate while Activating, with additional incentives to reward governance participation.</p>\n<p>When NewGovToken is Activated, the user chooses a reward to receive. The rewards available will be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10% of total Protocol Stablecoin Surplus</li>\n<li>15% of the Token Reward supply for each SubDAO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NewGovToken Activation will become available at Spark launch.</p>\n<p>At first only SPK rewards will be supported for users who Activate (at a rate of 150 million SPK per year distributed across all Activated NewGovToken). Some time after Spark launch, Protocol Stablecoin Surplus will become available, and other SubDAO tokens will be available as Activation Rewards as soon as they launch.</p>\n<p>In addition to incentivizing governance participation in the long term, NewGovToken Activation will also act as a useful primitive that can power restaking mechanisms built on top of NewGovToken. Restaking protocols will be able to stack the native Activation Rewards with their own Restaking rewards.</p>\n<p>NewGovToken Activation will not be available to US-based and VPN users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"newgovtoken-sealed-activation-formerly-known-as-lockstaking-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#newgovtoken-sealed-activation-formerly-known-as-lockstaking-2\"></a>NewGovToken Sealed Activation (formerly known as LockStaking)</h1>\n<p>LockStaking is being renamed to Sealed Activation, and some of its parameters have changed.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation is designed to incentivize participants to delegate their NewGovToken and MKR and get additional skin in the game, by Sealing the tokens behind an Exit Fee.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation will launch shortly after the launch of NewStable, NewGovToken, and the new Endgame app.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation is available both to NewGovToken and MKR holders, and provides Activation Rewards. It is possible to delegate while Sealed. When Unsealing, there is an Exit Fee.</p>\n<p>When NewGovToken is Sealed, the user chooses a reward to receive. The rewards available will be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>25% of total Protocol Stablecoin Surplus</li>\n<li>15% of the Token Reward supply emissions for each SubDAO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Sealed Activation launches, only 25% of the Protocol Stablecoin Surplus will be available as an Activation Reward, but SPK Token Reward will become available as an additional choice soon as Spark launches (at a rate of 150 million SPK tokens per year distributed across all Sealed NewGovToken and MKR).</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation has an Exit Fee that is paid on the Sealed principal when the user Unseals. The Exit Fee starts at 5% at the moment Sealed Activation launches, and then increases by 1% every 6 months until it reaches its long term value of 15%. Exit Fee increases are applied retroactively. The Exit Fee is set low initially to encourage a lot of early participation.</p>\n<p>NewGovToken Sealed Activation will not be available to US-based and VPN users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"spk-activation-formerly-known-as-spk-staking-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spk-activation-formerly-known-as-spk-staking-3\"></a>SPK Activation (Formerly known as SPK Staking)</h1>\n<p>When the Spark SubDAO launches SPK will have the SPK Activation feature available from launch (previously known as SPK Staking).</p>\n<p>Just like NewGovToken Activation, SPK holders can Activate or Deactivate their SPK at any time, with no restrictions, cost, or additional risk. Later on it will be possible to vote while Activating, and there will be additional incentives to reward governance participation.</p>\n<p>When SPK is Activated, the user receives NewGovToken Rewards. The total rewards are 80 million NewGovToken per year distributed across all Activated SPK.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"additional-changes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#additional-changes-4\"></a>Additional changes</h1>\n<p>I will follow up with another post that will detail more changes, both feature changes and terminology changes, which I plan to put into the next MIP edit for community feedback and approval.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/newgovtoken-activation-new-feature-and-other-changes/24688\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/newgovtoken-activation-new-feature-and-other-changes/24688","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 19:08:59 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24688"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/newgovtoken-activation-new-feature-and-other-changes/24688.rss","#text":"NewGovToken Activation: new feature and other changes"}},{"title":"Capital Transparency: Endgame Operational Expenses Enabled by the Atlas","dc:creator":"ecosystem-team","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>The Ecosystem team is providing an update on our progress toward expense transparency, specifically building on the former <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/capital-transparency-2023-overview-of-the-transition-to-endgame/23438\">Capital Transparency: 2023 Overview of the Transition to Endgame</a>.</p>\n<p>In the sections below, we provide an overview of expenses from <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/preparing-to-decentralize-the-launch-project-after-launch-season/24193\">May 2023</a> through July 7, 2024.

Here is a quick overview of EtherMail’s security and important business context to allow one to assess the longevity EtherMail may have.</p>\n<p>Encryption:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emails sent between EtherMail users: Always end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that only the sender and recipient can read the messages.</li>\n<li>Emails from EtherMail users to non-EtherMail users: Encrypted with TLS if the non-EtherMail mail server supports it. While this provides encryption in transit, it is not end-to-end encrypted, meaning providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail can read these messages and hand them over if needed.</li>\n<li>Emails from non-EtherMail users to EtherMail users: Unless PGP is used, the email message is encrypted in transit using TLS and stored on EtherMail’s servers with zero-access encryption. However, it is not end-to-end encrypted and might be accessible to the sender’s email service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Funding:</p>\n<p>EtherMail has secured $7.3M in funding over two rounds from notable investors, including Tim Draper, Draper Associates, MS&amp;AD Ventures, Fabric Ventures, Greenfield, Rene Reinsberg, and w3.fund. This information is sourced from Crunchbase and confirmed in their EMT token launch article.</p>\n<p>Business Model:</p>\n<p>EtherMail recently launched the EMT token, introducing “Consensual Marketing.” In this model, users opt-in to receive promotional content and are compensated with EMT tokens for their engagement. The utility of EMT includes access to premium features and market buybacks equating 50% of all Consensual Marketing advertising revenue.</p>\n<p>For more details, you can read the article on the EMT token here (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@ethermail_io/launching-emt-the-worlds-first-email-token-e2378336de18#:~:text=Consensual%20Marketing%3A%20EtherMail%20introduces%20a,EMT%20tokens%20for%20their%20engagement\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Launching $EMT: The World’s First Email Token | by EtherMail | Jun, 2024 | Medium</a>).</p>\n<p>Best Practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a security precaution, do not use an address already used for handling financial transactions or storing funds for EtherMail. This minimizes the risk of financial loss.</li>\n<li>Inform your contacts about the security practices and limitations of using different email services. Encourage them to adopt secure email practices and consider using EtherMail for secure communications.</li>\n<li>For communications that must extend outside the EtherMail network, using PGP encryption can provide an additional layer of security. Both senders and recipients should be familiar with setting up and using PGP to ensure their messages are protected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This overview should help Alignment Conservers and those committed to high OpSec standards understand EtherMail’s potential as a secure and innovative email solution.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ethermail-email-solution-with-ethereum-sign-in/24670\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ethermail-email-solution-with-ethereum-sign-in/24670","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 14:52:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24670"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ethermail-email-solution-with-ethereum-sign-in/24670.rss","#text":"EtherMail: Email Solution with Ethereum Sign In"}},{"title":"Analysis and Summary of Recent Liquidations in the MakerDAO and SparkLend Ecosystems","dc:creator":"Mezdalug","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In the wake of recent market turbulence, the DeFi ecosystem has experienced liquidation events affecting positions across both the MakerDAO Core and SparkLend lending engines. This report will analyze the liquidations from 2 July 2024 to 8 July 2024, highlighting affected vaults, collateral types, and the financial implications in both DAI repayment and collateral liquidation. By understanding these market dynamics, we aim to underline the DeFi sector’s resilience and areas for potential enhancement.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"market-conditions-leading-to-liquidations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#market-conditions-leading-to-liquidations-2\"></a>Market Conditions Leading to Liquidations</h1>\n<p>There had been a significant bearish movement in the BTC and ETH prices in the first week of July. The BTC price plummeted by ~16% from 1 July to 5 July. Similarly, the price of ETH has decreased by ~20% in the same period - yet both assets have gained some value since. The recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market was, among others, also instigated by the large-scale movement of assets by Mt Gox, which started to repay users, triggering a significant supply shock. This had the effect on Thursday when its BTC movement (together with other market conditions) moved the price on Thursday evening, 4 July, to Friday morning, 5 July, ~8.8% lower.</p>\n<p>With previous bearish pressure on BTC and ETH prices, this rapid asset devaluation cascaded through the DeFi space, prompting a series of liquidations.</p>\n<p>For why exactly the Mt Gox movement had such an effect, refer to the following sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/303586/mt-gox-moves-nearly-47229-btc-ahead-of-9-billion-payout\">Mt Gox moves nearly 47,229 BTC</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/05/mt-gox-begins-repaying-bitcoin-to-creditors-a-decade-on-from-collapse.html\">Mt.

Although the total number of liquidations is only seven, the value of those liquidations is far from negligible.

Liquidators repaid $3.26M of debt, accounting for a 13% penalty fee, resulting in a $423K penalty collected by Maker protocol. While the movement of MtGox had an effect on the liquidations happening on 5 July, the liquidation on 3 July had to be due to some other reasons for not adjusting the position to the bearish market conditions. The recent liquidation data suggests the critical need for maintaining appropriate collateralization ratios in such volatile conditions.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"sparklend-liquidations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#sparklend-liquidations-4\"></a>SparkLend Liquidations</h1>\n<p>Similarly, SparkLend also faced the brunt of this market crash, resulting in numerous forced liquidations of various borrower positions. A lot more liquidations have been executed here, however the total value is significantly lower compared to Maker. While the Maker has seen the liquidations also before the MtGox effect, the SparkLend had more liquidation in number, but the majority of positions were very small, resulting in $892.7K collateral being liquidated and $853.4K debt being repaid.</p>\n<p>The total number of liquidations on Spark was 30, the vast majority on 5 July due to the explained market effect. There were 12 liquidations cumulatively on 6, 7, and 8 July; however, these positions were minimal in value, while 2 liquidations happened on 4 July, also extremely small.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/raFIAhmoosoTA3NtyJbD5avwPca.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e_2_690x510.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"raFIAhmoosoTA3NtyJbD5avwPca\" width=\"690\" height=\"510\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e_2_690x510.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e_2_1035x765.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"212027\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://spark.blockanalitica.com/v1/ethereum/liquidations/?days_ago=7\">Block Analitica Spark Liquidations</a></p>\n<p>The most liquidated collateral was WETH, which represented 92.43% ($661K) of all the collateral; the rest was WSTETH with 4.09% ($29K), WBTC with 3.21% ($23K), and sDAI with 0.27% ($2K).

We also initiate phase 1 of a three-step migration process intended to gradually migrate USDC from <code>USDC-PSM-A</code> and <code>RWA014-A</code>, to <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>. The first migration phase is estimated to last for 4 weeks, but can be changed depending on how many users and integrations managed to migrate, which will be communicated on this forum via new parameter proposal recommendation. To learn more about the proposed migration process and its respective phases, refer to <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-lite-psm-usdc-a-introduction-and-overview/24512\">LitePSM (LITE-PSM-USDC-A): Introduction and Overview</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that the recommended parameter values covered in this post are intended to change as the <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code> migration initiative reaches phase 2, and then again, as we reach phase 3. <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> will provide two additional forum posts with recommended parameter changes for the remaining steps of the migration process.</p>\n<p>As we explain in the LitePSM introduction post, the LitePSM contract had already been deployed at <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xf6e72Db5454dd049d0788e411b06CfAF16853042\">0xf6e72Db5454dd049d0788e411b06CfAF16853042</a>, the upcoming spell will finalize all required parameter configurations and execute the initial migration of reserves from PSM-USDC-A to LitePSM.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-parameters-for-phase-1-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposed-parameters-for-phase-1-3\"></a>Proposed Parameters for Phase 1</h1>\n<p>BA Labs recommends the Stability Facilitator to poll the following parameter changes and deployments in next available cycle and include them in the next available executive vote assuming positive poll outcome:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploy <code>PSM_MOM</code> GSM Delay Exception</li>\n<li>Migrate initial USDC (20M) reserves from PSM-USDC-A to LitePSM with a script executed in the spell, while leaving at least 200M USDC reserves in PSM-USDC-A</li>\n<li>The current DC-IAM available DAI liquidity is distributed between the two PSMs\n<ul>\n<li><code>PSM-USDC-A</code>\n<ul>\n<li><code>tin</code> &amp; <code>tout</code>: 0 (remains unchanged)</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>line</code> (max DC): 10B (remains unchanged)</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>gap</code>: Decrease for 20M from 400M to 380M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>ttl</code>: 12h (remains unchanged)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>\n<ul>\n<li><code>tin</code> &amp; <code>tout</code>: Set to 0</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>line</code> (max DC): Set to 50M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>gap</code>: Set to 20M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>ttl</code>: Set to 12h</li>\n<li><code>buf</code>: Set to 20M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>GSM Delay</code>: Decrease by 14h, from 30h to 16h</li>\n<li><code>ESM</code> (Emergency Shutdown Module) minimum threshold: Increase for 150k from 150k to 300k</li>\n<li>Deploy the keeper network job for calling permissionless LitePSM functions</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"keeper-network-threshold-parameters-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#keeper-network-threshold-parameters-4\"></a>Keeper Network Threshold Parameters</h1>\n<p>This group of parameters is specific to when the keeper network job is deployed and configured to call certain functions related to LitePSM buf.</p>\n<p>These are permissionless functions, but we still want to call them regularly in order to maintain a certain amount of DAI in the buf and transfers accumulated fees to the surplus buffer.</p>\n<p>Fill function mints additional DAI to the buf after a defined threshold had been reached up to the limit. Trim function burns DAI from the buf after a defined threshold had been reached down to the limit. The chug function transfers accumulated fees from the LitePSM to the surplus buffer, note that fees will not be activated for a considerable amount of time and are not planned as part of any migration phase.</p>\n<p>The keeper network job thresholds configuration will likely change in latter migration phases as liquidity and available DAI in buf increases, in the initial phase they are set relatively close to the buf in order to achieve good experience for transactors and integrators.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>fill</code>: Set threshold at 15M DAI</li>\n<li><code>trim</code>: Set threshold at 30M DAI</li>\n<li><code>chug</code>: Set threshold at 300k DAI</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"evaluation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#evaluation-5\"></a>Evaluation</h1>\n<p>The main goal of phase 1 is to have an initial low exposure period that will provide integrators with sufficient time to familiarize themselves with the LitePSM and to start migrating their solutions from PSM-USDC-A to LITE-PSM-USDC-A. The estimated duration of phase 1 is approximately 4 weeks. However, this duration may change depending on multiple factors, including (i) integrations, (ii) legal and technical aspects, (iii) the Maker governance process, and more.</p>\n<p>Below, we provide some additional context for the proposed parameter values for phase 1.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"deploy-psm_mom-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#deploy-psm_mom-6\"></a>Deploy PSM_MOM</h2>\n<p>Due to the fact that the LitePSM will have pre-minted DAI in the <code>buf</code>, the normal <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#10-2-3-debt-ceiling-breaker\">LINE_MOM</a> contract is not sufficient for temporarily disabling <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>. Instead, a new module referred to as <code>PSM_MOM</code> will be deployed. The PSM_MOM will be able to disable the LitePSM contracts by temporarily halting swaps.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"dc-iam-parameters-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dc-iam-parameters-7\"></a>DC-IAM Parameters</h2>\n<p><a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> believes that 20 million USDC serves as an adequate migration amount for the initial testing period. The 20 million USDC will be migrated from <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> to <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code> using a script in the determined Executive Spell.</p>\n<p>In order to counterbalance the increased exposure resulting from a gap and buf value of 20M respectively, we recommend decreasing the gap of <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> by 20M, from 400M to 380M. All other <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> parameters will remain unchanged for phase 1.</p>\n<p>For <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>, we recommend setting <code>tin</code> &amp; <code>tout</code> to 0, and the <code>ttl</code> to 12h in order to minimize unnecessary changes during the migration process and to reproduce a similar user experience as <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> and finally to achieve same available DAI liquidity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"gsm-delay-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#gsm-delay-8\"></a>GSM Delay</h2>\n<p>During phase 1 of the migration plan, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> believes that it is prudent to apply a lower GSM Delay in case any swift actions or parameter changes become necessary. We believe that a 16h GSM delay is a good compromise solution between being able to react quickly, while still being able to mitigate any potential malicious spells.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"esm-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#esm-9\"></a>ESM</h2>\n<p>The Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) will be increased, as the long-term plan is to remove this feature from the system and the LitePSM module is not supported by the ESM. There is still some value of maintaining the module until the full deployment of the Allocation System as part of the Endgame, but the threshold should be increased in order to prevent hostile activation when the module should not be used.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-scope-language-changes-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposed-scope-language-changes-10\"></a>Proposed Scope Language Changes</h1>\n<p>We will provide a more comprehensive language change edit where we define PSM_MOM, the LitePSM, and relevant parameters, in a future proposal. For the time being, the only relevant parameter value that needs to be changed is <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#10-1-1a\">10.1.1A</a> in the <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#0-the-governance-scope\">Governance Scope</a>.

Below is an update from 6s Capital:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We remain in continual compliance with the revolver’s covenants, and each of the underlying projects remaining in the portfolio is current with rent payments. These underlying projects are, or will shortly be put, on the market for divestiture. As each project is divested, closing funds will be utilized to pay down the revolver directly, to clear the lien.</p>\n<p>6s would again like to express our appreciation and our thanks to the community for the faith they put in us and our plan to deploy capital into senior secured loans.
