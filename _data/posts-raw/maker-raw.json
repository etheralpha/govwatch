(“BUIDL”) as part of the Spark Tokenization Grand Prix. BUIDL offers a tokenized U.S. Treasury product designed to provide decentralized organizations and other institutional investors a secure, yield-generating, blockchain-based investment solution. Since its launch in March 2024, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenized fund in the world, reaching over $500 million in assets under management in its first 6 months and  has become the category leader.</p>\n<p>We believe BUIDL is differentiated from competing funds and uniquely well positioned to address Sky’s needs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>World’s largest asset manager combined with the world’s leading RWA infrastructure provider:</strong>  BlackRock, with $10 trillion in assets under management, is the world’s largest asset management firm, having earned the trust of clients around the world over multiple decades.  BlackRock has invested heavily into the digital assets space, building capabilities that have allowed it to become the largest crypto asset management firm and largest tokenized fund manager in the world.</p>\n<p>Securitize, which serves as the transfer agent, tokenization platform and broker dealer for BUIDL, is the longest-standing and largest company in the RWA space, with over 100 RWA tokenized projects and more than $1B in issuances on chain since its inception.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the direct issuance of a fund by BlackRock in tokenized form cuts out a layer of intermediation and counterparty risk relative to funds where the fund issuer and reserve manager are separate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Instant on-chain liquidity:</strong>  As a result of a longstanding partnership between BlackRock and Circle, for whom BlackRock manages the USDC reserve assets, BUIDL offers the prospect of instant on-chain liquidity between BUIDL and USDC through smart contracts enabled by Circle (1).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Risk mitigation flexibility:</strong>  The scale and breadth of counterparty relationships of BlackRock’s Global Cash Management team, which oversees $778 billion of the firm’s $10 trillion in AUM, enables significant access to repurchase agreement supply as an investment alternative to U.S. short term treasuries, a critical capability to mitigate the potential risk of future U.S. debt ceiling concerns.</p>\n<p>Specifically, BlackRock currently manages $200 billion in outstanding repo balances across all segments. This is enabled by the connectivity BlackRock has to 53 unique repo counterparties, supported by 12 sponsors within the FICC cleared repo service model. This provides robust operational support across various structure types, including tri-party, delivery versus payment, and FICC settlement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Influence across the TradFi and digital assets ecosystems:</strong>  BlackRock’s role in both the traditional finance and digital assets ecosystems provides it the capacity to help drive digital asset adoption, including widening the usage of BUIDL across an expanse of platforms as well as supporting Sky’s growth ambitions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Depth of product lineup:</strong>  BlackRock intends to work with Sky to determine how BlackRock’s multi-faceted lineup of funds across its Cash Management, ETFs, Active Fixed Income, and Alternatives platforms may be able to supplement BUIDL and support enhanced yield generation or other investment goals of Sky.</p>\n<p>Further, Securitize has the largest roster of tokenized funds in the ecosystem, which would also be available alongside an investment in BUIDL.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>BlackRock and Securitize are committed to strengthening the Sky ecosystem by continually enhancing BUIDL’s features and working closely with decentralized finance (DeFi) participants to increase liquidity and utility across DeFi protocols. We look forward to collaborating with the Sky ecosystem to set a new standard for compliant, secure, and scalable treasury solutions, bringing to bear the joint capabilities of the largest asset manager and the largest RWA company in the space .</p>\n<p><strong>I.

We believe short-term assets are most effectively managed when decisions are based on the collaborative approach between these three groups. Clients’ cash management needs and investment strategies can vary based on their risk tolerance and investment horizon for their cash. Customized investment solutions are built based on these needs. We have sector-specific portfolio management teams that focus on Government, Prime, Short Obligation &amp; Collective Trust Funds, Separately Managed Accounts and Municipal mandates in Canadian dollars, Euros, Sterling, and U.S. dollars.</p>\n<p>Being one of the largest global asset managers of cash, with $778 billion in cash management assets under management as of 30 June 2024, we believe the CM Group’s investment team is able to provide scale-related benefits, which include: more efficient trade execution, increased liquidity, tighter bid/offer spreads and greater buying power. The CM Group’s scale also provides the investment team with deep capital markets participation, creating what we believe to be unique access to exclusive investment opportunities, along with the ability to source new issue allocations when they come to market. In the second quarter 2024, the CM Group executed approximately $82 trillion in trades across our Cash Management platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio risk oversight</strong><br>\nRQA partners with BlackRock’s investment teams to help ensure: (1) risks in the portfolios are appropriate across strategies and consistent within each mandate; and (2) positioning reflects the team’s current investment themes as well as adhering to each client’s formal risk constraints. RQA is an integral pillar to our Cash Management investment process that attends our formal Investment Strategies Group (“ISG”) meeting and credit committee meetings in an effort to provide portfolio perspectives on the current and forecasted upcoming risks to our portfolios. Specific to RQA Cash, positioning along the spectrum of maturities is dependent upon careful analysis of the liquidity demands of a fund, guidelines and other constraints including regulations, central bank policy, market behavior, inflation, and supply or availability of appropriate investments. This theme is echoed throughout all of our Global Cash Management client portfolios. Across the suite of Global Cash Management Stress Test reporting, there are more than 200 different shock scenarios run for every portfolio daily, collectively translating to over 100,000 shock/stress scenarios run weekly as of 30 June 2024 through the scaled Aladdin analytics platform.</p>\n<p>Specific risk factors that BlackRock’s CM Group addresses include, amongst others:<br>\n●\t<strong>Liquidity risk</strong> - The risk stemming from the lack of marketability of an investment that cannot be bought or sold quickly enough to prevent or minimize a loss.<br>\n●\t<strong>Interest rate risk</strong> - The risk that an investment’s value will change due to a change in the absolute level of interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or any other interest rate relationship.<br>\n●\t<strong>Spread risk</strong> - The risk associated with the change in value of a security due to a change in the relative spreads in the market.<br>\n●\t<strong>Credit risk</strong> - Associates adverse changes of a security’s value due to a ratings downgrade of the investment or in a distressed case, default of the security.</p>\n<p>BlackRock’s emphasis on risk management serves to help meet our objective of generating excess return within a risk-controlled investment framework. Our real-time analysis of a vast array of risk measures allows us to assess the potential impact of various sector and security strategies on total return. We believe the substantial investment we have made in proprietarily developed analytical systems and personnel strongly differentiates our firm.</p>\n<p>BlackRock performs daily stress testing of every Global Cash Management money market fund in accordance with both the SEC and EU’s standards. Stress testing involves challenging a fund’s ability to maintain both a stable net asset value per share, if relevant, and sufficient weekly liquid assets when faced with a series of specified hypothetical stress-events. These tests include but are not limited to the following hypothetical events: (i) a change in short-term interest rates; (ii) credit deterioration, such as a downgrade of or default on portfolio securities; and (iii) the widening or narrowing of spreads between yields on an appropriate benchmark the strategy has selected for overnight interest rates and commercial paper and other types of securities held by the strategy. These tests are each conducted in combination with various increases in shareholder redemptions as expected in a stressed scenario. BlackRock will also test other hypothetical events, as it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p>Our comprehensive Risk and Quantitative Analysis (RQA) mandate seeks to ensure we invest transparently and deliver value to our clients</p>\n<p>●\tRQA’s governance framework seeks to ensure risks are appropriate and portfolio positioning is deliberate, diversified, scaled and consistent with clients’ and/or fund shareholders’ risk/return expectations<br>\n●\tMore than 200 different shock scenarios run for every USD portfolio daily, and over 100,000 shock/redemption scenarios run weekly through the scaled Aladdin analytics platform<br>\n●\tMeets the requirements set forth by the Rule 2a-7 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stress testing guidance</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/5/8586c5bc75627378ae016f140b878c46a5073825.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/j3efD9d2zYbJQ1yoR55zDdR5VPv.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/5/8586c5bc75627378ae016f140b878c46a5073825_2_690x258.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"j3efD9d2zYbJQ1yoR55zDdR5VPv\" width=\"690\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/5/8586c5bc75627378ae016f140b878c46a5073825_2_690x258.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/5/8586c5bc75627378ae016f140b878c46a5073825.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/5/8586c5bc75627378ae016f140b878c46a5073825.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C1B5A8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Securitize</strong></p>\n<p>Securitize is the exclusive tokenization platform for the Fund and serves as BUIDL’s transfer agent and placement agent through our registered broker-dealer, Securitize Markets.

(i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Subscription and redemption flows operate as such:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Subscription:</strong></p>\n<p>Investors may purchase BUIDL shares via USD or, imminently, via USDC through payment conversion on-ramps. Investors may engage in peer to peer transfers on the secondary market (as available) as well (18).</p>\n<p>To subscribe to BUIDL, the investor must first complete onboarding with Securitize. This includes passing all KYC/B requirements for approval into the Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>USD:</strong><br>\nAfter a prospective investor is fully permissioned and onboarded, they will be able to access the Fund subscription document, which collects investor details related to bank accounts (for future distributions) and a wallet for minting the BUIDL tokens to.</p>\n<p>Once signed, the subscription is reviewed by the Transfer Agent. The investor provided wallet is also screened for AML/sanctions before the agreement is countersigned.</p>\n<p>Upon countersigning, the investor will be provided with funding instructions, accessible both via email and the Securitize portal, in order to send US Dollars to the Fund custodian demand deposit account at BNY Mellon. The Fund Transfer Agent monitors the custodial demand deposit account via API for all deposits received.</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of funds, tokens will be minted to the wallet address provided during the subscription process. US Dollar funds must be cleared and received in good order by the custodian by 2:30 pm ET on an applicable business day in order for shares to be issued that day at 2:45 pm ET. Otherwise, any late receipt of subscription funds will be issued tokens effective the next business day.</p>\n<p><strong>USDC (release imminent):</strong><br>\nInvestors using this service can subscribe to the Fund via USDC through an integration with a payment conversion provider. A unique and segregated wallet is created for each investor, which the investor will fund with USDC. The conversion partner facilitates the conversion to USD and transmits the USD to the Fund custodian demand deposit account at BNY Mellon.</p>\n<p>Identical to the USD subscription path, BUIDL tokens are minted on the business day in which USD funds are received to the Fund custodian at BNY Mellon by 2:30 PM ET.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary / Peer to Peer:</strong><br>\nSecondary market subscriptions into BUIDL are available via ecosystem partners to whitelisted investors. While the secondary market is available 24/7/365, liquidity is at the sole discretion of providers and partners and is not guaranteed. BlackRock and Securitize continue working with various partners to build the liquidity ecosystem and breadth of acceptance around BUIDL.</p>\n<p><strong>Redemption:</strong></p>\n<p>Investors can redeem BUIDL tokens for USD, as well as liquidate instantly for USDC via the Circle liquidity contract (19).  Additionally, BUIDL partners with a 3rd party payment converter to facilitate exit from the Fund in USDC. BUIDL investors may also engage in peer-to-peer secondary market transactions with other whitelisted investors to exit their position.</p>\n<p><strong>USD:</strong><br>\nInvestors may redeem directly with the Fund to receive USD by sending tokens to the redemption wallet monitored by the Transfer Agent. This can be facilitated through the Securitize platform UI, or by directly sending tokens to the redemption wallet via transfer on-chain.</p>\n<p>Tokens received in the redemption wallet by 3:00 PM ET each business day are processed with a same day wire payment. Redemptions received in the redemption wallet after the cutoff time will be paid during the next business day.  Generally, USD wires for redemption proceeds are released at 4:00 PM ET on each business day.</p>\n<p><strong>USDC:</strong></p>\n<p>As part of an upcoming feature, investors may redeem BUIDL for USDC via a payment conversion partner. In the case of certain investors, particularly those without access to traditional banking rails, performing a USD redemption (see USD redemption above) will result in the redemption proceeds being routed through the USDC conversion partner for further client instruction away from the Fund (20).  Similar to the USD redemption, this is initiated by performing a direct redemption with the fund by sending tokens to the redemption wallet monitored by the Transfer Agent.</p>\n<p><strong>On-chain Native Secondary Market Exit</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract:</strong><br>\nBUIDL partners with Circle to provide smart contract functionality that allows holders of BUIDL to transfer their shares to Circle for USDC (21).  Transactions can be facilitated through the Securitize platform UI or by directly interacting with the smart contracts. This smart contract provides BUIDL investors with an instant, atomic, 24/7 BUIDL off-ramp that brings to bear the core benefits of tokenized assets: speed, transparency and efficiency. Since the inception of the smart contract, 106M BUIDL tokens have been atomically transferred to the liquidity contract for instant USDC.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Market:</strong><br>\nSecondary market transfers of BUIDL are available via ecosystem partners. While the secondary market is available 24/7/365, liquidity is at the sole discretion of providers and partners and is not guaranteed. BlackRock and Securitize continue working with various partners to build the liquidity ecosystem and breadth of acceptance around BUIDL.</p>\n<ol start=\"15\">\n<li><strong>Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As redemptions are of paramount importance - both in terms of size of redemption and liquidity options available - BUIDL engages with an ecosystem of partners across 3rd party payment providers, conversion partners, and market makers to enhance liquidity and redemption efficiency. The ability to meet large redemptions is supported by BlackRock’s Global Cash Team’s expertise, the highly liquid fund composition, and the breadth of ecosystem partners willing to acquire BUIDL shares in the secondary market.</p>\n<p>Primary market redemption is managed by the same portfolio managers that manage the $778 billion in Cash held with BlackRock’s Cash Management group. The Cash Management group engages in risk analyses and stress testing to determine portfolio makeup that enables redemption demand to be met. (See Section II.1 for more details)</p>\n<p>As noted above, BUIDL has partnered with Circle to provide a seamless, 24/7 liquidity option to BUIDL token holders (22).

This structure ensures the fund meets the necessary legal requirements for international investors, including those in digital asset-friendly jurisdictions such as the BVI and Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p>The Fund relies on Regulation D under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, which provides an exemption from registering the Fund’s securities with the SEC. The Fund also relies on an exemption from registering with the SEC as an investment company provided in Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with respect to offers made to U.S. persons.</p>\n<p><strong>BlackRock:</strong><br>\nBlackRock Financial Management, Inc. is an SEC-registered investment advisor, operating under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

This ensures full protection and segregation of investor assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Comprehensive Legal Structure:</strong><br>\nThe Fund is a private entity issued in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), with BlackRock serving as the investment manager, BNY Mellon as the administrator and custodian, PwC as the auditor, Securitize Markets, LLC as the broker-dealer, and Securitize, LLC as the transfer agent. Each entity operates independently to ensure that client assets remain fully protected and segregated from potential bankruptcy risks across all service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Independent Oversight:</strong><br>\nAn independent board governs the Fund, upholding transparency and ensuring adherence to industry best practices across governance, administration, custody, and auditing.</p>\n<p><strong>Custodial Protections:</strong><br>\nBNY Mellon, as the custodian, follows stringent regulatory guidelines that require the segregation of client assets from BNY Mellon’s corporate assets and the assets of other clients.

The fund will provide annual PFIC statements to U.S. holders to facilitate their annual U.S. tax compliance. The fund has not committed to providing CFC reporting at this time. U.S. holders are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding their tax compliance obligations under these two regimes.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-U.S. Holders:</strong><br>\nBUIDL payments to a non-U.S. holder that provides appropriate tax certifications to the fund and gain realized on a sale or other disposition of the shares by the non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, unless (i) such income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, or (ii) in the case of gain, such non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who holds the shares as a capital asset and is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are satisfied.</p>\n<p><strong>BVI Taxation:</strong><br>\nBUIDL and all dividends, interest, rents, royalties, compensations and other amounts paid by BUIDL to persons who are not persons resident in the BVI are exempt from the provisions of the Income Tax Act in the BVI and any capital gains realized with respect to any shares of BUIDL by persons who are not persons resident in the BVI are exempt from all forms of taxation in the BVI.</p>\n<p>This is a brief summary of certain tax considerations relevant to an investment in BUIDL. Tax laws and practices in both the U.S. and BVI can change, potentially impacting the fund’s tax status. Individual tax situations vary significantly. We strongly encourage all investors to consult both the fund’s Offering Memorandum and their own tax advisors to fully understand the tax treatment specific to their jurisdiction and circumstances.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>V.

This allows the token to benefit from the well-established infrastructure of the Ethereum blockchain while incorporating critical compliance controls and governance features unique to the DS Protocol. By implementing the DS Protocol, the token retains full compatibility with the ERC-20 ecosystem, ensuring easy integration with wallets, custodians, and smart contracts while adding layers of regulatory compliance. This protocol enables features such as whitelisting investors, managing transfers within regulated environments, and automating compliance across jurisdictions, ensuring that securities regulations are adhered to.</p>\n<p>The fractionalization capabilities of the token (up to six decimal points) facilitate flexible fund representation, making it suitable for various investor types, from retail to institutional players. Importantly, because it conforms to the ERC-20 standard, the token can be integrated seamlessly into the broader DeFi ecosystem, enabling functionalities like staking, lending, and liquidity provision without needing any bespoke integrations. For example, some clients have chosen to manage their holdings using Gnosis Safe without requiring further customization, demonstrating the plug-and-play ease that the ERC-20 standard provides.</p>\n<p>The Securitize DS Protocol has been instrumental in the success of several high-profile tokenization projects and it is the most widely used on-chain protocol for RWA tokenization that represent securities. It was a critical factor in BlackRock’s choice to employ it for the BUIDL token, given the protocol’s stringent compliance and security guarantees and history of wide usage without any issues. Moreover, this technology has been adopted by other leading financial institutions such as KKR and Hamilton Lane, enabling them to tokenize their products effectively and securely. The DS Protocol’s ability to manage the entire lifecycle of digital securities - from issuance to ongoing compliance and cap-table management - ensures that tokenized assets remain compliant at all times.</p>\n<p>The DS Protocol powers every Securitize token deployment and enforces the underlying compliance rules required by each asset. As of July 2024, Securitize has facilitated over $1 billion (23)  worth of investments in tokenized securities through its platform, with 100+ tokenized securities issuances.</p>\n<p>Details of the DS Protocol can be found in the below links:<br>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jorge.serna/ds-protocol-first-code-release-7470e4d45ae6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DS Protocol</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/securitize/ds-protocol-the-basic-elements-23fabcb5c85f\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DS Protocol Basics</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/securitize/ds-protocol-the-trust-and-registry-services-91d1c4630f78\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DS Protocol Trust &amp; Registry Service</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/securitize/ds-protocol-the-compliance-service-b6fe472d625d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DS Protocol Compliance Service</a></p>\n<p>From a technical security perspective, the administration of the BUIDL token, including actions such as minting, burning, or any updates to the token or its smart contract, is secured by Fireblocks’ institutional-grade controls. Fireblocks offers an advanced framework for securing private keys through multi-party computation (MPC) technology, ensuring that access to token administrative functions is highly resilient to attacks. This advanced level of security not only mitigates unauthorized access but also complies with the rigorous standards expected in regulated financial markets.</p>\n<p>In addition, as a precautionary measure, all newly minted tokens undergo a 24-hour lockup period to further safeguard against any potential unauthorized transfers. During this lockup, tokens cannot be transferred, ensuring that any unexpected minting or suspicious activities can be promptly detected and addressed before the tokens become active. Once this period passes, BUIDL tokens can be freely transferred between whitelisted Ethereum addresses, ensuring compliance with security and regulatory requirements while maintaining the flexibility of a decentralized environment.</p>\n<p>To provide ongoing, proactive security monitoring, Securitize has partnered with Hexagate, a leader in Web3 security and risk analytics. Hexagate offers continuous on-chain monitoring, employing sophisticated algorithms to detect and prevent potential exploits, hacks, or vulnerabilities before they can cause any financial loss. This proactive approach ensures that the deployed tokens are safeguarded against real-time threats, providing an additional layer of protection to both the platform and its investors. This partnership reflects Securitize’s commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security in the rapidly evolving digital securities landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Implementation Information:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SecuritizeID Portal:</strong><br>\nOnboarding, investor account access, and reporting are managed through the SecuritizeID Portal at <a href=\"https://id.securitize.io/login\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://id.securitize.io/login</a>. All investor activity can be managed via the portal, or conversely, many routine token operations can be managed by interacting with the token directly on-chain. For additional portal details, refer to section V.2 above.</p>\n<p><strong>Operator Control Panel:</strong><br>\nAll Broker Dealer &amp; Transfer Agent functions are performed in the Control Panel. Additionally, all token transactions are monitored in real-time, and if necessary can be restricted. Transfer Agent control operators use Fireblocks institutional controls, requiring multiple key persons approval for any new token minting, further enhancing token security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>Securitize has been issuing digital asset tokens on the DS protocol since 2018, and also released the DS protocol for open-source development soon after. The contract is fully upgradeable using a proxy-delegate pattern and furthermore the structure of DS services allows not just the token upgrade but specific functions like compliance or registry services to be upgraded separately. The DS Protocol and related contracts have been audited multiple times over the years since the initial deployment, most recently by Certik in June 2024.</p>\n<p>All digital asset tokens issued by Securitize since inception have never been hacked or compromised in any way. Securitize is currently a SOC 1 and 2 Type 1 compliant organization.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Halborn audited the BUIDL-USDC swap smart contract provided by Circle. The smart contract code for BUIDL has been reviewed in detail by several partners, including Circle, Coinbase, and Anchorage. Etherscan has also reviewed and verified token information.</p>\n<p><strong>Internal DS Protocol Audits</strong> (reports to be share privately with the selection committee)<br>\nJuly 2018, June 2020 - CoinFabrik<br>\nSept 2023, June 2024 - Certik</p>\n<p><strong>External Audits &amp; Evaluations</strong> (can be reviewed privately)<br>\nOct 2023 - Halborn (Circle USDC contract)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>VI. Sky Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe any previous relationship with Sky and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>BlackRock and Securitize have substantial experience working with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and addressing their unique needs. Despite the differences in governance structures, DAOs share fundamental similarities with traditional entities like foundations and endowments, where BlackRock has long been a leading investment manager. Managing these types of entities requires managing perpetual portfolios, ensuring proper asset-liability alignment, investing with an infinite time horizon, and growing capital responsibly through effective risk management.</p>\n<p>BUIDL has successfully onboarded multiple decentralized organizations (including ArbitrumDAO, after being granted the largest allocation in the STEP grant program) and has distributed over $9.3M in dividends to BUIDL holders (many of which are DAO participants) without tax withholding due to the fund’s BVI offshore structure. This experience has allowed Securitize to develop a streamlined onboarding framework for DAOs incorporating a variety of legal structures, including U.S. and non-U.S. corporations, trusts, and foundations.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, BlackRock is well-equipped to work within jurisdictions that are friendly to digital assets and decentralized entities, such as the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands (BVI), and other global regimes that support DAOs. Our flexibility in navigating both international and U.S. regulatory frameworks ensures that we can offer DAOs tailored, globally-compliant solutions across multiple jurisdictions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the Spark Star and/or Sky ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>BUIDL gives Sky access to BlackRock’s world-class expertise in managing multi-asset portfolios, powered by Securitize’s market-leading infrastructure.</p>\n<p>With $10 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock has an unparalleled track record in advising  institutional portfolios, including organizations with highly bespoke needs such as Sky. In addition to the differentiated product dynamics and capabilities of BlackRock and Securitize highlighted elsewhere in this application, we believe two other dynamics are critical to expand upon:</p>\n<p><strong>Critical risk mitigation through repo capability:</strong><br>\nBlackRock ‘s Global Cash Management team manages $778 billion in global liquidity assets, as of 30 June 2024. BlackRock’s market-leading position in the financial ecosystem includes significant access to repurchase agreement supply, a critical capability that can offer several benefits compared to Treasuries. In the event of periods of concern around U.S. Treasuries, catalyzed by a U.S. debt ceiling issue or otherwise, it could be advantageous to vastly reduce exposure to U.S. Treasuries for some period of time.  In such an episode, extensive repo capacity would be a potentially critical advantage and risk mitigating capability. Through BlackRock, BUIDL portfolio managers can access the repo market through 53 unique counterparties and 12 sponsors within the FICC cleared repo service, enabling maximal liquidity and flexible, diversified counterparty exposures.</p>\n<p><strong>Institutional commitment and influence across TradFi and digital assets ecosystems:</strong><br>\nBlackRock’s senior leadership has shown a strong commitment to the future of tokenization and digital assets, ensuring that BUIDL can continue to align with the most innovative trends in decentralized finance. Through the strength of BlackRock’s platform, client relationships, and effective advocacy for digital assets, BlackRock has driven such robust flows into its cryptoasset and tokenized fund products that it has become the world’s largest crypto asset manager, growing AUM from cryptoasset products by over 8,000% on a YTD basis, to more than $20 billion today.  As part of this, BlackRock had to enlist the support and participation of a breadth of traditional finance players (including market makers, banks and fund administrators) in order to make the crypto ETP ecosystem viable.</p>\n<p>This unique ability to drive institutional demand for cryptoassets and galvanize support among traditional finance players would continue to benefit Sky and the decentralized finance ecosystem, positioning BlackRock as a valuable long-term collaborative partner to Sky in supporting the growth of the Sky and digital assets ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Further, BlackRock intends to continue to drive adoption and acceptance of BUIDL, and as this occurs, BUIDL’s utility to Sky as a foundational part of the Sky treasury assets will continue to grow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>BUIDL, via BlackRock and Securitize, is actively engaged in efforts across the DeFi ecosystem to extend the reach and acceptance of BUIDL to further enhance its utility to digital asset native investors.

Once onboarded to BUIDL through Securitize, Sky will have immediate access to any tokenized offerings available, which leverage the same processes, systems and investment experience as BUIDL. Securitize provides the unique ability for Sky to leverage existing KYC data, accreditation status, wallet(s) and other account information to access high quality products able to be managed alongside BUIDL through Sky’s Securitize ID account.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as the leading platform in tokenizing real-world assets, Securitize is committed to<br>\ndeveloping solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems, specifically by bringing digital asset securities to different markets for treasury management, portfolio<br>\ndiversification, and secured ecosystem utility.</p>\n<p>For example, the Hamilton Lane Senior Credit Opportunities Securitize Fund (“SCOPE”) offers several compelling advantages as a treasury management complement to BUIDL.<br>\nThe Hamilton Lane fund targets senior credit opportunities, aiming for yields that can outperform traditional fixed-income securities in a declining interest rate environment. The average deal is 450 bps above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR is currently 5.38% and is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities). As interest rates decline, existing credit assets often appreciate in value. This potential upside not only strengthens the overall value of a DAO’s treasury but also aligns with long-term growth objectives, making the Hamilton Lane fund an attractive investment option.</p>\n<p>And, through Securitize, the tokenized structure of the feeder fund provides on-chain daily liquidity via on-demand redemptions when needed, and allowing quick access to treasury funds for operational requirements without facing significant liquidation penalties or waiting for off-chain transactions to settle.</p>\n<p><strong>Hamilton Lane Senior Credit Opportunities Securitize Fund - Historic NAV</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/9/19e16f19ab869136b83779afe71c6c250bd240c8.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3GWVsNIgv0Hs2MXr01uaB4YllLW.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/19e16f19ab869136b83779afe71c6c250bd240c8_2_690x505.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"3GWVsNIgv0Hs2MXr01uaB4YllLW\" width=\"690\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/19e16f19ab869136b83779afe71c6c250bd240c8_2_690x505.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/19e16f19ab869136b83779afe71c6c250bd240c8_2_1035x757.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/19e16f19ab869136b83779afe71c6c250bd240c8_2_1380x1010.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C3CAD5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>By providing higher yields, liquidity, expert management, capital preservation, and potential<br>\nappreciation, SCOPE can enhance a DAO’s treasury management strategy in the face of anticipated lower interest rates, creating a balanced and resilient investment.</p>\n<p>The above are just a few examples of how BlackRock and Securitize both bring access to a wide array of complementary products that can be used to construct portfolios across a spectrum of desired outcomes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>VII.

Here’s how a strategic partnership and investment in TBLs will benefit SparkDAO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Direct On-Chain Ownership:</strong> TBLs offer SparkDAO direct access to the US Treasury market on-chain, removing unnecessary centralized intermediaries and reducing counterparty risk. This provides SparkDAO with enhanced control over its investments and capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unparalleled Liquidity:</strong> TBLs are the most liquid on-chain asset during market hours, backed by PV01’s issuance of 4-week TBLs with flexible rollover options. To ensure uninterrupted liquidity, PV01 is committing close to $100 million in weekend repo facilities, providing SparkDAO with USDC liquidity at all times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Robust Legal Foundation:</strong> PV01’s bankruptcy remote issuers, transaction structure and legal documentation developed in accordance with TradFi practices, together with legal opinions confirming the legality and validity of the bonds ensure our TBLs meet the highest of legal standards. PV01 is also fully compliant with applicable laws and regulations including securities laws and sanctions/AML regulations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Seamless Transferability:</strong> TBLs are easily transferable, with minimal restrictions or approval requirements, ensuring operational efficiency and agility for SparkDAO’s investment activities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Market-Leading Net Yield:</strong> Leveraging US T-bills directly as collateral, TBLs cut out intermediaries, delivering higher net yields and maximizing returns for SparkDAO, as compared to reverse repo alternatives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Composability:</strong> TBLs are designed for integration with other decentralized financial applications, enabling SparkDAO to build passive or rule-based investment strategies, which promote innovation and strategic flexibility within the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Strategic Diversification:</strong> As a modular financial instrument, TBLs can serve as a core building block for other financial products in the Sky/SparkDAO portfolio, diversifying risk and enhancing the overall resilience of the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>II.

Product Information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TBL: Product Overview</strong></p>\n<p>PV01’s digital bonds are the highest yielding short-term Treasury product in the market. With fewer intermediaries than competitors, they offer direct access to the underlying US T-Bill market and benefit from its immense liquidity.</p>\n<p>PV01’s core product, the ‘TBL’ is a digitally-native zero coupon bond secured by US Treasury Bills, subscribed for and redeemed by investors directly on-chain in USDC. TBLs are the world’s first fully blockchain-native bearer debt securities issued under English law - the gold standard for TradFi bond issuance. As bearer securities, TBLs are the most readily transferable Treasury product in the market – no approval whatsoever is required, a simple transfer from wallet to wallet suffices.</p>\n<p>Each TBL bond is a direct, secured, limited recourse debt obligation of its issuer, a regulated, bankruptcy-remote, orphan SPV established in Bermuda. Represented by a transferable ‘bearer’ bond token in ERC-20 format, the TBL tokens have a notional value of 1 USDC per token and are fully negotiable and freely transferable on the blockchain in any USDC amount, subject to a sanctions blacklist.</p>\n<p>With title to the TBL bonds passing by delivery of the TBL tokens on-chain, the need to maintain a register of ownership is eliminated. Ownership of TBL bonds is determined exclusively by possession (control) of the TBL tokens and is generally identified by the digital wallet address on which the TBL tokens are held.</p>\n<p>Each TBL is linked 1:1 to an equal USD principal amount of a specific US T-Bill (an “Underlying T-bill”) with a matching maturity date. The Underlying T-bills are held in a segregated, secured securities account with a regulated custodian.</p>\n<p>When the Underlying T-bill matures, the USD proceeds are converted to USDC and paid back to the holders of the corresponding TBL token, via the TBL smart contract.</p>\n<p>Prior to maturity, a TBL can also be tapped (increased in size) or redeemed early by buying or selling the Underlying T-bill during its lifetime. This provides unlimited and same-day liquidity during US government bond market hours.</p>\n<p>Outside of market hours (e.g. on weekends), PV01 has commitments from market makers to provide liquidity (in repo form and as outright purchases) for an aggregate amount just under $100mm. The fact that TBLs can be transferred without any approval by PV01 facilitates secondary liquidity.</p>\n<p>The TBL product is designed to mirror as closely as possible the commercial features of a direct holding of US T-bills on-chain, while meeting traditional finance standards in terms of structure and documentation - without unnecessary TradFi intermediaries such as registrars, paying agents and clearing systems - making it the most compliant, secure, cost-effective and liquid way to get access to US Treasury yields on-chain.</p>\n<p>Importantly, TBLs are not funds, they are simple debt securities with a fixed repayment amount and defined maturity date backed by a static number of matching underlying US T-bills and paying out in stablecoins. As such, they do not depend on an asset manager to carry out an investment mandate on behalf of investors.</p>\n<p>As modular, building block-like financial instruments, TBLs can be reused to build other financial products on-chain. Due to their bearer nature, TBL bonds can be deposited, transferred, posted as collateral, etc., by simple delivery of the TBL tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>rTBL: The ‘Perpetual’ TBL via Automatic Rollover</strong></p>\n<p>PV0 created an ERC-4626 vault to enable the automatic rollover of TBLs. At any point in time, the vault contains an “on-the-run” 4-week TBL. Holders of that same TBL can deposit their tokens into the vault. At maturity, the 4-week TBL inside the vault is rolled into the new 4-week TBL. This feature allows for the “invest-and-forget” convenience of money market funds, while avoiding their overhead and redemption delays. Our research also indicates that investors generate higher all-in yields compared to competing products thanks to those savings.</p>\n<p>At any moment before maturity, investors that deposited TBL tokens in the vault can withdraw them from the vault, and redeem their USDC at maturity instead of rolling automatically.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/1/6154bb78a23b7beded5f3687f4a7a3859dc086cf.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dT1QS2OCWQ6X332OT9eBeHIol7F.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/1/6154bb78a23b7beded5f3687f4a7a3859dc086cf_2_624x352.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"dT1QS2OCWQ6X332OT9eBeHIol7F\" width=\"624\" height=\"352\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/1/6154bb78a23b7beded5f3687f4a7a3859dc086cf_2_624x352.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/1/6154bb78a23b7beded5f3687f4a7a3859dc086cf_2_936x528.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/1/6154bb78a23b7beded5f3687f4a7a3859dc086cf.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"BBC3BD\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Currently PV01 conducts primary issuances of rollable TBLs every 4 weeks and has plans to introduce a 2-week rollable TBL.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Transferability: Efficient Yielding Collateral</strong></p>\n<p>The full transferability of TBLs enables them to be used efficiently as yielding collateral. Importantly, the transfer of TBL tokens as collateral does not trigger the usual selling restrictions afflicting US investors.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset:</strong></p>\n<p>Each TBL is backed by a USD principal amount of a specific US Treasury Bill (identified by its CUSIP) equal to the USDC principal amount of the TBL issued. They have the same maturity date. ​​</p>\n<p>The Underlying T-bill is deposited in a secured collateral account of the TBL Issuer (Digital Bonds Ltd, a special-purpose vehicle) and held there to maturity (unless liquidated in connection with an early redemption). No other assets form part of the collateral and there is no active management of the collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the token holder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs are zero-coupon debt securities offered at a discount to par, mirroring US T-bills. There are no periodic interest payments. Investors in TBLs are paid back using the redemption proceeds of the Underlying T-bill, which pays out at 100% of its principal amount in USD, converted to USDC by the TBL Issuer.</p>\n<p>The yield on TBLs comes from the difference between their issue price (or purchase price in the secondary market) and their final payout amount, equal to their principal amount.</p>\n<p>The final payout amount is claimed by TBL holders from the TBL smart contract at maturity, on the same day that the Underlying T-bill matures. Investors can take their gains or let their TBL roll by depositing TBL tokens in the rTBL ERC-4626 vault before maturity. In that case, no payment is received by the investor, but gains compound by greater and greater amounts with successive TBL series.</p>\n<p>As would be expected, both minting and redeeming are atomic operations in the smart contract.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>Bermuda is the jurisdiction of incorporation of both: (i) Digital Bonds Ltd (the “SPV”), and (ii) PV01 Capital Markets Ltd. (the “Arranger” and the “Tokenizer”).</p>\n<p><strong>Digital Bonds Ltd</strong></p>\n<p>The SPV was established in Bermuda in September 2023 as an exempted company and is registered as a segregated accounts company. Digital Bonds Ltd is registered in the Bermuda Registrar of Companies with registration number 202302760. The legal entity identifier (LEI) of Digital Bonds Ltd is 9845001ACD9A9DCCF060 and its registered office is at c/o Walkers Corporate (Bermuda) Limited, Park Place, 55 Par-la-Ville Road, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. The SPV’s sole business purpose and activity is the issuance of digital bonds and the purchase of collateral for such digital bonds through its segregated accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>PV01 Capital Markets Ltd.</strong></p>\n<p>PV01 is also incorporated in Bermuda, with registered company number 202302581 and its registered office at c/o Walkers Corporate (Bermuda) Limited, Park Place, 55 Par-la-Ville Road, Hamilton, HM 11, Bermuda.</p>\n<p>Both entities are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).</p>\n<p>HDL MF SA (“HDL”), the parent company of PV01, is a société anonyme incorporated and existing under the laws of Belgium, with registered office at 10 Boulevard de l’Empereur, 1000 Brussels, Belgium and registered under number 0793.243.927 in the Register of Legal Entities (Brussels, French-speaking section). HDL supplies administrative, legal, commercial and technological support to PV01.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to Sky’s RWA-15-A (‘Andromeda’) investments, TBLs are outright bonds and not a pre- constructed portfolio. Each TBL corresponds 100% with the underlying US T-bill.</p>\n<p>Sky and Spark DAO’s overall objectives in regards to concentration, duration and desired maturity profile can be implemented with the use of rTBL vaults in a rule-based and automated way. We propose to spread the investment 50:50 across the 2-week and 4-week rTBL vaults.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>The portfolio of TBL for Sky / SparkDAO consists only of bonds. No derivatives, no hedges, no reverse repos with banks.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

PV01 successfully completed its first two issuances in April 2024 with an initial USDC 5M transaction sold by PV01 partners B2C2, Keyrock and BlockTower Capital.</p>\n<p>Since then, PV01 has completed over USDC 50M in TBL issuance volumes.</p>\n<p>Figures above are for the Ethereum mainnet.</p>\n<p><strong>9. What are the standard fees (i.e., subscription, redemption, management, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>The standard TBL product fee is 20 basis points running, i.e. 0.20% annualized, which is factored into the purchase price/yield of each TBL upon issuance.</p>\n<p>PV01’s fee is among the lowest in the market as there are no active management fees or other intermediary fees. There is no issuing or redeeming fee.</p>\n<p>PV01 is committed to waiving its fee for the first $50M invested into our TBL product and to offer the subsequent $50M allocation at just 10 bps. For any amounts thereafter, the standard 20 basis point fee would apply and we guarantee that indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Crucially, our research also indicates that our product generates the highest after-fee yield in the market (give or take temporary fee holidays) by avoiding the inherently costlier structures of fund products or indirect US T-bill investments such as reverse repos via banks.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</strong></p>\n<p>No other fees or expenses are charged or passed on to investors. Importantly, there are no hidden fees charged by an underlying fund, which is one of two reasons identified by our research for the underperformance of competing offerings.</p>\n<p>The other reason is the use of reverse repos, which yield less than US T-bills due to their interaction with the balance sheets of the banks offering them.</p>\n<p><strong>11. How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users).</strong></p>\n<p>Our product is permissioned in a similar way as USDC.</p>\n<p>Specifically, direct subscriptions and redemptions require the investor to have been screened by PV01. These are primary users who would mint and redeem directly with PV01.</p>\n<p>Secondary users, including users of the rTBL vault, do not need to be screened by us.</p>\n<p>As has become standard in the industry, we use a crypto address blacklist for sanctions, both the one maintained by Chainalysis and our own blacklist.</p>\n<p>Token transfers are permissionless except for wallets in the blacklist. Those are rejected at the level of the smart contract.</p>\n<p>Note that TBL tokens are bonds under English law. As in TradFi, whether a bond transfer is permitted by the settlement technology (here, the blockchain as opposed to the clearing system) does not imply that it is legal to perform for the transferee and the transferor. Participants must make their own assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>12. What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>The monthly transaction volume has been circa USDC 25M.</p>\n<p><strong>13. What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>Our issuances and redemptions occur on the same day. We did allow for an extra day in our initial proof-of-concept issuance, but afterwards have always performed those actions within the day.</p>\n<p>PV01 has never had any interruptions in our ability to process redemptions and subscriptions.</p>\n<p>The yield accrues exactly from the time of the purchase to redemption (or sell), avoiding any gaps which results in loss of interest and lower yields to investors, unlike other products where intermediaries skim some extra interest by hanging onto the funds for a few days.</p>\n<p>See the section entitled “Issuance and Redemption” in the sample Offering Memorandum.</p>\n<p><strong>14. Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>The TBL primary subscription and redemption process on Pivio (as opposed to secondary transactions) involves the investor/TBL Holder completing the following steps:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Step</th>\n<th>Timing</th>\n<th>Parties</th>\n<th>Time for Completion</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1. <strong>Subscription and Issuance period of new TBLs</strong></td>\n<td>Subscribe to new TBL issues and settle bond tokens and stablecoin instantly and atomically</td>\n<td>Investor interacting with the Smart Contract via Pivio Platform or a direct technical integration</td>\n<td>Less than 2 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2. <strong>Outstanding period:</strong> Transfer or deposit TBLs into the Bond Token Vault for Automatic Rollover</td>\n<td>The period from the Issue Date to the Maturity Date</td>\n<td>TBL Investors, market counterparties (incl.

Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary Liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>TBL primary issuance occurs from time to time and every 4 weeks for the series used in the rTBL vault. Existing TBLs can be tapped or redeemed early within a day if the process starts early enough in US hours. Our process is lighter, more direct and therefore faster than competing fund structures and their overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>PV01 has commitments from market makers to provide repo and outright liquidity outside of market hours. The aggregate amount is just under $100mm.</p>\n<p><strong>16. With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.).</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs are currently USDC-denominated (subscribed and redeemed on-chain in USDC), however, they can easily be issued in other stablecoins such as USDT or even DAI and other cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>Our legal documents also have fallback provisions to settle in alternative currencies, should the need (or desire) arise.</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>We are adding full TBL secondary market trading functionality to our PV01 portal (currently manual).</p>\n<p>An automated market maker (AMM) product is being rolled out, initially using a Curve StableSwap Pool to allow swaps from rTBL to USDC. After creation, the pool will not be owned by PV01 but by the Curve DAO. Curve Pools are designed to be permissionless, any user can freely add or remove liquidity and swap between assets.</p>\n<p>In partnership with Sky, PV01 envisions a DAI denominated risk free DeFi yield curve with market participants investing, transferring and making liquid secondary markets in TBLs at scale.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>PV01</strong>, a Bermuda-domiciled and licensed entity, acts as arranger and tokenizer of the digital bond issuance transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Digital Bonds Ltd</strong>, also a Bermuda-domiciled and licensed entity, issues digital bonds (TBLs) through its segregated accounts.</p>\n<p>Both entities conduct their activities from within Bermuda and are subject to regulatory oversight of the BMA in Bermuda.</p>\n<p><strong>TBLs</strong> (and other digital bonds arranged by PV01) are legally classified as securities and as such are subject to compliance with securities laws in Bermuda and in each jurisdiction in which they are offered or sold.</p>\n<p>Notably, none of PV01’s or Digital Bonds Ltd’s activities are subject to compliance with the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (‘MICA’) in the EU, due to the status of our products as securities. Rather, PV01’s activities and products are subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, such as the Prospectus Regulation and MiFID in the EU and equivalents in the UK and other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>PV01 is dedicated to compliance with the laws and regulations to which it and its products are subject in all jurisdictions. Our products are not currently offered to investors in the US or to US Persons and are offered only in off-shore transactions to investors outside the US in accordance with Regulation S under the US Securities Act and as such are not subject to registration in the US.</p>\n<p><strong>English law</strong> is the governing law of our TBLs (and other digital bonds) and the framework within which they are created and issued. There is not currently a specific statutory framework for the issuance of DLT-based securities under English law. However, we have developed the structure and documentation of our products on the basis of English common law, with the advice of our international and local counsels, which firms have issued us with legal opinions confirming the legality and validity of our TBL bonds under English and Bermuda law. Copies of these opinions are available upon request.</p>\n<p>The TBLs are “zero coupon, secured, limited recourse, rollable digital bonds”. As noted above, each TBL bond (each ‘TBL’) is a bond (meaning a direct debt obligation) of the TBL Issuer secured against Underlying T-bills. The ‘limited recourse’ nature of the TBLs means that the liability of the issuer is limited to the amounts received by it in respect of the collateral (on a bond-by-bond basis), which ensures that the TBL Issuer remains solvent, as its liabilities cannot exceed its assets. See further under Question 3 re: bankruptcy-remoteness below.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple Documentation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Deed Poll:</strong> Each Series of TBL bonds is constituted under a Deed Poll entered into by the relevant Issuer for the benefit of the TBL Holders. This is a unilateral document, executed by the Issuer electronically and made available to Holders via a link included in the TBL smart contract.</p>\n<p>The Deed Poll creates the Issuer’s obligations under the TBL bonds and provides for those obligations to be attached to the bond tokens (thereby “tokenizing” them).</p>\n<p><strong>TBL Conditions:</strong> The Conditions of each TBL bond are included in the Deed Poll and are also set out in the Offering Memorandum for the Series. The Conditions are generally the same for each Series of TBLs, although they have evolved over time as new product features (such as the rollover option) have been added.</p>\n<p><strong>Brokerage and Custody Agreement:</strong> The Underlying T-bills are held in segregated cash and securities accounts maintained in the name of the TBL Issuer with StoneX as custodian, which also provides the brokerage services.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Deed:</strong> Security (in the form of an English law fixed charge) over the collateral accounts of each TBL Issuer is granted to the Security Agent under a Series-specific Security Deed.</p>\n<p><strong>SACA:</strong> A Securities Account Control Agreement (‘SACA’) is in place between each TBL Issuer, the Custodian and the Security Agent, giving the Security Agent the ability to immediately seize control over the collateral if a Realization Event occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Arrangement and Tokenization Services Agreement (‘ATSA’):</strong> PV01 as Arranger and Tokenizer provides arrangement and tokenization services, as well as expenses coverage to each TBL Issuer under a separate ATSA for each Series.</p>\n<p><strong>Arranger Agreement:</strong> under this umbrella agreement between PV01 and Digital Bonds Ltd, PV01 provides arrangement services and ongoing expenses coverage to the ‘general’ account of the SPV.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bma.bm/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) </a>- Fintech Authorization and Licensing Committee (the “FALC”)</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>PV01 obtained its license from the BMA’s FALC in 2024 and is licensed under the Digital Asset Business Act 2018 of Bermuda to operate as a digital asset services vendor. PV01 is authorized to operate in the categories of undertaking digital asset transactions on behalf of others and as a market maker for digital assets.</p>\n<p>Digital Bonds Ltd also obtained its license from the BMA’s FALC in 2024 and is licensed under the Digital Asset Business Act 2018 of Bermuda to operate as a digital assets business in the category of issuing, selling or redeeming virtual coins, tokens or any other form of digital asset.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>Digital Bonds Ltd (“DBL”) is structured as a fully bankruptcy-remote entity in accordance with TradFi standards for special purpose vehicles.</p>\n<p>DBL was established in September 2023 as an orphan special purpose vehicle in the form of an exempted company. The entire issued share capital of DBL is held by Zobec Trust Company Limited as share trustee (the “Share Trustee”) on trust for charitable purposes. This ownership structure means the SPV is not a subsidiary of PV01 and therefore it and its assets are not liable to become consolidated with the assets of PV01 in the event of PV01’s insolvency. It also protects against any voluntary winding up of the SPV without PV01’s consent.</p>\n<p>DBL has been registered as a ‘segregated accounts company’ or ‘SAC’ under the laws of Bermuda. The segregated account company structure creates a statutory segregation or ‘ring-fencing’ of assets and liabilities between each of its segregated accounts and the main or ‘general’ account of the SPV. This means that the assets (ie the collateral) of any individual TBL Issuer (as a segregated account of DBL) are not available to satisfy the liabilities (ie TBLs) of any other TBL Issuer or the liabilities of the general account of the SPV. As such, TBL Holders of any given Series have access only to the collateral backing that Series and vice versa.</p>\n<p>The sole business purpose and activity of DBL is the issuance of digital bonds and the purchase of collateral for such digital bonds through its segregated accounts. Each TBL Series is issued by a separate segregated account of DBL, which itself has no other business or liabilities. Even where TBLs are rolled via the token vault, the new TBL tokens received are those issued by a ‘fresh’ segregated account of the SPV and are therefore not exposed to any residual liabilities of the preceding TBL Issuer.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of the SAC structure is that the insolvency of one segregated account of the SPV will not result in the insolvency of any other segregated account or of the SPV as a whole - therefore, in the unlikely event of an insolvency of one TBL Issuer, the holders of other Series of TBLs would not be affected.</p>\n<p>Other features designed to protect against any potential insolvency of each TBL Issuer include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>limited recourse</strong> nature of the TBLs themselves and inclusion of market standard limited recourse and non-petition provisions in each of the Transaction Documents - ensuring that the liabilities of any TBL Issuer at any time do not exceed its assets;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Negative covenants</strong> given by each TBL Issuer in the TBL Conditions and the Security Deed whereby it undertakes not to:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>incur any other indebtedness, or issue any other class of debt securities or shares;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>amend its constitutive documents;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>dissolve or liquidate;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>form any subsidiaries;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>conduct business under any name other than its own;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>have any employees (other than directors or managers to the extent they are employees);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>consolidate or merge with or transfer its assets; or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>engage in any business or activity other than issuing and performing its obligations under the TBLs; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity/expenses support</strong> provided by PV01: in its capacity as Arranger, PV01 pays the ongoing and transaction-specific expenses of the SPV and TBL Issuers, including the fees payable to their service providers. This ensures that the full redemption proceeds of the Underlying T-bills are available for repayment to investors at maturity. In the event of a pricing mismatch between the TBL issuance proceeds and the price payable for the Underlying T-bills, PV01 also provides additional funding to the TBL Issuer to make up any shortfall.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any insolvency of a TBL Issuer or of the general account of DBL would constitute a Realization Event under the TBL Conditions, triggering their automatic acceleration and enforcement of the Security by the Security Agent. Under Bermuda law, the Security Agent would not be prevented from seizing the collateral and liquidating it to satisfy investor’s claims upon an insolvency.</p>\n<p>To protect against any insolvency of the Broker/Custodian, the collateral backing each TBL Series is held in a segregated custody account with StoneX, which operates in compliance with the FCA’s CASS regulatory framework [<a href=\"https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/CASS.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Link</a>]. This requires each TBL Issuer’s assets to be held segregated from other custody clients’ assets and from those of the custodian.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>As a bondholder, TBL investors have a secured limited recourse debt claim against the bankruptcy-remote TBL Issuer holding the underlying collateral.</p>\n<p>See the section of the Offering Memorandum entitled “Description of the Digital Bonds - Rights Attached to the Digital Bonds”.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO.</strong></p>\n<p>There is no conflict of interest between the company (either Digital Bonds Ltd or PV01 Capital Markets Ltd.) or products with the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p>See the section of the sample Offering Memorandum entitled “Interests of Natural and Legal Persons Involved in the Issue/Offer”.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product.</strong></p>\n<p>Our TBLs are currently issued as zero-coupon bonds. As such they do not pay out periodic interest, rather they are offered at a discount and pay out at maturity at their face value/principal amount. We view them as bonds for tax purposes as well.</p>\n<p>PV01 has not withheld any tax. If required by law, the TBL Issuer has the right, but not the duty, to withhold or deduct from any amounts otherwise payable to the Holder(s) such amount as the TBL Issuer determines in its sole discretion is necessary for the payment of such taxes, duties, assessments and/or governmental charges. Holders are not entitled to receive additional amounts to compensate for any amounts so withheld or deducted (i.e. there is no ‘grossing-up’ for any withholding or deduction by the TBL Issuer).</p>\n<p><strong>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark.</strong></p>\n<p>The average APY across TBL series 1 to 6 has been 5.25%, compared to 4-week US T-bills returning 5.45% APY.</p>\n<p>PV01’s TBLs mirror the performance of their underlying RWAs - each TBL being backed by a single US T-bill identified by its CUSIP.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p>Custody reports in the form of cash and securities custody account statements are produced by the custodian for each TBL on a daily basis. See the form included below. These are made available to investors via the Pivio Platform and are shared with the Security Agent upon completion of any further issuances of TBLs during Additional Issuance Settlement Windows (where additional Underlying T-bills are purchased by the TBL Issuer) or any partial early redemptions (where a portion of the Underlying T-bills are sold by the TBL Issuer).</p>\n<p><strong>Custody Reports</strong></p>\n<p>Sample Cash and Securities Custody Account Statement produced by StoneX for the TBL Issuer “DB Series-5”.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/d/5d55b430cef9d393150f66580047c961781bcadf.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/djG1vY8subANWBiE1bg1R1PjANV.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d55b430cef9d393150f66580047c961781bcadf_2_624x439.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"djG1vY8subANWBiE1bg1R1PjANV\" width=\"624\" height=\"439\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d55b430cef9d393150f66580047c961781bcadf_2_624x439.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d55b430cef9d393150f66580047c961781bcadf_2_936x658.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d55b430cef9d393150f66580047c961781bcadf_2_1248x878.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E8EBEF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Transactions in the TBLs themselves and TBL cash flows can be monitored with blockchain explorers such as Etherscan.

Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product.</strong></p>\n<p>As PV01 is not a fund product, there are no portfolio accounting reports. Each TBL is a single bond backed by a US Treasury Bill as opposed to a portfolio of assets. PV01 is committed to furnishing Sky with any reports it requires (such as the ones above).</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product.</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs are implemented on-chain through a combination of two smart contracts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>TBL Smart Contracts:</strong> Each Series of TBLs is implemented by a Series-specific ERC-20 smart contract governing the TBL tokens of that Series.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PV01 Vault Smart Contracts:</strong> These are <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-4626 compliant</a> contracts that each manage a single TBL as their asset token, allowing investors to deposit that TBL token into the vault in exchange for a “Bond Token Receipt”. Upon TBL maturity, PV01 as vault owner calls the Rollover Function in the vault smart contract, triggering an automatic exchange of tokens between the vault smart contract and the TBL smart contract of the next TBL Series. TBL tokens in the vault representing the maturing TBLs are exchanged for TBL tokens representing a new Series of TBLs - a process referred to as “rolling over” the asset.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This occurs seamlessly without requiring any action from investors. They continue to hold their Bond Token Receipts, which can be used to withdraw their entitlement of TBL tokens from the Bond Token Vault at any time up to the next Rollover.</p>\n<p>A single bond token vault is deployed as a separate ERC-4626 smart contract managing rollovers of TBLs with a specific tenure (period from issuance to maturity). The current ERC-2626 vault runs rollovers of TBLs maturing on 4-week intervals, with the ‘vault asset’ updating to the next TBL Series upon each rollover.</p>\n<p>All smart contracts are written in Solidity. The design goals, in order of priority, are: <strong>security, simplicity</strong>, and <strong>efficiency.</strong> The contracts leverage trusted and audited templates and libraries, primarily from OpenZeppelin. Simplicity is a key design principle, minimizing errors and reducing costs for future modifications. Gas efficiency is also considered, provided it does not compromise the primary goals of security and simplicity.</p>\n<p>All Solidity smart contract source code is published on Etherscan.</p>\n<p>The table below provides an overview of the operational contracts, along with links to detailed technical documentation.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs.</strong></p>\n<p>Our firm has extensive experience working with decentralized organizational structures, identifying their yield and cash management requirements and devising Treasury management solutions for them. In previous roles, our team members have worked with AMMs and have actively participated in DAO events, including as the market maker for the biggest L1 launch of 2021. PV01 is committed to working with decentralized organizations and importantly, has the knowledge and experience required to service the particular needs of Sky.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>PV01’s TBL product benefits the SparkDAO and Sky ecosystem by driving liquidity, efficiency, and growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancing SparkDAO’s Liquidity and Efficiency</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs are the highest yielding Treasury products and benefit from the greatest market hours liquidity through direct access to the actual US government bond market.</p>\n<p>TBLs also rely on fewer intermediaries. For instance, several fund products make use of reverse repos, which typically involve the large “too big to fail” banks. A reverse repo means that the fund lends dollars to a bank and receives a government bond in guarantee. While safe, the approach is economically inferior to purchasing T-Bills outright. We also view the unnecessary involvement of more TradFi actors as less consistent with the crypto ethos. Dealing with the US government by purchasing its debt can already be seen as a necessary evil that we accept only because it supports the growth of the crypto ecosystem.</p>\n<p>TBLs provide SparkDAO with the most competitive returns, a frictionless investment process, and rapid redemption (within hours). In comparison to managed funds, a 50:50 investment in 2-week and 4-week rolling TBLs reduces governance complexity, risk, and unnecessary costs, ultimately improving ROI and Sky ecosystem stability.</p>\n<p><strong>A Composable DeFi Primitive for Innovation</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs act as modular financial instruments, easily transferable and reusable. Their non-rebasing structure makes them ideal for building other financial products, opening up new opportunities for financial innovation within the Sky ecosystem. They’re also growing in acceptance as yielding collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>Scaling USDS and De-risking Maker Core</strong></p>\n<p>Issuing USDS against TBLs — secure, risk free, yield-bearing assets — would support USDS’s growth as the DeFi “risk-free currency.” TBLs’ simple structure, fast liquidation, and legal recourse to underlying US T-Bills further enhance Maker Core’s stability and reduce risk.</p>\n<p>Because TBLs are the most direct on-chain representation of government bonds, they can help scale USDS as much as that market will support.</p>\n<p><strong>Driving User Acquisition for the Sky Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs’ transparency and ease of understanding appeal to DeFi and non-DeFi users alike, helping attract new participants and align incentives for all stakeholders. PV01’s deep expertise in TradFi and crypto, alongside its institutional connections, will support SparkDAO and Sky as it introduces new products like corporate bonds, expanding community engagement and participation.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>PV01’s products are available on <a href=\"https://www.polytrade.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Polytrade</a> and we are finalizing several other partnerships, including one already announced with <a href=\"https://www.plumenetwork.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Plume Network</a>, a Layer 2 for RWAs.</p>\n<p>PV01 is currently exploring integrations with major DeFi protocols including Curve, Morpho and a few others. PV01’s TBL is also being on-boarded with major custodians, exchanges and other venues where it will be accepted as yielding collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>PV01’s mission is to build and operate a debt capital market on which a healthy digital asset ecosystem can thrive. The first iteration of PV01’s products are TBLs. However, PV01’s legal structure lends itself naturally to corporate bond issuances. PV01 will soon issue corporate bonds of crypto native companies directly on-chain. The crypto credit market exceeded $30bn at its peak and has the potential to be even bigger in this new cycle. Having the ability to invest in the debt of major crypto-native companies on-chain could be relevant for Spark and other SubDAOs, especially as assets less tethered to TradFi than government bonds.</p>\n<p>Our vision for PV01 is to make our credit products widely accessible to on-chain investors across different ecosystems and protocols. We are actively engaging with lending protocols, DEXs, and other blockchain players to ensure our products are available where they will be most value added.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-pv01/25199\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-pv01/25199","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 22:37:34 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25199"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-pv01/25199.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - PV01"}},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Midas mTBILL","dc:creator":"Midas","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<h3><a name=\"p-99124-i-product-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99124-i-product-summary-1\"></a>I.

Product Information</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Describe the product:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>mTBILL is an ERC-20 token designed to provide onchain exposure to short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills, offering stable dollar-denominated yield. It is an ideal solution for investors and DeFi protocols looking for reliable returns, particularly in volatile market conditions. By leveraging U.S. Treasuries, one of the safest assets globally, mTBILL offers a predictable yield with minimal risk.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of mTBILL is its permissionless transferability. This means the token can seamlessly integrate into DeFi protocols for a variety of use cases, including lending, borrowing, and yield generation. Its flexibility allows it to be used in DeFi money markets, liquidity pools, and collateralized loan platforms, contributing to the overall liquidity and efficiency of these ecosystems. Additionally, the token can be traded on secondary markets, providing liquidity to investors when needed.</p>\n<p>In terms of accessibility, mTBILL is available to a wide range of investors. Unlike most tokenized onchain Treasuries, mTBILL is available to retail investors during primary market issuance and with no minimum investment requirement, truly democratizing access to onchain yield-bearing assets. This is because the issuance of Midas’s products is approved by regulators, instead of relying on prospectus exemptions commonly utilized by RWA issuers in the market, which limit the products to a limited group of accredited investors with $100,000 investment minimum thresholds in addition to net worth requirements.</p>\n<p>This broad accessibility aligns with Sky’s vision of making institutional-grade financial products available to everyone, fostering inclusivity, and making Midas the internet’s best place to save and invest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Midas-issued tokens are not available to persons and entities in the US, China, and to those in sanctioned countries. Midas-issued tokens are also not available to individuals in the UK.</em></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Describe the underlying asset</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>mTBILL is exclusively composed of short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills, as well as funds and ETFs that are comprised of US Treasury Bills, ensuring that the asset is of the highest credit quality and liquidity. Such funds might include the BUIDL fund whose assets are managed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, ensuring that they are held in a highly liquid, low-risk portfolio.</p>\n<p>Ankura Trust, serving as both an independent data verification agent and security agent, plays a critical role in ensuring that the assets backing mTBILL qualify as eligible collateral. If the assets fall outside of the established criteria, an ineligible collateral event is triggered. Ankura’s primary responsibility is to safeguard the interests of tokenholders by continuously monitoring and enforcing compliance. Further details about Ankura’s specific responsibilities regarding ineligible collateral are outlined in later sections.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yield from mTBILL is transferred via price accrual, which mirrors the interest earned from the underlying U.S. Treasury Bills. The token’s value usually appreciates daily, reflecting the accrued interest and it does not require manual reinvestment. Performance reporting is provided by the independent verification agent Ankura Trust.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>mTBILL is issued by Midas Software GmbH, a German-based SPV that operates under the jurisdiction of BaFin (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority). The FMA in Liechtenstein has approved a Base Prospectus for Midas Software GmbH, which governs the issuance of mTBILL.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The portfolio for mTBILL is exclusively composed of short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills, as well as funds and ETFs that are comprised of US Treasury Bills, ensuring that the asset is of the highest credit quality and liquidity. The concentration limits are designed to maintain a diversified exposure across different Treasury Bill issuances, minimizing risk while ensuring that the portfolio remains stable and low-risk. The independent verification agent, Ankura Trust, monitors and enforces that the collateral is invested within the predefined eligible scope of securities.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>No, the mTBILL portfolio does not utilize hedging or derivatives or permit such activity.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product.

Provide a breakdown by blockchain.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>mTBILL currently has an AUM of $7 million, with all assets currently on the Ethereum blockchain. As Midas expands, we plan to deploy mTBILL on other chains, which will further diversify and grow the product’s AUM, enhancing its accessibility and utility within DeFi. Midas also has 8 figures of capital commitments from various ecosystems to seed mTBILL and mBASIS liquidity with the largest being an LOI for $50mn of seeded liquidity in a nascent L2 ecosystem.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>What are the standard fees (i.e., subscription, redemption, management, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gross Yield</strong>: <em>~5.16%</em>*</li>\n<li><strong>Annual Tokenholder Fee</strong>: 10% of earned interest (waived for Sky)</li>\n<li><strong>Instant Mint Fee</strong>: 0.0%</li>\n<li><strong>Instant Redeem Fee</strong>: 0.07% (waived for Sky)</li>\n<li><strong>Mint Fee</strong>: 0.0%</li>\n<li><strong>Redeem Fee</strong>: 0.0%</li>\n<li><strong>Net Yield</strong>: ~5.16%</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>*<em>yield at the time of writing</em></p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong>Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>No other fees are applicable.</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li><strong>How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In <strong>primary markets</strong>, the issuance and redemption of mTBILL tokens to primary users requires accepted counterparties (e.g. those who have successfully passed KYC and AML checks and have successfully onboarded to Midas). There is also a blacklist function to prevent sanctioned individuals and operators of scam/fraud operations from utilizing the asset.</p>\n<p>In <strong>secondary markets</strong>, mTBILL is permissionless and freely transferable. This makes mTBILL a suitable collateral asset for SparkLend &amp; DeFi lending protocols strategically aligning itself with Sky’s DeFi <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959\">roadmap</a>.</p>\n<p>The token’s permissionless and freely transferable nature makes it an ideal collateral asset for DeFi lending protocols like SparkLend. This flexibility allows users to seamlessly use mTBILL as collateral, supporting lending markets’ continuous liquidity and stability. Its design ensures that any participant can engage in lending and borrowing, which we touch on more deeply in Section VI of this proposal.</p>\n<p>By integrating mTBILL into SparkLend, Sky can elevate the base lending rate in DeFi markets. This aligns with Sky’s roadmap to scale DeFi and make high-quality financial products accessible to everyday users. The on-chain composability of mTBILL also supports efficient liquidations, ensuring that lenders are protected in volatile market conditions.</p>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li><strong>What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Midas deployed mTBILL earlier this year on Ethereum Mainnet. It has had a few million dollars in monthly transaction volume. It’s important to note that this soft launch was intentionally limited as Midas worked to secure regulatory approval for its Prospectus, which was recently obtained in August 2024. This approval is a significant milestone, as it removes all initial investment minimums and opens mTBILL allocations to non-accredited investors (excluding the US and sanctioned jurisdictions), which we believe will dramatically increase its use and adoption within DeFi markets.</p>\n<p>As Midas exits its soft launch phase at the end of September, we expect transaction volume to grow substantially. We are particularly excited about a $50 million Letter of Intent (LOI) of seed liquidity from a major Foundation, which has committed to having Midas natively deploy mTBILL in their chain. This liquidity injection will help fuel even greater adoption and enhance the product’s presence across the DeFi ecosystem. The team has also worked alongside vault curators Steakhouse, Re7, and Leadblock to launch multiple Morpho vaults on both Ethereum and Base.</p>\n<p>Midas also has an integration roadmap with both regulated custodians and non-custodial wallets, which, coupled with no initial investment minimums and accessibility (outside of the US and sanctioned entities) for retail, will lead to future growth. With this upcoming liquidity and the removal of restrictions, mTBILL is well-positioned to become a pervasive asset in the DeFi space, driving higher transaction volumes in the months ahead.</p>\n<ol start=\"13\">\n<li><strong>What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Subscriptions and redemptions for mTBILL against USDC are processed atomically and are settled within the blocktime of the Ethereum Blockchain. Other stables would be processed quickly, though not atomically.

Legal Structure</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The mTBILL token is issued by Midas Software GmbH, a Germany-domiciled SPV, under the laws of the European Union. The product is structured as a tokenized debt instrument classified as a MiFIDII security.</p>\n<p>The legal framework governing mTBILL is based on German and Liechtenstein law, which provide a robust legal environment for financial products, ensuring compliance with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) regulations. The product operates primarily within the European Economic Area (EEA) but is accessible to global investors, subject to local regulatory restrictions. The issuer, Midas Software GmbH, is responsible for ensuring that the product adheres to all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The mTBILL product is subject to oversight by several key regulatory bodies, ensuring rigorous compliance with European and international financial regulations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>BaFin (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht)</strong>: As the primary regulator for Midas Software GmbH, BaFin oversees the product within Germany. BaFin is responsible for ensuring that mTBILL complies with both national regulations and broader EU-wide standards, including those set by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). This ensures that the product adheres to strict investor protection and market transparency requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA)</strong>: The Liechtenstein FMA plays a crucial role in overseeing aspects of mTBILL given their approval of the Base Prospectus. The FMA’s approval signifies that the product meets all necessary regulatory standards under both Liechtenstein and EU law.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>European Passporting</strong>: The FMA’s approval of the Base Prospectus also enables European passporting, which is a critical feature of the EU’s single market for financial services. European passporting allows mTBILL to be offered and marketed across all member states of the European Economic Area (EEA) without the need for additional regulatory approvals in each country. This facilitates the permissionless distribution of mTBILL throughout Europe, broadening its accessibility to investors across multiple jurisdictions while ensuring that it remains under the supervision of a unified regulatory framework.</p>\n<p>Together, these regulatory bodies ensure that mTBILL is governed by the highest standards of financial regulation, providing a robust and transparent investment product that is both secure and compliant. The combined oversight of BaFin and the FMA, reinforced by the advantages of European passporting, offers investors confidence in the product’s integrity and its widespread availability across Europe.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Midas Software GmbH has received the authorizations for the issuance of mTBILL by having received approval of the Base Prospectus and these Final Terms together, which constitute the formal issuance documentation required for regulatory approval under the Prospectus Regulation (EC) 2017/1129.

For Collateral comprising tokens, Midas has transferred the both the tokens and the proceeds and claims from a sale or other disposal of tokens by way of security to the Security Agent and assigned its claims to demand delivery and possession (Lieferungs- und Herausgabeansprüche) against the relevant crypto custodian to the Security Agent as security in order to secure claims of the investors (the <strong>“Tokenholders”</strong>) against Midas and the claims of the Security Agent for compensation of its costs and expenses incurred in connection with its function as Security Agent (together the <strong>“Secured Claims”</strong>). The Security Agent has accepted the Pledge, and the custodian has been notified of the Pledge.</p>\n<p>The assets underlying mTBILL are held in a bankruptcy-remote trust structure managed by the Security Agent, <strong>Ankura Trust Company</strong>. Ankura ensures that the assets can be liquidated and distributed to investors if necessary.

As a permissionless ERC-20 token, mTBILL can be freely transferred and integrated into DeFi platforms for lending, borrowing, and enhancing liquidity.</p>\n<p>The token operates through automated smart contracts, enabling instant minting and redemption using stablecoins via the Midas website, providing real-time liquidity. This ensures that mTBILL is highly accessible for DeFi users, allowing seamless participation in decentralized markets. Partnerships with liquidity providers like Flowdesk, GSR, and Wintermute further enhance market liquidity, ensuring smooth trading and minimal market impact.</p>\n<p>Yield is distributed through price accrual, meaning the token’s value increases daily as interest from U.S. Treasury Bills, or similar underlying, accrues, with price updates secured by oracles such as Ankura Trust and Chronicle Labs.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></p>\n<p><em>Token</em></p>\n<p>mTBILL is a permissionless ERC-20 token on EVM chains, enabling investors to access the full range of DeFi platforms, services, and strategies.

Alec now leverages this background to drive forward the Midas mission, ensuring all Midas products resonate within the ever-evolving DeFi landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Blocktower</strong>, a lead investor and close advisor for Midas, has worked with MakerDAO in expanding its portfolio of real-world assets, particularly by facilitating investments in structured credit products and U.S. Treasuries. BlockTower has managed several MakerDAO vaults, helping Maker diversify into real-world credit assets and enhance the resilience of DAI by providing access to stable, non-crypto-related cash flows. Additionally, BlockTower Andromeda, <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-blocktower-andromeda-rwa015-a-onboarding-risk-parameter-changes-dsr-increase-spark-protocol-proxy-activation-mkr-vesting-transfers-june-14-2023\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWA015</a>, a subsidiary of BlockTower, has been instrumental in facilitating MakerDAO’s expansion into RWAs, with its holdings reaching $752 million.</p>\n<p><strong>Framework Ventures</strong>, another lead investor and close advisor for Midas, worked with Sky in a pivotal role during a crucial event in Sky’s history. Specifically, during a major MKR auction held to recover DAI collateral after the “Black Thursday” crash, Framework Ventures joined the <a href=\"https://blog.makerdao.com/the-dai-backstop-syndicate-decentralization-at-work/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dai Backstop Syndicate</a>. This syndicate was formed to act as a buyer of last resort during the auction, stepping in to purchase MKR if auction prices dropped below a certain threshold. Framework’s involvement was critical for ensuring the stability of DAI during a time of crisis. <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmbBVg2D\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MIP13c3-SP1</a> was later introduced which helped formalize the community’s response to similar crises.</p>\n<p><strong>Ankura Trust</strong> serves as a Security Agent and Verification Agent for mTBILL and has worked with MakerDAO on select real-world asset projects (see <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP117#MIP117c2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MIP117</a>). As a Security Agent in certain RWA vaults, Ankura has overseen and safeguarded the collateral placed in these vaults, ensuring compliance with MakerDAO’s terms. In partnerships involving structured credit, like those managed by BlockTower, Ankura’s role includes managing the collateral backing these investments and overseeing liquidation processes in the event of default, ensuring compliance with MakerDAO’s liquidation protocols to protect the interests of tokenholders.</p>\n<p><strong>Jacek Czarnecki</strong> is an investor in Midas’ parent company.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Berto</strong> is the advisor on Midas’ risk management framework. During her tenure at Aave Companies, Alex was instrumental in setting resilient DeFi risk standards that endured extreme market conditions. After helping to propel the protocol’s growth, Alex supported its consolidation, developing a risk management framework covering tracking, alerting, and mitigations.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or Sky ecosystem?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Midas is committed to enhancing the utility of USDS and the Sky ecosystem. This commitment begins with integrating USDS into Midas’ product suite, enabling users to request issuance and redemption of mTBILL or mBASIS using USDS. This integration offers USDS holders a variety of investment options: exposure to tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills through mTBILL or delta-neutral perpetual futures funding yield via mBASIS. This bolsters the overall utility of the USDS token by providing additional ways for USDS holders to earn yield across different market cycles, bull or bear. As USDS becomes more pervasive over time, it’ll enhance the stability and foster the growth of the Sky ecosystem. Midas is positioned to further support Sky with the introduction of new products that leverage a broader collateral base, potentially including corporate bonds, non-U.S. foreign debt, and other structured products while maintaining composability with USDS.</p>\n<p>In SparkLend, Midas plays a crucial role in the liquidation process, which is open to anyone. Midas’ tokens are permissionless in the secondary market, allowing liquidators to bid on defaulted loan assets and efficiently recover lenders’ debts. This feature is vital for DeFi money markets and has already proven successful in Midas’s Morpho Vault, where its permissionless design facilitates seamless participation in loan recovery. By enabling anyone to participate in liquidations, SparkLend fosters a more inclusive and efficient market, driving the adoption of its decentralized lending protocol. Moreover, as SparkLend continues to grow within the Sky ecosystem, the integration of Midas tokens like mTBILL and mBASIS will help elevate the base rate of lending in DeFi, bringing it closer in line with traditional finance rates.</p>\n<p>Additionally, since mTBILL provides instantaneous redemptions, liquidators can immediately redeem the underlying assets’ net asset value (NAV). This mitigates market exposure risks, as liquidators do not need to worry about volatility during the liquidation process. This ensures that lenders are protected even in the event of market instability, enhancing the overall stability of the SparkLend protocol and its ability to manage risks. Moreover, as mTBILL narrows the arbitrage gap between DeFi and CeFi markets, it ensures that SparkLend will remain competitive with traditional financial institutions.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/3/63faa93659293022b8cd025c6dc68af8860aa04e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/egsj6WNbue7kGtd4pafO8iwqxfU.png?dl=1\" title=\"Loop Breakdown\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/3/63faa93659293022b8cd025c6dc68af8860aa04e_2_690x345.png\" alt=\"Loop Breakdown\" data-base62-sha1=\"egsj6WNbue7kGtd4pafO8iwqxfU\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/3/63faa93659293022b8cd025c6dc68af8860aa04e_2_690x345.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/3/63faa93659293022b8cd025c6dc68af8860aa04e.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/3/63faa93659293022b8cd025c6dc68af8860aa04e.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CEE0ED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Given that the DAO relies on a network of actors to automatically identify and process liquidations, Midas intends to develop Keepers to support and maintain the health and security of both SparkLend and Maker Core. These Keepers will automate parts of the liquidation process, ensuring the timely and accurate execution of liquidations, which is essential for preserving the integrity of the lending system. By building these tools, Midas ensures that SparkLend and Maker Core can scale securely while continuing to offer efficient and truly decentralized financial services.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>mTBILL is integrated with Morpho’s lending markets on both Ethereum and Base and is available as an eligible collateral within Leadblock and Gaunlet’s USDC metamorpho vaults.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As the US Federal Reserve cuts rates over time, Midas sees a palpable need onchain for non-US Treasury-backed tokenized products, where users can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Midas basis trading token, mBASIS, provides Spark users with a high-yield opportunity to earn delta-neutral returns on high-volume cryptocurrencies such as ETH and BTC. The mBASIS token is backed by a strategy that is actively managed by an institutional asset manager that is issued by the same Midas entity with investor assets that are held in a bankruptcy remote vehicle. Users can leverage mBASIS to create “bullish” positions, anticipating an increase in the market price for BTC, ETH, or the largest crypto altcoins. And while investors will seek higher yields from products like mBASIS, there is also an argument that reduced borrowing costs will boost overall investment in the crypto ecosystem, which still makes mTBILL an invaluable asset given the proven utility and need for tokenized yield-bearing assets in DeFi. This is why Midas believes in creating a toolkit for investors where numerous tokenized products can be utilized in different rate environments.</p>\n<p>Further, we are positioned to tokenize any number of RWAs and high-yield structured products based on market conditions, such as Euro and high-yield corporate bonds. These products will provide diversified yield opportunities for SubDAOs as the Sky ecosystem continues to scale USDS well beyond $100 billion. This diversified collateral approach ensures that lending markets like Spark remain efficient and competitive through different market conditions.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/2/32d1bfe3668ae415f6412cddbd0b8fb9568618e3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7fzg712Yxv49pds9thY7hkWQgqn.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Roadmap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/2/32d1bfe3668ae415f6412cddbd0b8fb9568618e3_2_690x401.jpeg\" alt=\"Roadmap\" data-base62-sha1=\"7fzg712Yxv49pds9thY7hkWQgqn\" width=\"690\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/2/32d1bfe3668ae415f6412cddbd0b8fb9568618e3_2_690x401.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/2/32d1bfe3668ae415f6412cddbd0b8fb9568618e3_2_1035x601.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/2/32d1bfe3668ae415f6412cddbd0b8fb9568618e3_2_1380x802.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D1D1D3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>More About Midas:</strong></p>\n<p>Midas shares deep ties with large active participants in the Sky ecosystem. <strong>BlockTower</strong> and <strong>Framework Ventures</strong> are also significant holders of MKR and long-standing ecosystem participants and co-lead Midas’s $9mn <a href=\"https://midas.app/blog/midas-raises-8-75-million-funding-round-led-by-framework-ventures-blocktower-and-hv-capital\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">investment round</a>.

To mitigate risk and enhance diversification, the Fund will invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities, which include bills, bonds, and notes issued by the U.S. Treasury (“Treasury Securities”). Assets not invested in Treasury Securities may be held in cash or cash equivalents. For these purposes, “cash equivalents” include high-quality, highly liquid investments that typically have maturities of less than 90 days, including, but not limited to, bankers’ acceptances, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, short-term government bonds, treasury bills, and registered money market funds that operate by Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will have a maximum average portfolio duration of zero to eight years and a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity between zero and five years. This strategy reduces exposure to specific maturities and enhances the product’s overall stability. The asset eligibility criteria for ArCoin are designed to ensure that the portfolio remains highly liquid and secure.

The distribution across blockchains reflects Arca Labs’ strategy to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchain ecosystems to enhance liquidity, interoperability, and security.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ArCoin’s initial investment traction was modest, largely due to the challenging environment faced by upstart asset managers like Arca during that period. When we received authorization to launch ArCoin in 2020, the broader market conditions were particularly unfavorable for attracting significant investment. At that time, portfolios were yielding near zero due to historically low interest rates, which made it difficult to highlight the potential yield advantages of ArCoin to prospective investors. Additionally, as a new player in the asset management space, establishing credibility and gaining investor trust posed inherent challenges. The combination of these factors contributed to a slower accumulation of assets under management (AUM) during the initial phase, as investors were more inclined to stay with established institutions or opt for risk-averse strategies in a low-yield environment.</p>\n<p>Arca Labs is committed to maintaining and growing the AUM of ArCoin, ensuring that the product remains competitive and attractive to a broad range of investors. This growth is supported by ongoing efforts to expand the token’s presence across additional blockchains and DeFi platforms.</p>\n<p>Standard fees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Management fee: 0.05%</li>\n<li>Blockchain Administration Fee: 0.20%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arca Labs adheres to a transparent fee structure designed to be competitive while ensuring that the product remains sustainable.

Thus, all subscriptions and redemptions follow stringent guidelines as laid out by the SEC. Subscriptions into the Fund are processed at the Net Asset Value (NAV) on the day that the corresponding wire is sent to the Fund Transfer Agent. Investors will receive their share representation as tokens in their Ethereum-compatible wallet after NAV is struck for the day their wire is received.</p>\n<p>The Fund currently offers investors the ability to redeem shares once a month during the redemption period, which is typically the first 10 business days of each month. Investors may submit the requested redemption amount at any time during that period. The shares submitted for redemption will be priced on the redemption pricing date. USD proceeds will be paid back to the investor within 7 days of the redemption pricing date.</p>\n<p>The expected time for subscriptions and redemptions is designed to be as short as possible while complying with relevant rules and regulations, providing investors with access to the market. Arca Labs has implemented robust processes and systems to ensure that these timeframes are consistently met, providing investors with accessibility to ArCoin.</p>\n<p>Arca Labs regularly reviews and optimizes the subscription and redemption processes to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of investors and remain aligned with market expectations.

This process is streamlined to ensure that investors can access or exit their positions with minimal friction. A detailed flowchart of the fund flow is available upon request, providing transparency into each transaction process step.</p>\n<p>The subscription process begins when an investor submits a request to purchase ArCoin. The investor transfers the required funds to the transfer agent, who then issues the corresponding amount of ArCoin to the investor’s blockchain wallet. The redemption process works in reverse, with the investor submitting a request to redeem ArCoin for fiat. The transfer agent then liquidates the necessary amount of U.S. Treasury securities and transfers the proceeds to the investor.</p>\n<p>The subscription and redemption processes are designed to be seamless and efficient, providing investors with access to ArCoin. The use of blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are transparent, secure, and fully traceable.</p>\n<p>Liquidity vehicles:<br>\nArca Labs has established paths to liquidity in the form of secondary markets operated by approved liquidity providers to enhance the efficiency of redemptions and subscriptions. These vehicles ensure that ArCoin remains liquid and accessible, even during high demand or market volatility periods. Additionally, listing ArCoin on an Alternative Trading System (ATS) provides investors with further liquidity options, allowing them to trade ArCoin on a regulated secondary market. This dual approach to liquidity ensures that ArCoin remains highly liquid and accessible, catering to the needs of both institutional and retail investors.</p>\n<p>The liquidity vehicles are designed to provide additional flexibility for investors. They allow them to buy and sell ArCoin on secondary markets without waiting for the standard subscription and redemption processes. This enhances the product’s overall liquidity and provides investors with greater control over their investments.</p>\n<p>Arca Labs works closely with approved liquidity providers to ensure that these vehicles operate smoothly and efficiently, providing a reliable source of liquidity for ArCoin holders. The use of secondary markets, including the ATS listing, helps to ensure that ArCoin remains competitively priced, reflecting its true market value at all times.</p>\n<p>Future development plans:<br>\nArca Labs is actively exploring opportunities to expand ArCoin to additional blockchains, thereby increasing its interoperability and accessibility. Future plans also include integrating new DeFi protocols and introducing additional U.S. Treasury-backed products that align with the needs of a diverse and growing investor base.</p>\n<p>The expansion to additional blockchains is a key part of Arca Labs’ strategy to increase the reach and impact of ArCoin. By making the token available on multiple blockchains, Arca Labs can tap into new markets and user bases, increasing the adoption and utility of the product. This expansion also enhances the security and resilience of ArCoin, as it reduces the reliance on a single blockchain infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In addition, we look to create new opportunities and applications for ArCoin inside and outside of the DeFi ecosystem.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs<br>\nAs the fund is new, there has been no previous relationship with MakerDAO or other DAOs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?<br>\nWhile there are a number of other tokenized funds in the market, we believe ours is among the most secure due to the legal approach to structuring (Unit Trust, a structure tested over decades in TradFi fund management) and the jurisdiction of issuance (Singapore, which has a clear framework for the regulation of tokenized securities). The  Fund is an offshore entity from a U.S. standpoint and maintains no U.S. nexus, reducing the potential risk of intervention by the U.S. SEC, the securities regulator in a jurisdiction that has not yet clarified treatment of tokenized securities, including tokenized U.S. Treasuries and Treasury funds.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Fund’s technology partner, Libeara, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Chartered Group, a leading global banking group and a supporter of digital asset initiatives across custody, trading, tokenized deposits, tokenized supply chain finance, wholesale and retail CBDCs and more. Standard Chartered Bank also banks a number of leading web3 projects in Asia and globally.</p>\n<p>The Fund is the second tokenized fund to be established by the Manager in collaboration with Libeara (the first being SGD Delta Fund, on which more information is provided in Section VI.4, below), with more tokenized funds and asset classes in the product pipeline. Once onboarded with the Manager, SparkDAO/MakerDAO will be able to access many of these other tokenized products as well.</p>\n<p>We believe the MakerDAO/Sky community would benefit greatly from the presence of the Investment Manager and Standard Chartered Group and their partners in the ecosystem.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Fund is not yet integrated in any other protocols or platforms, though we expect it to be within three-to-six months of launch. We view Fund and the subsequent tokenized funds we plan to issue as bridges between TradFi capital and DeFi functionality, especially given our relationship with Libeara, the tokenization platform provider, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<pre><code>Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Manager has also established the SGD Delta Fund which is another sub-fund of the Delta Master Fund that invests in invests in securities issued by the Government of Singapore, which could be relevant for any low-risk, currency diversification needs.</p>\n<p>The following documents will be submitted privately as supplementary information:<br>\n•\tInformation Memorandum<br>\n•\tTrust Deed<br>\n•\tSubscription Agreement<br>\n•\tNCC audit report<br>\n•\tSample of Investor monthly NAV report<br>\n•\tFund Factsheet<br>\n•\tRating Report for the SGD Delta Fund</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-libeara-usdlta-fund/25190\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-libeara-usdlta-fund/25190","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 17:03:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25190"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-libeara-usdlta-fund/25190.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application – Libeara (USDLTA Fund)"}},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Archax Ltd","dc:creator":"Archax","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<p>Grand Prix Application</p>\n<p>I.

This provides a diversified basket of exposure to these AAA-rated MMFs. Sky can decide the weightings.</p>\n<p>The tMMFs take the form of ‘Beneficial Ownership Tokens’ representing investments in the MMF(s) of these asset managers, with the tokens issued and legally enforceable under English Law. The underlying units of the MMFs are held in FCA-regulated, bankruptcy remote safe custody by London based, Archax Limited.</p>\n<p>Note, Archax’s complete list of tokenised funds is currently 80+ meaning Sky will have future flexibility depending on market conditions. Any of the tokenised funds can be invested in independently or as part of a basket token.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Issuer jurisdiction:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Archax is a UK domiciled and an FCA authorised and regulated entity.<br>\nThe 4 respective MMFs are domiciled and issued from Ireland &amp; Luxembourg.</p>\n<p>As outlined in your request, there may be times when other funds are required.

Company Details</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Company description:<br>\nArchax has been focused on securities since its incorporation 6.5 years ago. During this time, we have developed a robust infrastructure on which to offer tokenised ‘real world assets’ (RWAs).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Archax is an FCA-regulated exchange, broker, and custodian, and was the first name on the UK cryptoasset register. This combination of regulatory permissions enables us to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. Our vision is the tokenisation of all financial assets – we are a tokeniser, custodian, marketplace, and broker, allowing us to offer a one-stop shop for RWAs.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Key personnel biographies</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Graham Rodford | CEO &amp; Co-Founder<br>\nGraham is a qualified accountant, with over 25 years’ experience in financial services.

Product Information</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describe the product:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The basket token (bToken) is a weighted basket of up to 4 tokenised money market funds (tMMFs) that are accessed via Archax’s formal distribution agreements with some of the largest global asset managers (note: our distribution agreements allow us to tokenise more than just Money Market Funds).</p>\n<p>The specific asset managers and funds will be listed in the accompanying email.</p>\n<p>We create Beneficial Ownership Tokens (BoTs) that represent legally enforceable rights to the units in the underlying MMFs held in our FCA-regulated, London based custodian. [We can create natively digital MMFs too] The MMFs we tokenise tend to be the most institutional share classes of the respective asset managers (meaning the lowest fee structures) that trade at par to their NAV (1.0000 versus USD).</p>\n<p>All the funds are available for same day (T+0) subscription and redemptions, subject to cut-off times, and would settle T+1 if cut-off times are not met. In some cases, the products also provide intraday liquidity. Because of our connectivity to Circle, these amounts can be swapped to/from fiat seamlessly. Yields from the MMFs can either be distributed via airdrops of more tokens or distributed as stablecoins. There are no minimum or maximum subscription or redemption sizes.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Describe the underlying asset:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The specific asset managers and MMFs are included in a separate email. All the funds below are in USD, but Archax also provides MMFs in other currencies, such as GBP and EUR.</p>\n<p>Money Market Fund 1</p>\n<p>Domicile: Luxembourg</p>\n<p>The Fund invests in high quality US Dollar denominated money market instruments, with minimum liquidity maturity requirements, and invests in securities with an outstanding term to maturity of no more than 397 days. The entire Fund must have a weighted average maturity of no more than 60 days and a weighted average life (WAL) of no more than 120 days.</p>\n<p>Money Market Fund 2</p>\n<p>Domicile: Ireland</p>\n<p>The Fund invests in a broad range of government fixed income securities (such as bonds) and money market instruments (MMIs) (i.e. debt securities with short term maturities), reverse repurchase agreements and in cash. At least 99.5% of the Fund’s assets will be securities, instruments or obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States government or another sovereign government and reverse repurchase agreements referencing such assets and in cash.</p>\n<p>Money Market Fund 3</p>\n<p>Domicile: Ireland</p>\n<p>The fund invests in a diversified range of short-term instruments, including high quality money market instruments (including government securities, bank obligations, commercial paper and other short-term obligations), high quality securitisations and asset-backed commercial paper, deposits, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and units or shares in eligible money market funds. The weighted average maturity is expected not to exceed 60 days.</p>\n<p>Money Market Fund 4</p>\n<p>Domicile: Ireland</p>\n<p>The Fund invests in a range of investment grade fixed and adjustable-rate money market instruments which are transferable securities and primarily denominated in USD.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The 4 tMMFs detailed above are distributing share classes, meaning they maintain a price of 1.0000 (being at par to their NAV).</p>\n<p>This allows for T+0 (same day) subscription and redemption flows, with accrued interest either reinvested or air-dropped to the whitelisted wallet address of the bToken holder (note MMF will credit fiat or units at monthly).</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Depending on which of the MMFs, the issuer is based in either Luxembourg or Ireland, subject to the respective financial regulator in both jurisdictions (CSSF or CBI respectively) while Archax as the tokeniser and regulated custodian is based in London.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The bToken consists of tMMFs that are all beneficial ownership tokens representing legal title interests in AAA-rated public debt CNAV or LVNAV MMFs. Their respective investment mandates are dictated by the official prospectus of the individual fund and the appropriate EU regulations (EU Regulation on MMF and UCITS). The information on the specific funds will be provided directly to the process administrator via email.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each fund has its own hedging strategy. Whilst most money market funds do not explicitly contain hedges, the investment restrictions of each product may allow the asset manager to hedge depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc). Provide flow-charts or diagrams for all related entities and counterparties, if available.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This will be provided in a separate email.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>What is the AUM of the product? Provide a breakdown by blockchain*<br>\nFund Number\tCurrent AUM</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Money Market Fund 1 (Luxembourg)\tUSD 3.6BN<br>\nMoney Market Fund 2 (Ireland) \tUSD 28 BN<br>\nMoney Market Fund 3 (Ireland) \tUSD 7.4BN<br>\nMoney Market Fund 4 (Ireland)\tUSD 32.3BN</p>\n<p>Note that MMF subscriptions can be in either stablecoins or fiat and the subscribed MMF units can be tokenised on any of Ethereum, Polygon, Algorand, Hedera, XRPL, and imminently on Arbitrum, Etherlink and XDC.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>What are the standard fees (i.e., subscription, redemption, management, etc.)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Archax usually has access to the most institutional share classes, and therefore the lowest fee structures, of the respective MMFs. Using our structure, we can usually avoid minimum subscription or redemption sizes creating a more flexible product.</p>\n<p>Archax will then charge the client a single fee (bps of aum) to cover fund access, tokenisation and custody. The fee will be included in a separate accompanying email, along with any information on a proposed discount. Archax does not charge any transaction, deposit or withdrawal fees for use of the MMF products.</p>\n<p>Note, in the event Archax issues an RWA utility token in the future, use of our tokenised RWA products may result in airdrops of that token to users as a long-term incentive for product adoption.</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Under UK and EU regulation, MMFs and tMMFs are considered security instruments. Archax therefore maintains a directory of whitelisted, KYC’d wallets that these tokens can be held in.</p>\n<p>Archax also owns a majority stake in Montis, a company applying for Central Securities Depositary regulation in Luxembourg under CSSF. Combined with Archax’s own permissions outlined above, Archax believes they will be uniquely positioned to be able to create, custody and trade digital securities in the near future bringing enhanced liquidity to RWA.</p>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li>What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The nature of these funds (see AUM reference in question 8), means daily and monthly volume is in the hundreds of millions.</p>\n<ol start=\"13\">\n<li>What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All the MMFs that would form the bToken are available on a same day subscription and redemption basis, subject to cut-off times, with the relevant transfer agent in some cases processing multiple daily redemption windows. If cut-off times are missed, the subscription or redemption will be processed T+1.</p>\n<p>We have not had any interruptions in our subscriptions and redemptions processing.</p>\n<ol start=\"14\">\n<li>Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See table below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/c/6c1b27720e22e1043a9634750be7cba7ce4f7ad7.jpeg\" alt=\"Picture2\" data-base62-sha1=\"fqlK8zrnYdsHKDSMctv5UgwVN5B\" width=\"532\" height=\"724\"></p>\n<ol start=\"15\">\n<li>Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Currently no, but Archax is licenced in the UK by the FCA and can list these tokens on its exchange (secondary activity) or through the Archax OTC trading desk. See question 11 for more information on Central Securities Depositary function.</p>\n<ol start=\"16\">\n<li>With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Subject to the appropriate AML/KYC and chain analysis, Archax can accept subscriptions in USDC, Dai, other stablecoins or fiat currency. Archax may be able to accept other cryptocurrencies subject to operational considerations.</p>\n<ol start=\"17\">\n<li>What are your future development plans for the product?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Archax is developing a collateral transfer network across crypto, cash, securities and tokenised securities (including tMMFs) where KYC’d participants will be able to borrow, lend, purchase or sell, any asset at any time to any participant. This, and connectivity into other collateral networks, will bring significant utility to these tMMFs.</p>\n<p>IV. Legal Structure</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The referenced MMFs are investment companies incorporated with limited liability in Ireland or Luxembourg under the UCITs regime, and then duly authorised in Ireland or Luxembourg as a MMF UCITS.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The referenced MMFs and their managers are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) in Ireland and the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financie (CSSF) in Luxembourg respectively.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The underlying products are authorised in Ireland/Luxembourg as MMFs under the EU UCITs directive and the European Money Market Funds (MMF) Regulation.</p>\n<p>Archax is regulated as an exchange, broker, and custodian in the UK and was the first name on the FCA’s cryptoasset register. Archax has formal distribution agreements in place with the regulated global asset managers of the MMFs.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Legal assessment will be emailed to the process administrator.</p>\n<p>At the MMF level, the funds are run under the UCITS regime, adopted as the global gold standard of regulated fund structures. We will email further information to the process administrator.</p>\n<p>Archax operates subject to the FCA’s CASS regime. CASS rules are the regulations that financial service providers must follow when they hold or control client money or assets. The rules are designed to protect client assets if a firm fails or leaves the market.</p>\n<p>Underlying assets are held by Archax Nominees Limited, a bankruptcy remote entity which operates under English Trust law.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>What rights do tokenholders have?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For all securities offered on Archax, we pass through the rights to the Tokenholder.</p>\n<p>In addition to the rights on each issuance, the Tokenholder has rights with Archax as a client to whom Archax is providing a regulated service, including the right to complain to the regulator of Archax (the FCA) and to seek timely resolution.</p>\n<p>As a leading London based firm in the industry, we have a significant compliance function that can address any concerns.</p>\n<p>At the token instrument level itself, the Tokenholder has a legal claim under the Archax trust deed to enforce their (RWA) asset ownership in the English Courts, which we believe is recognised globally as one of the strongest and most readily enforceable claims that can be associated to an instrument.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>None. Ireland and Luxembourg do not claim taxing rights and Archax provides a custody service (to a foreign entity) which falls outside the UK taxing scope. We would however always recommend a client undertakes its own professional tax assessment based on its own unique set of circumstances.</p>\n<p>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The underlying funds follow transparent benchmarking, which is readily available - links will be provided by email to the process administrator.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All fund performance information is publicly and transparently available, but Archax will also provide account statements on a weekly or monthly basis in addition to account balances being visible on our platform.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The underlying UCIT funds are independently custodied by leading global custodians and the funds’ NAV and accounts are maintained by leading fund administrators. This is also subject to Depository oversight.</p>\n<p>Archax, being subject to CASS regulations, must reconcile client positions multiple times daily and is itself subject to audit.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Describe the technical implementation of your product:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The investing entity would open a regulated custody account with Archax. Once KYC has been completed the client can immediately instruct Archax to mint (subscribe) and (burn) redeem. Archax would then either custody the resulting tMMFs or whitelist &amp; send to the client’s self-hosted wallet.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Archax tokenisation engine was built in conjunction with 3rd party developer Applied Blockchain who routinely conduct internal audit processes. Additionally, by nature of the tMMFs being Beneficial Ownership Tokens, the underlying legal ownership of the actual MMF units sits in our FCA regulated custodian, so are protected from digital bad actors.</p>\n<p>Archax is also ISO27001 accredited, and Cyber Essentials certified.</p>\n<p>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Archax team met with Rune Christensen and team in 2019 to discuss the future of digital securities and the staff of Archax have used MakerDAO on a personal level.</p>\n<p>We are currently in the process of creating DAO structures for clients and working with local regulators to secure consent to issue. We therefore have a significant understanding of how to service a DAO Client.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have an inhouse built crypto due diligence platform which we use to service over 20 crypto companies. This platform provides due diligence reports on a number of DAOs on which our compliance team make decisions.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Archax is one of the leading regulated players in RWA and tokenised funds. We understand regulation and crypto alike. We can help the ecosystem move forward in a regulatory appropriate way whilst maintaining your innovative nature.</p>\n<p>In addition, by investing in these products, Archax will be bridging the gap between traditional finance companies and your DAO.

Since Backed is not a broker/authorized participant it only onboards and sells its products to professional/qualified/accredited clients.</li>\n<li>Backed does not actively market nor solicit users outside Jersey / the EU / EEA. To the extent that qualified investors might come from outside the EU / EEA, this is done on a reverse solicitation basis.\n<ul>\n<li>Backed does not hold a Virtual Asset Service Provider (“VASP”) license, as it exclusively issues and redeems its own proprietary products (which are EU MIFID compliant securities in tokenized form). Backed does not provide any virtual asset services to its clients aside from selling its own issued products.

Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All Backed products are bankruptcy remote. bTokens are issued by an SPV, which is legally separated from Backed Finance AG, the tokenizer and the operator of the employment activity. A 1:1 ratio of underlying assets is maintained at all times and legally must be adhered to. The underlying assets are held with regulated Swiss custodian banks. An appointed security agent has the authority to seize the assets on behalf of token holders in case there is any deviation from the commitments the issuer has made or in a bankruptcy event. In a bankruptcy or insolvency situation, Security Agent Services AG take control of the custody accounts and liquidates the assets in favor of the token holders.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>What rights do token holders have?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Holders of bTokens are the legal owners of our structured products. The blockchain is the primary ledger in which ownership is defined. Holders of bTokens have the primary claim to the collateral value.</p>\n<p>The structured product is directly linked to the underlying asset, ensuring a connection between the real-world asset and the token counterpart. This can be viewed in the Final Terms of any of our products. As our products are issued under an approved EU prospectus, risks are clearly defined, and the products are retail-grade.</p>\n<p>When a user buys bTokens, they enter into a three-way agreement between themselves, Backed, and Security Agent Services AG. This Security Agent is obligated to act in the interest of the token holder in any instance where a complaint is lodged against Backed or if we go bankrupt. In the event we go bankrupt - and to be clear, this isn’t something we expect to happen - The Security Agent takes control of the custody accounts and liquidates the assets in favor of the token holders.</p>\n<p>The underlying assets are owned by our special-purpose vehicle, Backed Assets (JE) Limited, to ensure there is no commingling of user funds and to keep them separate in the event of bankruptcy. Underlying assets are held securely with regulated Swiss custodian banks.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or Sky</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are no conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or Sky.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</li>\n</ol>\n<p>bTokens, as issued by Backed, do not involve any inherent taxation.</p>\n<p>Backed performs transactions of the underlying with minimal financial impact. No tax is involved in such transactions.</p>\n<p>Taxes such as Capital Gains tax, interest, and Dividend tax, etc. might be applicable to the holders of bTokens. Such taxes depend on the jurisdiction of the token holder and can not be anticipated by Backed.</p>\n<p>Backed recommends that Sky seeks professional tax advice to understand their specific tax obligations and reporting requirements related to investing in these products. Backed does not provide tax advice, as the tax treatment may vary based on individual circumstances and jurisdictional rules.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99100-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99100-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-5\"></a>V.

This unique solution has been developed by experienced institutions and professionals ensuring strict adherence to the highest standards in investment management, regulatory compliance and bankruptcy-protection. This strategic partnership combines the strengths of traditional finance and digital assets, offering tailored solutions designed to meet Sky’s specific investment needs.</p>\n<p><strong>A Partnership Built on Trust and Expertise</strong></p>\n<p>Project Serenity is built on a foundation of trust, shared expertise, and a proven track record. By leveraging decades of experience in both capital markets and the digital asset ecosystem, Sygnum and Fidelity International deliver compliant, regulated investment solutions that prioritize security, transparency, and flexibility.</p>\n<p>Sky (formerly MakerDAO) and Sygnum share a long and successful history of being the first partnership worldwide to implement real-world-assets treasury diversification at scale (see <a href=\"https://www.sygnum.com/news/sygnum-lead-partner-in-maker-half-billion-treasury-diversification/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">article</a> <em>“Sygnum lead partner in Maker half-billion treasury diversification”</em>). With Serenity we are keen to add another successful chapter to this unique partnership.</p>\n<p>Serenity offers two potential investment options with different underlying characteristics:</p>\n<p><strong>Option a) Tailored Discretionary Mandate – FIBILL Token</strong></p>\n<p>FIBILL Token: Discretionary Mandate investing in 0-3 months U.S. Treasury Bills, managed by Sygnum with investment advisory services provided by Fidelity International. The ICE BofA US Treasury Bills 0-3m Index serves as benchmark for the investment portfolio of the discretionary mandate.</p>\n<p>This on-chain investment solution is designed to be highly adaptable, allowing regular adjustments to meet Sky’s evolving investment and liquidity needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b) Institutional Liquidity Fund (ILF) – FIUSD Token</strong></p>\n<p>FIUSD Token: Fidelity International’s Institutional Liquidity Fund (ILF), a short-term money market fund known for its strong track record of performance.</p>\n<p>This on-chain investment solution offers direct access to a well-established multi-billion money market investment fund designed for simplicity and cost-efficiency.</p>\n<p>Both investment options are structured to offer attractive yields, competitive fee models and are safeguarded by the bankruptcy-remoteness of traditional securities and digital assets applicable for assets held in custody with a Swiss bank. Thanks to Sygnum’s ability to act as a collateralized lender against the FIBILL and FIUSD tokens, and in collaboration with Circle, as direct access point to USDC, Sygnum can offer 24/7/365 liquidity between $25m-$100m for both options.</p>\n<p>Project Serenity delivers a secure pathway into on-chain representation of the allocated assets. Combining the expertise of Sygnum and Fidelity International, this initiative provides a compliant, regulated approach to on-chain traditional securities investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Sygnum?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Pioneers in Digital Asset Banking:</strong></em> Sygnum is recognized as the world’s first digital asset bank with more than $4 billion in assets under custody and trusted by +1’900 institutional clients globally including leading digital asset foundations, entrepreneurs/founders, family offices, asset managers, brokers as well as other banks, deeply rooted in Switzerland and Singapore. As a licensed bank in Switzerland, Sygnum ensures the adherence to the highest standards of compliance and security.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Proven Tokenization Expertise:</strong></em> Sygnum’s Tokenization platform has been operational for more than four years, supporting a series of successful and globally recognized tokenization projects across private markets, traditional securities, and art.</li>\n<li><em><strong>On-chain Integration:</strong></em> The FIUSD token, launched in March ‘24 on ZKsync Era, integrates Fidelity International’s Institutional Liquidity Fund (ILF) Net Asset Value (NAV) on-chain through Chainlink, delivering greater transparency and operational efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why Fidelity International?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Global Investment Expertise:</strong></em> Fidelity International has over 50 years of experience in the investment industry, serving 2.9 million clients worldwide (excludes Fidelity Investments Canada (FIC) clients). With a long-term perspective and a solid track record, Fidelity International is a trusted name in global finance.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Comprehensive Financial Services:</strong></em> Managing over $862 billion in assets as of June 2024, Fidelity International provides a wide range of tailored investment solutions for institutions and workplace pensions.</li>\n<li><em><strong>All rounded digital assets ecosystem:</strong></em> Fidelity International’s long-term vision is to position itself as a gateway to digital assets investing for investors, relying on Fidelity International’s all rounded digital assets ecosystem to bring in research capabilities and blockchain expertise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>\n<p>Sygnum and Fidelity International are dedicated to expanding their presence in Web3 and blockchain-based finance.

The objective is to replicate the ICE BoFA US Treasury Bill 3-Month Index, with Fidelity International providing the corresponding investment advisory services to Sygnum. The portfolio will be rebalanced on a monthly basis, aiming to maximize returns while optimizing cost-efficiency, particularly in terms of portfolio turnover.</p>\n<p>As a discretionary mandate, the investment guidelines can be easily adjusted to accommodate Sky’s evolving needs, providing flexibility. The token itself is structured under Swiss DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) law and represents a fraction of the underlying investment portfolio <em>(for further information on the legal setup see below: “4. Legal Structure”)</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b):</strong></p>\n<p>In Option b), Sky invests in a Fidelity International money market fund with a proven track record.

These are short-term government debt instruments issued by the US government with a high rating.

How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option a):</strong></p>\n<p>The yield generated by the T-Bill portfolio is passed on to tokenholders through daily price accrual, which directly incorporates the earned interest into the value of the FIBILL tokens. As a result, the token price consistently reflects the value of the (respective fraction of the) underlying T-Bill portfolio, including the cumulative interest earned by that T-Bill portfolio. When a bond reaches maturity, the funds made available are seamlessly reinvested in accordance with the mandate, ensuring continued alignment with the investment strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b):</strong></p>\n<p>The net income generated by the fund is allocated to tokenholders through daily price adjustments, directly integrating the earned net income into the value of the FIUSD token.

How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></p>\n<p>If enabled, token transfers are exclusively available to professional investors fully onboarded with Sygnum, according to Swiss Law. These investors undergo thorough KYC and AML verification as part of the onboarding process, ensuring alignment with all applicable regulatory standards. Upon successful completion of these due diligence procedures, their custodial wallets are added to the whitelist.</p>\n<p>For every transaction, a smart contract is automatically activated to verify the blockchain address. If the address matches an approved one from the whitelist, the transaction is promptly authorized and completed. This process guarantees that only verified investors can engage in token transfers, creating a secure and compliant ecosystem for all participants.</p>\n<p><strong>12. What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option a):</strong></p>\n<p>Since this is a discretionary mandate, the question does not apply. The underlying T-Bills are among the world’s most liquid instruments with multiple billions in Average Daily Trading Volume.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b):</strong></p>\n<p>The Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund - US Dollar Fund, per European money market regulations, is required to have over 10% of its assets in instruments that mature in 1 day and 30% with a weekly maturity. This means there is a naturally high level of liquidity in the portfolio at all times, ensuring that large inflows and redemptions can be met with ease. At present, there is more than 25% in assets with a 1-day maturity. Given a fund size of approximately $8bn, this means it is trading over $2bn of assets in instruments such as time deposits each day.</p>\n<p><strong>13. What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>Subscription requests can be made during standard Swiss banking hours, subject to applicable cut-off times and T-Bill trading venue opening hours.

Subscription can be placed in FIAT or Stablecoins*. Following Sky’s order, Sygnum invests in the fund via J.P. Morgan.</p>\n<p>After the trade is successfully completed, Sygnum mints tokens representing the purchased fund units and distributes them to Sky’s wallet, which is securely held at Sygnum. J.P. Morgan takes on the role of the calculation agent, tasked with determining the NAV of the tokens. J.P. Morgan then communicates the NAV to Chainlink. In return Chainlink pushes the updated asset price on-chain.</p>\n<p><strong>Redemption FIUSD:</strong></p>\n<p>To initiate the redemption process, Sky submits a redemption request to Sygnum. Upon receiving the request, Sygnum burns the tokens and executes the redemption via J.P.

Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p>Sygnum with its direct access to state-of-the-art fiat and cryptocurrency/stablecoin capabilities, as well as its ability as a bank to provide collateralized lending facilities is uniquely positioned to provide maximum redemption and subscription efficiency.</p>\n<p>Sygnum, as a lender against the FIBILL or FIUSD tokens, in collaboration with Circle, as a direct access point to USDC, has designed a liquidity facility concept which increases the redemption and subscription efficiency significantly above current industry benchmarks. The designed process increases the 24/7/365 redemption and subscription capacity for option a) to more than $100 million and option b) to about $25m.</p>\n<p>The above liquidity facility setup is currently being established with final approvals from the respective governance bodies of both parties still pending.</p>\n<p><strong>16. With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p>Subscriptions are generally to be made in the currency of the underlying asset(s), which in both options is USD (e.g., if U.S. Treasury bills are only available for purchase in USD, then USD is the preferred currency the same applies for the ILF fund). Sygnum offers on- and off-ramping services for various cryptocurrencies including DAI and USDC, aiming to provide a seamless and efficient service. Please note that volume limits may apply.</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option a):</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks to the flexible discretionary mandate agreement setup the product can be adjusted to Sky’s needs and different market environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b):</strong></p>\n<p>Sygnum has concrete plans to enhance token features to include multi-chain compatibility as well as interoperability with other on-chain platforms and ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>In broad terms and applicable to both Options a) and b), the overall product can be described as a tokenized on-chain representation of the allocated treasury assets of Sky at Sygnum Bank. The legal structure of the token remains in principle (see the slightly different design below) the same for Option a) and Option b), however, the underlying assets will change.</p>\n<p><strong>Token</strong></p>\n<p>The FIBILL and FIUSD tokens are designed as an instruction token (Anweisungstoken; see art. 466 Swiss Code of Obligations) that represents the right of the respective token holder (i.e., Sky) vis-à-vis Sygnum to demand the delivery/sale of the underlying custody asset:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Option a):</strong> The FIBILL token gives the token holder the right to a fraction of the underlying asset portfolio (e.g., if there are 100 tokens, one token represents 1% of the underlying asset portfolio).</li>\n<li><strong>Option b):</strong> One token represents one fund unit of the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund (ILF). A new FIUSD token is issued for each new fund unit that is subscribed. If a fund unit is sold or redeemed, the corresponding FIUSD token is burnt. The FIUSD tokens therefore always represent the exact number of fund units invested via Sygnum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The FIBILL and FIUSD tokens will be issued as a ledger-based security under Swiss law in accordance with art. 973d et seqq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations. With ledger-based securities, Swiss law explicitly provides for the legal possibility of representing a value or right on-chain. Together with the well-established legal system in Switzerland, this provides full legal certainty in a renowned jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The proposed setup is structured in such a way that Sygnum will hold the assets in its own name but on behalf of Sky (i.e., a fiduciary setup in accordance with art. 16 para. 2 of the Swiss Banking Act to ensure that the assets are segregated in the unlikely event of Sygnum’s bankruptcy).</p>\n<p><strong>Option a)</strong> – Discretionary Mandate</p>\n<p>Sygnum will enter into a portfolio management mandate with Sky (or the relevant counterparty). Based on this portfolio management mandate Sygnum will be mandated to (i) acquire the underlying assets (of the product) and (ii) ensure that the strategy underlying Option a) is being adhered to on an ongoing basis. For this purpose, Fidelity International will advise Sygnum on the selection of the underlying assets and composition of the overall portfolio.</p>\n<p><strong>Underlyings</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option a):</strong></p>\n<p>For an overview of the underlyings see above <em>“3. Product type / underlying asset” under “I. Product Summary”</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b):</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is part of the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund, which is an umbrella fund with segregated liability between funds established as an open-ended investment company with variable capital organised under the laws of Ireland as a public limited company pursuant to the Companies Act 2014.</p>\n<p>There are currently four sub-funds established in the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund, The Euro Fund, The Sterling Fund, The United States Dollar Fund and The United States Dollar Treasury Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>On institution level:</strong></p>\n<p>Regarding the token(s) as such (i.e., not the underlying asset level), there is no direct product supervisory body. However, as a regulated Swiss bank, Sygnum is prudentially supervised by FINMA. This supervision aims at protecting creditors and maintaining the stability of the financial system (see <a href=\"https://www.finma.ch/en/supervision/banks-and-securities-firms/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Banking supervision | FINMA</a>). The authorization to operate as a bank in combination with Sygnum’s approved Organizational Regulations also authorizes Sygnum to operate as a portfolio manager as envisaged in Option a) (see art. 6 para. 1 of the Swiss Federal Act on Financial Institutions).</p>\n<p><strong>On product/underlying asset level:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund is domiciled in Ireland and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>On an institution level:</strong></p>\n<p>Sygnum Bank AG is an authorized Swiss bank and securities firm supervised by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and is authorized to operate as a portfolio manager.</p>\n<p><strong>On an advisory level:</strong></p>\n<p>FIL (Luxembourg) S.A. who acts as the counterparty for the advisory set-up is authorised and supervised in Luxembourg by the CSSF (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier). FIL (Luxembourg) S.A. is a MiFID Investment firm, authorised to provide amongst others portfolio management and investment advice.</p>\n<p>The company is registered in Luxembourg under the company number R.C.S. Luxembourg B 29112. The registered address is 2a, rue Albert Borschette, BP 2174 L-1021 Luxembourg.</p>\n<p><strong>On a product level:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund PLC – The United States Dollar Fund is an Irish domiciled fund which is authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland (the “Central Bank”) as an UCITS under the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2011.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>The chosen setup, in which Sygnum will hold the underlying assets in its own name but on behalf of Sky, is a fiduciary setup.</p>\n<p>According to art. 16 para. 2 of the Swiss Banking Act, tangible assets, securities and claims which a bank safekeeps on behalf of the depositor (i.e., Sky) are considered to be deposits as per art. 37d of the Swiss Banking Act and are therefore segregated by law in case of an unlikely event of bankruptcy of Sygnum. In other words, the underlying assets held by Sygnum on behalf of Sky are bankruptcy remote.</p>\n<p>This applies both to the underlying portfolio of T-Bills (Option a) as well as the underlying fund units (Option b).</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>The FIBILL and FIUSD tokens are designed as an instruction token (Anweisungstoken). The instruction token represents the right of the respective token holder (i.e., Sky) vis-à-vis the bank to demand the delivery or sale of a certain custody asset. <em>For further information see above: Section 4.1.</em></p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>As of the date of submission of this RFP, there are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers that would have a material impact on the products/services described herein.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong>.</p>\n<p>At this time, there is no known (unmitigated) conflict of interest that requires disclosure. Sygnum Bank AG has appropriate policies and procedures in place to adequately identify and mitigate (potential) conflicts of interests.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product.</strong></p>\n<p>Tokenizing the claim to the assets themselves is not expected to have any additional tax implications in Switzerland.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Sygnum is not entitled to provide any tax advice, hence the above information is for general information purposes only and does not constitute tax, legal or financial advice. It is recommended to consult a qualified tax, legal and/or financial advisor for specific tax questions or matters.

Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option a):</strong></p>\n<p>The solution replicates the BofA Treasury Bills 0-3m Index and delivered the following backtested performance. The deviation can be attributed, among other factors, to the goal of replicating the portfolio in a more (cost-)efficient manner. This is reflected in the application of various constraints, such as the number of assets, the duration of the securities in the portfolio, and the frequency of rebalancing. These restrictions are intended to optimize portfolio performance while adhering to specific investment criteria.</p>\n<p><em>Table 6: Option a) Backtesting (Aug 2021 - Aug 2024)</em><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/3/d3ed70c0eee0be441ae06a106e6dc263f938edb0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ueNswvurtJ992vsfYAYMXH0pXhe.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Option a) Backtesting USD\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/3/d3ed70c0eee0be441ae06a106e6dc263f938edb0_2_469x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Option a) Backtesting USD\" data-base62-sha1=\"ueNswvurtJ992vsfYAYMXH0pXhe\" width=\"469\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/3/d3ed70c0eee0be441ae06a106e6dc263f938edb0_2_469x800.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/3/d3ed70c0eee0be441ae06a106e6dc263f938edb0.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/3/d3ed70c0eee0be441ae06a106e6dc263f938edb0.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E7E7E7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The results of the backtest provided are simulated and do not represent actual trading.

Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs.</strong></p>\n<p>The Sky (formerly MakerDAO) and Sygnum relationship was established in early 2022 as a decisive moment for the digital assets industry to progress on the adoption of real-world-assets on-chain. Started per Improvement Proposal 65, Sygnum was selected as lead brokerage and custody partner by the Sky (formerly MakerDAO) community to diversify $500 million of the collateral asset pool backing DAI into traditional securities, particularly into liquid bond strategies under the structure of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) marking thereof one of the most notable collaborations to enable the adoption of real-world-assets by blockchain communities. Most notably this was the first collaboration established with a banking institution attesting Sygnum’s conviction into the blockchain ecosystem and particularly Sky (formerly MakerDAO) and its vision.</p>\n<p>Sygnum’s extensive experience in serving as interface between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem is built on the premise of our unique regulatory status as bank and securities firm which provides additional assurances to Sky such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extensive options for liquidity</strong> achieved via Sygnum’s ability to act as a lender as well as professional broker with access to an underlying network of institutional liquidity providers built and operated over 5 years.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bankruptcy remoteness</strong> for traditional securities and digital assets held under custody with Sygnum anchored in the Swiss Banking Act, art. 16 and 37d.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Strong industry presence</strong> and existing partnerships with key members of the Spark ecosystem such as ZKsync and Chainlink (as Sygnum tokenized $50m of Matter Labs’ treasury reserves onto the ZKsync blockchain, see <a href=\"https://www.sygnum.com/news/sygnum-matterlabs_treasury-fidelity/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">article</a>) or Polygon, on which Sygnum built its multi-chain tokenization stack (supporting Hamilton Lane, leading global private markets investment management firm with over $800bn in assets, in launching DLT-registered shares for a flagship product on the Polygon blockchain, see <a href=\"https://www.hamiltonlane.com/en-us/news/sygnum-bank-apex-dlt-registered-shares\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">article</a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The transparent on-chain portfolio construction used in option a) is a powerful showcase of asset management solutions leveraging the blockchain’s key features of transparency and efficiency.</p>\n<p>We believe that on-chain representation of individual components such as T-Bills, equities and derivatives will enable real-world-asset (RWA) DeFi applications such as collateralized RWA lending, on-chain portfolio management solutions and on-chain structured products.</p>\n<p>Consequently, we see this proposal as a major showcase and industry enabler to drive adoption of on-chain RWA asset management and structured finance solution. These solutions may be integrated into SparkDAO and/or the Sky ecosystem in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>The FIBILL and FIUSD tokens use the ERC20 standard. Through using the ERC20 standard we ensure compatibility with any platform adhering to that standard.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>Fidelity International and Sygnum are currently in the process of developing a new product to shape future on-chain finance. Due to the sensitive nature of this product, Fidelity International and Sygnum are unable to disclose specific details publicly at this time. Fidelity International and Sygnum look forward to sharing more information confidentially with Sky and to making it public when appropriate.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-sygnum-bank-ag-fidelity-international-fibill-fiusd/25177\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-sygnum-bank-ag-fidelity-international-fibill-fiusd/25177","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 10:28:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25177"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-sygnum-bank-ag-fidelity-international-fibill-fiusd/25177.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Sygnum Bank AG & Fidelity International (FIBILL & FIUSD)"}},{"title":"Risk Assessment and Parameter Recommendations: Spark DDM to Aave Lido Market","dc:creator":"monet-supply","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<p>Reviewing the items proposed by Phoenix Labs <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-proposal-for-integrations-into-aave/25005\">here</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>sUSDS supply on Aave V3 Main Market are eligible for the SPK pre-farming airdrop incentive program for 3.33m SPK tokens per month (50% of SparkLend)</li>\n<li>USDS D3M to Aave Lido Market with an initial debt ceiling of 100m to boost adoption</li>\n</ol>\n<p>BA Labs supports the proposed changes.

There is an <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboard-steaklrt-to-aave-v3-lido-instance/18613\">active proposal</a> to list Steakhouse’s Mellow/Symbiotic restaking vault steakLRT as a collateral asset, and additional Mellow/Symbiotic vaults or other Lido aligned collaterals may be listed in the future at the discretion of Aave governance. It is also assumed that USDS will be listed as a borrowable asset to facilitate injection of liquidity via the proposed DDM, and potentially other stablecoins may be listed as borrowable and/or collateral assets (for example Aave’s GHO stablecoin).</p>\n<p><strong>Normal Mode Parameters</strong></p>\n<p>Parameters for the existing listed collaterals, ETH and wstETH, are quite safe. wstETH features 81% liquidation threshold (1% higher than SparkLend) and 6% liquidation penalty (1% less than Sparklend), while ETH features equivalent LT and penalty parameters vs SparkLend. All of these parameters are reasonably conservative and should not present any serious concern even for very large deployments of USDS liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquid Restaking Tokens</strong></p>\n<p>Addition of steakLRT presents some potential risk due to the asset’s liquidity profile and proposed parameters at Aave. SteakLRT currently has less than $1 million worth of secondary market liquidity depth from a single Balancer pool. Due to the way Mellow LRTs work, large number of LRT vault operators fragmenting liquidity, and Mellow’s expected business strategy, we do not anticipate secondary market liquidity will improve much in the future. Given this, exchanging steakLRT (or other Mellow LRTs) for underlying wstETH will primarily rely on the native redemption process. This is expected to take around 1 week in normal conditions, but may take up to a maximum of 90 days if the vault curator in question is unresponsive.</p>\n<p>This delay period is not too problematic when considering borrowing ETH correlated assets, but may increase risk for steakLRT collateral positions that borrow stablecoins such as USDS, as liquidators will not be able to loop their capital atomically if the small amount of DEX liquidity has been exhausted. The proposed liquidation threshold parameter of 75% is acceptable given the initial supply cap of 240 units of steakLRT, but will require DEX liquidity to scale up to maintain adequate safety if supply caps are raised in the future. Risk could be mitigated by setting lower normal mode liquidation threshold and higher liquidation penalty for steakLRT, or by implementing an isolation mode mechanism that prevents excessive borrowing of stablecoins from accounts with steakLRT collateral. Alternatively, the recently proposed new version of the Aave codebase (version 3.2) includes a feature called <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-2-liquid-emodes/19037\">Liquid eModes</a> which may allow for more fine tuned parameterization of LRT assets, which may offer a more efficient way to address these liquidity risks.</p>\n<p>Additional Lido aligned LRTs may be considered for listing in the future. However, because the existing Balancer pool pairs four separate LRTs with the same finite amount of wstETH, listing additional LRTs is not expected to improve the functional liquidity profile of the given assets (LRTs compete for the same pool of liquidity resources).</p>\n<p><strong>ETH Efficiency Mode</strong></p>\n<p>Aave v3 features an efficiency mode (e-mode) mechanism allowing for subsets of listed assets to have greater capital efficiency. Typically this is applied to price correlated assets such as stablecoins or liquid staking tokens. In the case of the Lido market, e-mode is currently applied to ETH and wstETH, with a proposal to also list steakLRT in e-mode when it is formally onboarded by governance.</p>\n<p>Parameters for ETH e-mode in the Lido market are fairly aggressive, featuring a 93.5% maximum LTV and 95.5% liquidation threshold, each 0.5% higher than the comparable Aave main market and the LT being 2.5% higher than the SparkLend mainnet market. Aave uses a redemption rate pricing mechanism for wstETH (and plans to do the same for steakLRT), so there is no risk of price manipulation or flash crashes causing insolvencies in the market. Note that Aave main market and SparkLend also use redemption rate pricing rather than a live market price.</p>\n<p>While redemption rate is better from a risk perspective overall, it means that the margin system will not account for any secondary market price depegs that may occur during stressed market conditions. If the price of wstETH or a supported LRT depegs at least as much as the liquidation penalty (currently 1%), then it will not be profitable for liquidators to bid on positions collateralized by the given collateral; liquidations would not be triggered based on market price, but might become eligible due to interest accrual if the interest rate on the borrowed asset exceeds yield earned on collateral. And if the collateral asset depegs below the liquidation threshold (eg. if price trades below 95.5% of redemption price), then end users will be able to borrow more than the value of their collateral. This implies that if the price of a supported e-mode collateral ever falls below the e-mode LT, all borrowable liquidity for ETH will be exhausted. This could increase risk of insolvency of accounts that supply ETH to borrow stablecoins, where even a temporary inability to withdraw ETH from the market can prevent liquidators from participating fast enough to avoid bad debt.</p>\n<p>ETH currently has a 0% LTV parameter set, which was implemented to avoid non-economical recursive borrowing of ETH while Lido incentives are provided for ETH suppliers. In practice, this means that accounts supplying ETH as collateral cannot open any new borrow positions, so the risk to stablecoin suppliers including the proposed DDM is currently not applicable. However, it is expected that this 0% LTV limit will be lifted at some point in the future and ETH’s liquidity risk will become an important factor for evaluating the DDM’s overall risk profile. Potential mitigation strategies include implementing a market price oracle based kill switch like the one in use on SparkLend (which prevents borrowing activity when stETH depegs), careful calibration and maintenance of supply caps to avoid ETH reaching 100% utilization, a higher slope 2 rate model parameter to incentivize liquidity, or adjustments to ETH e-mode parameters to reduce the likelihood of collateral price falling below LT in worst case conditions.</p>\n<p>While the ETH liquidity risk factors noted above are more pronounced with the Aave Lido market vs SparkLend, due to higher e-mode LT for wstETH, we note that stETH has not experienced a significant depeg that would approach the 95.5% LT since Ethereum staking withdrawals were enabled in April 2023. The largest price divergence over the past year was a very brief depeg down to ~0.993 ETH per stETH on 10 January 2024. So while additional mitigation measures may help improve risk profile, overall we find the liquidity risk to be acceptable for the proposed DDM deposit of USDS.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99090-recommended-parameters-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99090-recommended-parameters-3\"></a>Recommended Parameters</h3>\n<p>The proposed DDM mechanism will utilize a facilitator multisig to direct increases or decreases to DDM exposure, rather than a <code>bar</code> parameter that increases or reduces exposure based on a borrow rate target.</p>\n<p>The relevant parameters for the DDM are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>line</code>: Maximum debt ceiling</li>\n<li><code>gap</code>: Temporary debt ceiling / maximum incremental debt ceiling change</li>\n<li><code>ttl</code>: Minimum cooldown period between when <code>gap</code> debt ceiling increases can be triggered</li>\n<li><code>tau</code>: Period after which bad debt is written off</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the <code>line</code> parameter, this is recommended to be set initially at 100 million USDS, aligning with the strategic agreement for the Aave Lido market DDM. Given the low risk profile of market collateral assets and parameters, this exposure limit should be quite safe, and it is expected that Spark may progressively raise the <code>line</code> parameter in the future if there is strong borrowing demand and the risk profile of the market doesn’t significantly change.</p>\n<p>Because increases in exposure are directed via the facilitator multisig, which is a trusted role, the <code>gap</code> parameter is only needed as a secondary safeguard against excessive pace of exposure growth. We recommend to set <code>gap</code> at 50 million USDS, which will allow for exposure to be scaled up quickly after launch of the DDM and provide flexibility for managing exposure, while still serving as a meaningful limit against rapid exposure growth. We recommend setting <code>ttl</code> at 24 hours, as operationally it is not expected that the facilitators will perform more than one allocation action per day. Given the current ~30 hour governance security module delay, this implies exposure to the DDM could increase by roughly 100 million USDS before any remedial governance reactions.</p>\n<p>Finally, we recommend setting a <code>tau</code> parameter of 7 days matching the parameter in use for the SparkLend DDM. This time length strikes a balance of ensuring prompt recognition of losses in the unlikely event of bad debt, while avoiding unnecessary write offs during short term illiquidity events.</p>\n<p>The Aave Lido market DDM will be added to the <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.8.2.2.5_Direct_Deposit_Breaker_Exception-c240d4fa-ab20-4787-8dbf-7c94c8e78347%7C0db30758e055352c\">DIRECT_MOM GSM Exception</a>, which allows the Sky Governance to pull available liquidity out of the market with a successful Executive vote without the GSM delay in the case of emergency.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99090-parameter-summary-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99090-parameter-summary-4\"></a>Parameter Summary</h4>\n<p><strong>BA Labs, acting as Stability Advisor, recommends to the Stability Facilitator to propose the following initiation parameters for the Spark USDS DDM to Aave Mainnet Lido Market to be included in the first available executive vote according to the <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.3.8.1.4_Spark_Deployment_Of_New_Direct_Deposit_Modules-f2b7774f-a699-4226-994a-370774d7f2df%7C57eaf45219be\">Atlas A.3.8.1.4</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Activate Aave Lido Market USDS Direct Deposit Module</li>\n<li>Set DC-IAM <code>line</code> to 100 million USDS</li>\n<li>Set DC-IAM <code>gap</code> to 50 million USDS</li>\n<li>Set DC-IAM <code>ttl</code> to 24 hours</li>\n<li>Set <code>tau</code> to 7 days</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-and-parameter-recommendations-spark-ddm-to-aave-lido-market/25175\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-and-parameter-recommendations-spark-ddm-to-aave-lido-market/25175","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 10:06:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25175"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-and-parameter-recommendations-spark-ddm-to-aave-lido-market/25175.rss","#text":"Risk Assessment and Parameter Recommendations: Spark DDM to Aave Lido Market"}},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - DigiFT (on behalf of a Tier-1 Asset Manager)","dc:creator":"AmosSong55","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<p><strong>MakerDAO - SparkDAO Grand Prix Application</strong></p>\n<p>DigiFT, an on-chain RWA exchange regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”), is proud to partner a Tier-1 Asset Manager (soon to be announced) to submit a proposal for the Spark Tokenization Grand Prix.</p>\n<p><strong>Product Highlights</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Simple straightforward structure</strong></p>\n<p>The first U.S. treasury fund token that is structured, managed and minted for the public blockchain by a global regulated financial institution, without any intermediaries.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong><br>\n<strong>1.\tDescribe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>The Asset Manager and DigiFT are strategic partners to bring RWA securities to Web3, making blockchain driven finance a reality, providing critical infrastructure for value exchange across new and mature investment ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>Asset Manager</strong><br>\nThe Fund Token smart contract was developed and deployed by Asset Manager’s in-house tokenization service. It was designed to bring various “real world assets\" on-chain and is a core part of Asset Manager’s global distributed ledger technology corporate strategy, focused on leveraging public and private blockchains networks for enhanced fund issuance and distribution</p>\n<p><strong>DigiFT</strong><br>\nDigiFT is the first and only RWA exchange on Ethereum public blockchain with a Capital Market Services (CMS) License and is approved as a Recognized Market (RMO) Operator by MAS. With these licenses, DigiFT is approved to offer:<br>\n•\tPrimary market issuance and broker-dealer services<br>\n•\tSecondary marketplace ‘wallet to wallet’ order-matching (via AMM, OTC or P2P), transfer agent and settlement services<br>\n•\tAccept fiat, stablecoins and cryptocurrencies for trading of RWA tokens</p>\n<p>DigiFT has been successfully granted authorisation to deploy a hybrid approach that combines DeFi technology and processes, offering decentralised ‘wallet to wallet’ RWA trading, while successfully configuring public chain permission standards (ERC-20) to meet the highest regulatory and compliance standards, acceptable to the Singapore MAS. This well vetted combined approach allows DigiFT to confidently provide the required “Trust Anchor” bridge when delivering sustainable yield and value transfer between both DeFi and TradFi industries.</p>\n<p>DigiFT has successfully listed over 12 tokens in the past 24 months, including a corporate debt note by Diners Club, single U.S. T-Bills, high-yield bank bonds and money market fund. As an on-chain exchange, DigiFT’s team also have experience working with DeFi protocols and decentralized organizations, such as payment channels, lending protocols and CeDeFi protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tBeyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Adding Stability and Credibility to the Stablecoin Reserve</strong><br>\nThe Fund lowers the counterparty risk for SparkDAO and/or Sky ecosystem. With an established presence across the world, the Asset Manager has been a dependable partner globally for over 100 years. The Asset Manager brings exacting standards, robust investment processes and a true focus on high-quality client service delivery, all underpinned by the safety and security of the broader group.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversification of Assets</strong><br>\nDigiFT is grateful for the opportunity to provide SparkDAO and/or Sky the opportunity to diversify its holdings across both asset class and managers. Digital assets have developed substantially over the last ~10 years and have further room to mature. Diversified allocation to lower volatility assets is critical to ensure long term success. Our long-term investment and risk management experience in developed investment markets (TradFi) guides this core principle. We believe the Fund offers an unique opportunity for SparkDAO and/or Sky to benefit from Asset Manager’s experience and institutional approach in money market investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Capital Efficiency and Best Execution</strong><br>\nAsset Manager operates a global research platform shared by all of the firm’s research analysts located in the main financial centres around the world. We employ a team of 30+ credit research analysts divided into industry and regional coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>Institutional Risk Management</strong><br>\nRisk control is an important aspect for the asset management business particularly to prevent liability and reputation damage. The highest standards of risk identification, risk management, and risk control are indispensable to the success, reputation, and continuing strength of the business group, and its management and staff is thus committed to developing and applying best market practice to all risk activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple liquidity solutions</strong><br>\nThe settlement period for redemption at the Fund level is T+0. In addition, SparkDAO and/or Sky will be able to experience instant liquidity solution as well as P2P and OTC facility on DigiFT’s platform, offering SparkDAO and/or Sky multiple access points to liquidity 24/7.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic Collaborations</strong><br>\nAs the distributor, DigiFT can offer other Asset Manager’s solutions across major traditional and alternative asset classes – from active to passive including a comprehensive sustainable investing offering to diversify SparkDAO and/or Sky collateral base, adding high quality reserve assets to the portfolio.</p>\n<p>Secondly, DigiFT, as a regulated channel for DeFi and TradFi, can connect DeFi protocols with mainstream finance. For example, we can structure sDAI or sDAI-backed products as a security to allow family office/fund access to sDAI in a regulatory compliant manner. DigiFT can also list DAI/USDS as a trading currency against capital market products on DigiFT Exchange, expanding the use case for Sky’s DAI/USDS.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tDoes the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>SparkDAO and/or Sky will be among the first few protocols that the Fund is made available to, with the aim to extend the use cases with other suitable protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tDo you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. We offer investment capabilities and styles across all major traditional and alternative asset classes – from active to passive including a comprehensive sustainable investing offering to institutions.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-digift-on-behalf-of-a-tier-1-asset-manager/25174\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-digift-on-behalf-of-a-tier-1-asset-manager/25174","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 09:22:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25174"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-digift-on-behalf-of-a-tier-1-asset-manager/25174.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - DigiFT (on behalf of a Tier-1 Asset Manager)"}},{"title":"Postmortem: Incorrect Total Supply Metric on Info SKY dashboard","dc:creator":"commanderkeen","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Date: 2024-09-20</p>\n<p><strong>Incident Summary:</strong><br>\nWe discovered that the total supply metric displayed on our dashboard <a href=\"https://info.sky.money/\">info.sky.money</a> was inaccurate due to an incorrect calculation.

To keep the momentum going, I am preparing an Atlas edit proposal that will pave the way for a rapid short term expansion and deep integration of Sky on Solana by bridging SKY, USDS, and sUSDS via Wormhole, and implementing a short term liquidity incentive program that provides SKY tokens for DeFi integrators of USDS and SKY on Solana, to pave the way and build early network effects for the full Solana SkyLink deployment.</p>\n<p>Solana is the second major DeFi ecosystem after Ethereum and its L2s, and while still not nearly as big as Ethereum it has the potential to soon catalyze larger scale growth as many of the key primitives already exist and have significant lindy effects on Solana. What is currently missing, however, is exactly what USDS and Sky offers: A decentralized stablecoin that can access a native savings rate and token rewards, and eventually deploy large scale capital into high value opportunities in trusted Solana DeFi protocols.</p>\n<p>There is a huge opportunity for synergy and integration from deploying Solana SkyLink, but it is also more advanced due to the differences between EVM and SVM.

Product Information</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe the product</strong><br>\nWe introduce IVVIA, a novel approach to real estate acquisition through tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). The term “to ivviate” has been coined to describe the process of gradually buying out a tokenized property. The ivviator can progressively acquire tokens, eventually becoming the sole owner—similar to a mortgage but without the burdens. Meanwhile, ivviatees (investors) profit by selling their tokens at market value and collecting rental income.<br>\nThis process begins with creating a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), raising funds to purchase the property, and tokenizing it via the IVVIA smart contract.</p>\n<p>Based on historical data (see Example calculations), IVVIA offers several advantages over traditional mortgages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Faster:</strong> Full ownership can be achieved in 15.5 years, compared to 20 years with the same monthly payments.</li>\n<li><strong>Cheaper:</strong> The ivviator can save $166K in total expenses versus a comparable mortgage.</li>\n<li><strong>More lucrative:</strong> Investors could see $1.2M in gains compared to $533K in a traditional mortgage scenario.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IVVIA will attract people who want to buy a home or are currently paying off a mortgage and are looking for relief from it. It also appeals to individual real estate investors who would usually have to borrow the remaining amount from a bank to buy property.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=14NtP7Ue5JhJgZO7-Vf1chzMjP8OFobTZ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">White Paper</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1znlc43AdaqG-WpylMEOS04aSCy78_HlY-IYLFltkG7g/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Example calculations</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe the underlying asset</strong><br>\n<strong>Real Estate.</strong> The underlying asset in IVVIA is real estate, typically residential, though commercial properties can also be tokenized. In the basic IVVIA model, investors pool their funds to form a trust, which then purchases the property and issues tokens representing trust units. These ivvia tokens reflect ownership units in the trust. Alternatively, parties may choose different legal entities for their DAO, such as corporations (e.g., RealT in the U.S.) or DAO LLCs (e.g., in Wyoming), to structure their DAO vehicles and manage the property.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong><br>\n<strong>Property Value Appreciation:</strong> Ivviatees (investor token holders) earn yield through the monthly buyout process, where the ivviator (the beneficiary) purchases their tokens. Ivviatees can set their own selling price, and their profit comes from the margin between the original investment price and the sale price of their token share. If the ivviator does not purchase the tokens, they are auctioned publicly, allowing ivviatees to exit and new investors to enter.<br>\n<strong>Rent Distribution:</strong> The property is leased, and rental profits are distributed regularly to token holders. This distribution can occur monthly, weekly, or fortnightly, as specified in the smart contract.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong><br>\nAt this stage, it’s important to distinguish between <strong>IVVIA as an asset class</strong> (a type of DAO) and <strong>IVVIA Partnership</strong> as a software development company, which does not intend to operate as an asset provider.<br>\n<strong>IVVIA Partnership</strong> is a <strong>protocol-level project</strong> offering B2B services to facilitators and operators of property tokenization (ivviation) using the IVVIA protocol. We provide the technology to service providers, who then offer it to consumers in various jurisdictions.<br>\nIn this structure, the <strong>issuer</strong> is the entity responsible for tokenizing (ivviating) a particular property. It is generally expected that the issuer operates in the same jurisdiction as the property or, at minimum, holds the necessary legal authorization (such as a financial license) required in that jurisdiction.<br>\nWe plan to launch <strong>demo cases</strong> in <strong>Australia</strong> and the <strong>UK</strong>, with future expansions into the <strong>US</strong>, <strong>EU</strong>, and other regions. These plans are tentative, and entering the US market may be prioritized.<br>\nThis version keeps the focus clear while improving flow and readability. Let me know if you’d like any further adjustments!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong><br>\nThe property (a land title or an apartment unit) must be marketable, meaning it must be registered in a land registry (in the UK, Australia, or the EU) or have an unbroken chain of title (for the U.S.). The property may have an existing mortgage; however, as a result of ivviation (tokenization), it must be free from any encumbrances or third-party interests. The title should then be transferred to a trust controlled by the interested parties: the ivviator (the property beneficiary) and the ivviatees (investors). If this condition is not met, the property cannot be ivviated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong><br>\nNo. At least in the first version of the ivvia smart contract.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc). Provide flow-charts or diagrams for all related entities and counterparties, if available.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>IVVIA Partnership (Tech Provider)</strong>: (it’s us) Provides the IVVIA application and smart contracts to facilitate property tokenization.

start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the AUM of the product? Provide a breakdown by blockchain</strong><br>\nIrrelevant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What are the standard fees (i.e., subscription, redemption, management, etc.)?</strong><br>\nIvvia Manager to IVVIA Partnership - subscription fee. For self-managed DAO - one free IVVIA subscription per one non-professional manager.<br>\nIvvia members to Ivvia manager - smart contract level fee per transaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</strong><br>\nStandard expenses for setting up Ivvia SPV (trust, corporation or any chosen legal form), and purchasing property.<br>\nPayments to the lease real estate agent (property manager).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong><br>\nIVVIA tokens are a regulated asset class. The DAO requires a hosting legal entity and an administrator with privileged rights to issue and reissue tokens, allocate tokens based on court or arbitration rulings, and replace parties in cases such as inheritance. This ensures compliance with legal and regulatory standards while maintaining the integrity of the tokenized property system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong><br>\nIrrelevant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Maximum/Expected Term:</strong><br>\nIVVIA is designed to function as a mortgage replacement, with an expected term similar to traditional mortgages, typically around 20 years or more, providing long-term stability. Our projection however shows that acquiring the property under the similar conditions will take 15.5 years.<br>\n<strong>Minimum Possible Term:</strong><br>\nUnlike traditional mortgages, IVVIA offers flexibility with its entry and exit points. The minimum possible term is as short as one day from the token’s issuance, allowing for rapid liquidity if needed. Additionally, IVVIA guarantees an exit time of up to two months at any point, ensuring users can always exit within a reasonable period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DAO’s Phases:</strong><br>\n<strong>Initial Phase:</strong> This phase involves investment subscriptions (contributions) from members to fund the property purchase. If the target is met, the property is bought. If not, all contributions are fully redeemed and returned to investors.<br>\n<strong>Operational Phase:</strong> In this phase, the DAO beneficiary (ivviator) buys tokens from other investors (ivviatees) and pays rent for the property. If the ivviator does not purchase the tokens, they are sold in a public auction.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Subscriptions and Redemptions:</strong><br>\n<strong>Ivviator’s Down Payment:</strong> The ivviator, who intends to acquire the property, initiates the DAO with their down payment and becomes the first subscriber. In addition to receiving tokens proportional to their investment, the ivviator gets two tokens representing Rights of First Refusal (ROFR):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BUYOUT NFT:</strong> This grants the ivviator the priority right to buy out ivviatees’ tokens through periodic installments.</li>\n<li><strong>LEASE NFT:</strong> This grants the ivviator the right to lease the property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ivviatees’ Contributions:</strong> Ivviatees invest to reach the target property price. Their contributions are locked during the fundraising period (set between 1 to 12 months), and refunded in full if the target is not raised. After reaching the target, funds are converted to fiat by the Ivvia Manager, who facilitates the property purchase and title conveyance.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational BUYOUT Subscriptions and Redemptions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Regular Monthly Buyouts:</strong> The Ivviator have the right to purchase ivviatees’ tokens at a price determined by the ivviatees each month. Ivviators usually follow a long-term plan (similar to a mortgage, around 20 years) to buy out all the tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Outstanding Buyouts:</strong> Ivviatees can offer to sell any number of tokens to the ivviator, who has a month to respond. If the ivviator does not purchase, the tokens are auctioned.</p>\n<p><strong>Ivvia Auction:</strong> Auctions occur when the ivviator does not buy tokens during the outstanding offer or the regular monthly cycle. An English-style auction is held, where bids increment until the highest bidder wins. Ivviators can use a reserve price, effectively bidding to prevent underpriced sales.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational LEASE Subscriptions and Redemptions:</strong><br>\nThe ivviator pays rent based on the established price, which is locked for each 12 months. Two months before the lease ends, members can propose a new rent price, voted on proportionally by token holdings. A 75% majority is required to pass a new rent. If no proposal succeeds, the rent remains the same. The person who puts forward the proposal is not allowed to vote, ensuring that someone holding 75% of the shares cannot both offer the price and vote for it to manipulate the decision. This prevents the ivviator from depriving the ivviatees of rent revenue once her share reaches 75%, or an ivviatee to jack up the price.</p>\n<p><strong>Price Feeds by Oracles:</strong><br>\nOracles provide property and rent price data, which helps guide buyout pricing. It is optional, parties may always pursue their own economic strategy that aligns with the concept of decentralized finance and free market.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong><br>\nIVVIA has established a liquidity mechanism through the IVVIA auction, designed to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency by letting members sell shares publicly if private sales are not agreed upon. This ensures liquidity and fair pricing through open market participation.<br>\nThe auction works by setting a price for the shares, and if not accepted, the tokens are sold at auction with bids incrementing until a final buyer is determined. This process ensures efficient and transparent transactions.<br>\nFor details, see IVVIA White Paper, section 'Ivvia auction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong><br>\nThe smart contract will feature its own legal tender (or multiple tenders), which all parties agree to accept unconditionally, providing a stable and reliable medium for transactions. This legal tender will likely be a stablecoin to ensure consistency in value.<br>\nIn addition to the legal tender, the contract will allow for optional assets that members can agree upon on a case-by-case basis for specific exchanges. This flexibility enables parties to use various assets when mutually agreed upon, while ensuring stability through the base legal tender.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What are your future development plans for the product?</strong><br>\nWe plan to develop the full IVVIA technology stack, which includes smart contracts and a user-facing application, and commercialize it as a SaaS platform.<br>\nTo demonstrate its business viability, we will launch demo cases in selected jurisdictions. Local operating companies are intended for sale (once they accomplish their mission on introduction of ivvia on the local market), as IVVIA Partnership adheres to a no-competition policy, ensuring fair market competition among independent IVVIA operators.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-99082-iv-legal-structure-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99082-iv-legal-structure-5\"></a>IV.

Product Information</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p>USDM is a regulated and permissionless yield-bearing USD stablecoin. Technically, USDM is an ERC-20 token, with a rebasing mechanism that provides increased balances of USDM on a daily basis, based on the USDM reward rate, currently at a 4.75% APY.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>The following short-term maturity assets are the only accepted assets that can comprise the USDM Reserves, as the underlying assets for USDM:</p>\n<p>(i) US Short Term bonds (Treasury Bills);</p>\n<p>(ii) Near maturity longer-term bonds;</p>\n<p>(iii) FDIC-insured bank deposits;</p>\n<p>(iv) Repurchase agreements; and/or</p>\n<p>(v) Money Market Funds or other Funds that invest in short term US federal bonds.</p>\n<p>(vi) Assets in transit: Fiat and supported stablecoins (e.g. USDC) can comprise a nominal portion of reserves until they are invested.</p>\n<p>Full investment mandate (link: <a href=\"https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/reference/usdm-reserves-investment-mandate\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USDM Reserves - Investment mandate | Mountain Protocol</a>) and attestations (link: <a href=\"https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/reference/usdm-reserves-attestations\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USDM Reserves - Attestations | Mountain Protocol</a>) can be found in our documentation (link: <a href=\"https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>Rebasing, daily. System matches the stETH / wstETH model which is a simple and battle-tested model.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Mountain Protocol Limited holds a “Class F” license, which represents the highest level of authorization attainable for digital asset businesses in Bermuda. It was issued after the company had proven the maturity of its operation under ~9 months on a Class M license.<br>\nThis is the same licensing level held by companies like Coinbase, Kraken and Circle.</p>\n<p>License can be found in the BMA’s website: <a href=\"https://www.bma.bm/regulated-entities\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Search the regulated entities - BMA</a></p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>All assets issued in Bermuda are required to be Bankruptcy remote in order for a license to be issued, under DABA. DABA’s regulation recognizes customer assets as separate from the issuers and mandates that the company makes arrangements to ensure the return of client assets in the event the DAB is placed into liquidation (Source: <a href=\"https://www.bma.bm/viewPDF/documents/2018-12-29-05-19-21-Digital-Asset-Custody-Code-of-Practice.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.bma.bm/viewPDF/documents/2018-12-29-05-19-21-Digital-Asset-Custody-Code-of-Practice.pdf</a>).</p>\n<p>This means that Maker’s USDM holdings would be bankruptcy remote, along with all other USDM holders’ claims.</p>\n<p>All custody of securities is done under a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), fully owned by a regulated trust company in Bermuda: Carey Olsen Fiduciaries Bermuda Limited, owner of USDM Reserves Limited. This company structure isolates the USDM Reserves in case of insolvency of Mountain Protocol Limited, loss of license or other unforeseen factors.</p>\n<p>In the case that such a scenario materialized, the BMA would designate a Joint Provisional Liquidator (JPL), as per Bermuda law, who will begin processing redemptions for USDM holders, without going through a bankruptcy proceeding.<br>\nNote that USDM Reserves Limited is over-capitalized to cover liquidation costs (JPL, accounting, operations).</p>\n<p>All financial institutions that Mountain Protocol works with require a risk assessment and subsequent no-objection by the regulator, to ensure safe handling of assets. Bankruptcy of brokers/custodians fall under the standard re-allocation process and do not fall under the bankruptcy estate of the broker/custodian as assets are customer assets held off their balance sheets.</p>\n<p>USDM Reserves Limited holds nominal (as minimum as operationally possible) bank deposits, stablecoins, and off-ramper claims. The rationale is these have proven to be the weakest assets on a stablecoin’s balance sheet and the root cause for most recent depeg scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>The Company will ensure US$ 1 or an equivalent amount of USD-denominated assets will be held in the name of the Company with regulated financial institutions in bankruptcy-remote accounts, segregated from the operating accounts of the Company, held on behalf of, and for the benefit of, Users that request a redemption of USDM (“Redeeming Users”).</p>\n<p>Every USDM minted and sold by the Company and remaining in circulation, either US$1 or an equivalent amount of USD-denominated assets in such segregated accounts, will be held in the name of the Company in such segregated accounts on behalf of and for the benefit of, Redeeming Users.</p>\n<p>The Company commits to redeem 1 USDM for US$1 from a Redeeming User, subject to compliance with the Company’s policies and procedures and the “Terms of Service” accepted by Users.</p>\n<p>SOURCE: <a href=\"https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/reference/product-structuring#rights-conferred-by-the-usdm-token\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Product Structuring | Mountain Protocol</a></p>\n<p><strong>6.

Product Information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tDescribe the product</strong></p>\n<p>The WisdomTree Government Money Market Digital Fund (“WTGXX” or the “Fund”) seeks to provide investors with a high level of current income consistent with preservation of capital and liquidity and the maintenance of a stable $1.00 net asset value (“NAV”) per share. The Fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by government securities or cash.</p>\n<p>WTGXX is made available to institutions via our institutional platform, WisdomTree Connect™. WisdomTree Connect is a comprehensive solution for both business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-business-to-consumer (“B2B2C”) interactions.  WisdomTree Connect enables clients to interact with WisdomTree-issued tokens, in any eligible self-hosted wallet or third-party custodial wallet service, across supported blockchains via a web portal and API. The WTGXX token available via WisdomTree Connect is an ERC-20 compatible token on Ethereum. WisdomTree facilitates orders and dividend payments in WisdomTree Connect via fiat (USD) and USDC (via the Stablecoin Conversion Service*). For the purposes of this proposal, we assume Spark elects to use USDC and the Stablecoin Conversion Service and all references to process and flows reflect this election.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree is also in the process of establishing an offshore private fund, with a similar mandate of U.S. Treasury and government securities, available to non-U.S. qualified investors that is anticipated to be made available via WisdomTree Connect.</p>\n<p><small>* <em>Please note investors cannot directly purchase shares of the Fund via USDC but are processed via the Stablecoin Conversion Service that is an operational process facilitated by WisdomTree. All future references to the Stablecoin Conversion Service and operations are describing the client’s experience.</em></small></p>\n<p><strong>2.\tDescribe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX invests in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury and government securities. Such securities may include: U.S. Treasury Notes (both fixed and floating rate), U.S. T-Bills, U.S. Government Agency Notes, including Discount Notes, that are either fixed or floating rate and issued by government agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Bank System, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the Federal Farm Credit Bank. The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements collateralized fully by U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government Agency securities or cash. The Fund may also invest in other investment companies that are government money market funds to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).</p>\n<p>The Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in government securities and repurchase agreements that are collateralized by government securities.</p>\n<p>The securities purchased by the Fund are subject to the quality, diversification, and other requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the1940 Act, and other rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).</p>\n<p>Please see the Prospectus and SAI for additional information, including additional strategy information and risk factors.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s weighted average life is 48 days and weighted average maturity is 29 days with a 7-Day yield of 5.03% as of 9/18/24. Please see definitions and disclosures below the link to holdings details*.</p>\n<p>Holdings details can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/digital-funds/money-market/wtgxx#money_market_holdings\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/digital-funds/money-market/wtgxx#money_market_holdings</a></p>\n<p><small>*<em>Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. The Fund’s yield may be affected by changes in interest rates and changes in credit ratings. Income and/or dividends are not guaranteed. Performance data for the most recent month-end is available at <a href=\"http://wisdomtree.com/investments\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">wisdomtree.com/investments</a>.</em></small></p><small>\n<p>7-Day Yield – The current yield reflects the current earnings of the Fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year. It is the Fund’s total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement. Absent such waivers or reimbursements, the returns would have been lower.</p>\n<p>Weighted Average Life (WAL) – For money market funds, this is the weighted average of the life of the securities held in a fund or portfolio and can be used as a measure of sensitivity to changes in liquidity and/or credit risk. Generally, the higher the value, the greater the sensitivity. WAL is based on the dollar-weighted average length of time until principal payments must be paid, taking into account any call options exercised by the issuer and any permissible maturity shortening features other than interest rate resets. For money market funds, the difference between WAM and WAL is that WAM takes into account interest rate resets and WAL does not.</p>\n<p>Weighted average maturity (WAM) – The weighted average maturity of the portfolio represents the market-weighted average of the maturities of the portfolio’s individual holdings. A money market fund in the United States must maintain a weighted average maturity of 60 days or fewer.</p>\n</small><p><small>Visit <a href=\"http://sec.gov\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sec.gov</a> to obtain the most recent 12 months of publicly available information filed by the Fund with the SEC on Form N-MFP.</small></p>\n<p><strong>3.\tHow is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX declares dividends of net investment income every U.S. trading day (each day the NYSE is open for trading) as of 4:00 pm ET and distributions are made monthly (first business day of the following month). WisdomTree facilitates orders and dividend payments in WisdomTree Connect via fiat (USD) and USDC, via the Stablecoin Conversion Service. For the purposes of this proposal, we assume   Spark elects to use USDC and the Stablecoin Conversion Service and all references to process reflects this flow. Accordingly, the value of the dividends is paid to   Spark’s wallet via USDC.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tWhat is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WTGXX and Its Service Providers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trust (issuer of WTGXX):</strong> WisdomTree Digital Trust - United States (Delaware)</li>\n<li><strong>Investment Adviser:</strong> WisdomTree Digital Management, Inc. - United States</li>\n<li><strong>Sub-Adviser:</strong> Voya Investment Management Co.

The Fund maintains a policy pursuant to Rule 2a-7 to which the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser must follow. Rule 2a-7 is the principal rule governing money market funds in the U.S. This rule covers a range of topics that seek to ensure the ability of WTGXX to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and meet redemption orders in a timely manner. These topics include maturity of investments, type and quality of investments, issuer diversification, disclosure of portfolio holdings, fund liquidity, determination of amortized cost-based and market-based NAVs, and stress testing. Stress testing includes periodically testing and reporting to the WisdomTree Digital Trust Board of Trustees, which oversees the Fund (“Fund Board”), the test results, assumptions, and related assessments of the Fund’s ability to withstand stressful economic and financial market conditions. Further, with respect to portfolio liquidity, WTGXX must hold securities that are sufficiently liquid to meet reasonably foreseeable shareholder redemptions in light of the Fund’s obligations under section 22(e) of the 1940 Act to timely process shareholder redemptions. Specifically, this means WTGXX must maintain 25% of total assets in Daily Liquid Assets, 50% of the total assets in Weekly Liquid Assets, and a 5% maximum limit for investment in “illiquid” securities at the time of acquisition (defined as any security that cannot be sold or disposed of within seven days at approximately the market value ascribed to it).</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tAre any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No, this is not permitted in the Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>7.\tProvide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc).

Once the investor completes the onboarding process, an onchain attestation, represented by a non-transferable soulbound NFT, is issued to the investor’s wallet and only those registered wallets can participate in transactions. WisdomTree issued soulbound NFTs cannot be transferred and can be revoked by WisdomTree in the event that client status or conditions change.  Shareholders can also peer-to-peer transfer WTGXX tokens to other onboarded shareholders with registered wallets as described above with the Transfer Agent maintaining the official record of share ownership. In this manner, WisdomTree prevents transactions between unknown persons or unknown blockchain wallets.</p>\n<p>Separately, the WisdomTree Connect Portal for Fund subscriptions and redemptions is permissioned via IP whitelisting, a process completed during onboarding. Each entity and authorized person must validate, among other qualifications, that it is an institutional investor as defined by U.S. law.</p>\n<p><strong>12.\tWhat is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see below for monthly transaction volume for WTGXX since inception.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/1/91f3833dcf927a77d12a80cb1b1ebd2c7c9a19a4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kP8XjvjRNsHtRJajdKU5Ex2pCm0.png?dl=1\" title=\"WisdomTree Monthly Flows\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/1/91f3833dcf927a77d12a80cb1b1ebd2c7c9a19a4_2_345x345.png\" alt=\"WisdomTree Monthly Flows\" data-base62-sha1=\"kP8XjvjRNsHtRJajdKU5Ex2pCm0\" width=\"345\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/1/91f3833dcf927a77d12a80cb1b1ebd2c7c9a19a4_2_345x345.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/1/91f3833dcf927a77d12a80cb1b1ebd2c7c9a19a4_2_517x517.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/1/91f3833dcf927a77d12a80cb1b1ebd2c7c9a19a4_2_690x690.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"272F2F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Please note, the monthly transaction volume of the Fund does not generally affect its ability, under normal market conditions, to facilitate subscriptions or redemptions on trading days, which may generally be accommodated in all sizes.

If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, investors purchase and redeem shares of WTGXX via a primary market subscription or redemption by interacting directly with the WisdomTree Connect platform. API connectivity is also available via WisdomTree Connect for investors to access WTGXX.</p>\n<p>We are working on multiple solutions to further enhance the experience of clients entering and exiting positions of WTGXX. In the near term, we are developing one-way pricing for instant sales of WTGXX (with a daily capacity cap via WisdomTree) for USDC via the Stablecoin Conversion Service.</p>\n<p>We are exploring functionality to provide two-way pricing for instant liquidity on both purchases and sales. This functionality would allow investors to purchase and sell WTGXX instantly via USDC using the Stablecoin Conversion Service, without a daily capacity cap. We believe this functionality would provide investors with a strong user experience, and, while there are no guarantees of its timing or ultimate availability due to a need for existing regulations and/or required licenses to evolve, we will continue to work towards this functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>16.\tWith what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made?

We are working on primary market developments specifically related to WTGXX. Our development plans include dividend reinvestment optionality and expanding existing funding and conversion mechanisms. We are also developing functionality whereby share purchases and redemptions can be facilitated via a service that includes additional currencies, crypto native assets, and stablecoins. We are also working to increase operational efficiency by extending order cutoff times. In the future, we also plan to leverage an onchain conversion mechanism to seamlessly process transactions from USDS to USDC via the Stablecoin Conversion Service to facilitate fund subscriptions or redemptions. Finally, we are exploring other novel methods of interaction via decentralized application (“dApp”) to allow primary market order placement for purchases and sales via smart contracts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the instant liquidity developments for purchases and sales detailed above in question 15, we are focused on the development of secondary market functionality for our offerings with the goal of utilizing the full potential of blockchain technology. Research &amp; development efforts currently underway include integration of atomic swaps, contingent transactions, oracles, time locks, account abstraction, third party attestations for KYC / AML verification, and zero knowledge proofs. We are also leveraging our position and connectivity to the wider financial markets to deliver on our vision to bring more traditional financial services onchain, including market making, pricing, credit facilitation and advanced risk management.</p>\n<p>We are continuously evaluating and evolving our practices to further our mission to provide regulated financial products to the onchain community. We have been a pioneer in this space since launching our Digital Assets division in 2020, which today includes: (1) launched 13 digital funds that are all tokenized 1940 Act funds with strategies across fixed income, equities, and asset allocation models, (2) launched real world asset tokens including a gold token (serving as certificate of title to physical gold) and a stablecoin, and (3) built a proprietary tokenization platform and tech stack that integrates blockchain technology with traditional finance infrastructure. We are committed to this space as an organization and believe onchain finance is the next evolution of financial services.</p>\n<p><em>The features detailed above would also be subject to then-existing regulations, regulatory interpretations and/or regulatory license requirements with no guarantees of timing or ultimately availability.</em><br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>IV.

Shares of the Fund have a pro rata interest in its assets. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and distributions declared by the Fund Board with respect to the Fund, and in the net distributable assets of the Fund on liquidation.</p>\n<p>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which a shareholder vote is required consistent with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. These shareholder voting rights generally include election of, or changes in, the Fund Board under applicable circumstances and approval of advisory agreements, including increases in management fees, each as further described in and subject to the Fund’s governing documents, Prospectus or otherwise as prescribed in the 1940 Act, as applicable.</p>\n<p>The Ethereum token is a record of the investor’s Fund ownership. Under WisdomTree’s integrated recordkeeping system, the onchain record is aligned with book-entry records maintained by WisdomTree Transfers. WisdomTree Transfers maintains a master shareholder file for all primary market purchases, primary market sales, and peer-to-peer transfers of the token between eligible tokenholders.</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tAre there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against WisdomTree Digital Management, WisdomTree Digital Trust, WisdomTree Securities, or WisdomTree Transfers.

The principal responsibilities of the Audit Committee are the appointment, compensation and oversight of the Trust’s independent registered public accounting firm, including the resolution of disagreements regarding financial reporting between Trust management and such independent registered public accounting firm, among other responsibilities. Annually, the independent registered public accounting firm reviews with the Audit Committee its audit of the Fund’s financial statements.</p>\n<p>A smart contract audit has been conducted by Oxorio. Audit reports for the smart contract are available at <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/TOKEN-STANDARDS-FRAMEWORK/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standards</a> and <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/ERC20-REVOCABLE-COMPLIANCE-STANDARD-SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standard Annex</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tDescribe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p>WisdomTree’s tokenization platform is designed to facilitate onchain ownership and transferability while seamlessly integrating with established traditional frameworks in the asset management industry. This convergence encompasses asset custody, risk management, portfolio management, and regulatory compliance.</p>\n<p>The onchain component utilizes common token standards, modified to meet the specific requirements of this use case. Specifically, the Fund tokens are ERC-20 compatible with additional functionalities to enhance ownership control. These functionalities include the ability to pause the token, freeze individual addresses, claw back tokens, and implement transferability checks.</p>\n<p>The token represents ownership of the Fund shares; however, regulatory requirements necessitate maintaining offchain records. To ensure compliance without limiting token functionality, we have implemented a bespoke integrated record-keeping system that continuously monitors onchain ownership changes and maintains alignment with the offchain ledger.</p>\n<p>A novel feature of our platform is the transferability checks, ensuring that only eligible wallets can hold the tokens. Onchain identity attestation is achieved by implementing a soulbound NFT (ERC-721) linked to the known wallet. Whenever a transfer method is called, a compliance oracle performs a check to ensure the receiving address also holds this soulbound NFT. We believe that using this soulbound NFT enables us to develop more decentralized identity management solutions compared to traditional allow lists or whitelists.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree has developed our own code base based on opensource standards that utilizes a beacon proxy pattern for upgradability. This enables us to have the maximum flexibility to respond to both client needs and regulations. This is a deliberate decision to build and manage this ourselves in order to leverage the power and innovation of the DeFi ecosystem and apply those learnings to our products and solutions.</p>\n<p>The code base we have deployed is aimed to serve as a foundation for future enhancements, particularly as we seek increased integration into DeFi enabled workflows and we continue on our goal to migrate more operations onchain over time.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>We have had two rounds of audit on the existing code base as of August 31, 2024. Any future adjustments or changes to the code base will be audited prior to deployment. A smart contract audit has been conducted by Oxorio. Audit reports for the smart contract are available at <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/TOKEN-STANDARDS-FRAMEWORK/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standards</a> and <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/ERC20-REVOCABLE-COMPLIANCE-STANDARD-SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standard Annex</a>.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tDescribe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs.</strong></p>\n<p>We have actively engaged with Sky, affiliated stakeholders, and other DAOs in efforts to fully understand the unique needs and objectives of the onchain community. To meet the ecosystem’s unique needs, we have built solutions that (1) unlock access to tokenized real-world-assets, (2) have the ability to facilitate stablecoin conversion (e.g., to USD) to serve as a form of payment, (3) facilitate non-custodial wallet transactions and (4) implement onchain identity attestation via soulbound NFTs.</p>\n<p>Leveraging our traditional finance and blockchain expertise, we have developed products and platforms that seek to seamlessly integrate between the TradFi and DeFi worlds while implementing WisdomTree’s robust and rigorous compliance framework. We are committed to delivering best-in-class service for our clients, including adapting, building, and evolving our products, solutions, platforms, and integration points. As the industry evolves, WisdomTree will continue to develop bespoke solutions to provide regulated financial products, which could potentially include solutions built to the specific needs of Sky and its affiliates.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tBeyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to WTGXX, we have developed a full suite of 13 tokenized funds covering equity, fixed income, and asset allocation models, in addition to tokenized gold and a stablecoin. By onboarding to our platform and subject to applicable onboarding requirements, Spark can potentially access current and future products as they become available and as we continue to innovate, which we believe will be the types of products and services of benefit to Spark. Our products provide increased optionality to Spark’s treasury management through enhanced diversification as well as additional yield opportunities. Together, these funds ensure investors have access and selection to the asset class, structure, and accessibility required by their own unique situation while being assured of a regulated, established asset manager issuing and managing the Funds. Our full suite of digital funds may be found here: <a href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/digital-funds\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/digital-funds</a>.</p>\n<p>We are also in the process of establishing an offshore private fund, with a similar mandate of U.S. Treasury and government securities, available to non-U.S. qualified investors, as stated earlier in our responses.</p>\n<p>We believe that by providing access to real world assets across multiple asset classes, focusing on increasing liquidity and efficiency in primary and secondary markets, and issuing products via a robust legal framework, we are building an onchain experience for more users to interact with the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tDoes the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX is currently able to be minted on Ethereum and Stellar. We will be deploying on select other EVM compatible chains over time. We consistently monitor the ecosystem evolving and continue to develop new, innovative ways to provide access to our solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tDo you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the solutions and products detailed above, WisdomTree, through applicable global subsidiaries, has the ability to deliver customized asset allocation guidance and direct access to our research and expertise to meet Spark’s specific investment objectives. Our Global Research Team and Chief Investment Office focus on four areas: product development, investment research, model portfolio management across various asset classes (equities, fixed income, alternatives, crypto), and strategic asset allocation. We can design and actively manage investment strategies that align with Spark’s specific needs.</p>\n<p>Spark would gain access to WisdomTree’s senior advisors for insights and education. Our research is readily available through multiple platforms, allowing the Spark community to stay updated with expert-driven content on current market trends and strategies. A copy of our Model Portfolio Investment Committee Q3 2024 Quarterly Strategic Outlook was emailed to GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial.</p>\n<p>We can also offer a comprehensive review of Spark’s existing investments through personalized portfolio consultations, delivering forward-looking insights tailored to your objectives. Our team can analyze Spark’s portfolio to potentially uncover hidden risks and provide actionable considerations to potentially enhance long-term performance.</p>\n<p>Finally, we can provide Custom Model Portfolios, which are designed and managed specifically to meet Spark’s objectives with a tailored approach to portfolio management, ensuring it is optimized for Spark. Our extensive research, including white papers, market insights, and long-term strategies, will keep the community informed and empowered to make confident financial decisions.</p>\n<br>\n<p><small><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong><br>\n<strong>Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing.

Yields from investments are accrued daily, including non-business days, ensuring continuous returns for investors. These daily yields are represented by transferable, permissioned ERC-3643 tokens, referred to as ‘Daily Distribution Tokens’. This tokenization of yield allows for greater flexibility and transparency in yield management.</p>\n<p>A key feature of these Daily Distribution Tokens is their conversion schedule. All Daily Distribution Tokens issued within a given month become convertible to fiat cash on the first business day of the following month. This means that regardless of when the yield was accrued during the month, all tokens for that period share the same maturity date. This standardisation simplifies accounting and provides a clear timeline for investors expecting cash conversions. Another innovative aspect of these Daily Distribution Tokens is their tradeability. Unlike traditional yield distributions that may be locked until a specific date, these tokens can be traded 24/7. This feature provides investors with enhanced liquidity and the ability to manage their yield positions more dynamically, potentially opening up new strategies for cash management and short-term investing.</p>\n<p>Please see our daily attestation and reporting on token distributions at:</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://frictionless.markets/transparency\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://frictionless.markets/hubfs/frictionless-icon-black-2.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://frictionless.markets/transparency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">frictionless.markets</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    \n\n<h3><a href=\"https://frictionless.markets/transparency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Transparency, Stability, and Trust</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Always secure, always transparently &amp; independently attested</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the underlying asset will be the same and the skyUST will have its own independent daily reports of the same calibre as fsISTUSTD.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-4-what-is-the-jurisdiction-of-the-issuer-and-key-entities-32\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-4-what-is-the-jurisdiction-of-the-issuer-and-key-entities-32\"></a>4.

Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</h3>\n<p>The fsISTUSDT Fund (‘the Fund’) does permit the use of hedging and derivatives in its underlying portfolio, but this is managed within a strict risk management framework. The Portfolio Manager employs a comprehensive risk management process to monitor and measure the risk associated with all open derivative positions and their impact on the overall risk profile of the Fund’s portfolio.</p>\n<p>This process is designed to be continuous, allowing for real-time monitoring of the Fund’s exposure. The Portfolio Manager specifically uses a methodology known as the Commitment Approach to measure and manage the global exposure from Financial Derivative Instruments (FDIs). This approach aggregates the underlying market or notional values of FDIs to determine the degree of global exposure of the Fund to these instruments. Importantly, there are regulatory limits in place to control the use of these instruments. In accordance with the requirements of the Central Bank of Ireland, even if a Fund uses leverage through FDIs, the global exposure for such a Fund must not exceed 100% of that Fund’s Net Asset Value. This ensures that the use of derivatives and hedging strategies does not lead to excessive risk-taking. The Portfolio Manager maintains the flexibility to employ new techniques and instruments as they become available, subject to regulatory approval and proper risk management protocols. This approach allows the Fund to potentially benefit from financial innovations while maintaining a strong focus on risk control.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that while these tools are permitted, their use is closely monitored and controlled to ensure alignment with the Fund’s investment objectives and risk profile. The ultimate goal is to use these instruments, when appropriate, to enhance the Fund’s ability to meet its objectives while carefully managing associated risks.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the risk mitigation framework and Committed Approach, oversight and regulatory criteria will apply as it has done for the fsISTUSTD fund.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-7-provide-a-list-of-all-counterparties-and-service-providers-used-by-your-product-ie-custodians-trustees-reporting-agents-exchange-agents-banks-etc-provide-flow-charts-or-diagrams-for-all-related-entities-and-counterparties-if-available-37\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-7-provide-a-list-of-all-counterparties-and-service-providers-used-by-your-product-ie-custodians-trustees-reporting-agents-exchange-agents-banks-etc-provide-flow-charts-or-diagrams-for-all-related-entities-and-counterparties-if-available-37\"></a>7.

How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</h3>\n<p>The fsISTUSTD Fund (‘the Fund’) establishes bankruptcy remoteness for its assets through several mechanisms provided by the Luxembourg Securitisation Law. This legal framework effectively separates the securitised assets, including those in digital format, from any insolvency risks of the securitisation vehicle, the Issuer, service providers, and all other parties involved in the transaction.</p>\n<p>In the event of bankruptcy of the originator or the servicer responsible for collecting cash flows from the assets (including digital assets and digital securities), the Luxembourg Securitisation Law ensures that the securitisation vehicle can claim ownership transfer of the securitised assets and any cash collected on its behalf before liquidation proceedings begin. This provision safeguards the Fund’s assets from being included in the bankruptcy estate of these entities.</p>\n<p>The Securitisation Law further strengthens the Fund’s bankruptcy remoteness through three key provisions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Subordination Provision: This allows investors and creditors to subordinate their payment rights to other creditors or investors, which is crucial for structuring the securitisation transaction.</li>\n<li>Non-recourse Provision: Investors and creditors may waive their rights to request enforcement. For instance, if an interest payment defaults, investors can agree to defer payment without initiating legal action, accommodating known or temporary situations.</li>\n<li>Non-petition Provision: This allows investors and creditors to waive their rights to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against the securitisation vehicle, protecting it from individual investors who might have an interest in such proceedings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Regarding multiple products, the issuer, FRICTIONLESS MARKETS SECURITIES Securitisation Fund, utilises a compartment structure. The fsISTUSTD Fund operates within its own bankruptcy-remote and orphan-entity-protected compartment. This structure allows the issuer to have multiple products, each in its own compartment, without risking cross-contamination of assets or liabilities between different products.<br>\nDetailed legal opinions and supplementary documents regarding the structure of the Fund, are provided in the supplement. These documents offer a comprehensive legal analysis of the Fund’s structure and its compliance with the relevant provisions of the Luxembourg Securitisation Law, Financial Collateral Act and MiCA.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the same regulatory posture will exist.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-5-what-rights-do-token-holders-have-64\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-5-what-rights-do-token-holders-have-64\"></a>5. What rights do token holders have?</h3>\n<p>Tokenholders of the Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds enjoy a comprehensive set of rights and protections, underpinned by robust Luxembourg and European Union legislation. These rights are designed to ensure that tokenholders have equivalent protections to traditional securities holders, while also benefiting from the advantages of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>The rights of token holders are protected under several key pieces of Luxembourg legislation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Luxembourg Securitization Law of 2004 (as amended)</li>\n<li>The Financial Collateral Act 2005 (as amended)</li>\n<li>The Blockchain Acts I, II, and III (as amended)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These laws collectively ensure that tokenholders have the same legal and economic rights as traditional investors in orphan entities, and bankruptcy-remote securitization compartments. This means that token holders can expect:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clear ownership rights of their tokens, legally recognized and protected.</li>\n<li>The right to receive any distributions or interest payments associated with their tokens.</li>\n<li>The ability to transfer their tokens, with such transfers recognized as valid and binding.</li>\n<li>Protection of their assets from potential bankruptcy of the fund issuer or service providers.</li>\n<li>Equal treatment among all token holders of the same class.</li>\n<li>The right to access relevant information about their investment.</li>\n<li>Legal recourse through the Luxembourg legal system if their rights are violated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s important to note that the Luxembourg Securitisation Law of 2004 was recently amended, with changes coming into force in March 2022. These amendments were specifically designed to provide enhanced investor protection, further strengthening the rights of tokenholders.</p>\n<p>By leveraging Luxembourg’s position as the world’s dominant securitization location, tokenholders benefit from the legal protections of both Luxembourg and the broader European Union. This dual layer of protection provides a robust framework for safeguarding investor interests in the evolving landscape of blockchain-based financial instruments.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the same protections are provided.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-6-are-there-any-pending-or-threatened-legal-proceedings-or-investigations-against-the-company-or-any-of-its-officers-65\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-6-are-there-any-pending-or-threatened-legal-proceedings-or-investigations-against-the-company-or-any-of-its-officers-65\"></a>6.

In general, there are several advantages to utilising this structure considering the scale of investment the Spark DAO community can leverage in Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds.</em></p>\n<p>A Luxembourg SOPARFI (Société de Participations Financières) is a holding and financing company that offers several key advantages, especially for investors looking to optimise tax efficiency, financial structuring, and operational flexibility, such as:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-tax-efficiency-68\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-tax-efficiency-68\"></a>Tax Efficiency</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Participation Exemption: SOPARFIs can benefit from the participation exemption regime, which allows for tax exemptions on dividends received and capital gains from qualifying holdings. This can significantly reduce or eliminate taxes on income generated from investments in subsidiaries.</li>\n<li>Interest Deduction: Interest payments made by a SOPARFI can generally be deducted from its taxable income, lowering its effective tax rate.</li>\n<li>No Withholding Tax on Liquidation Proceeds: Distributions made during the liquidation of a SOPARFI are generally free from withholding tax, making it an attractive structure for exit planning.</li>\n<li>Favourable Double Tax Treaties: Luxembourg has an extensive network of double tax treaties that can reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and royalties paid to or by a SOPARFI in cross-border transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-flexible-corporate-structure-69\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-flexible-corporate-structure-69\"></a>Flexible Corporate Structure</h4>\n<p>Although primarily used as a holding company, a SOPARFI can engage in various financial activities, including holding shares, granting loans, financing activities, managing intellectual property rights, and even real estate investments.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-no-specific-regulatory-supervision-70\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-no-specific-regulatory-supervision-70\"></a>No Specific Regulatory Supervision</h4>\n<p>A SOPARFI is not considered a regulated entity like an investment fund or financial institution, meaning it is not subject to the direct supervision of Luxembourg’s financial regulator, the CSSF (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier). This makes the setup and ongoing operation simpler and less costly in terms of regulatory compliance.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-efficient-holding-structure-71\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-efficient-holding-structure-71\"></a>Efficient Holding Structure</h4>\n<p>SOPARFIs are ideal for international holding structures, enabling investors to manage and consolidate their global investments under one umbrella. They can hold interests in both EU and non-EU companies, providing flexibility for cross-border operations.</p>\n<p>Luxembourg’s stable and business-friendly environment ensures legal certainty and an attractive framework for managing complex financial structures.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-attractive-capital-gains-treatment-72\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-attractive-capital-gains-treatment-72\"></a>Attractive Capital Gains Treatment</h4>\n<p>In addition to the participation exemption on capital gains, Luxembourg also offers favourable conditions for individuals holding shares in a SOPARFI, with low capital gains tax rates for residents under certain conditions.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-vat-exemptions-73\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-vat-exemptions-73\"></a>VAT Exemptions</h4>\n<p>A SOPARFI can benefit from VAT exemptions on financial services it provides, such as granting loans or managing subsidiaries, which further enhances its cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-confidentiality-and-investor-protection-74\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-confidentiality-and-investor-protection-74\"></a>Confidentiality and Investor Protection</h4>\n<p>Luxembourg provides strong investor protection laws and respects confidentiality regarding financial matters, ensuring that investors’ privacy is maintained while enjoying the benefits of this corporate structure.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-attractive-exit-opportunities-75\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-attractive-exit-opportunities-75\"></a>Attractive Exit Opportunities</h4>\n<p>Given the participation exemption and the favourable tax treatment of liquidation proceeds, SOPARFIs offer attractive conditions for investors looking to exit their holdings through liquidation, M&amp;A transactions, or divestitures.</p>\n<p>In summary, by utilising a Luxembourg SOPARFI, Spark DAO can benefit from a combination of tax efficiency, flexibility, and international legal frameworks, for holding and financing activities into any tokenized asset class or fund issued by Frictionless Markets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99065-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-76\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-76\"></a>V.

Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</h3>\n<p>A key benefit of the Luxembourg issuance of our Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds is the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Act 2005. All financial instruments issued by Frictionless Markets enjoy the classification of legal financial collateral under the Luxembourg and E.U laws and are globally recognized. This enables the tokens to be used legally in leverage positions as derivatives and by prime desks as collateral. Furthermore, this is extended to the deposit tokens in any currency denomination, therefore the Spark community can exercise global protection of their assets under these collateralization laws.</p>\n<p>As our Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds are exclusively invested in the BlackRock Institutional Cash Series there is no cash drag in the funds, once the order is fulfilled and accepted by the transfer agent on business days, the cash is put to work instantly, returning the daily distributions on the following business day. This maximises the capital efficiency of the Spark DAO and Sky community.</p>\n<p>As the issuer of multiple public constant NAV funds with multiple currencies at both spot and fwd FX, our solution can ensure that the Spark DAO community can react quickly to changing interest rate environments on the horizon, by deploying Dollar/USDC/USDS into potentially higher returning funds such as the Sterling Gov Liquidity fund.</p>\n<p>Finally, our globally recognised structure and issuance ensure that the Spark DAO community and Sky Money can attract investors without worrying about opaque tax structures, FATCA, CRS, and other key international agreements and regulations.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-93\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-93\"></a>3.

Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tExplain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></p>\n<p>MUSF is a private fund in the Cayman Islands. The Fund is available to Qualified Purchasers in the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, as well as jurisdictions in EMEA that permit reverse inquiry by qualifying investors.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tWhat regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Regulated by the Cayman Island Monetary Authority (CIMA).</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tWhat licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Matterhorn is a Swiss GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung). It is a wholly owned subsidiary of OPI and was incorporated under the laws of Switzerland on 26 April 2023 by way of a notarial deed.</p>\n<p>According to the articles of association of Matterhorn, its established purpose is to acquire, hold, and administer majority and minority participation in companies in the DeFi industry and tokens. In addition, Matterhorn may:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>advise domestic and foreign clients and/or companies in the areas of distributed ledger technology, tokens and liquidity;</li>\n<li>stablish branches and subsidiaries in Switzerland and abroad;</li>\n<li>participate in or hold other enterprises of identical or similar nature in Switzerland and abroad, or establish, merge, acquire, or finance such enterprises; and</li>\n<li>acquire, hold and sell real estate in Switzerland and abroad.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A subsidiary of OPI, Oasis Pro Markets LLC (“OPM”), can access regulated financial markets in the United States by virtue of its regulatory authorization. OPI is also in the process of incorporating entities in the UK and India.</p>\n<p>Regulatory Compliance: Engaging in both the traditional and DeFi financial spaces requires navigating a complex web of regulations. OPM, acting as broker-dealer and ATS, for instance, holds the required regulatory permissions to undertake such activities, ensuring that activities are compliant with US securities laws.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tHow is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>MUSF is bankruptcy-remote from Oasis Pro Inc as it is a separate entity set up in the Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Tokenholders are granted shareholder rights. Shareholders have rights to the fund’s assets under Cayman Islands bankruptcy law.</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tAre there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>7.\tDescribe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>There are no conflicts of interests the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>8.\tExplain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>Navigating the complex web of regulations is paramount to the success of integrating RWAs into a decentralized ecosystem. OPI’s legal and compliance team, which has extensive experience in dealing with both traditional and crypto-assets, will be an invaluable resource. Matterhorn will work closely with the legal team to ensure that the tokenization of RWAs complies with regulatory standards. They will also structure the tokens in a way that adheres to the legal frameworks of various jurisdictions, thereby safeguarding both Matterhorn and the MakerDAO community from potential legal pitfalls.</p>\n<p>Any gain realized between the redemption proceeds and the original purchase amount is subject to taxation at the investor’s applicable tax rate.</p>\n<p>MUSF does not distribute dividends or make other distributions, so the primary tax consequence arises from the gain or loss realized on redemption. No taxes are withheld on any transactions within the Fund.</p>\n<p>The Fund Admin will prepare a Schedule K-1 annually for each investor, detailing their share of the Fund’s gains or losses for the year. Foreign investors will also receive a Form 1042-S reflecting that none of the Fund’s income is considered ECI.</p>\n<p><strong>V.

The tokenization platform is built on modular architecture and supports all tokenization features through UI and APIs.  The platform will mint Digital Asset Securities based on real-time valuation using ERC-3643 and ERC-1404 security token standards. We have created our own standard regulatory and compliant ERC token.</p>\n<p>Our platform supports the minting of tokens on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Base, Solana, Provenance, and Aptos blockchains along with private blockchains like R3 Corda, and Canton. All blockchains are built on the same standard. Offers the ability to easily add support for more tokenization standards and blockchains.</p>\n<p>The tokens are designed with the following advanced features: on-chain compliance, upgradeability, a factory pattern for efficient deployment, multi-signature (multisig) support, and account abstraction. They also incorporate custom asset control contracts, capital call and distribution functionalities, and waterfall mechanisms. Additionally, the tokens have the capability to mint, burn, freeze, and forcibly transfer assets.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our smart contracts integrate with a custom oracle to retrieve real-time pricing data, enabling on-chain calculations and decision-making. The contracts also support commitment mechanisms and Delivery vs. Payment (DvP) features for secure and efficient transactions.</p>\n<p>Regarding tokenization, we are a founding member of the ERC-3643 foundation, and we have submitted our own ERC token standard for securities to the Ethereum Foundation for review.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.erc3643.org/news/industry-leaders-form-erc3643-association-to-propel-standardization-of-tokenization\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/0/20b97ff9bad2bc72b1b825a05cee7799dba5bd87.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"C3DCF8\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.erc3643.org/news/industry-leaders-form-erc3643-association-to-propel-standardization-of-tokenization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">erc3643.org</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/361;\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/2/520decef9fadb171765948661f0875c3dac6cbfa_2_690x361.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"D9EAF6\" width=\"690\" height=\"361\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.erc3643.org/news/industry-leaders-form-erc3643-association-to-propel-standardization-of-tokenization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Industry Leaders Form ERC3643 Association to Propel Standardization of...</a></h3>\n\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>For more information about the ERC-3643 token standard, please see official website: <a href=\"https://www.erc3643.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.erc3643.org/</a></p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>We have partnered with many 3rd party providers, such as Certik, who will review the source code of the smart contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>VI.

Product Summary</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Project name:</strong><br>\nRealize</p>\n<p><strong>2. Product name:</strong><br>\nRealize T-BILLS Fund (the “Fund”)</p>\n<p><strong>3. Product type / underlying asset:</strong><br>\nThe Fund is the first Abu Dhabi Global Market (“ADGM”) tokenized open-ended investment fund based out of Abu Dhabi, UAE. The principal purpose and investment objective is to invest into and tokenize Exchange-Traded Funds that hold short-term U.S treasury bills and short-term U.S. treasury bills directly. The tokenized asset, $RBILL, will be available to investors on Ethereum and other major Blockchains.</p>\n<p>The Fund is the first tokenized fund to be authorized by the regulator in ADGM, a historical achievement made possible through the close alignment and collaboration between Realize, its partners and the regulator. Based on English common law, ADGM is one of the most exciting jurisdictions for traditional finance and especially for the digital assets space, as ADGM has created the necessary legal and regulatory framework for asset issuers, investment managers and investors to operate with clarity, safety and certainty.</p>\n<p>The Fund is also one of the first directly tokenized funds globally, where the actual units in the fund are tokenized. This gives investors into the $RBILL fund direct ownership rights, legal and regulatory protection, and better oversight of fund operations. This is in contrast to many competing structures which have opaque, expensive, complex and convoluted structures using third-party custodians, pledging agreements and SPVs. In many cases, the structures are unregulated and therefore their products carry potential risk of closure in the future as regulations tighten. Competitor products use a Custodian as the participating shareholder which means the structure falls outside of the parameters of securities and fund rules in the relevant domicile of the fund. This means there is no oversight by the relevant regulator, and provides little to no protection to investors into those products.</p>\n<p>The $RBILL token represents a direct, tokenized ownership right in the ADGM-authorized Realize T-BILLS Fund. This positions $RBILL as one of the safest and cheapest ways to hold tokenized treasury bills on-chain.</p>\n<p>Realize is not just a tokenization platform to tokenize regulated funds and bring yield-bearing assets on-chain, but is positioning itself to become an RWA ecosystem. The main focus of Realize is the utility and collateralization of tokenized assets. Our ecosystem team is already forming strategic partnerships with major DeFi dApps to open up entire new possibilities of tokenized assets within Web3.</p>\n<p>Key highlights of the Fund and the underlying asset:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. Treasury Bills with short-term maturities of 3 months or less</li>\n<li>The Fund partakes in direct tokenization, reducing the need for complicated engagements and opaque ownership structures</li>\n<li>The Fund is significantly more economical viable for investors:\n<ul>\n<li>0% management fee</li>\n<li>0% performance fee</li>\n<li>0% tokenization fee, with an option to charge 10 bps post $100 million AUM</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Instant 24/7 liquidity for USDC and other cryptocurrencies through liquidity partnerships, T+1 for wire transfers</li>\n<li>Subscriptions and redemptions in all major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins (including $USDS and $SKY)</li>\n<li>The Fund is operated by seasoned fund administrators and investment managers</li>\n<li>The team behind Realize is crypto native with extensive experience in building and deploying DeFi protocols and building Web3 ecosystems</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4.

Company Details</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Company description:</strong></p>\n<p>Realize is a tokenization platform that focuses on unlocking the full potential of real-world assets in Web3. Based in Abu Dhabi, Realize leverages strategic regional connections, clear regulatory framework and institutional partnerships to provide a seamless solution for tokenizing assets. Together with our partners, Realize is merging the worlds of traditional finance and decentralized finance out of one of the most exciting, safe and crypto-friendly jurisdictions. We are bringing the future of tokenization from the UAE to the world.</p>\n<p>Realize is the fund sponsor of the Realize T-BILL Fund (OEIC), the first tokenized fund to be authorized by Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), one of the leading finance ecosystems in the world.</p>\n<p>Together with Neovision Wealth Management Limited (the “Fund Manager” or “Neovision”), Realize and Neovision have created a scalable and robust framework to tokenize regulated funds. We are currently working towards tokenizing several additional funds to be operational and accessible fully on-chain, including trade finance funds, UAE real estate, government-backed bonds and other ETFs. With this platform, Realize is positioned to bring safe, yield-bearing assets on-chain and offer new opportunities for crypto native treasury managers, DAOs and HNWIs to diversify and manage their portfolio entirely on-chain.</p>\n<p>Unlike many current tokenization efforts, Realize operates within a framework designed for broadening accessibility, liquidity and utility of tokenized assets. Most companies in the tokenization space focus on building closed ecosystems that they can control, charging high fees for limited services and restricting liquidity. These systems frequently stifle innovation, asset composability and limit the flexibility and opportunities that tokenization can offer.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Realize is committed to maximizing composability, liquidity, transparency, and security in the tokenization space. We are expanding the utility of tokenized assets across the Web3 ecosystem, providing deep integrations and partnerships with major L1 and L2 blockchains. The Realize platform empowers investors to tokenize their assets and access a wide array of applications, including asset collateralization, unlocking yield opportunities beyond the limits of traditional finance. By breaking down the barriers of closed ecosystems, Realize fosters an open, interconnected environment where investors can fully unlock the value of their tokenized assets, diversifying and managing their capital with new investment opportunities.</p>\n<p>Our mission is to democratize access to real-world assets by seamlessly integrating them within Web3. We strive to offer a secure, efficient, and transparent gateway for investors to gain exposure to a diverse range of assets, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and yield opportunities that are traditionally unavailable in conventional finance.</p>\n<p>Watch this short video to learn more about Realize:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eLatmPge88A?feature=shared\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/8/7801aa12908d077db9be4defc6ab8fd97fe397cd.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"h7CRsFOQFYTv6nPBIWyjpMOAMON\" width=\"690\" height=\"359\" role=\"presentation\"></a><br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2.

We are geographically dispersed, providing us with a global perspective.</p>\n<p>Importantly, we have no operational exposure to regulatory-sensitive countries, ensuring that our fund adheres to the highest standards of governance and compliance.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>4. Years in operation</strong></p>\n<p>Realize was founded in 2023, with the core team closely collaborating since 2019. In 2021, we formed Nakama Limited, a Web3 development studio from which Realize emerged. With extensive experience in fund operations, traditional finance, tokenization, and smart contract development, our team brings a proven track record and deep expertise, uniquely positioning us to deliver impactful results from day one.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>III. Product Information</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.1 Realize T-BILLS Fund (OEIC) Limited</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is the first tokenized fund to be authorised by the regulator in the UAE (ADGM) and is managed by Neovision (see section 4 for more information pertaining to key counterparties).</p>\n<p>The Fund is an open-ended investment fund allowing investors to gain access to U.S. government bonds as digital tokens on the blockchain. Each RBILL token represents a claim on underlying T-Bills, with rights and obligations managed by smart contracts. These tokenized T-Bills, with one-year maturity or less, are backed by shares in underlying U.S. Treasuries ETFs. Available initially on both Ethereum, IOTA and other major L1 / L2 Blockchains, RBILL tokens can be exchanged for stablecoin or FIAT currency, with a minimum investment of $50,000.</p>\n<p>This approach eliminates the traditional barriers faced by non-U.S. investors, offering a seamless and global investment opportunity. The combination of low-risk T-Bills and the transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology makes $RBILL a compelling option for diverse investor profiles. $RBILL provides real-time accountability and 24/7 subscriptions and redemptions, ensuring flexibility and convenience for investors.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>1.2. Key innovations of the Fund</strong></p>\n<p>Authorized structure in major crypto-friendly jurisdiction:</p>\n<p>Abu Dhabi is widely recognized as the top FinTech hub in the MENA region, with ADGM playing a pivotal role in championing the development of a sustainable and vibrant FinTech ecosystem. ADGM has set numerous “firsts” in the region, including the first FinTech regulatory regime and the first FinTech RegLab, which is now the second most active FinTech sandbox globally, after London.</p>\n<p>ADGM’s commitment to technological innovation within financial services aligns with its mission to support growth in FinTech while promoting systemic safety and consumer protection. Positioned strategically between European and Asian markets, Abu Dhabi serves as a global crossroads, where ADGM’s partnerships with regulators and private sector entities foster a thriving FinTech ecosystem.</p>\n<p>By being domiciled in ADGM, the Fund is being supervised by one of the most progressive, advanced and protective legal jurisdictions. ADGM is based on UK common law, making it a perfect domicile for the Fund:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clear and transparent regulation</li>\n<li>Best-in-class investor protection</li>\n<li>Strict supervision and compliance of the fund operations</li>\n<li>Thriving ecosystem with many of the largest financial institutions having set up their operations to ADGM in recent years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Direct tokenization of fund shares:</p>\n<p>Direct tokenisation is where the securities of the fund are directly tokenized, ie, instead of an issuance of participating shares in a fund, the fund issues security tokens which would then be traded on a platform. The Fund is managed by the Fund Manager in the same manner a traditional fund would.</p>\n<p>Some of the key benefits of this structure are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduction of complexity</li>\n<li>Less operational risks</li>\n<li>Increased investor protection</li>\n<li>Faster and easier issuance and redemption</li>\n<li>Real-time settlement on blockchain</li>\n<li>Counterparty risk reduced against a regulated investment fund</li>\n<li>Direct claim on assets in the fund, rather than in synthetic indirect tokenization structures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike competing solutions, the Realize T-BILLS Fund provides investors a directly tokenized fund structure, a rarity in the market. We believe this model represents a best-in-class approach for tokenizing funds, setting a new standard for fund tokenization within ADGM and globally.</p>\n<p>In stark contrast, indirect tokenization involves the fund operating as a more traditional vehicle, issuing participating shares as part of an investment round. These shares are typically subscribed to by a single entity (often offshore), referred to as the Custodian. The Custodian then issues tokens that provide contractual rights to the underlying assets it holds, with investors receiving tokens representing their interests in the ‘Fund.’ However, since the Custodian remains the participating shareholder, the tokenization may fall outside the scope of securities and fund regulations in the fund’s jurisdiction. This results in reduced oversight, higher operational costs, and the introduction of unknown risks for investors.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/i23tE3nkeJwDeLd0pzzUu0bHdwu.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_690x271.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"i23tE3nkeJwDeLd0pzzUu0bHdwu\" width=\"690\" height=\"271\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_690x271.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_1035x406.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_1380x542.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0E1DF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>0% Management fees and 0% Performance fees:</p>\n<p>Due to its pioneering direct tokenization model, the operational costs of the Fund are significantly lower compared to competing structures.

We address the following issues:<p></p>\n<p>Isolated assets: Many tokenized assets exist in isolation, lacking Web3 compatibility and preventing them from being effectively integrated into DeFi ecosystems. We bridge this gap, enabling true interoperability and usability of tokenized assets across various dApps.</p>\n<p>Misaligned audience: Realize is addressing the growing demand in the Middle East for innovative financial solutions by focusing on real-world asset tokenization. With our launch in this region, we are positioned to meet the needs of sophisticated investors seeking reliable, compliant opportunities that align with the Middle East’s forward-looking financial landscape.</p>\n<p>Opaque fund structures: Many tokenization platforms rely on unregulated offshore structures, creating opacity around the funds and raising compliance concerns. Realize operates within a regulated framework, including the first direct tokenized fund structure launched under ADGM, providing clarity and security to investors.</p>\n<p>Indirect funds: Ineffective tokenization processes result in indirect fund structures, limiting the benefits of blockchain technology. We offer a direct tokenization model, unlocking greater liquidity, transparency, and yield-generating opportunities for investors.</p>\n<p>Extra fees: Many tokenization platforms charge [high] fees for the process itself, reducing overall returns. Realize offers a more cost-effective, transparent solution, ensuring that investors can maximize the value of their tokenized assets without unnecessary overhead.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>1.4. Legal framework for the tokenization of the Fund</strong></p>\n<p>In order to tokenize the Fund, the Fund will conduct an “Initial Token Offering” (an “ITO”) and offer tokens (the “Tokens”). The ITO will be a direct tokenization of an ADGM fund: The regulation permits fund-raising using DLT with the tokens representing a “traditional” regulated issuance, such as Shares, Debentures or Units in a Collective Investment Fund. In these instances, a DLT platform may also comprise a share or bond register. The issuance of the Tokens is akin to the issuance of “Units” in the Fund and will constitute Digital Securities. Accordingly, each holder of a Token could be considered a “Unitholder”. There is no express legislation or rules in ADGM as to process or requirements for an ITO. In order to try and adopt best-in-class principles and ensure transparency and compliance with ADGM laws and rules, the ITO will be undertaken on the same basis as an offering of Units in the Fund, together with customary elements that would form part of a “White Paper” used in token offerings, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detailed information about the token: The economic and legal features and characteristics of the Token which make it an FSRA regulated ‘security’. This includes the nature of the securities and the rights and liabilities attaching to those securities.</li>\n<li>Information about the token sale: This includes the timeline of the ITO, the price of the Tokens, and the method of purchase.</li>\n<li>Information about the project team: This includes the backgrounds and qualifications of the team members.</li>\n<li>Legal and regulatory information: This includes any legal and regulatory considerations, such as how the token is classified under ADGM laws and rules.</li>\n<li>DLT: An explanation of the use of the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) behind the tokenization of the Tokens and the overall execution of the ITO on the DLT platform.</li>\n<li>A copy of the White Paper will be made available separately upon request.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund Manager is initially targeting the following ETFs which offer efficient and liquid subscriptions and redemptions:</p>\n<p>SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issuer: State Street</li>\n<li>Inception Date: 05/25/07</li>\n<li>Expense Ratio: 0.14%</li>\n<li>AUM: $34.79B</li>\n<li>Index Tracked Bloomberg US Treasury - Bills (1-3 M)</li>\n<li>Segment ICE BofA US Treasury (9-12 M)</li>\n<li>Structure Open-Ended Fund</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issuer: BlackRock, Inc.</li>\n<li>Inception Date: 05/26/20</li>\n<li>Expense Ratio: 0.09%</li>\n<li>AUM: $25.67B</li>\n<li>Index Tracked ICE 0-3 Month US Treasury Securities Index</li>\n<li>Segment ICE BofA US Treasury (9-12 M)</li>\n<li>Structure Open-Ended Fund<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3.

The Fund will also accept Sky and USDS.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>A. We are in discussions with our regulator to find ways to ensure RBILL can be more interoperable in DeFi and to allow for secondary transfers. We are looking to build and support an RWA ecosystem in which RWAs can be utilized within DeFi. This will include partnerships with, or launching of our own, DeFi RWA-focused applications; management of RWA tokens on behalf of investors; and creation of RWA DeFi strategies.</p>\n<p>B. Outside of RBILL, Realize is an RWA tokenization platform which is capable of supporting additional RWA tokens. Realize currently has plans to launch two additional tokenized funds, and is in talks with several key players (both local to UAE and abroad) to tokenize further assets.</p>\n<p>At Realize, we see the tokenization of RWAs as the first step towards building a truly global, immersive, free and fair economy. In order to realize this vision, tokenized RWAs must have additional utility along with the ability to be traded on secondary markets.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>IV. Legal Structure</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund has been created with the sole purpose to support the launch of the RBILL token in a regulated and transparent manner. The Fund will not issue any separate or additional products to its investors.</p>\n<p>The Fund is managed by NeoVision, a licensed investment manager headquartered in UAE. Ascent Fund Services Limited is the regulated Administrator who will calculate the daily NAV and perform daily subscriptions and redemptions.</p>\n<p>Following the RBILL minting process, investors’ tokens are provided directly to the investor and are not retained by Realize, the Fund or any of its affiliates, unless the investor chooses to use a full custody service provider (partnerships to be announced shortly).</p>\n<p>Shares in US Treasury ETFs are acquired and custodied through our broker, Interactive Brokers LLC. Additional regulated brokers and custodians of the ETFs will be added in the future. Realize does not hold or retain any rights to the Fund’s assets and the Fund’s assets are not recognised on Realize’s or the Fund Manager’s balance sheet. Furthermore, no operational capital of Realize or its affiliates are commingled with the Fund’s assets (digital or otherwise). Assets are also not leveraged or managed within an investment strategy which ensures the assets are not at risk.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, the Fund is subject to an annual external audit, provided by Grant Thornton. This ensures that the management and administration of the Fund is in line with its legal and regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p>We are working with Chainlink and the Fund Administrator to implement off-chain proof of reserves and are exploring implementing a transparency council which would include a number of trusted partners who would have view access of the asset accounts for the Fund. We would be happy to add members of SparkDAO / MakerDAO to this council.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>The rights of token holders are entrenched in the Articles of Association of the Fund, of which a contractual nexus exists between the Fund and the token holders. Any subsequent transferee of a token, or a fraction of a token, will sign customary documents adhering to the various Fund documents binding it to the obligations thereunder and affording it their rights therein. In summary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The tokens afford the token holder a proportionate share in the assets of the Fund (in the same manner as participating shares would afford the holder a right in the assets of the fund in a traditional structure).</li>\n<li>The tokens may be subscribed for (minted) and redeemed (burned) in accordance with the Fund documents.</li>\n<li>Subscribers sign a token purchase agreement that will reflect substantially the form of a fund subscription agreement as well as containing all other information necessary in connection with the issuing of the investor’s tokens.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>6.

Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product:</strong></p>\n<p>Neither Realize nor the Fund is qualified to provide tax advice. We kindly recommend that potential investors into the Fund seek qualified tax advice to understand any current or potential future tax implications before investing in $RBILL tokens.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is due to launch in October 2024 and as such we are unable to provide any historical performance records relative to benchmark.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports.</strong></p>\n<p>A daily NAV report will be issued by the Fund Administrator. We are also currently working towards Chainlink Proof of Reserves adoption together with a Transparency Committee which could include members of SparkDAO / MakerDAO. The Transparency Committee is planned to have view-access of both bank and custody accounts.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product:</strong></p>\n<p>Ascent has been appointed by the Fund as the fund administrator, pursuant to the terms of the administrative services agreement. The Administrator is responsible for providing services required in connection with the Fund’s operations, including (i) calculating the net asset value of the Fund; (ii) verifying the identity of investors for the purposes of anti-money laundering regulations; and (iii) preparing and submitting to the Fund and the Fund Manager all ancillary documentation that are used for the annual audit and the preparation of financial statements. The annual financial statements will be prepared in line with Ascent’s policies and procedures, and will be audited by <a href=\"https://www.grantthornton.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Grant Thornton</a>.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product:</strong></p>\n<p>Our product is built using Solidity for Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) but is designed with future scalability in mind, as we plan to extend support to non-EVM virtual machines. The core of the system operates through a series of smart contracts that manage tokenization, user interactions, price oracles, and whitelisting functions, all while ensuring high security and compliance standards.</p>\n<p>At the heart of our system is the TokenManager contract, which holds the core logic for both the current and future tokens issued on the platform. The TokenManager contract orchestrates essential functions like minting and burning tokens, managing pricing through oracles, and interacting with permissioned lists of users. The modular nature of TokenManager allows the system to be easily extendable, making it adaptable to new types of tokens or evolving business logic.</p>\n<p>Supporting the TokenManager are a series of contracts designed for specific purposes. Hub.sol handles user requests for minting and redeeming tokens, ensuring that collateral is deposited and tokens are issued appropriately. The Hub contract serves as the central point for token operations, coordinating between various contracts in the system, including pricing and whitelisting mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The ListAggregator.sol contract ensures that users meet all necessary criteria by checking multiple whitelists, providing an aggregated view of allowed or disallowed accounts. This is critical in ensuring compliance with various KYC and AML regulations, as different token providers may have specific rules for whitelisted addresses. Administrators can add or remove users from these lists using the ManagedList.sol contract, which allows flexibility in managing permissions.</p>\n<p>The TokenPrice.sol contract acts as a price oracle, allowing specific operators to adjust token prices within predefined limits. This is key for ensuring that the system remains adaptive to market conditions while maintaining strict control over price changes. The use of price oracles ensures that token minting and redemption operations always occur at a fair value, protecting both the platform and its users from price manipulation or errors.</p>\n<p>One of the standout features of our system is its ability to handle multiple tokens and operations simultaneously. The Proxy.sol contract provides upgradability, ensuring that the system can evolve without disrupting existing operations. This is particularly important for a platform dealing with real-world assets (RWAs), as regulations and business requirements may change over time.</p>\n<p>A crucial aspect of the Realize platform is its integration with Fireblocks, which plays a key role in securing all on-chain operations. Every critical operation, from minting and burning tokens to handling sensitive user-related functions, is tied to a Fireblocks MPC (Multi-Party Computation) Vault. This means that no single entity or person can execute an operation on their own; instead, it requires approval from multiple authorized parties, making the system more secure and reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.</p>\n<p>The Fireblocks Vault ensures that all actions require a series of cryptographic signatures from a committee before execution. This process not only protects the system from insider threats but also provides a transparent approval chain for every transaction. Every operation is logged and requires multiple approvals, ensuring that no unauthorized action can take place.</p>\n<p>We will further enhance security by incorporating Chainlink Proof of Reserve (PoR), which ensures that the collateral backing the tokens is fully transparent. By integrating PoR, users and regulators can verify in real-time that the system is appropriately collateralized, thus enhancing trust in the platform.</p>\n<p>From an operational perspective, Realize connects to Ascent Group’s systems, which handle the onboarding and KYC processes. Ascent’s technology, including its global ID coverage and automated transaction monitoring, ensures that users are onboarded quickly and securely. All user information remains confidential, and Realize does not store any sensitive personal data. Ascent’s systems, integrated with One Constellation, allow for real-time access to fund data, ensuring transparency for both fund managers and investors.</p>\n<p>By combining the security and transparency provided by Fireblocks, Chainlink PoR, and Ascent’s onboarding technology, Realize offers a secure, compliant, and scalable solution for managing tokenized real-world assets. The integration of both on-chain and off-chain security measures ensures that users can confidently participate in the platform, knowing that their assets and personal data are fully protected.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>5. What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>The smart contracts for our product underwent a comprehensive audit by Zokyo Security in July 2024. The audit yielded a high score of 98/100, with no critical or high-severity issues. All identified medium and low-severity issues were resolved, and the audit covered key areas, including test coverage (97.27%), security against reentrancy, and overall adherence to industry best practices. The audit report confirmed that our contracts are well-crafted, organized, and secure for handling token minting and redemption processes backed by real-world assets.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs:</strong></p>\n<p>The team behind Realize has been involved in DAOs since early 2020. The primary experience has been in establishing the legal framework in establishing a Marshall Island DAO and guiding the process of establishing and getting community-approval for establishing the DAO. In addition to that, the Realize ecosystem team is in close contact with several major DAOs to invest into and diversify their treasury into the Fund. We expect to go through several other DAO governance processes to allocate part of the treasury of those DAOs to the Fund in the coming weeks.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Realize is an RWA tokenization, building out a range of tokenized regulated fund products, bringing yield-bearing assets on-chain and making them fully compatible and usable within Web3. As part of this ecosystem, Realize will launch a utility token in Q4 of this year. Realize is entirely self-funded and has no external investors, making it a pure token distribution that will be maximally community-oriented and aligned.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/v4f5MqKB2D21YAYa484NaitTKeC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_624x339.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"v4f5MqKB2D21YAYa484NaitTKeC\" width=\"624\" height=\"339\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_624x339.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_936x508.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_1248x678.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEAF8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Unlike other RWA ecosystems, where the token is a limited governance token with no real rights or participation in the success of the ecosystem, the Realize token will be deeply embedded in the Realize platform to directly benefit token holders from the growth and success of the Realize RWA ecosystem. In addition to that, token holders can unlock various rewards, access premium features, fee rebates and actively participate in governance decisions. It serves as a key driver of engagement within the ecosystem, encouraging active involvement and long-term commitment from the community.</p>\n<p>We take great inspiration from the incredible success of $MKR (now $SKY) and the MakerDAO governance process and community and want to work together to build the future of finance on-chain. Realize proposes to offer MakerDAO / SparkDAO <em><strong>up to a 5% token allocation and airdrop to $SKY holders</strong></em>. Details of the token airdrop and distribution will be discussed by both communities.</p>\n<p>Apart from the token allocation, the Realize team is very happy to work closely with the MakerDAO / SparkDAO teams on future products and tokenized assets. In addition to that, we are happy to work closely on regulatory support in Abu Dhabi and the UAE, and helping the team with any matters related to becoming operational, domiciled or even regulated in the UAE. We are also happy to use our network of investors, policy makers and partners to support the SKY ecosystem.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>Realize serves as the gateway to an expansive DeFi ecosystem composed of a diverse range of dApps, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their investments in tokenized RWAs. Unlike competitors who restrict tokenization to isolated silos, Realize aims in the future to integrate these tokenized assets into a seamless and interconnected environment, allowing them to be used as collateral for additional yield-generating opportunities across multiple dApps within a regulatory compliant environment.</p>\n<p>The Realize ecosystem team is currently in close discussions with several major L1 Blockchains to offer the tokenized $RBILL on their network and to partner with major DeFi applications within the ecosystem to accept $RBILL as collateral for trading pairs, collateral-backed lending protocols and more. We will work towards $RBILL being accepted as a secure form of collateral across all major L1 Blockchains.</p>\n<p>Through Realize’s institutional-grade DeFi platforms, investors holding tokenized assets gain access to a wide range of opportunities to generate additional yield:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/0/706204e5d932038f7c80f17c50293dcaeb0df4a8.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/g2btRHA1iehlC7nd33emWLY0Wi4.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/0/706204e5d932038f7c80f17c50293dcaeb0df4a8_2_621x350.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"g2btRHA1iehlC7nd33emWLY0Wi4\" width=\"621\" height=\"350\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/0/706204e5d932038f7c80f17c50293dcaeb0df4a8_2_621x350.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/0/706204e5d932038f7c80f17c50293dcaeb0df4a8_2_931x525.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/0/706204e5d932038f7c80f17c50293dcaeb0df4a8_2_1242x700.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D2CAF1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realizeassets.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Realize</a>: Realize is a cutting-edge tokenization platform that serves as the gateway for RWAs into the broader DeFi ecosystem.

I hope you can provide clear answers and address any concerns that other potential users like myself might have. Here are my key questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How is the security of my DAI deposit ensured?</strong><br>\nWhat mechanisms are in place to prevent the theft or loss of funds while interacting with the <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> protocol? Are there any smart contract audits or insurance policies in place to mitigate potential risks?</li>\n<li><strong>What happens if the website or protocol goes down?</strong><br>\nIn the unlikely event that <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> becomes unavailable due to technical issues, cyber-attacks, or even a complete shutdown, what will happen to my deposited DAI? Will I still be able to access and withdraw my funds through alternate means (e.g., interacting directly with the smart contract)?</li>\n<li><strong>Are there KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements?</strong><br>\nDoes <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> have any policies requiring KYC verification for users? If so, at what stage is it mandatory? This is crucial to understand from both a compliance and privacy perspective.</li>\n<li><strong>Can my wallet be frozen or restricted?</strong><br>\nUnder what circumstances, if any, could <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> or any associated entity freeze, restrict, or block access to my wallet? For example, would compliance with regulatory requests or suspicious activity trigger such actions?</li>\n<li><strong>What are the risks associated with depositing into the <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> protocol?</strong><br>\nWhile I understand that all DeFi protocols carry inherent risks, could you outline the specific risks that are most relevant to <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a>? Are there any particular vulnerabilities users should be aware of?</li>\n<li><strong>How is governance handled?</strong><br>\nDoes <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> have a governance model where users can vote on decisions? How decentralized is the protocol’s decision-making process, and how can I stay informed of governance updates or participate in governance myself?</li>\n<li><strong>Is there a withdrawal limit or fee structure?</strong><br>\nWhat are the withdrawal policies in terms of limits, fees, or delays? Are there any situations where withdrawals might be temporarily paused?</li>\n<li><strong>How are interest rates or yields determined?</strong><br>\nCould you explain how yields are calculated on DAI deposits and what factors might affect the return on investment? Are these yields subject to significant fluctuation?</li>\n<li><strong>What recourse is available in case of loss?</strong><br>\nIn the unfortunate event of a hack, exploit, or catastrophic failure of the protocol, is there any recourse for recovering lost funds? Does <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> have any protection funds, insurance mechanisms, or partnerships that users should be aware of?</li>\n<li><strong>How can I monitor the health of the protocol?</strong><br>\nAre there any recommended tools or dashboards I should use to track the performance and security of the protocol? What should I watch for in terms of metrics to assess its ongoing reliability?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I believe these questions are critical for anyone considering a substantial DAI deposit into <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> or any DeFi protocol, and I hope to receive detailed responses to make an informed decision.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

The funds are segregated from Ledgity Company through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which assigns Delubac AM the mandate to manage the T-Bills portfolio. This SPV is created specifically and exclusively for this application.</p>\n<p><strong>Fund Mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>Investors can deposit USDC into the dedicated Ledgity Vault, structured as a loan to Ledgity’s SPV. In return, the Ledgity protocol issues LUSDC at a 1:1 ratio in the form of ERC-20 tokens, where each LUSDC represents one dollar in the SPV. Transferring the LUSDC token effectively transfers ownership of the underlying claim of USDC. While investors aren’t required to complete KYC, they are subject to on-chain AML monitoring and analysis to ensure compliance.</p>\n<p>LUSDC is a rebase token meaning that the investors see the number of LUSDC tokens growing overtime at the rate equal to the yield generated by the portfolio net of fees.</p>\n<p>Investors can withdraw up to 5% of the Assets Under Management (AUM) instantly. For withdrawals exceeding 5% within a 24-hour period, processing may take 2-3 business days.</p>\n<p><strong>Service Providers Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Delubac Asset Management has a mandate to manage the portfolio of T-Bills. U.S. Treasury Bills are held in custody in a segregated custodial account at Bank Delubac &amp; Cie. BPCE (Natixis Group) is the sub-custodian of this account.</p>\n<p>*In option, we can create a dedicated fund with an agreement of the AMF and a specific objective (US Money Market Fund). The custody is held by CACEIS, a daily NAV is published by CACEIS + AMF agreement, custody and valuation independent from the asset manager, CACEIS is rated A1/A+.</p>\n<p>Issuer Ledgity: Ledgity interface helps investors to track and manage their investments.

LEGAL STRUCTURE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></p>\n<p>Ledgity is the issuer of the LUSDC product. Delubac Asset Management is the asset management company in charge of the management of the assets. And bank Delubac &amp; Cie is the custodian.</p>\n<p>LUSDC represents a loan of USDC to Ledgity’ SPV. This loan is segregated in a SPV, bankruptcy remoteness structure. Therefore, Ledgity delegates a private mandate to Delubac Asset Management in order to manage the portfolio according to the mandate.</p>\n<p>Our setup allows seamless use of Ledgity protocol with no KYC, instant withdrawal and no minimum of investment. The funds are in custody in France at the bank Delubac &amp; Cie.</p>\n<p>Ledgity is regulated as Digital Asset Service Provider by the <a href=\"https://protectepargne.amf-france.org/acteurs-listes-blanches/psan/ledgity-sas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">French Financial Market Authority (AMF) under the number E2022-040</a>.</p>\n<p>Delubac Asset Management is a management company authorized and regulated in France by the Financial Markets Authority, under approval number GP 00009, dated March 31, 2000.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>The funds are held by a dedicated SPV, segregated from the balanced sheet of the issuer, Ledgity. This structure ensures that even in case of bankruptcy of Ledgity, the funds are safe and can be withdrawn by investors. The SPV will be created for Spark and Sky Ecosystem and a legal opinion will be shared in case of selection</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Investors in LUSDC are the only “creditor” of the SPV that holds the funds. They can ask at any time to withdraw their capital in USDC without penalties.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or Sky</strong></p>\n<p>We do not see any conflicts of interest between Ledgity, Delubac AM, their employees and Sky.</p>\n<p><strong>8.

Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p>Ledgity uses blockchains to deliver a secure and seamless investment experience. Our infrastructure ensures scalability, security, and compliance. Here’s a summary of the implementation:</p>\n<p>a) Onchain Overview:</p>\n<p>LUSDC Token Proxy - <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd54d564606611A3502FE8909bBD3075dbeb77813#internaltx\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xd54d564606611A3502FE8909bBD3075dbeb77813</a></p>\n<p>Global Owner: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xe4Af4573bFc5F04D8b84c61744de8A94059f2462\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xe4Af4573bFc5F04D8b84c61744de8A94059f2462</a></p>\n<p>Global Pause: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd4D4c68CE70fa88B9E527DD3A4a6d19c5cbdd4dB\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xd4D4c68CE70fa88B9E527DD3A4a6d19c5cbdd4dB</a></p>\n<p>Global Blacklist: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcA55A2394876e7Cf52e99Ab36Fc9151a7d9CF350\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xcA55A2394876e7Cf52e99Ab36Fc9151a7d9CF350</a></p>\n<p>Our smart contracts are designed to be flexible, allowing for upgrades as needed. Key functions, like managing the Global Blacklist, are securely controlled by the Ledgity Admin Address to ensure proper oversight and compliance.</p>\n<p>Our contracts are currently deployed on Arbitrum. They can be deployed in a day on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>b) LUSDC: A standard Upgradable OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation with several modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The LToken contract verifies that all holders are not on the global blacklist.</li>\n<li>Burn - Investors can initiate a withdrawal by requesting an “instantWithdrawal” or “requestWithdrawal”.</li>\n<li>Mint - New LUSDC tokens are created during deposits and as rewards for holders.</li>\n<li>Implements an auto-compounding reward system for token holders.</li>\n<li>The contract implements a fee system for withdrawals, with adjustable rates and tier-based exemptions. For Spark Tokenization Grand Prix withdrawal fees will be set at 0%</li>\n<li>A withdrawal queue system is implemented to manage liquidity and handle large withdrawals.</li>\n<li>The contract maintains a retention rate to limit asset exposure on-chain.</li>\n<li>Includes a “repatriate” function for fund management between the contract and a fund wallet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>c) Transfers:</p>\n<p>LUSDC tokens can be freely transferred between Arbitrum or Ethereum addresses using transfer or transferFrom functions. Each transaction is verified to ensure that neither the sender nor the receiver is on the global blacklist. The contract also implements a system of transfer listeners, allowing other contracts to be notified of LUSDC transfers.</p>\n<p>**d) Black list:</p>\n<p>For compliance and regulatory purposes, we apply AML enforcement through a global blacklist function to ensure that illicit transactions cannot impact the rest of the investors. Addresses on the blacklist cannot make deposits, withdrawals, or transfers of LUSDC tokens. Withdrawal requests from addresses that become blacklisted are frozen and can be managed separately.**</p>\n<p>e) Additional Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Global pause functionality for emergency situations.</li>\n<li>Detailed event logging for deposits, withdrawals, and other activities.</li>\n<li>Separate management of “big” withdrawal requests exceeding half of the retention rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>f) Security Measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use of OpenZeppelin’s safe transfer functions for ERC20 tokens.</li>\n<li>Implementation of reentrancy guards for critical functions.</li>\n<li>Upgradeable contract structure with proper initialization checks.</li>\n<li>Clearly defined access control for administrative functions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>g) Additional Services:</p>\n<p>Investor Portal: <a href=\"https://ledgity.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ledgity.finance</a> allows Investors to manage and track their portfolio with ease, offering real-time access to account information.</p>\n<p><strong>5.

Describe any previous relationship with Sky and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>This application is our first contribution to the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the Spark Star and Sky ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>LUSDC offers crypto native investors an easy access to TradFi institutional asset managers. Pierre-Yves Dittlot, the CEO and Founder of Ledgity, has 18 years of experience in the asset management and private banking industry, managing up to $800M. For several years, he worked with financial institutions to promote the innovation brought by blockchain technology. By onboarding LUSDC, the Sky ecosystem may easily access other products offered by Ledgity in the future and co-create tailor made products for the Sky ecosystem. Ledgity promises clear transparency. Accelerated by Chainlink, Ledgity will create a Proof of Reserve oracles on-chain.</p>\n<p>Ledgity aims to create a Council with external key leaders from the TradFi and DeFi industry. The Council will be in charge of making proposals for the creation of new products as well as contributing to the asset allocation of a future yield bearing stable asset backed by an onchain reserve of RWA, actively managed. The Sky ecosystem will be able to participate as a leader, helping us to shape the future of finance.</p>\n<p>Finally, Ledgity launched his governance and utility token, the LDY token. We are happy to dedicate 10% of LDY supply to the Sky ecosystem as additional incentives.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>Not yet. As soon as we reach the first $20M of AUM, we will work on integrations with key DeFi protocols such as Morpho, Euler, Uniswap, Curve and more.</p>\n<p>Our vision is to make our products widely accessible across different ecosystems and protocols to benefit onchain investors.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other Stars?</strong></p>\n<p>Ledgity is working to launch a permissionless yield bearing stable asset backed by an onchain RWA reserve, actively managed by Ledgity Council. As mentioned above, Ledgity Council will be composed of key leaders from the TradFi and the DeFi industry. The purpose of this product is to provide key benefits for crypto native investors: permissionless, high yield, low risk, instant liquidity, instant yield distribution, resilient, fully transparent with onchain reserve and Chainlink Proof of Reserve, backed by RWA, decentralized management by the Council.</p>\n<p>We will be happy to collaborate with the Sky ecosystem to understand what other strategies/exposures might be suitable and to launch new product on demand.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-delubac-asset-management-x-ledgity/25152\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-delubac-asset-management-x-ledgity/25152","pubDate":"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 18:56:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25152"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-delubac-asset-management-x-ledgity/25152.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Delubac Asset Management x Ledgity"}},{"title":"Questions about Negative MKR Balances and Their Impact on Governance Polls","dc:creator":"ohho","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>Dear MakerDAO community,</p>\n<p>While reviewing governance poll results, I’ve noticed some concerning patterns that I’d like to bring to the community’s attention and seek clarification on.</p>\n<p>I’ve observed multiple instances where wallets with “0 MKR” or “≈0 MKR” voting power have participated in governance polls.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/1/011b06ffd29047f720b885e32fbc561d08d38739.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9MnLkJijmVoloxQkqh9cHyzfEB.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/1/011b06ffd29047f720b885e32fbc561d08d38739_2_690x488.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"9MnLkJijmVoloxQkqh9cHyzfEB\" width=\"690\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/1/011b06ffd29047f720b885e32fbc561d08d38739_2_690x488.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/1/011b06ffd29047f720b885e32fbc561d08d38739_2_1035x732.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/1/011b06ffd29047f720b885e32fbc561d08d38739_2_1380x976.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F7F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Upon closer inspection, I’ve discovered something even more alarming - wallets with <strong>negative MKR balances</strong> appear to be voting and impacting poll results.</p>\n<p>Let me provide a specific example:</p>\n<p>In Poll 232 (<a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmR4A4dT\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Maker Governance - MIP9 Community Greenlight Poll - renBTC - July 20, 2020</a>), there were <strong>30 wallets</strong> that voted with a Total Voting Power of <strong>21,315.378 MKR</strong>.

What is the AUM of the product? Provide a breakdown by blockchain</strong></p>\n<p>Smart Cash has not yet been issued on any blockchain. This is a TradFi product that is very successful with money market investors, as an alternative to certificates of deposits.</p>\n<p>The current amount outstanding for non-tokenized Smart Cash Notes is in excess of $8bn.</p>\n<p><strong>9. What are the standard fees (i.e., subscription, redemption, management, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>The fees are embedded in the spread of the Notes. There are no subscription fees except in the case of subscription via stablecoins, no redemption fees, no management fees, no fees for custody and SG-Forge will make abstraction of the conversion fees between USDC and fiat USD. We estimate that SG Group fees (both for SGIS and SG-Forge) will be in the range of 10 basic points (bps) per annum.</p>\n<p>Subscription fees in case of subscription via USD Stablecoins will be up to 15 bps, corresponding to a cost pass-through that we intend to reduce as much as possible prior to execution.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable.</p>\n<p>There are no other expenses associated with the products. The only expenses are the fees already embedded in the spread, and the subscription fees (if applicable).</p>\n<p><strong>11. How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></p>\n<p>Our security token smart contract is based on 3 operators who have the permission to call smart contract methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registrar: Agent of the issuer and responsible of the register.</li>\n<li>Registrar Agent: Operates under Registrar delegation for certain use cases.</li>\n<li>Settlement Agent: In charge of the settlement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>12. What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>We register between $200m and $1bn of activities (buy and sale) every month on the SGIS secured notes program.</p>\n<p><strong>13. What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>Subscriptions and redemptions are open during European banking hours, as described in the attached termsheet.</p>\n<p>While using fiat currency to subscribe and redeem SGIS can meet settlement at T+1.</p>\n<p>Should subscription and redemptions be required to take place is stablecoin (USDC) SG-Forge and SGIS would be able to offer settlements at T+2.</p>\n<p><strong>14. Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>Subscription in USDC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spark / Maker to contact SG-Forge and SG in order to subscribe to the product, confirm terms and notional, sign termsheet and transfer USDC to SG-Forge Wallet at T=0, with cut-off time being 1:30pm CET.</li>\n<li>SG-Forge to convert the USDC into fiat USD using authorised market makers and transfer this fiat USD to SG.</li>\n<li>Note to be issued by SGIS and tokenised by SG-Forge at T+2. Tokens are then held in custody with SG-Forge and safekept for the benefit of Spark / Maker.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Redemption in USDC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spark / Maker to contact SG-Forge and SG for a buy back. Confirm number of Notes that will be sold back to SG at T=0, with cut-off time being 1:30pm CET.</li>\n<li>SG to buy back the agreed number of Notes and send corresponding amount of fiat USD to SG-Forge.</li>\n<li>SG-Forge to convert fiat USD into USDC using authorised market makers and transfer this USDC to Spark / Maker whitelisted wallet at T+2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please see Diagram provided in 7.</p>\n<p><strong>15. Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p>The EMTN includes a put option with a 5 business days’ notice period. This put option can be triggered on any day by the client with the issuer SGIS.</p>\n<p>In addition, Societe Generale will provide a secondary market on the EMTNs, and will commit to buy back the EMTN at their accrued value, with no fees or bid/ask spread, through a T+1 settlement period (in fiat) or T+2 settlement period in stablecoin (USDC or PYUSD or any other pre-agreed USD stablecoin). This commitment will be formalized by a liquidity letter between Societe Generale and the client.</p>\n<p><strong>16. With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, DAI, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p>Fiat USD</p>\n<p>Stablecoins: USDC, PYUSD, or any other pre-agreed USD stablecoin</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>The product is currently available on Ethereum. We are working on deploying the Security Token, to multiple chains soon.</p>\n<p>The TradFi product is highly successful and mature, and we do not expect further developments at this level.</p>\n<p>SG-Forge is working to improve the stablecoin settlement process of its security tokens, notably to significantly reduce settlement cycle (with objective T=0), allow a larger range of stablecoins and improve security of the operations in preparation for higher volumes.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

SG-Forge funded this loan in the crypto market by borrowing DAI stablecoins from MakerDAO. Same Security Tokens were pledged to the benefit of the MakerDAO protocol.</p>\n<p>SG-Forge has been able to enter into contractual agreements with the DAO using the voting process of the protocol. This financial, legal, and technological innovation implied different proposals and governance votes from the DAO community, notably:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A MakerDAO Initial Collateral Application made in September 20212</li>\n<li>A MakerDAO Governance Poll and Executive Vote to accept the proposed Security Tokens as collateral for the transaction and elect a Maker Representative for executing the legal documentation and administrative tasks on behalf of the DAO</li>\n<li>On August 2nd 2022 the MakerDAO community approved a DAI stablecoins credit line to SG-Forge.</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"10605\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/s/9de0a6/48.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/security-tokens-refinancing-mip6-application-for-ofh-tokens/10605\">[Security Tokens Refinancing] MIP6 Application for OFH Tokens</a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/c/legacy/co/17\"><span data-category-id=\"17\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #ED207B; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF; --parent-category-badge-color: #231F20;\" data-parent-category-id=\"74\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category --has-parent\" title=\"This subcategory is used for posting and discussion of MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Applications.\"><span class=\"badge-category__name\">Collateral Onboarding Applications</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    Dear MakerDAO Community, \nWe submit to you, on behalf of European investment firm Societe Generale-Forge, this MIP6 application for discussion and approval of Security Tokens refinancing.

Upon successful onboarding and clear understanding of the specific financial situation of the DAOs, SG structuring specialists would be able to suggest appropriate investment products. More information is available here: <a href=\"https://sg-structuredproducts.com/societe-generale-group\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SG Structured Products (sg-structuredproducts.com)</a>.</p>\n<p>Building a relationship with one of the very few systemic banks being involved in the permissionless blockchain ecosystem would also benefit the DAOs, improve its reputation and attract institutional investors in the respective ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>At this point in time the Smart Cash product doesn’t have integrations with other crypto / onchain platforms.</p>\n<p>Other SG-Forge products, notably its EURCV Stablecoin is listed on Bitstamp and supported by market makers such as Wintermute and Flowdesk at this point in time.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see response to 2.

US - either direct bond purchases, managed funds or ETFs</li>\n<li><strong>Short-Term Duration</strong>: Focus on short-term bonds to reduce risk exposure.</li>\n<li><strong>Good Yield</strong>: Outperform the S&amp;P U.S. Ultra Short Treasury Bill &amp; Bond Index.</li>\n<li><strong>Standardized and consistent investment process</strong>: We perform extensive due diligence on all assets to be included in the portfolio to ensure high-quality assets with proper durations. We integrate key fixed-income factors such as value, momentum, size, and liquidity into the asset allocation process. By actively managing exposure to these factors, the portfolio can achieve more stable and predictable returns.</li>\n<li><strong>Capital Preservation</strong>: The focus on high-quality, short-term bonds and active risk management aligns with the capital preservation goals of Sky. The portfolio offers a low-risk investment option, suitable for conservative investors seeking stable returns.</li>\n<li><strong>Income Generation</strong>: The portfolio’s emphasis on bonds with attractive yields offers a reliable source of income, appealing to income-focused investors.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong><br>\nAlignment of interest with Sky (MakerDAO), DigitalX Digital Asset Fund, also managed by DigitalX Asset Management, holds MakerDAO tokens.</p>\n<p>DigitalX has previously worked on a DAO proof of concept to create decentralized investment validation with ArbelaDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong><br>\nDiversification is a cornerstone of sound investment strategy as it is crucial for mitigating risk. In today’s globalized economy, investors seek to broaden their portfolios beyond traditional asset classes and geographical boundaries. Investing in global bonds, especially those outside the US, we can provide a number of diversification benefits to Sky.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Mitigation</strong><br>\nWhile U.S. Treasury bills are secure, they are not immune to market shifts that can affect their performance. By investing in high quality bonds from other governments around the world, Sky’s exposure will spread across different economic environments and interest rate regimes. These countries can be at different points in their economic and interest rate cycles compared to the US, so their bonds can offer a hedge against US idiosyncratic market volatility. By holding a diversified mix of bonds from different countries, we will reduce Sky’s reliance on the U.S. economic cycle and interest rate environment. This strategy not only aims to preserve capital but also seeks to enhance returns by taking advantage of different global economic cycles. In the long run, this approach can lead to a more resilient portfolio, capable of weathering various economic conditions while still providing steady income and capital preservation.</p>\n<p><strong>Hedge against Currency risk</strong><br>\nGlobal government bonds can offer a valuable hedge against currency risk, particularly in the context of long-term forecasts for the U.S. dollar. Vanguard’s proprietary model estimates that the U.S. dollar is roughly 12% overvalued against a basket of five leading currencies heading into 2024. In the coming decade, it is estimated that the probability of some dollar depreciation at about 75%, with a modest decline of 1.1% annualized the most likely outcome (<a href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/vemo/vemo-us-dollar.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Source</a>). Investing in bonds denominated in foreign currencies allows the portfolio to be diversified beyond the U.S. dollar. If the dollar weakens as forecasted, the value of the portfolio’s holding in stronger foreign currencies could increase, therefore boosting Sky’s overall returns. This potential appreciation in foreign currencies could help offset any declines in the US dollar’s value, effectively providing a natural hedge against the risks associated with a weakening domestic currency.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong><br>\nThe DigitalX Real World Asset Tokenisation Fund token - the Fund is about to list for both wholesale and retail markets, respectively on a Web3 RWA platform.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong><br>\nWe currently have tokenized Australian residential properties, Australian ETFs and Australian corporate bonds. We also have the appropriate licensing and technical capability to tokenize other types of assets such as commodities, venture capital, private debt, private equity and we plan to continue to expand this asset base. We can provide Spark or other SubDAOs with exposure across multiple asset classes across different risk profiles, investment horizons and geographic locations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99027-vii-investment-process-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99027-vii-investment-process-7\"></a>VII. Investment Process</h2>\n<p><strong>Due Diligence</strong><br>\nWe screen all available investments in government bonds globally. We then use a proprietary, data-driven, universal scoring process - referred to as the Universal Scoring Matrix (USM) - through which investment selection criteria are programmed into a scorecard. The USM helps us compare each investment opportunity using a standardized and consistent approach for scoring various attributes of the investment. A higher score may reflect a superior risk/reward investment proposition.</p>\n<p>Criteria used to evaluate each asset include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Liquidity Screening: The portfolio will prioritize assets with high liquidity, ensuring that trades can be executed efficiently and cost-effectively. We have an AUM threshold (for now, at least $200mil AUM), high trading volumes, and well-established issuers. This ensures that the portfolio can be adjusted with minimal impact on market prices. We avoid illiquid assets by excluding funds and bonds with known liquidity issues or those that are difficult to trade, such as smaller issues or bonds from issuers with lower visibility.</li>\n<li>Asset performance compared to relevant benchmark</li>\n<li>Identification of any legal or reputation risks. We establish minimum rating requirements for assets to be included in the portfolio. This reduces exposure to lower-rated, riskier bonds and ensures a higher quality of credit risk.</li>\n<li>Operating track record including how long the funds have been in operation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All assets must pass this due diligence to be included in the portfolio.</p>\n<p><strong>Asset Allocation</strong><br>\nOur asset allocation process utilizes transparent and efficient allocation methodologies to select underlying assets that maximize risk-adjusted returns and diversification benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Factor-based allocation</strong>: Instead of market-value weighting potentially leading to over-concentration in issuers with large amounts of outstanding debt, we allocate assets based on risk-weighted approaches to allocate assets. Our asset allocation approach targets specific characteristics or factors that have historically been associated with higher returns or lower risk. Those factors include size, credit quality, value and momentum signals.</p>\n<p><strong>Regular Rebalancing</strong>: The portfolio will be regularly rebalanced to maintain target allocations to the identified factors and to ensure compliance with risk parameters. This process involves adjusting positions to reflect changes in market conditions, issuer fundamentals, and investor preferences.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Monitoring and Management</strong>: Ongoing risk monitoring will be conducted to assess the portfolio’s exposure to interest rate risk, credit risk, and other market risks. The portfolio’s duration, credit quality, and sector exposures will be actively managed to align with the investment objectives and risk tolerance.</p>\n<p><strong>Macroeconomic and Market Analysis</strong>: The investment team will closely monitor global economic indicators, central bank policies, and market trends to inform strategic decisions. This analysis will guide adjustments to the portfolio’s allocation to different regions, sectors, and factors.</p>\n<p><strong>Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis</strong>: The portfolio will undergo regular stress testing and scenario analysis to evaluate its performance under various market conditions. This process helps identify potential vulnerabilities and ensures that the portfolio remains resilient in the face of adverse events.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99027-viii-conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99027-viii-conclusion-8\"></a>VIII. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Fund represents a unique opportunity for Spark to diversify its government bonds assets across different economic environments and interest rate regimes. The portfolio helps reduce concentration risk and US$ currency risk, manage volatility and preserve capital while capturing attractive risk-adjusted returns. This comprehensive strategy aligns with the Spark’s overall objectives of diversification, stability, and liquidity.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-digitalx-skyx/25135\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-digitalx-skyx/25135","pubDate":"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 09:49:43 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25135"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-digitalx-skyx/25135.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - DigitalX (SkyX)"}},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Etherfuse","dc:creator":"etherfuse","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/3/a3097c0b1495e17aa1f811277da1de6160e25da6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ngi9bMcI32GvzBdqQg9S8QChDnw.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/3/a3097c0b1495e17aa1f811277da1de6160e25da6.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ngi9bMcI32GvzBdqQg9S8QChDnw\" width=\"690\" height=\"126\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"000000\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Grand Prix Application</p>\n<p>I.
