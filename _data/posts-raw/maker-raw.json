It can be used in several ways, including to participate in the Sky Savings Rate and access Sky Token Rewards without giving up control. It is the upgraded version of DAI, backed by a surplus of collateral and soft-pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, meaning it is designed to maintain a value equal to or close to a dollar. USDS powers the permissionless, non-custodial Sky Protocol.</p>\n<p>Unlike cryptocurrencies that can fluctuate widely in value, USDS is designed to maintain a soft peg to the U.S. dollar and to be a reliable store of value and medium of exchange. USDS is governed by a community of broad and diversified individuals and entities from around the world, who hold Sky governance tokens and support the Sky ecosystem by participating in a system of decentralized onchain voting. USDS powers the open Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I get USDS?</strong></p>\n<p>You can use Sky.money as a gateway to the Sky Protocol and to then access the permissionless liquidity pools, or similar onchain solutions, to trade USDC, USDT, ETH or SKY for USDS. You can also upgrade your DAI to USDS subject to any applicable gas fees for using the Ethereum blockchain network, which powers the Sky Protocol. That fee is not controlled, imposed, or received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol. You might be able to obtain USDS on various crypto exchanges that decide to make it available on their platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>What is SKY, and how can I get it and use it?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY is a native governance token of the decentralized Sky ecosystem and the upgraded version of Maker’s legacy governance token, MKR. You can upgrade your MKR to SKY at the rate of 1:24,000 via the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<p>You can trade SKY for USDS and, soon, use it to accumulate Activation Token Rewards and participate in Sky ecosystem governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting.</p>\n<p>Sky.money is a non-custodial gateway to the Sky Protocol. You always remain in control of your funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives to Sky.money</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://Summer.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow

Executive Summary</strong></h2>\n<p>We believe our proposal for USDY, alongside our proposal for OUSG, offers SparkDAO and the Sky ecosystem a best-in-class solution for the diversification of its RWA portfolio. Our proposal has been tailored to meet the requirements of the Sky ecosystem for the highest possible yield, while maintaining healthy liquidity. In addition, Ondo Finance and its affiliates are committed to building a long-term relationship and being the strategic partner to the Sky ecosystem. We are excited to provide the most effective backing for sUSDS and help make it into the preeminent savings instrument onchain for people globally. and be the strategic partner to the Sky ecosystem. We are excited to provide the most cost-effective and multichain backing for sUSDS and help make it into the preeminent savings instrument onchain for people globally.</p>\n<p><strong>What Sets USDY Apart:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unparalleled scale and experience</strong>: Ondo is the market leader in RWAs with a combined TVL exceeding $600M. We have unmatched experience with managing onchain RWAs at scale. Over the past 20 months, Ondo has also pioneered multiple RWA innovations, such as OUSG (the first peer-to-peer transferable fund onchain), USDY (the first quasi-permissionless bearer note backed by US Treasuries), and <a href=\"https://fluxfinance.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Flux Finance</a> (“Flux,” the first DeFi protocol designed to support permissioned securities). Going forward, Sky can expect Ondo to pioneer additional innovations that will be accretive to the Sky ecosystem and its products (e.g., USDS and sUSDS).</li>\n<li><strong>Best-in-class product features and integrations</strong>: As the largest quasi-permissionless RWA product, USDY has a clear track record of best-in-class product features. USDY offers the highest yield with daily interest accruals, near-zero fees, rebasing and non-rebasing versions, and unparalleled multi-chain availability (USDY is live on 7 different chains). USDY is designed to be used across a variety of use cases and is integrated with over 70 different protocols.</li>\n<li><strong>Robust investor protection:</strong> USDY offers industry-leading protections to its holders. USDY holders benefit from a perfected, first-priority security interest in the issuer’s US Treasuries and cash assets that fully back and overcollateralize the token value and are held in a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle. An independent Collateral Agent protects the tokenholders’ interests in these assets, while an independent Verification Agent helps ensure detailed, daily transparency of the issuers assets and obligations.</li>\n<li><strong>Highest onchain yield</strong>: USDY has historically achieved some of the highest onchain yields (5.35%) due to its backing, efficient management and very low fees. In addition, we will soon support instant redemptions of USDY against other major stablecoins, including USDS, for up to $25M per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Long-term strategic partnership</strong>: USDY can offer long-term strategic advantages to SparkDAO and the Sky ecosystem, particularly as it relates to the performance of its RWA portfolio and its multichain footprint. For example, Sky will be able to easily expand the backing of USDS and sUSDS to other chains (and minimize transaction fees for its holders) with the multichain integrations and bridging of USDY. Finally, Ondo’s Global Market initiative will be able to bring other fixed-income products and public securities onchain for SparkDAO and the Sky ecosystem, thereby always ensuring the most optimal backing of sUSDS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99146-i-product-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99146-i-product-summary-3\"></a><strong>I.

Ondo GM will unlock access to traditional securities, bringing their liquidity onchain while adding DeFi capabilities to these traditional assets. It is a foundational platform bridging TradFi and DeFi that will include a broker-dealer with accounts at traditional trading, clearing and settlement venues that will accept client orders via API, web app, and smart contract call or token transfer. Ondo GM will combine the asset and liquidity access plus the institutional-grade investor protections of traditional brokerages with the interoperability, composability, and low friction settlement of public blockchains. In summary, Ondo GM will provide native access to traditional securities and associated exchange liquidity for onchain investors and protocol developers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key personnel biographies:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanlallman/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>Nathan Allman</em></a> <em>| Founder and Chief Executive Officer</em><br>\nNathan previously worked at Goldman Sachs on the Digital Assets team, where he was responsible for the first bond issuance by the European Investment Bank on Ethereum.

USDY was launched just over 13 months ago.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99146-iii-product-information-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99146-iii-product-information-5\"></a><strong>III. Product Information</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe the product:</strong></p>\n<p>The Ondo US Dollar Yield Token (USDY) is a tokenized bearer note that is overcollateralized and secured by short-term US Treasuries (which constitute over 95% of the Issuer’s assets) and US bank demand deposits (i.e. cash deposits in US banks that can be withdrawn upon demand of the issuer). The first-of-its-kind product provides its holders with onchain access to US Treasuries in a bearer form that is composable with DeFi protocols, and is the most widely held, most composable, and most DeFi-integrated tokenized US Treasuries asset available.</p>\n<p>USDY yields variable-rate interest, adjusted monthly in advance by the Issuer, in accordance with its procedures, to be competitive with short-duration US Treasury rates. The yield automatically compounds, such that the USD-denominated minting and redemption value of USDY increases each day. As of this writing, USDY yields 5.35% APY.</p>\n<p><strong>USDY Overview</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/9/6914efd17049ccc3b89e610ce7c7397345282dab.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/eZAZsps1ejwtbXpopsGXgFe6MZl.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/9/6914efd17049ccc3b89e610ce7c7397345282dab_2_690x444.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"eZAZsps1ejwtbXpopsGXgFe6MZl\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/9/6914efd17049ccc3b89e610ce7c7397345282dab_2_690x444.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/9/6914efd17049ccc3b89e610ce7c7397345282dab_2_1035x666.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/9/6914efd17049ccc3b89e610ce7c7397345282dab_2_1380x888.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E8E9ED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>USDY also offers significant investor protections. These include (1) creditor rights under Delaware commercial law and US federal bankruptcy law; (2) requirements for Ondo USDY LLC to overcollateralize its obligations to USDY holders; (3) representation by an independent Collateral Agent that holds a first-priority security interest in all of the LLC’s assets for the benefit of USDY holders and that is empowered and required to seize those assets and make distributions to token holders in major Issuer default events; (4) the bankruptcy remote design and operation of the Issuer; and (5) daily transparency regarding the Issuer’s assets and obligations. See Sections IV.4 and IV.5 below for details regarding these protections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe the underlying asset:</strong></p>\n<p>USDY is secured and overcollateralized by short-duration US Treasuries with a maximum term of one year and an average maturity of three months, though it may hold small amounts of bank demand deposits to facilitate redemptions and liquidity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>USDY comes in two versions: an ‘accumulating’ version (USDY) whose per-token price increases as yield accrues, and a ‘rebasing’ version (rUSDY) whose price remains at $1.00. Whereas the price of USDY tokens increases as the value of the underlying assets increase, rUSDY is automatically subdivided into more rUSDY in your wallet; in effect, the yield on the underlying assets accrues in the form of additional rUSDY tokens. For example, if you acquired 100 rUSDY tokens when the price per token of USDY was $1.00 – and then the price per token of USDY increased to$1.01, the price per token of rUSDY would remain at $1.00, but your wallet would now hold 101 rUSDY tokens. This ‘rebasing’ occurs automatically when the USDY price is updated each day.</p>\n<p>Tokenholders can easily and instantly convert back and forth between USDY and rUSDY on the USDY <a href=\"https://ondo.finance/usdy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">website</a> at any time.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/9/99928b005e25e2c82c1bfd05db2912aae34a3f87.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lUz1ejAFhul2hTwn6DCXmVJV8qP.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/9/99928b005e25e2c82c1bfd05db2912aae34a3f87_2_690x303.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"lUz1ejAFhul2hTwn6DCXmVJV8qP\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"303\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/9/99928b005e25e2c82c1bfd05db2912aae34a3f87_2_690x303.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/9/99928b005e25e2c82c1bfd05db2912aae34a3f87_2_1035x454.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/9/99928b005e25e2c82c1bfd05db2912aae34a3f87_2_1380x606.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F1F2F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>More information about rUSDY can be found <a href=\"https://docs.ondo.finance/general-access-products/usdy/usdy-vs-rebasing-usdy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Issuer: Ondo USDY LLC</em></p>\n<p>USDY is issued by Ondo USDY LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and special purpose vehicle that is designed for bankruptcy remoteness from all other persons and entities, including Ondo operating companies.</p>\n<p><em>Servicer and Administrator: Ondo Finance Inc.</em></p>\n<p>Ondo Finance Inc., a Delaware corporation, provides technical, financial, operational and administrative services to the Issuer, including smart contract development and administration, daily valuation calculations, accounting services, and financial operation and reporting.</p>\n<p><em>Other</em></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Category</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Entity</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Jurisdiction</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Brokers / Custodians</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Morgan Stanley Stone X</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">United States</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Collateral Agent</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Ankura Trust Company</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">United States</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Verification Agent</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Ankura Trust Company</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">United States</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Banking Partners</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Silicon Valley Bank</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">United States</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Fiat-to-Stablecoin Conversion</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Coinbase</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">United States</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>Ondo USDY LLC is a special purpose vehicle with strict, narrow asset allocation requirements.

When you invest in USDY, we earn interest on the US Treasuries and bank deposits to which the proceeds are allocated. We earn any difference between that interest and the yield that accrues to USDY.</p>\n<p><em>Transaction Fees</em><br>\nThere are no mint fees for USDY. There is a 20 bps fee on redemptions. There are no incoming and outgoing wire / money transmission fees for transactions over $100,000.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</strong></p>\n<p>Proceeds from the issuance of USDY, whether direct or indirect, are used by the Issuer for payments to maintain the Issuer’s operations (i.e. payments to Ankura Trust Company as the Collateral Agent and Verification Agent, and to Ondo Finance as Servicer and Administrator). Such use of proceeds, however, does not release the Issuer’s obligation to tokenholders to maintain sufficient overcollateralization of its USDY liabilities. The interest that accrues to USDY is net of any and all such payments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></p>\n<p>Primary purchasers and redeemers of USDY must undergo and successfully complete customer due diligence with Ondo USDY LLC as a condition to primary purchase and redemption. The LLC’s customer due diligence process screens these persons for (1) anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance and (2) jurisdictional purposes in connection with the LLC’s regulatory obligations as a US registered money services business and under US federal securities and tax laws, respectively.</p>\n<p>Due to restrictions imposed by US federal securities laws, primary purchasers of USDY initially receive a non-tokenized electronic record of their ownership (their “Temporary Global Certificate”), which is eligible for automatic conversion to USDY tokens 40-50 days post-purchase (based on the USDY price at the time of initial subscription).</p>\n<p>Because USDY is a bearer asset, once it is minted it becomes transferable peer-to-peer without Issuer KYC or recordation of ownership. Accordingly, USDY is a highly composable and liquid asset.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>The 30-day transaction volume is $408,704,420 as of September 18, 2024. Additional metrics can be found on <a href=\"https://app.rwa.xyz/assets/USDY\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this dashboard</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>Investors typically receive their USDY Temporary Global Certificate the first business day after a subscription request; it is the acknowledgement date on this certificate that determines when the investor begins earning yield. For subscriptions made via the USDY web app, this acknowledgement date is the date that the investment was made, even if certificate issuance is delayed. Actual USDY token issuance currently happens 40-50 days after the initial subscription, based on the price at initial subscription.</p>\n<p>Investors can request redemptions of Temporary Global Certificates or USDY tokens. In both cases, it typically takes between 2-3 business days to redeem. Any redemption in excess of $100,000 must be made no later than 5 business days after the demand for payment.</p>\n<p>To date, we have not had any interruption in our ability to process subscriptions or redemptions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Onboarding &amp; KYC Verification</strong></p>\n<p>Before any subscription can proceed, prospective tokenholders must successfully complete the Issuer’s customer due diligence to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

Legal Structure</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates:</strong></p>\n<p>Ondo USDY LLC is structured as a special purpose vehicle whose activities are limited to (1) borrowing funds from prospective lenders, (2) issuing USDY tokens to evidence the LLC’s debt obligations to those lenders, (3) allocating the proceeds of borrowing to US Treasuries and US bank demand deposits, (4) creating and perfecting a security interest in its assets, and (5) related incidental activities.</p>\n<p>The LLC is co-owned by Ondo Finance Inc. and Flux Finance Inc., a British Virgin Islands business company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Ondo Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company (which are unaffiliated with the Ondo Foundation). Ondo Finance holds 100% of the Class B interests in the LLC, which afford the right to appoint the members of the LLC’s board of directors and which pay an annual preferred return – but which otherwise have no economic rights. The Class A interests of the LLC are held by Flux Finance (&gt; 99%) and Ondo Finance (&lt; 1%) and provide pro rata rights to the equity of Ondo USDY LLC.</p>\n<p>USDY is offered and sold by the LLC in reliance on Regulation S under the 33 Act, which exempts USDY from the securities registration requirements of the 33 Act.  Accordingly, USDY can only be issued and sold by the LLC to non-US persons in transactions outside the US. Ondo USDY LLC is also registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the US Department of the Treasury (“FinCEN”). Investors also must undergo customer due diligence for anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance purposes in accordance with the anti-money laundering program that the LLC has adopted to comply with the US Bank Secrecy Act.</p>\n<p>The LLC has granted Ankura Trust Company a perfected, first-priority security interest in all of its assets, including the US Treasuries and demand deposits that overcollateralize the USDY tokens. Copies of the Uniform Commercial Code financing statement and amendment thereto that have been filed with the US state of Delaware to perfect the interest, are being delivered with the private supplement to this application.</p>\n<p>The LLC is organized in and operates from the United States, with its principal place of business in the state of Connecticut. USDY is marketed primarily via Internet channels from the United States in the English language, and does not target any specific jurisdiction or jurisdictions. The LLC only offers and sells USDY to non-US persons outside of the US who successfully complete its customer due diligence process, which screens sanctioned persons and persons in sanctioned or other high-risk jurisdictions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>As an issuer of a product that is available in a wide range of jurisdictions, Ondo USDY LLC is mindful of regulatory requirements both in its own jurisdiction and the jurisdictions of its tokenholders.</p>\n<p>In the US, the offer and sale of USDY is structured to comply with Regulation S, an exemption from securities registration requirements that is enforced by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). FinCEN has regulatory oversight over the anti-money laundering compliance activities of the LLC as a registered money services business.</p>\n<p>Globally, the LLC relies on exemptions or exclusions from applicable securities or digital asset approval, registration, licensing, permitting and similar requirements. These exemptions and requirements are enforced by various regulatory bodies, including the following regulatory bodies in top jurisdictions for USDY issuance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cayman Islands Monetary Authority;</li>\n<li>British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission;</li>\n<li>Jersey Financial Services Commission;</li>\n<li>Securities and Commodities Authority (United Arab Emirates, mainland); and</li>\n<li>Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (Dubai, United Arab Emirates, mainland).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the Section IV.3 below for further information on these exemptions and exclusions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>In the US, Ondo USDY LLC is registered as a money services business with FinCEN. Ondo USDY LLC offers and sells USDY in reliance on the Regulation S exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which requires, among other things, that USDY is only offered and sold to non-US persons outside the United States.</p>\n<p>Globally, the Fund, its affiliates and OUSG rely on exemptions or exclusions from applicable securities or digital asset approval, registration, licensing, permitting and similar requirements. These include exemptions and exclusions for sales pursuant to reverse solicitations; cross-border transactions; absence of operations and other activities in the applicable jurisdictions; and combinations thereof.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>Ondo USDY LLC is structured to maximize bankruptcy remoteness and investor protection. Specifically, it has been designed with and maintains all of the well established and widely recognized indicia of a bankruptcy remote structure, including those listed below. Because a variety of jurisdictions – including jurisdictions where the issuer is organized, jurisdictions where key business decisions are made, and jurisdictions where creditors or other interested parties reside or conduct their business – may assert jurisdiction to enforce creditor rights (with respect to Ondo USDY LLC or any other issuer), it is crucial to adhere to bankruptcy remoteness principles that are widely recognized across jurisdictions. The LLC’s maintenance of these characteristics is designed to prevent voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy filings, to prevent the substantive consolidation of the LLC with another person or entity in the event of the latter’s bankruptcy, and to protect the USDY holders’ rights to the principal and accrued interest evidenced by their tokens in the event of any such bankruptcy. A non-consolidation opinion from a major global law firm is enclosed with the private supplement to this application.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Restrictions on Activities.</em> The LLC is structured as a special purpose vehicle with significant restrictions on its activities. Specifically, its business is limited to (1) borrowing funds from prospective lenders (i.e. prospective USDY holders), (2) issuing USDY tokens to evidence the LLC’s debt obligations to those lenders, (3) allocating the proceeds of borrowing to US Treasuries and US bank demand deposits, (4) creating and perfecting a security interest in its assets, and (5) related incidental activities (e.g. engagement of the Collateral Agent, Verification Agent, Servicer and Administrator in furtherance of the activities described in (1) through (4)).</li>\n<li><em>Security Interests in Assets.</em> The LLC has also granted its Collateral Agent a perfected, first-priority interest in all of its assets to ringfence them for the benefit of USDY holders in the event of any bankruptcy.</li>\n<li><em>Limitations on Incurring Indebtedness.</em> The LLC cannot incur any indebtedness for money borrowed, other than debt evidenced by USDY.</li>\n<li><em>Independent Director Requirements.</em> The LLC is not permitted to authorize or take any material action without the approval of an independent director (and the approval of the requisite majority of LLC members). Material actions include, among other things: modifying the LLC’s permitted asset guidelines; initiating or consenting to a bankruptcy or similar action; liquidating or dissolving the LLC; and merging, consolidating or dividing the LLC.</li>\n<li><em>Restrictions on Organizational Changes.</em> In addition to the restrictions on organizational changes referenced immediately above, the LLC is not permitted to merge, consolidate or divide; to liquidate or dissolve; or to change material terms of the LLC’s obligations to USDY holders without the consent of the requisite majority of USDY holders.</li>\n<li><em>Operational Separateness.</em> Ondo USDY LLC maintains organizational separateness from Ondo Finance Inc. and other persons and entities in a variety of manners, including conducting business in its own name only; not commingling assets with any other person or entity; maintaining separate books, records, accounts and financial statements from any other person or entity; not acquiring any securities or other interests in its members or creditors; not incurring any guarantee or obligation with respect to any other person’s or entity’s debts; not pledging its assets; not making any loans or advances; and observing all limited liability company formalities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>USDY holders have creditor rights under Delaware commercial law and US federal bankruptcy law, and they also enjoy significant and unparalleled investor protections.</p>\n<p>First, Ondo USDY LLC’s obligations are required to be overcollateralized by a combination of (1) the US Treasuries and demand deposits that fully back its obligations to token holders and (2) an additional first-loss equity buffer held in US Treasuries and demand deposits and is funded in part by the capital contributions of Ondo Finance Inc. and Flux Finance Inc. The Issuer must maintain a quarterly overcollateralization ratio of 103.00% and a daily ratio of 100.50%. The current overcollateralization ratio is 103.43%.</p>\n<p>Second, the interests of USDY holders are protected by the independent Collateral Agent, Ankura Trust Company, LLC, which is empowered and required to seize the Issuer’s assets and make distributions to tokenholders in the event that the Issuer fails to timely make any redemption of at least $100,000, fails to adequately maintain its daily overcollateralization obligations, or files for bankruptcy or similar, if so directed by requisite tokenholder consent.</p>\n<p>Third, the Collateral Agent holds a perfected, first-priority security interest in all of the assets of the Issuer, for the benefit of the USDY token holders, under Delaware law. This security interest works in tandem with the Collateral Agent’s rights and obligations in the events of default described above</p>\n<p>Fourth, the Issuer has been designed from first principles to be bankruptcy remote from all other entities, including Ondo Finance Inc. See Section IV.4 above for further discussion of bankruptcy remoteness.</p>\n<p>Fifth, transparency in the Issuer’s assets and obligations is ensured by the independent Verification Agent, who reviews and confirms the amounts and valuations of those assets and liabilities (and any related calculations) each business day and publishes daily reports detailing outstanding USDY token and Temporary Global Certificate balances and asset amounts, types and custodians. See Section V.2 for additional discussion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?:</strong></p>\n<p>Yes; however, the Ondo USDY LLC does not expect any resulting material adverse effect on its financial condition or operations, including its abilities to fulfill any of its USDY-related obligations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO:</strong></p>\n<p>Nathan Allman is a director and officer of the Issuer, as well as a director and officer of Ondo Finance Inc., which indirectly controls the Issuer and holds a minority (&lt; 1%) of its Class A interests.</p>\n<p>While we do not believe that the following relationships constitute an actual or potential conflict of interest, we note that Sébastien Derivaux is a director of Ondo USDY LLC, as well as the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Steakhouse Financial.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product:</strong></p>\n<p>Ondo USDY LLC expects to be treated as a partnership (and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation) for US federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the LLC does not pay US federal income tax, but instead passes through its profits, losses, deductions and credits to its partners.</p>\n<p>The LLC further expects that the USDY tokens will be treated as debt, and that the LLC will not be treated as being engaged in a trade or business in the US, for US federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the LLC does not expect payments of interest to USDY holders to be subject to any US federal withholding tax – and the LLC does not withhold any taxes on such interest payments.</p>\n<p>The LLC will deliver applicable US tax forms to USDY holders consistent with these expectations.</p>\n<p>USDY is also structured to comply with the requirements of TEFRA D, which exempts the LLC from excise taxes that generally apply to the principal amount of bearer debt.</p>\n<p>Note that foreign taxes, or US state and local taxes, may apply to a tokenholder’s interest income depending on the tokenholder’s personal tax circumstances.

It leverages the battle-tested OpenZeppelin <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/access-control#role-based-access-control\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Transparent Upgradeable Proxy</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC20</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/access-control#role-based-access-control\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Role Based Access Control</a> (RBAC) standards. To ensure compliance, USDY incorporates native <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20-_beforeTokenTransfer-address-address-uint256-\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">transfer hooks</a> that enforce blocklist and sanctions checks on all transactions.

Like USDY, it leverages OpenZeppelin’s RBAC and Transparent Upgradeable Proxy standards and enforces the same transfer restrictions. Users acquire rUSDY by granting USDY allowance to the rUSDY token contract and invoking <code>rUSDY::wrap(uint256 _USDYAmount)</code>, which deposits their USDY into the contract. Conversely, users can convert back to USDY by calling <code>rUSDY::unwrap(uint256 _rUSDYAmount)</code>, which burns rUSDY and returns the corresponding amount of USDY. The user’s holdings are tracked through an account-to-shares mapping, which records the proportion of USDY they own. rUSDY’s rebasing mechanism adjusts balances according to the price of USDY, which is fetched from the <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0219aa5b31e65bc920b5b6dfb8edf0988121de0#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWADynamicOracle</a>. As USDY’s price rises, rUSDY balances automatically increase, maintaining parity with USDY’s value. Clients can observe token balances by calling the <code>rUSDY::balanceOf(address _account)</code> function, which calculates the balance by multiplying the user’s shares by the latest USDY price. rUSDY is always valued at one dollar and conversion between USDY and rUSDY is accessible to non-US users via <a href=\"https://ondo.finance/convert\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ondo Finance’s platform</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: On the Mantle blockchain, rUSDY is referred to as mUSD.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xd8c8174691d936E2C80114EC449037b13421B0a8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blocklist</a>:</p>\n<p>The Blocklist contract manages a list of addresses prohibited from interacting with USDY. It maintains a simple mapping of address-to-status to keep track of the set of blocked addresses. External contracts can call <code>Blocklist::isBlocked(address addr)</code> to check whether a particular address is blocked. The blocklist is managed by a permissioned Gnosis Safe Multisig account, which has the authority to add or remove addresses via the <code>Blocklist::addToBlocklist(address[] accounts)</code> and <code>Blocklist::removeFromBlocklist(address[] accounts)</code> functions. Ownership functionality is implemented using the Open Zeppelin’s <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable2Step\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ownable2Step</a> standard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0219aa5b31e65bc920b5b6dfb8edf0988121de0#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWADynamicOracle</a>:</p>\n<p>The RWADynamicOracle contract provides clients the ability to retrieve the canonical USDY redemption price on the Ethereum blockchain. USDY’s price increases in a deterministic manner based on a monthly APY, which is determined before the start of each month.</p>\n<p>The oracle maintains a series of time ranges aligned to UTC midnights, each associated with a daily interest rate. Clients can retrieve the USDY price for the current day by calling the <code>RWADynamicOracle::getPrice()</code> function. This function uses the <code>block.timestamp</code> to determine the day of the current transaction, and then uses the daily interest rate to calculate what the price is. Price updates occur automatically at UTC midnight.</p>\n<p>Time ranges and interest rates are set via a Gnosis Safe Multisig account, which calls <code>RWADynamicOracle::setRange(uint256 endTimestamp, uint256 dailyInterestRate)</code>. Administrative functions are secured using OpenZeppelin’s <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/access-control#role-based-access-control\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RBAC</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ondo Bridge Overview For USDY</strong></p>\n<p>The Ondo Bridge facilitates USDY transfers between blockchains using two contracts: SourceBridge and DestinationBridge. It’s one of the first Multi-Message Aggregation Bridge implementations, relying on both the Axelar Network and Ondo Finance’s off-chain systems to relay and attest messages.</p>\n<p>USDY bridging uses a ‘native-burn-and-native-mint’ mechanism, allowing the token issuer to maintain compliance controls across chains. The contracts implement emergency pausing, global rate limiting, and dynamic attestation thresholds to safeguard the system, with the thresholds scaling based on the amount of USDY being bridged.</p>\n<p>Non-US users can bridge USDY between Ethereum and Mantle using <a href=\"https://ondo.finance/bridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ondo Finance’s web app</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xD89655ECf4800251880f8f6BA9038970AD9813dB#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SourceBridge</a>: The SourceBridge contract handles USDY transfers on the source chain. Users can bridge by granting  USDY approval to the SourceBridge contract and then calling <code>SourceBridge::burnAndCallAxelar(uint256 amount, string destinationChain)</code>. This function burns the USDY and sends the gas and message payload to the <a href=\"https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/gas-service/intro/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Axelar Gas Service</a> and Axelar Gateway. This contract uses Open Zeppelin’s <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ownable</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/utils#Pausable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pausable</a> standards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xBd8Fb563a325dc853741907ae06e5F3c02c9235c#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DestinationBridge</a>:</p>\n<p>The DestinationBridge contract operates on the destination chain and is responsible for receiving the USDY bridge message payloads from the Axelar network. Upon receiving a payload, the contract queues it for further attestations from the token Issuer.</p>\n<p>Once the required number of attestations is met, the contract verifies the token amount against the global rate limit and the corresponding USDY is minted to the end user on the destination chain. Like the SourceBridge, this contract leverage’s Open Zeppelin’s <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ownable</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/utils#Pausable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pausable</a> standards.</p>\n<p>Ondo Finance is actively collaborating with leading bridging providers to replicate a similar design across all blockchains where USDY is natively deployed.</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Bounty</strong></p>\n<p>Ondo’s USDY related smart contracts are secured by an <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/ondofinance/information/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Immunefi bug bounty</a>, with an industry-leading maximum payout of $1,000,000.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract Management Systems</strong></p>\n<p>Ondo leverages Gnosis Safe multisigs in combination with a proprietary off-chain management system to enforce signing quorums for all administrative contract calls. Ondo regularly reviews and assesses multisig and other relevant control architectures against best practices and evolving industry standards.</p>\n<p>Web Experience: Key Elements</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mint/Redeem U</strong>I. We have developed an easy-to-use web based UI that allows investors to easily subscribe to or redeem USDY. Users must have successfully onboarded and be logged in to utilize the web based subscription and redemption functionality. If a user prefers not to use the web experience, Ondo supports subscriptions or redemptions by direct transfer to an address provided by our operations team. There is also a UI interface to enable a slippage-free way to convert between USDY and rUSDY. Users do not need to be authenticated (logged in) to utilize the convert functionality. Jurisdiction restrictions apply to the functionality described above in that users may not be located within the US.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>API for Canonical, Real-Time Data</strong>.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs:</strong></p>\n<p>Since inception, Ondo has been committed to meeting the unique needs of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Our <a href=\"https://v1.ondo.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">v1 product</a> suite, designed specifically for DAOs, is a testament to this commitment. With these tools, we have empowered DAOs to govern themselves more effectively, optimize their liquidity, and manage real-world assets (RWAs) onchain in a seamless, transparent manner.</p>\n<p>Ondo Finance developed <a href=\"https://fluxfinance.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Flux Finance</a> (Flux), a DAO-governed special purpose lending protocol facilitating stablecoin loans against tokenized treasuries collateral, including OUSG. Flux is similar to a US Treasuries repo market, in which large institutions effectively lend and borrow overcollateralized against US Treasuries. Flux made a <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip119-onboard-dai-funds-to-the-flux-finance-dai-lending-pool/19885\">proposal</a> to Sky in Feb 2023 that led to continued discussion about Sky’s diversification into tokenized treasuries.</p>\n<p>In addition to Flux, we have integrated deeply into the broader DeFi ecosystem, collaborating with multiple DAOs on treasury management, liquidity solutions, and yield strategies. Most recently, Ondo partnered with the Arbitrum DAO, helping them diversify their treasury into stable assets with minimal volatility and secure yield uncorrelated to crypto markets. Through this collaboration, USDY was awarded the second-largest <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-committee-recommendations/25097\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">allocation</a> of 17% (6M ARB), second only to BlackRock’s BUIDL. We have also submitted applications for <a href=\"https://gov.ethenafoundation.com/t/reserve-fund-ondo-finance-usdy/108\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USDY</a> and <a href=\"https://gov.ethenafoundation.com/t/reserve-fund-ondo-finance-ousg/109\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OUSG</a> for inclusion in Ethena’s Reserve Fund.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Ondo is committed to being a long-term partner for SparkDAO and the Sky ecosystem, providing effective backing for sUSDS and helping establish it as the leading savings instrument onchain. Beyond providing yield, OUSG offers a variety of strategic benefits for SparkDAO and Sky:</p>\n<p><strong>On-and Off-Ramp for USDY:</strong> We will enable subscriptions and redemptions for OUSG against USDS, with liquidity up to $50M per day by the end of 2024. This will be the largest instant redemption facility onchain, providing flexibility and robust liquidity to the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Chain Expansion:</strong> USDY is currently live on seven different chains already (incl. Solana, Aptos, Sui and many EVM chains), with more chain integrations coming. USDY could be a suitable collateral source for Sky when it decides to expand to other, low cost chains, to further reduce the transaction costs for USDS and sUSDS holders.</p>\n<p><strong>Protocol Partnerships:</strong> USDY is currently integrated with over 70 projects, and we would be delighted to work with Sky on joint partnerships with protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Co-Marketing Campaigns:</strong> We can partner with the Sky ecosystem on co-branded marketing efforts to highlight the synergies between Ondo and Sky and to ignite each of our communities. This could include case studies, social media campaigns, and other educational content to raise awareness.</p>\n<p><strong>Joint Hackathons and Grants:</strong> We can collaborate with Sky on hackathons or developer grants to encourage building on top of USDS, further strengthening the integration between Ondo’s solutions and the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We are providing a supplemental, private addendum to GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial with additional strategic considerations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>As a quasi-permissionless yieldcoin, USDY can be used across a variety of use cases, including, lending &amp; borrowing, cash management, payments, and more, all while earning yield. USDY has demonstrated proven traction across these many use cases, being integrated with over 70 projects across 7 blockchains: Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, Sui, Mantle, Arbitrum, and Cosmos via Noble.</p>\n<p><strong>DeFi Lending Protocols:</strong></p>\n<p>USDY is integrated with lending platforms, enabling tokenholders to use USDY as collateral for borrowing other assets. This expands the utility of USDY beyond simple yield-bearing functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Pools:</strong></p>\n<p>USDY can be deposited into various DEXs and liquidity pools, where it provides liquidity to trading pairs. This integration allows users to earn additional rewards and enhance the liquidity of the token within the broader DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Payments:</strong></p>\n<p>USDY is integrated with payment platforms like Helio that allow tokens to be used as a method of settling transactions. These platforms enable USDY holders to make payments across the crypto ecosystem, offering a secure and fast alternative for conducting transactions compared to traditional payment methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Bridges:</strong></p>\n<p>USDY is supported by a select group of bridges that allow seamless transfers of the token between different blockchain networks. These bridges enable cross-chain compatibility, enhancing USDY’s accessibility and flexibility within the decentralized ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallets:</strong></p>\n<p>USDY is compatible with numerous popular crypto wallets, including both hardware and software solutions. These wallets provide secure storage and easy access to USDY, allowing investors to manage their tokens across multiple platforms. Integration with leading wallets ensures that users can track and transact their USDY with ease.</p>\n<p><strong>Custody Solutions:</strong></p>\n<p>USDY is supported by institutional-grade custody platforms such as Anchorage and BitGo, which specialize in secure digital asset storage. These custodians offer high-security solutions tailored to institutional investors, providing protection and robust infrastructure for USDY holdings. The integration with these platforms ensures that USDY is safely stored, mitigating risks associated with operational challenges and custody concerns.</p>\n<p>These integrations significantly boost USDY’s utility by allowing holders to access capital efficiently or earn additional returns through various DeFi strategies. Retail investors and institutions can therefore leverage their USDY holdings within DApps.

Executive Summary</strong></h2>\n<p>Ondo Finance, in collaboration with BlackRock and Securitize, is proud to present the Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries Token (OUSG) as a premier solution for SparkDAO and the Sky ecosystem’s RWA portfolio diversification. Our proposal has been tailored to meet the requirements of the Sky ecosystem for yield and liquidity. In addition, Ondo Finance and its affiliates are committed to building a long-term relationship and being the strategic partner to the Sky ecosystem. We are excited to provide the most effective backing for sUSDS and help make it into the preeminent savings instrument onchain for people globally.</p>\n<p><strong>What Sets OUSG Apart:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unparalleled scale and experience</strong>: As the largest player in on-chain RWAs with over $600M in TVL, Ondo brings unparalleled experience in managing real-world assets onchain at scale. Over the past 20 months, Ondo has also pioneered multiple RWA innovations, such as OUSG (the first peer-to-peer transferable fund onchain), USDY (the first quasi-permissionless bearer note backed by US Treasuries), and <a href=\"https://fluxfinance.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Flux Finance</a> (“Flux,” the first DeFi protocol designed to support permissioned securities). Going forward, Sky can expect Ondo to pioneer additional innovations that will be accretive to the Sky ecosystem and its products (e.g., USDS and sUSDS).</li>\n<li><strong>Best-in-class product features</strong>: OUSG offers unmatched product features, including instant 24/7 subscriptions and redemptions for up to $25M per day (expanding to $50M by year-end), daily interest accruals, low fees, rebasing and non-rebasing versions, and multi-chain availability (including Ethereum and Solana).</li>\n<li><strong>Robust investor protection:</strong> OUSG affords its holders the rights of Delaware limited partners within the most common structure for pooled investment, operated to maximize bankruptcy remoteness.</li>\n<li><strong>Deepest onchain available liquidity</strong>: OUSG provides the deepest onchain liquidity for instant subscriptions and redemptions, currently up to $25M per day, thanks to our partnership Blackrock, Securitize, and Circle. In addition to this liquidity facility and its potential growth, we are working on further expanding OUSG liquidity via separate facilities and by enabling subscriptions and redemptions against other stablecoin pairs, including USDS.</li>\n<li><strong>Long-term strategic partnership</strong>: OUSG can offer long-term strategic advantages to SparkDAO and the Sky ecosystem, particularly as it relates to the liquidity and performance of its RWA portfolio. For example, Sky will have the ability to “unwrap” its OUSG into BUIDL, if onboarded to both Ondo and Securitize, to automatically rebalance as needed. In addition, OUSG can also step in as a buyer for other, suitable assets, to help the Sky ecosystem rebalance its portfolio over time and alleviate some of its liquidity needs. Finally, Ondo’s Global Market initiative will be able to bring other fixed-income products onchain for SparkDAO and the Sky ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99145-i-product-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99145-i-product-summary-3\"></a><strong>I.

We have partnered with prominent bridging technologies, such as Axelar, and incorporated state-of-the-art, multi-chain communication primitives together with a novel Ondo risk management layer to help tokenholders bridge RWAs in a safe and efficient manner. It’s one of the first Multi-Message Aggregation Bridge implementations with amount-based attestation thresholds, relying on both the Axelar Network and Ondo’s off-chain systems to relay and attest messages. Ondo strives to build out the services and infrastructure needed to enhance utility and security for tokenized assets more broadly.</p>\n<p>Finally, in January 2024, we announced <a href=\"https://blog.ondo.finance/introducing-ondo-global-markets/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ondo Global Markets</a> (“Ondo GM”), which will bring publicly listed securities onchain. Ondo GM will unlock access to traditional securities, bringing their liquidity onchain while adding DeFi capabilities to these traditional assets. It is a foundational platform bridging TradFi and DeFi that will include a broker-dealer with accounts at traditional trading, clearing and settlement venues that will accept client orders via API, web app, and smart contract call or token transfer. Ondo GM will combine the asset and liquidity access plus the institutional-grade investor protections of traditional brokerages with the interoperability, composability, and low friction settlement of public blockchains. In summary, Ondo GM will provide native access to traditional securities and associated exchange liquidity for onchain investors and protocol developers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key personnel biographies:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanlallman/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>Nathan Allman</em></a> | <em>Founder and Chief Executive Officer</em><br>\nNathan previously worked at Goldman Sachs on the Digital Assets team, where he was responsible for the first bond issuance by the European Investment Bank on Ethereum.

OUSG may also temporarily hold shares in BlackRock’s FedFund (TFDXX), bank deposits, and USDC and other stablecoins for liquidity purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>OUSG is available in two versions, an accumulating token (OUSG) and a rebasing token (rOUSG). While both versions pay out yield upon redemption and accrue yield daily, the manner in which the accrual is represented differs.</p>\n<p>For OUSG, the accruing yield gets ‘accumulated’ into the token price. As the underlying investments accrue yield daily, we recognize this yield by increasing the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying Fund, thereby increasing the NAV per OUSG token. We typically update the price once every Business Day, generally at around 6pm ET.</p>\n<p>rOUSG, on the other hand, is intended to maintain a price of $1.00 per token, with the accruing yield represented by the division of rOUSG tokens into more tokens via rebasing. To learn more about the intricacies and mechanics of rOUSG please see a more detailed explanation in our <a href=\"https://docs.ondo.finance/qualified-access-products/ousg/rebasing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">support documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>As an example, let’s say you held 1 OUSG token worth $100 and 100 rOUSG tokens worth $1.00 each. The next day the NAV per OUSG token increased to $101 per token. After the price update and rebasing, your holdings of both rOUSG and OUSG would be worth $101.00 each ($202.00 in total). You would still have a balance of 1 OUSG token worth $101.00. However, due to the rebasing nature of rOUSG tokens, you would now hold 101 rOUSG tokens worth $1.00 per token.</p>\n<p><strong>Two Versions of the OUSG Token:</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/e/ee3e35a6b2774b7deeda4b1cc0e69762e5032ec4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xZAV7JnPnEi8bUrfWbHVJLYI4a8.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/e/ee3e35a6b2774b7deeda4b1cc0e69762e5032ec4_2_690x276.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"xZAV7JnPnEi8bUrfWbHVJLYI4a8\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/e/ee3e35a6b2774b7deeda4b1cc0e69762e5032ec4_2_690x276.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/e/ee3e35a6b2774b7deeda4b1cc0e69762e5032ec4.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/e/ee3e35a6b2774b7deeda4b1cc0e69762e5032ec4.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F1F2F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>More information on OUSG’s yield accrual mechanisms can be found <a href=\"https://docs.ondo.finance/qualified-access-products/ousg/yield#how-is-the-amount-of-yield-determined\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Issuer: Ondo I LP</em></p>\n<p>Ondo I LP is a US-based Delaware limited partnership.

Even in the event of a delay in minting, however, your rights as a OUSG tokenholder and limited partner of the Fund in connection with that minting/subscription request, including the amount of OUSG you receive, are based upon the date we receive your valid subscription request, not the date on which the tokens are minted.

Legal Structure</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is structured using a traditional GP/LP model. Investors become limited partners in the Fund by acquiring OUSG tokens, each of which represents a unitized limited partnership interest in the Fund. The Fund is managed by its General Partner, Ondo I GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Ondo Finance. The Fund’s Investment Manager is Ondo Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Ondo Finance. Proceeds of each purchase of OUSG from the Fund are invested by the Investment Manager into US Treasuries products (as described in Section III.5 above).</p>\n<p>The Fund is further structured as a private fund under Section 3(c)(7) of the 40 Act, which exempts the Fund from registration as an investment company under the 40 Act. Accordingly, OUSG is only available to Qualified Purchasers as defined in the 40 Act. OUSG is offered and sold by the Fund in reliance on Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the 33 Act, which exempts OUSG from the securities registration requirements of the 33 Act. Accordingly, OUSG can only be acquired by verified Accredited Investors as defined in Regulation D. This exemption preempts US state securities laws. Investors also must undergo customer due diligence for anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance purposes, which is administered by the General Partner.</p>\n<p>The Investment Manager is exempt from registration as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. However, the Investment Manager anticipates that it will be required to become a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act in 2025, and will comply with such requirements.</p>\n<p>The Fund, as well as its General Partner and Investment Manager, are organized in and operate from the United States, with their principal places of business in the state of Connecticut. OUSG is marketed primarily via Internet channels from the United States in the English language, and does not target any specific jurisdiction or jurisdictions. OUSG is only sold to and held by global qualifying institutions and high net worth persons who successfully complete the Fund’s customer due diligence process, which screens prospective purchasers for sanctions and anti-money laundering compliance purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>As an issuer of a product that is available in a wide range of jurisdictions, the Fund is mindful of regulatory requirements both in its own jurisdiction and the jurisdictions of its tokenholders.</p>\n<p>In the US, the Fund, its Investment Manager, and the offer and sale of OUSG are structured to comply with exemptions from applicable registration requirements that are enforced by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).</p>\n<p>Globally, the Fund, its affiliates and OUSG rely on exemptions or exclusions from applicable securities or digital asset approval, registration, licensing, permitting and similar requirements. These exemptions and requirements are enforced by various regulatory bodies, including the following regulatory bodies in top non-US jurisdictions for OUSG ownership:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cayman Islands Monetary Authority;</li>\n<li>British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission;</li>\n<li>Securities and Commodities Authority (United Arab Emirates, mainland);</li>\n<li>Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (Dubai, United Arab Emirates, mainland);</li>\n<li>Securities and Futures Commission (Hong Kong);</li>\n<li>Hong Kong Monetary Authority;</li>\n<li>Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Switzerland); and</li>\n<li>Monetary Authority of Singapore.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See Section IV.3 below for further information on these exemptions and exclusions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>In the US, the Fund is structured as a private fund under Section 3(c)(7) of the 40 Act, which exempts it from registration as an investment company with the SEC. OUSG is offered and sold in reliance on Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the 33 Act, which exempts it from the SEC’s securities registration requirements and preempts the applicable registration or qualification requirements of US state securities laws. The Investment Manager is a private fund adviser that is exempt from registration with the SEC as an investment adviser. However, the Investment Manager expects to register with the SEC as an investment adviser in 2025.</p>\n<p>The Fund has filed Form D with the SEC, and an amendment thereto, in connection with its compliance with Rule 506(c) (available <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1957431\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>). The Investment Manager has filed Form ADV with the SEC in connection with its compliance with the exempt reporting adviser requirements of the Advisers Act (available <a href=\"https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/325197\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Globally, the Fund, its affiliates and OUSG rely on exemptions or exclusions from applicable securities or digital asset approval, registration, licensing, permitting and similar requirements. These include exemptions and exclusions for sales to high net worth persons, sophisticated persons or professional investors; sales pursuant to reverse solicitations; cross-border transactions; absence of operations and other activities in the applicable jurisdictions; and combinations thereof.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund operates within a traditional GP/LP structure to maximize bankruptcy remoteness and investor protection. Specifically, it maintains the key, well established and widely recognized indicia of a bankruptcy remote structure listed below. Because a variety of jurisdictions – including jurisdictions where the issuer is organized, jurisdictions where key business decisions are made, and jurisdictions where creditors or other interested parties reside or conduct their business – may assert jurisdiction to enforce creditor rights (with respect to the Fund or any other issuer), it is crucial to adhere to bankruptcy remoteness principles that are widely recognized across jurisdictions. The Fund’s maintenance of these characteristics is intended to prevent voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy filings, to prevent the substantive consolidation of the Fund with another person or entity in the event of the latter’s bankruptcy, and to protect the OUSG holders’ rights in the event of any such bankruptcy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Restrictions on Activities.</em> The Fund only (1) issues OUSG in exchange for investment, (2) invests the proceeds of those investments in the manner set forth in Section III.5 above, and (3) otherwise operates its business in a manner incidental to such issuance and investment.  (While the Fund was originally structured to issue additional assets, it does not do so.)</li>\n<li><em>Limitations on Incurring Indebtedness.</em> The Fund does incur any indebtedness for money borrowed.</li>\n<li><em>Restrictions on Organizational Changes.</em> The Fund’s limited partnership agreement cannot be amended in any manner that adversely affects any OUSG holder without the consent of a majority-in-interest of OUSG holders (excluding OUSG tokens that are subject to a pending redemption)</li>\n<li><em>Operational Separateness.</em> The Fund maintains operational separateness from the General Partner, the Investment Manager, Ondo Finance and other persons and entities in a variety of manners, including conducting business in its own name only; not commingling assets with any other person or entity; maintaining separate books, records, accounts and financial statements from any other person or entity; not acquiring any securities or other interests in its members or creditors; not incurring any guarantee or obligation with respect to any other person’s or entity’s debts; not pledging its assets; not making any loans or advances to the General Partner, the Investment Manager or Ondo Finance; and observing all limited partnership formalities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Holders of OUSG tokens are, by definition, limited partners in the Fund and therefore have statutory rights of limited partners under the Delaware Revised Limited Partnership Act and contractual rights under the Fund’s Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement and the applicable Subscription Documents (available <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h7n7iqe19hqv21c/AABW-YaRPf0TR-5_Uh865Vm8a?e=1&amp;dl=0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>), including limitation of liability.

The Fund expects to qualify for an exemption from being a publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation because 90% or more of its gross income for any taxable income is expected to constitute “qualifying income” for the purposes of Section 7704 of the US Internal Revenue Code, as amended. Accordingly, the Fund does not pay US federal income tax, but instead passes through its profits, losses, deductions and credits to its limited partners.</p>\n<p>The Fund further expects that its non-US investors will be exempt from US federal income tax because the Fund’s principal activity is engaging in investing or trading securities for its own account and the Fund intends to not be a dealer and, therefore, non-US investors in the Fund would be deemed not to be engaged in a US trade or business for US federal income tax purposes.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Fund does not expect to have any US federal withholding tax obligations with respect to its non-US partners’ share of Fund income because, among other things, such income is either foreign source income or qualifies for applicable portfolio interest, interest-related dividend or similar exemptions from such withholding tax obligations.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s US investors are expected to be subject to US federal income tax on their share of Fund income.</p>\n<p>The Fund will deliver applicable US tax forms to its investors consistent with these expectations.</p>\n<p>Note that foreign taxes, or US state and local taxes, may apply to an investor’s share of Fund income depending on the investor’s personal tax circumstances. You should consult with your own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of and risks of acquiring, holding and selling OUSG. We cannot provide assurances regarding those consequences or risks.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99145-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99145-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-7\"></a><strong>V.

Like OUSG, it leverages OpenZeppelin’s RBAC and Transparent Upgradeable Proxy standards and enforces the same transfer restrictions. Users acquire rOUSG by granting OUSG allowance to the rOUSG token contract and invoking <code>rOUSG::wrap(uint256 _OUSGAmount)</code>, which deposits their OUSG into the contract. Conversely, users can convert back to OUSG by calling <code>rOUSG::unwrap(uint256 _rOUSGAmount)</code>, which burns rOUSG and returns the corresponding amount of OUSG. The user’s holdings are tracked through an account-to-shares mapping, which records the proportion of OUSG they own. The rebasing mechanism is observed through the <code>rOUSG::balanceOf(address _account)</code> function, which calculates rOUSG balances by multiplying the user’s <code>shares</code> by the latest OUSG price. Consequently, as the OUSG price rises, rOUSG balances increase proportionally. rOUSG is always valued at one dollar and conversion can be performed by authorized users by visiting <a href=\"https://ondo.finance/ousg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ondo.finance/ousg</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x2826989983e3a66F0622132D019c2Ae173eb6A43\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OUSGInstantManager</a>:</p>\n<p>Users who have completed KYC verification can access the Fund’s platform for instant minting and redemption of OUSG. This process is powered by the OUSGInstantManager contract, which has undergone two independent security audits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Minting</strong>: To mint OUSG, users approve the OUSGInstantManager contract to transfer stablecoins from their account and then call the <code>OUSGInstantManager::mint(uint256 usdcAmountIn)</code> function. This function transfers the user’s stablecoins to the Fund’s account at Coinbase Prime and mints OUSG to the user in return.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Redemption</strong>: For redemption, users approve their OUSG tokens and call <code>OUSGInstantManager::redeem(uint256 ousgAmountIn)</code>. This function burns the OUSG and transfers a portion of the contracts stablecoin holdings back to the user. If the contract lacks sufficient stablecoin holdings to service the redemption, it taps into BUIDL holdings and performs a BUIDL-to-USDC swap to fulfill the redemption request.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To enhance security, instant mints and redemptions are limited by both global and per-user time-based rate limiters. The global rate limiting is intrinsic to the OUSGInstantManager contract, while the per-user based rate limiter contract can be found <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x9b013b4e03b87295a68a19B1A55e3C7DC3c56FFa\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.

Clients, such as the Flux Finance protocol, can use the function <code>KYCRegistry::getKYCStatus(uint256 requirementGroup, address account)</code> to verify whether a specific user is authorized for OUSG transactions.</p>\n<p>Currently, only requirement group 1 applies to OUSG holders, but additional requirement groups can be created in the future for new tokens with distinct compliance needs. The KYCRegistry contract extends the <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/access-control#role-based-access-control\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenZeppelin Role-Based Access Control</a>, enabling different accounts to manage various requirement groups, supporting future security and compliance use cases.</p>\n<p>The General Partner uses a proprietary off-chain system integrated with operational processes to view and manage authorized users. Addresses that have successfully gone through the KYC process are added through the <code>KYCRegistry::addKYCAddresses(uint256 kycRequirementGroup, address[] addresses)</code> function and can be removed via <code>KYCRegistry::removeKYCAddresses(uint256 kycRequirementGroup, address[] addresses)</code>.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s OUSG related smart contracts are secured by an <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/ondofinance/information/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Immunefi bug bounty</a>, with an industry-leading maximum payout of $1,000,000. We also use Gnosis Safe multisigs in combination with a proprietary off-chain management system to enforce signing quorums for all administrative contract calls. Ondo regularly reviews and assesses multisig and other relevant control architectures against best practices and evolving industry standards.</p>\n<p><em>Web Experience: Key Elements</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mint/Redeem UI.</strong> We have developed an easy-to-use web3 native UI that allows investors to easily and instantly mint or redeem, clearly displaying any relevant limits. If a user prefers to not use the instant manager, they may subscribe via bank wire or directly sending USDC to an address provided by our operations team.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs:</strong></p>\n<p>Since inception, Ondo has been committed to meeting the unique needs of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Our <a href=\"https://v1.ondo.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">v1 product</a> suite, designed specifically for DAOs, is a testament to this commitment. With these tools, we have empowered DAOs to govern themselves more effectively, optimize their liquidity, and manage real-world assets (RWAs) onchain in a seamless, transparent manner.</p>\n<p>Ondo Finance developed <a href=\"https://fluxfinance.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Flux Finance</a> (Flux), a DAO-governed special purpose lending protocol facilitating stablecoin loans against tokenized treasuries collateral, including OUSG. Flux is similar to a US Treasuries repo market, in which large institutions effectively lend and borrow overcollateralized against US Treasuries. Flux made a <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip119-onboard-dai-funds-to-the-flux-finance-dai-lending-pool/19885\">proposal</a> to Sky in Feb 2023 that led to continued discussion about Sky’s diversification into tokenized treasuries.</p>\n<p>In addition to Flux, we have integrated deeply into the broader DeFi ecosystem, collaborating with multiple DAOs on treasury management, liquidity solutions, and yield strategies. Most recently, Ondo partnered with the Arbitrum DAO, helping them diversify their treasury into stable assets with minimal volatility and secure yield uncorrelated to crypto markets. Through this collaboration, USDY was awarded the second-largest <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-committee-recommendations/25097\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">allocation</a> of 17% (6M ARB), second only to BlackRock’s BUIDL. We have also submitted applications for <a href=\"https://gov.ethenafoundation.com/t/reserve-fund-ondo-finance-usdy/108\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USDY</a> and <a href=\"https://gov.ethenafoundation.com/t/reserve-fund-ondo-finance-ousg/109\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OUSG</a> for inclusion in Ethena’s Reserve Fund.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Ondo is committed to being a long-term partner for SparkDAO and the Sky ecosystem, providing effective backing for sUSDS and helping establish it as the leading savings instrument onchain. Beyond providing yield, OUSG offers a variety of strategic benefits for SparkDAO and Sky:</p>\n<p><strong>On-and Off-Ramp for USDS:</strong> We will enable subscriptions and redemptions for OUSG against USDS, with liquidity up to $50M per day by the end of 2024. This will be the largest instant redemption facility onchain, providing flexibility and robust liquidity to the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct conversion with BlackRock’s BUIDL:</strong> Through our collaboration with BlackRock, we will facilitate a direct 24/7/365 conversion between OUSG and BUIDL. This seamless integration allows investors in both products to rebalance in real-time, leveraging the strengths of each without market-hour constraints.</p>\n<p><strong>Co-Marketing Campaigns:</strong> We can partner with the Sky ecosystem on co-branded marketing efforts to highlight the synergies between Ondo and Sky and to ignite each of our communities. This could include case studies, social media campaigns, and other educational content to raise awareness.</p>\n<p><strong>Joint Hackathons and Grants:</strong> We can collaborate with Sky on hackathons or developer grants to encourage building on top of USDS, further strengthening the integration between Ondo’s solutions and the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>OUSG is supported as collateral on Flux, enabling investors to use OUSG as collateral for borrowing USDS and other stablecoins. Conversations are ongoing with multiple other DeFi protocols regarding the enablement of OUSG as collateral for other use cases. OUSG is also available across a growing number of blockchains, currently Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Ondo USDY LLC, which is indirectly controlled by Ondo Finance, currently offers <a href=\"https://ondo.finance/usdy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USDY</a>, a quasi-permissionless yieldcoin that is overcollateralized and secured by US Treasuries (and a small amount of US bank demand deposits for liquidity purposes). USDY is similar to real world asset-backed stablecoins, but it passes yield to its holders and offers superior investor protections. Ondo USDY LLC is designed to be bankruptcy remote, and its holders benefit from a security interest in its assets. USDY currently has approximately $400 million in circulating supply. USDY is submitted in a separate application for the Tokenization Grand Prix.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, Ondo Finance will launch <a href=\"https://blog.ondo.finance/introducing-ondo-global-markets/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ondo Global Markets</a> (Ondo GM), a platform that will provide native access to traditional securities and associated exchange liquidity for onchain investors and protocol developers. This includes bringing a range of public securities such as fixed-income products and equities onchain. These other fixed income products and public securities would have different yield characteristics that may suit the evolving needs of the Sky ecosystem. Ondo’s experience in managing onchain securities at scale makes us the ideal partner to help Sky diversify its portfolio, balancing liquidity and yield in both traditional and onchain markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Disclosures:</strong><br>\nOndo I LP, the issuer of OUSG, is not registered as an investment company under the US Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

We have garnered assets of ~$130mn across these products in the 6 months since our launch this year.</li>\n<li>Our infrastructure integrates the complex legal and regulatory aspects of regulated assets to realise the benefits of cost savings, risk reduction and capital efficiency.</li>\n<li>The multi-chain infrastructure vision, enabled by the Libre AppChain, is to provide a fully decentralised hub that enables the management of complex instrument issuance and distribution workflows, logic and data.\n<ul>\n<li>The issued RWAs can then be minted and accessed via Libre DeFi gateway interfaces that are situated on public networks. The Libre Gateway enables onboarded users on public networks to easily subscribe, redeem, transfer and manage regulated RWA tokens directly on the public chains using wallets like Metamask, Phantom and Coinbase Wallet.</li>\n<li>Libre’s vision is to turn the Gateways into decentralised interfaces which will allow any appointed distributors, professional investors and service providers to use the interface for distribution and administration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Gateway interface will connect with public networks through multiple cross-chain messaging services (e.g., LayerZero, CCIP, Wormhole) to enable reliability and redundancy.</li>\n<li>The RWA tokens issued and minted on the public networks via Libre are composable with prevailing standards on the distribution network e.g. ERC20 on EVM chains. This enables Libre RWAs to be used as assets in other decentralised services and pools that allow for external hooks e.g. Uniswap V4, which enables external compliance hooks to be checked before enabling a transfer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Libre’s proposal for the SparkDAO/MakerDAO GRAND PRIX</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are proposing the Libre USD I Money Market fund (Blackrock ICS money market fund) and Societe Generale Smart Cash products for the allocation by the SparkDAO/MakerDAO</li>\n<li>MakerDAO can access these products using fiat or USDC on Day 1, with the goal of also allowing subscriptions and redemptions in DAI</li>\n<li>In addition to cost-efficient Day 1 access to our high quality assets, Libre delivers a strong strategic alignment to the Maker Endgame:\n<ul>\n<li>Both the Libre and Maker models ensure that all operational complexity can be decentralised onto appchains, but also abstracted from the end-user interfaces on the main public networks without impacting liquidity and composability.</li>\n<li>Libre enables its issued RWAs to be used as collateral by whitelisted services, e.g. in collateralised lending pools, DAI issuance vaults or DAI Direct Deposit Modules (D3M).</li>\n<li>Therefore, MakerDAO can enable native issuance of DAI on multiple networks by enabling Libre RWAs issued on a network to be whitelisted as Maker Vault collateral.</li>\n<li>To drive wider adoption and utility of DAI, Libre could also enable the purchasing of new RWAs by users on a new network through the Libre Gateway directly using DAI.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Furthermore, Libre is working on deploying the Libre gateway on Coinbase’s Base network which will allow Libre to bring its tokenized funds into the largest ecosystem of verified users and connected Coinbase infrastructure. Libre envisions that users on Base would then be able to transact with DAI or USDC on Base liquidity pools.</li>\n<li>Libre can facilitate DAI lending to borrowers (e.g. through Morpho Finance) using high quality Libre tokenised funds as collateral. In addition, as part of Maker’s endgame strategy Libre will be proposing to work directly with Maker to establish a D3M for minting DAI on Base, which will enable an on-demand mechanism for issuing DAI on Base.</li>\n<li>This is a multi-phased approach for DAI minting, borrowing and uptake using Libre’s tokenised funds, and it can be replicated on a number of our integrated networks. For example, Libre is executing a similar roadmap to replicate the model on Solana, and working with Kamino finance on the collateralised lending.</li>\n<li>As MakerDAO and Maker Foundation look to expand beyond money markets in the future, Libre can provide a single entry point across other RWA asset classes including top tier private credit funds, hedge funds and crypto-native strategies e.g., exclusive access to market neutral strategy to the Laser Carry Fund from Laser Digital (Nomura’s digital asset subsidiary)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p><em>This content of this document is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any security, fund, crypto-currency token or other investment or the provision or sale of any financial service.

Company description</strong></p>\n<p>Libre is an institutional grade infrastructure for the on-chain issuance and distribution of RWAs, which are minted and managed across multiple public networks (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Aptos, NEAR and BASE among others being added)</p>\n<p><strong>On-Chain Integration Beyond Simple Token Registers:</strong> Libre addresses a common shortcoming in current tokenisation efforts where most asset issuance and distribution processes occur off-chain and the blockchain is only used for basic token ownership registers i.e. to indicate ownership of the issued RWAs. However, Libre’s focus is to fully integrate issuance and distribution workflows on-chain, including complex legal and regulatory checks, to unlock the true benefits of RWA tokenisation – which includes fractionalisation, cost savings, and risk reduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralised Infrastructure with Libre AppChain:</strong> Libre’s multi-chain infrastructure vision, called the Libre AppChain, is to provide a fully decentralised hub that enables the management of complex instrument issuance and distribution workflows, logic and data. The issued RWAs can then be minted and accessed via Libre DeFi gateway interfaces that are situated on public networks. All the associated complex logic and data can be managed on the Libre AppChain to minimise gas cost, operational complexity and other risks.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

They will have full visibility on each stage of the transaction journey (Create, Confirm, Sign, Approve, Fund, Settle).</li>\n<li>A transaction is first Created by inputting the subscription/redemption amount.</li>\n<li>Once reviewed and Confirmed, a DocuSign subscription/redemption document will be sent automatically by the Libre Platform via DocuSign for Signing.\n<ul>\n<li>For subscription orders, the investor needs to fund the transaction by arranging for the subscription monies to be paid into Libre’s sub-fund account/wallet (details provided in subscription document).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Fund admin will review the subscription/redemption order and process the transaction</li>\n<li>The investor will be issued a subscription/redemption contract note via email and will also be able to see their updated shareholding on the ‘Holdings’ screen of the Libre platform and public mainnet blockexplorer.\n<ul>\n<li>For redemption orders, the investor will receive redemption proceeds into their bank account/wallet (details provided in onboarding document).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>On a daily basis, an investor will receive NAV statements from the Fund Admin via email and can view the updated NAV values on the Holdings screen.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Transaction Flow Overview - USDC Based</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/6/964e0107494c293c8ae9cf25ba6e7a98ef1d4541.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lrEK5DYp96NwF5z0PptsMUm4hIl.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/6/964e0107494c293c8ae9cf25ba6e7a98ef1d4541_2_602x339.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"lrEK5DYp96NwF5z0PptsMUm4hIl\" width=\"602\" height=\"339\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/6/964e0107494c293c8ae9cf25ba6e7a98ef1d4541_2_602x339.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/6/964e0107494c293c8ae9cf25ba6e7a98ef1d4541_2_903x508.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/6/964e0107494c293c8ae9cf25ba6e7a98ef1d4541_2_1204x678.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEDED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Transaction Flow Overview - USD Based</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/6/06d8332c403b54d58b79082b609dbd365814718d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/Yy4oLzrild9JYQvHVhzdkrp79r.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/6/06d8332c403b54d58b79082b609dbd365814718d_2_602x339.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"Yy4oLzrild9JYQvHVhzdkrp79r\" width=\"602\" height=\"339\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/6/06d8332c403b54d58b79082b609dbd365814718d_2_602x339.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/6/06d8332c403b54d58b79082b609dbd365814718d_2_903x508.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/6/06d8332c403b54d58b79082b609dbd365814718d_2_1204x678.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDEDEE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Gateway Connectivity</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/0/00f2823e47cfe45e181f1c791a75bdd5cf6007d4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8nzvbjlYkmduudOA9cjtPV9oMI.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/0/00f2823e47cfe45e181f1c791a75bdd5cf6007d4_2_690x346.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"8nzvbjlYkmduudOA9cjtPV9oMI\" width=\"690\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/0/00f2823e47cfe45e181f1c791a75bdd5cf6007d4_2_690x346.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/0/00f2823e47cfe45e181f1c791a75bdd5cf6007d4_2_1035x519.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/0/00f2823e47cfe45e181f1c791a75bdd5cf6007d4.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DDE0E2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>15. Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p>Libre is in discussions with partners to facilitate 24/7 stablecoin liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>16. With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently fiat and USDC.</li>\n<li>In addition, Libre could create a DAI-denominated share class so that any of the assets available on the Libre platform could be subscribed for or redeemed in DAI directly (besides fiat and USDC).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>As noted above, the Libre Appchain is being designed to abstract tokenised RWA workflows, logic and data complexity from public networks.</li>\n<li>This includes instrument legal logic, such as dealing periods, gates, fees, etc; and distribution regulatory flags, which includes investor types, jurisdictions, whitelists, etc.</li>\n<li>Thus, all subscription, redemption and transfer workflows can be setup and managed fully on the Libre AppChain in a decentralised manner with minimal off-chain dependencies apart from the final underlying asset investment.</li>\n<li>All these end-user RWA services can be accessible through simple public chain interfaces and the issued tokens are minted on the user’s relevant public network, i.e. all issued RWA assets and payments are managed on the public networks through the Libre Gateways.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Libre SAF VCC is an umbrella feeder fund structure in Singapore, under the provisions of the VCC Act.</li>\n<li>Vulpes Investment Management Private Limited is the appointed Fund Manager (regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore) and NAV Fund Services (Singapore) Limited is the Fund Administrator.</li>\n<li>The Libre SAF VCC feeder fund has a private placement memorandum and each sub-fund has a separate appendix that provides full details of the underlying fund into which that sub-fund invests.</li>\n<li>The share register for each sub-fund is kept on-chain and investors directly own shares in the underlying sub-fund, with PII held off-chain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Vulpes Investment Management Private Limited is the appointed Fund Manager, regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Vulpes Investment Management Private Limited is the holder of a capital markets services licence for the regulated activity of “fund management” under the SFA.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the bankruptcy remoteness position of a Singapore VCC sub-fund?\n<ul>\n<li>A VCC sub-fund will be wound up singly and separately from the other sub-funds as if it were a separate legal entity. This ensures that the ring-fencing of each sub-fund’s assets and liabilities applies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How does this apply with respect to other jurisdictions/where the sub-funds invests in assets outside of Singapore?\n<ul>\n<li>Some legal commentators have noted that there is a risk that the laws of other jurisdictions may not recognise the ring fencing of sub-funds. Therefore the advice is that VCCs should take this into account and structure their investments accordingly.</li>\n<li>As regards the ring fencing of sub-funds, MAS has noted that it will require the directors and the fund manager of a VCC consisting of authorised scheme(s) to take reasonable measures to mitigate cross-cell contagion risks when investing in assets located in another jurisdiction. The measures which would be considered reasonable will depend on the facts and circumstances in each case.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What steps has Libre taken to mitigate or provide for these risks?\n<ul>\n<li>The PPM for Libre details under the ‘Structure’ section that:\n<ul>\n<li>‘As a matter of Singapore law, under Section 29 of the VCC Act: (a) Fund Assets of a particular Fund shall not be used to discharge any Fund Liability of any other Fund or Fund Liabilities, including in the winding up of such other Fund or the Company; and (b) Fund Liabilities of a particular Fund shall only be discharged solely out of the Fund Assets of such Fund, including in the winding up of such Fund. However, investors should note that there is a risk that Section 29 of the VCC Act may not be applied in legal or other proceedings before a court or other tribunal of a foreign country. The Company will establish a separate account for each Fund and each Class of Shares comprised in each Fund.’</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Libre SAF VCC has also operationally segregated each of the sub-funds with their own separate bank accounts with ANZ Bank and custody accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>An investor owning a token is listed in the Register of Members as the holder of such Shares.</li>\n<li>Any issuance or redemption of a Share will be effected pursuant to a subscription or redemption request processed by the Fund’s administrator on behalf of the Fund, and subsequently recorded in the Register by updating, issuing or destroying the Tokens (or data recorded in the Tokens) accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>None</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>Investors should consult their professional advisers on the possible tax and other consequences of their subscribing for, purchasing, holding, selling or redeeming shares under the laws of their country of incorporation, establishment, citizenship, residence or domicile.</p>\n<p><strong>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark</strong></p>\n<p>The performance of the underlying Blackrock money market fund is in line with its current comparator benchmark, SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate).</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p>Performance reports are provided on a daily basis by the fund administrator.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product</strong></p>\n<p>Ernst &amp; Young LLP has been appointed as the Auditor for the Fund and will conduct their audits in accordance with IFRS.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Decentralised Infrastructure with Libre AppChain:</strong> Libre’s multi-chain infrastructure vision, called the Libre AppChain, is to provide a fully decentralised hub that enables the management of complex instrument issuance and distribution workflows, logic and data. The issued RWAs can then be minted and accessed via Libre DeFi gateway interfaces that are situated on public networks. All the associated complex logic and data can be managed on the Libre AppChain to minimise gas cost, operational complexity and other risks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cross-chain Communication with the Libre AppChain:</strong> The Libre AppChain’s strategic focus is on establishing cross-chain connections to public networks with multiple messaging services. LayerZero is the first such service to be integrated, with other messaging services, such as CCIP and Wormhole, being integrated over the next year. This multi messaging service model will provide a more resilient and fault tolerant cross chain communication capability, which is closely aligned with Libre’s vision of making the Libre AppChain a fully decentralised issuance and distribution infrastructure for regulated assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Institutional DeFi Interfaces:</strong> The Libre Gateway enables onboarded users on public networks to easily subscribe, redeem, transfer and manage regulated RWA tokens directly on the public chains using metamask and other wallets e.g. Phantom on Solana. Libre’s vision is to work towards the Libre Gateways becoming completely decentralised interfaces: a service similar to those existing in the DeFi space but with compliance hooks and execution logic/data being decoupled and operating on the Libre AppChain. The end result is that the onboarding of users to use the Libre Gateway interfaces can be done by any distributor or service provider appointed to perform such administrative services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Composable RWAs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All Libre fund units are issued as standard fungible tokens on various public networks. For example, if an asset is issued on the Ethereum mainnet, the ERC20 standard is used, which enables the tokens to be composable with other services.</li>\n<li>For example, once Libre onboards the Maker Foundation it will be possible to whitelist a Vault and use the issued fund units as collateral on the Maker protocol to mint new DAI.</li>\n<li>In addition, Libre could create a DAI-denominated share class so that any of the above assets could be subscribed or redeemed in DAI directly (as well as in fiat and USDC).</li>\n<li>Furthermore, Libre is working on deploying the Libre gateway on Coinbase’s Base network. Which will allow Libre to bring its tokenized funds into the largest ecosystem of verified users and connected Coinbase Infrastructure.</li>\n<li>The Base user network allows for seamless transaction flow between Coinbase Custody, PrimeWeb3 wallets, and on-chain wallets, which can be important for the Maker ecosystem Protocol Management.</li>\n<li>Libre envisions that users on Base would then be able to transact with DAI or USDC on Base liquidity pools.</li>\n<li>Libre’s focus is then to enable its tokenized funds to be composable on collateralised lending Pools, such as Morpho Markets, which will bring instant liquidity to Maker.</li>\n<li>In addition to using liquidity pools, where DAI can be lent to borrowers using high quality Libre tokenised funds as collateral, as part of Maker’s endgame strategy Libre will be proposing to work directly with Maker to establish a DAI Direct Deposit Modules (D3M) for minting DAI on Base, which will enable an on-demand mechanism for issuing DAI on Base using high quality Libre tokenised funds.</li>\n<li>This is a multi-phased plan for DAI minting and borrowing using Libre’s tokenised funds, and it can be replicated on a number of networks. For example, Libre is executing a similar roadmap to replicate the model on Solana, and working with Kamino finance on the collateralised lending.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>Audits performed by Nethermind (Dec 2023) and Cybaverse (June 2024).</p>\n<p><strong>VI. Sky Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with Sky and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>The leadership and technology teams have deep experience working with multiple DAOs, including the Maker foundation, throughout their careers. This includes advising DAOs on strategy, governance and RWA initiatives.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or Sky ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Libre AppChain and Maker Endgame Strategic Alignment:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Libre AppChain vision is fully aligned with the Maker Endgame strategy; i.e. both the Libre and Maker models ensure that all operational complexity can be decentralised, but also abstracted from the end-user interfaces on the main public networks without impacting liquidity and composability.</li>\n<li>Akin to the Maker Endgame strategy, which is focused on minting DAI and governing the ecosystem, the Libre AppChain vision ensures Libre will easily be able to add new public networks and enable any investor or issuer on a specific network to be able to connect to the Libre Gateway to invest or issue through the Libre protocol running on the Libre AppChain.</li>\n<li>This means that whenever Maker wishes to enable DAI to be natively issued on a specific public network, Libre could also enable RWA assets to be accessible on that network, which can be whitelisted to be used as Maker Vault collateral. In this fashion, Libre-issued RWAs can be used seamlessly to mint new DAI natively on any network and bootstrap the DAI ecosystem onto such new network.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, Libre could also enable the purchasing of new RWA tokens through the Libre Gateway to be denominated in DAI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bootstrapping New DAI Ecosystems - Aligned Vision:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whilst Libre users can initially use fiat payments to purchase and mint new RWA assets through a Libre Gateway on a public network, the issued RWAs can then be used to mint new DAI on such network through the Maker AppChain interface.</li>\n<li>This feature would ensure that users on a public network could purchase RWA assets using Libre and benefit from the returns on those assets whilst simultaneously opening a Maker vault within which to lock such RWA assets and mint DAI. These combined elements would enable users to receive immediate liquidity whilst permitting them to benefit from the returns on blue chip RWA assets.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, since Libre would enable any new subscriptions, redemptions, and transfers to be denominated in DAI, the newly minted DAI could also be used to purchase more RWAs or otherwise reinvest the DAI-denominated proceeds.</li>\n<li>This model of enabling Libre RWAs to be used as collateral on Maker as well as enabling payment for RWAs in DAI enables a strong alignment between the two protocols, and would drive a maximally optimal model to increase supply of both DAI and Libre RWAs across multiple public networks.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the ability to bootstrap new multichain ecosystems is also maximised due to the strong legal, regulatory, and operational risk management and compliance heritage that Libre brings to the table.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Execution Roadmap for Day One Strategy:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whilst the Libre AppChain vision is fully aligned with the longer term Maker Endgame strategy, Libre already has a strong foundation to kickstart the relationship with: (a) AUM across multiple networks already in excess of USD 100 million after only 4 months since going “live”; and (b) a range of private market RWAs from top issuers already in place.</li>\n<li>Libre can work with Maker on a Day One strategy, to provide access to top money market, private credit, hedge fund, and other tokenised RWA assets on Ethereum mainnet, and enable these assets to be used as collateral in a Maker vault to mint new DAI.</li>\n<li>Also, Libre could introduce a new DAI-denominated share class that would enable subscriptions and redemptions to be made directly in DAI on the Ethereum mainnet.</li>\n<li>As DAI can be bridged to other networks, over time, Libre can also enable bridged DAI to be used to mint RWAs on other public networks.</li>\n<li>The aforementioned aspects can take place on Day One and, as Maker evolves towards the AppChain and multi-chain model, Libre can start operating under the aforementioned Aligned Vision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blockchains - Ethereum, Base, Solana, Near, Aptos, Polygon, Injective, Mantra and Plume.</li>\n<li>Wallets - Metamask, Phantom, Coinbase Wallet.</li>\n<li>Custody - Komainu and Coinbase Custody</li>\n<li>DeFi - TBA</li>\n<li>3rd party Distribution Platforms - TBA (launch of open infrastructure access model)</li>\n<li>Exchanges - TBA</li>\n<li>Market Makers - TBA</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong> Yes, Libre’s key advantage is the ability to offer products from multiple high quality issuers based on MakerDAO/Sky and other customers needs. This is a key diversification benefit against concentration risks with a single traditional finance institution. Libre has already launched leading alternatives such as hedge funds and private credit funds e.g., Hamilton Lane’s SCOPE Senior Credit Opportunities fund. Libre is also exclusively launching the tokenised market-neutral crypto native strategy Laser Carry Fund (LCF) from Nomura’s subsidiary Laser Digital.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenisation-grand-prix-application-libre/25213\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenisation-grand-prix-application-libre/25213","pubDate":"Sat, 21 Sep 2024 03:54:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25213"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenisation-grand-prix-application-libre/25213.rss","#text":"Tokenisation Grand Prix Application - Libre"}},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Fasanara Money Market Fund (FAST)*","dc:creator":"matthewfasanara","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<p><strong>For SparkDAO and/or Sky in response to the Spark Tokenization Grand Prix as an Accredited Investor within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 / Investment Professional within the meaning of Article 19 of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 only.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Introducing Project FAST</strong></p>\n<p>Project FAST draws its name from a blend of Fasanara’s forward-thinking ethos and the demands of the digital age.

Product Summary</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Project Name:</strong> <strong>FAST</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Product Name:</strong> Fasanara Money Market Fund (“<strong>FAST</strong>”)</p>\n<p><strong>3. Product Type / Underlying Asset:</strong> FAST provides holders a tokenized representation of this ownership in the Fasanara Money Market Fund (the “<strong>Fund</strong>”), providing utility and US dollar yields to permissioned investors. The Fund is managed by Fasanara Capital Ltd (“<strong>Fasanara</strong>”) as the Investment Manager and is operating in partnership with Apex Group, global, top-tier independent service provider, servicing nearly $3trn in assets and Tokeny, a leading onchain finance operating system. Trusted globally, Tokeny has successfully executed over 120 use cases across five continents and facilitated 3 billion onchain transactions and operations.</p>\n<p>The representation of ownership will be minted on Polygon, a design chosen to reduce protocol specific risks. The preference for EVM Layer 2s was to ensure investors are not covering high gas fees or unable to transact efficiently given the congestion events that are hinder transaction speeds in the dominant Layer 1s.</p>\n<p>Unlike other tokenized Money Market Funds in the market, which are often tied to a single marketplace or distributor, or even an omnibus wallet, the Fund issues its tokenized Money Market Fund through its own blockchain-based platform. This platform is powered by Tokeny and operated by Apex Group. This strategic approach eliminates the constraints of a single distribution channel, offering unparalleled flexibility and reach across multiple marketplaces and platforms, all directly connected to the same onchain assets.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

With an extensive track record, world-class operations, and a growing footprint, Fasanara has established itself as a dominant force in the market for several key reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global Market Champion in Digital Yield</strong>: Fasanara is recognized for its leadership in generating digital yield through fintech platforms. It boasts a remarkable length and quality of track record, combined with large-scale operations, placing it at the forefront of the fintech revolution in the digital lending and alternative income space.</li>\n<li><strong>Unrivaled Fintech Network</strong>: Over the years, Fasanara has cultivated a global network of fintech originators specializing in real-world assets (RWA). This decentralized network is the largest of its kind, encompassing 141 fintech platform originators across 60 countries. With a collective workforce of more than 10,000 professionals, this network is continuously sourcing loans and receivables, making Fasanara a pivotal player in global financial markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Massive Transaction Volume</strong>: Fasanara’s scale is underscored by its impressive transaction history, having facilitated close to $85 billion in loans to corporations and individuals over the past 13 years. As growth accelerates, transaction volumes are projected to surpass $150 billion in the next two years, reinforcing the firm’s ability to handle large-scale lending operations effectively.</li>\n<li><strong>Proven Track Record in Alternative Income</strong>: Fasanara’s flagship alternative income strategy in digital lending has demonstrated a decade-long history of strong performance, with no months of negative returns. This resilience and consistency in performance distinguish it as a stable and reliable investment vehicle, making it a standout in the alternative income space.</li>\n<li><strong>Investment Grade Ratings</strong>: Fasanara’s alternative income strategy is highly regarded by leading rating agencies. It holds an investment-grade rating from two respected agencies—achieving a Single-A rating from a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) approved agency in Europe and a BBB rating from one of the top 10 SEC-approved agencies in the United States. These ratings are a testament to the firm’s sound risk management and high-quality performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Pioneering Crypto Market Making</strong>: In addition to its expertise in digital lending, Fasanara is also a significant player in the global cryptocurrency market,  set up in 2018. It operates one of the largest and oldest high-frequency trading (HFT) operations in the crypto space, serving as a top liquidity provider to major exchanges worldwide. Within 2024 alone, the firm had already transacted over $140 billion in crypto market volumes, highlighting its expertise and influence in this emerging asset class.</li>\n<li><strong>Innovative Approach to Tokenized Assets</strong>: Fasanara is committed to the future of finance through tokenization. Over the past year, the firm successfully developed tokenized assets twice, both of which were fully funded by external investors. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is central to Fasanara’s vision, allowing it to unlock new value streams from its vast global fintech ecosystem and push the boundaries of modern financial innovation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By combining a pioneering spirit with a proven track record, Fasanara continues to lead the way in digital yield, fintech-originated assets, and innovative financial technologies.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Vision and Purpose</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fasanara envisions a future where blockchain technology can play a transformative role in the financial ecosystem by providing additional liquidity and tradability to Real World Assets (RWA).</strong> This vision aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the rapidly evolving digital economy, creating tangible benefits for the <em>Real Economy</em>—the sector of the economy that deals with the production and exchange of goods and services, rather than speculative financial markets.</p>\n<p><strong>Blockchain for Real World Assets (RWA)</strong>: Fasanara believes that blockchain technology can unlock new liquidity streams for real-world assets such as loans, receivables, real estate, and other physical or financial assets. By tokenizing these assets, Fasanara envisions a future where they become more easily tradeable and accessible to a wider pool of investors. This process of tokenization allows for fractional ownership and easier transferability, enhancing liquidity in markets that are traditionally illiquid. This, in turn, can lead to more efficient capital allocation, benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), individual borrowers, and the broader real economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Supporting the Real Economy</strong>: At the heart of Fasanara’s vision is the desire to support the real economy, particularly at a time when traditional commercial banks are increasingly neglecting the mid-market segment. Banks are often focused on servicing large, mainstream clients, which leaves SMEs and individuals underserved. This has led to a well-documented <em>funding gap</em>, where smaller businesses and individuals struggle to access the financial resources they need to grow or maintain operations.</p>\n<p>Fasanara’s approach directly addresses this funding gap by leveraging technology and fintech platforms to source loans and receivables, providing much-needed liquidity to those left behind by conventional banking. The use of blockchain technology in this context is crucial: it not only democratizes access to capital but also ensures that liquidity can flow to areas where it is needed most, supporting economic growth at the grassroots level.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating Purpose for Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</strong>: Fasanara’s focus on the tokenization of RWAs also speaks to a broader purpose for blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Rather than existing solely for speculative trading or niche applications, blockchain can serve a more meaningful role by directly contributing to the real economy. By embedding blockchain into the fabric of real-world financial operations, Fasanara aims to give blockchain technology the finality and utility it needs for long-term sustainability. This purposeful use of blockchain creates value by providing real-world applications, ensuring that the technology has a lasting impact beyond its initial hype.</p>\n<p><strong>Dedication to Purposeful Investments</strong>: Fasanara is deeply committed to purposeful investments that align technology with the needs of the real economy. By using blockchain to facilitate liquidity and tradeability, Fasanara enables investments that have real-world impact. This is particularly important at a time when commercial banks are increasingly turning away from the mid-market segment, leaving many SMEs and individuals without access to the financial support they need. Fasanara’s approach not only fills this gap but does so in a way that is sustainable and scalable through the use of innovative technologies.</p>\n<p>In summary, Fasanara’s vision is about harnessing the potential of blockchain to enhance liquidity for real-world assets, thereby supporting SMEs, individuals, and the broader real economy. By focusing on purposeful investments and providing liquidity where it is most needed, Fasanara is addressing the challenges posed by the traditional banking sector’s retreat from the mid-market. At the same time, this approach gives blockchain and cryptocurrencies a meaningful role in the global financial system, ensuring their long-term relevance and sustainability.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Years in Operation:</strong> ~13 years</p>\n<p><strong>III. Product Information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>FAST</strong> offers qualified, onboarded investors the opportunity to gain exposure to a diversified money market portfolio managed by <strong>Fasanara</strong>. The product is designed to provide stability, liquidity, and yield through a carefully constructed investment strategy focused on short-term, high-quality assets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TBills Portfolio</strong>: The primary investment focus is on <strong>0-3 month U.S. Treasury Bills</strong>, with the objective of replicating the performance of international benchmarks such as the <strong>U.S. Treasury Bill 3-Month Index</strong>. These Treasury Bills are selected to provide a highly secure, low-risk foundation for the portfolio.</li>\n<li><strong>Money Market/Liquidity Fund Allocation</strong>: Complementing the Treasury Bill holdings, the portfolio also allocates funds to high-quality liquidity products, including the <strong>Goldman Sachs US$ Liquid Reserves Fund</strong>. This fund brings additional diversification, offering a combination of stable performance and immediate liquidity through investments in low-risk, short-term instruments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FAST is designed to deliver the <strong>liquidity and stability</strong> of U.S. Treasury Bills, alongside the <strong>proven performance</strong> of a leading money market fund. The entire portfolio is managed by a regulated asset manager with a strong track record of consistently generating digital yield.</li>\n<li>Investors benefit from a <strong>stable token</strong> that maintains a daily par value of 1, while earning U.S. Treasury yields.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Subscription and Investment Process</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After passing AML and KYC requirements, investors can subscribe to the fund using <strong>fiat currency</strong> or a wide range of liquid <strong>digital assets</strong>, which are subject to thorough provenance checks. Importantly, no digital assets are held directly in the feeder fund, ensuring investors avoid conversion costs and benefit from a streamlined investment process.</li>\n<li>By keeping digital assets separate from the core fund, <strong>FAST</strong> complies with regulatory requirements, making it suitable for use in regulated institutions such as banks and insurance companies. Financial institutions, which may be restricted from holding digital instruments, can benefit from this <strong>compliant, permissioned, and stable digital asset</strong> structure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, FAST offers a secure, flexible, and compliant investment vehicle that delivers reliable U.S. Treasury yields in a stable, tokenized form suitable for use by regulated financial entities.</p>\n<p>FAST is also working with Credio Network – a risk rating and monitoring services provider - in the following 3 areas:</p>\n<p><strong>Token rating</strong>: Credio is facilitating a token rating of FAST by a global credit rating agency or a community of data scientists in a transparent and decentralized manner through on-chain competition.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-time update and integrated risk management</strong>: Through Credio, FAST will receive real-time updates i.e. whenever rating changes due to changes in default probabilities. The NAV calculation module can be automatically updated, refreshing its valuation on a FAST holder’s balance sheet.</p>\n<p><strong>Proof of reserve</strong>: Credio Proofs enable real-time transparency of the reserves backing a tokenized or wrapped asset like FAST that is collateralized by reserves that exist off-chain.</p>\n<p>See below the Credio Architecture:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/4/34971cf3a4401985156a9aea885842f46ed605bd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7veAny1aiwh5sIEtDLnX4mIEa1n.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-09-21 040124\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/4/34971cf3a4401985156a9aea885842f46ed605bd_2_689x360.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-21 040124\" data-base62-sha1=\"7veAny1aiwh5sIEtDLnX4mIEa1n\" width=\"689\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/4/34971cf3a4401985156a9aea885842f46ed605bd_2_689x360.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/4/34971cf3a4401985156a9aea885842f46ed605bd_2_1033x540.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/4/34971cf3a4401985156a9aea885842f46ed605bd.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"252726\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset:</strong></p>\n<p>Our tokenized money market fund offers a balanced approach to stability and liquidity through a carefully curated portfolio of U.S. Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and investments within selected Liquidity Funds including Goldman Sachs US$ Liquid Reserves Fund. By focusing on T-Bills with maturities ranging from 0 to 3 months, we aim to minimize market volatility exposure while maintaining high liquidity. Alongside the T-Bills, Fasanara’s expertise in generating digital yield through FinTech-originated assets, Fasanara will invest in Liquidity Funds that have been selected based on criteria including, without limitation; Safety and Credit Risk; Liquidity; Redemption Features; Yield; Interest Rate Environment: Net Yield vs. Gross Yield: Expense Ratio; Management Fees and Other Costs: Tax Considerations and Fund Performance History and Duration and Weighted Average Maturity (WAM). With a 13-year track record in sourcing real-world assets (RWAs) like loans and receivables from a vast global network of 141 FinTech platforms across 60 countries, Fasanara has significant asset management experience to manage FAST.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>The yield generated from the underlying portfolio of T-Bills and investment in US$ Liquidity Funds is transferred to token holders through a daily price accrual mechanism. This process ensures that the earned interest is directly reflected in the value of the tokens, providing a seamless and efficient method for investors to benefit from the fund’s performance.</p>\n<p>Key aspects of our yield transfer mechanism include:</p>\n<p><strong>Daily NAV Calculation</strong>: The fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV) is calculated daily, based on NYSE business days. This NAV includes the market value of US T-bills, reverse repos, investments in Liquidity Funds and any cash holdings.</p>\n<p><strong>Immediate Yield Accrual</strong>: Token holders begin to receive dividends on the day after the fund receives their investment, provided it’s received in good order prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time or the regularly scheduled close of the NYSE, whichever is earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Distribution Options</strong>: Dividends from net investment income are declared and distributed daily. Token holders have the option to reinvest these dividends or receive them directly to their account in the form of additional tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Continuous Portfolio Alignment</strong>: As bonds in the portfolio reach maturity, the funds are seamlessly reinvested in accordance with the fund’s mandate, ensuring ongoing alignment with the investment strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Transparent Valuation</strong>: The daily price accrual ensures that the token price consistently reflects the value of the respective fraction of the underlying T-Bill portfolio, including all cumulative interest earned.</p>\n<p>This approach to yield transfer combines the benefits of daily accrual, flexible distribution options, and transparent valuation, aligning with the fund’s goals of liquidity, efficiency, and low-risk yield generation.</p>\n<p>The Fund declares a dividend equal to the amount of interest for that day, ensuring that the fund retains all assets in yield bearing instruments. All wallet holders are minted their fractional share of the interest into wallets that permit transferability at the end of the month. This is to mirror the standard practice in money market funds, where the accrued interest is paid and realized into the fund at the end of each month. Locking the accrued tokens is a protection mechanism to all investors. If a large investor were to redeem and take their accrued interest before the fund realized it, remaining investors would be left with a ‘receivable’ that is not interest bearing.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

Redemptions made after 2:00 pm ET are processed by 11:00 am ET the next day.</p>\n<p>The Fund has not had any interruptions in the ability to process redemptions and subscriptions. The product has been rigorously tested and no issues or interruptions have been identified.</p>\n<p><strong>14. Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>Subscriptions</p>\n<p>To invest in the Fund, investors must complete the application form provided with the subscription documents and submit supporting materials through the TOCAN platform managed by the Administrator. After the application and due diligence are approved, investors can access their Investment Portal, powered by Tokeny SARL, to manage transactions such as subscriptions, redemptions, switches, and transfers. Tokens, representing ownership in the relevant share class, are issued via the Polygon blockchain, and ownership is recorded on the DLT Register (share register), maintained in accordance with Cayman Islands law. The DLT serves as the authoritative record of ownership and prevails in case of discrepancies with blockchain records.</p>\n<p>Subscription acceptance requires the Administrator to receive a properly completed Application Form and supporting documentation. Once approved, investors can fund their investment by crediting the Portfolio’s subscription account. Funds must be received by 12:00 pm EST on a Business Day to be processed on the next Subscription Dealing Day, with late funds processed on the following Business Day. All token transactions, including subscriptions and redemptions, will be conducted through the Investment Portal.</p>\n<p>Verification of Identity</p>\n<p>The Administrator shall perform customarily KYC and anti-money laundering checks (including sanctions screening) as part of the investor onboarding process.</p>\n<p>Payment for Shares</p>\n<p>Payment for tokens must be made in USD, covering any fees or charges, and must be wired to the Fund’s bank account by 12:00 pm EST on the Business Day before the Subscription Dealing Day. The transfer details should be communicated to the Administrator, and payments must come from an account in the subscriber’s name (or from an XBTO account for digital asset subscribers).</p>\n<p>The Administrator will maintain a digital ledger with the names and addresses of shareholders, which serves as conclusive proof of ownership. Share certificates will not be issued, and tokens will be recorded to six decimal places.</p>\n<p>Subscriptions using Digital Assets</p>\n<p>To subscribe for tokens in the Fund using stablecoins or other digital assets, you must have an XBTO Wallet, which will be set up by XBTO upon confirmation in the subscription documents. XBTO will provide instructions for completing the subscription using digital assets.</p>\n<p>Digital assets will be converted into USD at the current exchange rate, subject to fees, and the USD proceeds must be wired to the Fund’s bank account. The subscription is complete once the Fund receives the USD funds and all other requirements are met. XBTO’s digital asset services are subject to its terms and may be discontinued without notice.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/d/ed6c881ee155fcf6ca79071a4ab785d18563f96d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xSlGH7oV6cupJQVpAVw9qjtrj2d.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-09-21 040013\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/d/ed6c881ee155fcf6ca79071a4ab785d18563f96d_2_690x359.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-21 040013\" data-base62-sha1=\"xSlGH7oV6cupJQVpAVw9qjtrj2d\" width=\"690\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/d/ed6c881ee155fcf6ca79071a4ab785d18563f96d_2_690x359.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/d/ed6c881ee155fcf6ca79071a4ab785d18563f96d_2_1035x538.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/d/ed6c881ee155fcf6ca79071a4ab785d18563f96d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F2F4\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/a/9a8719263d974d62dc9a7e6580c009574131df90.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/m30YzWBe71U1YQNZLJi8eEmXANq.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-09-21 040036\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/a/9a8719263d974d62dc9a7e6580c009574131df90_2_690x257.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-21 040036\" data-base62-sha1=\"m30YzWBe71U1YQNZLJi8eEmXANq\" width=\"690\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/a/9a8719263d974d62dc9a7e6580c009574131df90_2_690x257.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/a/9a8719263d974d62dc9a7e6580c009574131df90.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/a/9a8719263d974d62dc9a7e6580c009574131df90.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EFF0F2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Redemptions</p>\n<p>Shareholders may request the redemption of their Shares or Master Fund Shares on any Redemption Dealing Day, provided written notice is received by the Administrator.

Liquid digital assets such as BTC, ETH and other liquid assets are also accepted. The process for subscription in digital assets requires a number of additional checks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The assets must be moved to a regulated custodian, XBTO account, where the assets are provenance checked. All investors are granted an XBTO account on passing AML with APEX for investment into the Fund.</li>\n<li>The investor will indicate the amount and token they are investing with.

Technological and operational development will be a constant by Apex.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund comprises a single-legged master feeder structure domiciled in Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p>Feeder fund: Fasanara Money Market Fund (Feeder) SPC (the “<strong>Feeder Fund</strong>”) is an exempted company incorporated with limited liability and unlimited duration under the laws of the Cayman Islands on 19 September 2024 and registered as a segregated portfolio company under registered number 413981.</p>\n<p>As a segregated portfolio company, the Feeder Fund is permitted to create one or more feeder fund portfolios in order to segregate the assets and liabilities of the Feeder Fund held within or on behalf of a feeder fund portfolio from the assets and liabilities held within or on behalf of any other feeder fund portfolio.</p>\n<p>Each feeder fund portfolio will be created in relation to a corresponding master fund portfolio and each class of shares within a feeder fund portfolio will be created in relation to a corresponding class of master fund shares within the corresponding master fund portfolio. All of the assets of each class and/or series of shares within each feeder fund portfolio (save for general assets, incidental cash or cash equivalent balances) will be invested in the corresponding class and/or series of master fund shares within the corresponding master fund portfolio. Accordingly, investment management of each feeder fund portfolio’s assets takes place at the level of the corresponding master fund portfolio.</p>\n<p>Master fund: Fasanara Money Market Fund SPC (the “<strong>Master Fund</strong>”, and together with the Feeder Fund, the “<strong>Fund</strong>”) is an exempted company incorporated with limited liability and unlimited duration under the laws of the Cayman Islands on 19 September 2024 and registered as a segregated portfolio company under registered number 413984. As a segregated portfolio company, the Master Fund is permitted to create one or more master fund portfolios in order to segregate the assets and liabilities of the Master Fund held within or on behalf of a master fund portfolio from the assets and liabilities held within or on behalf of any other master fund portfolio.</p>\n<p>As set out above, it is expected that each Class and/or Series of Shares within each feeder fund portfolio will invest in the corresponding class and/or series of master fund shares in the corresponding master fund portfolio.</p>\n<p>Master Fund Shares will also be available for subscription by U.S. Taxpayer investors (other than U.S. tax-exempt investors) who are eligible investors at the discretion of the Investment Manager.</p>\n<p>FAST will be the first master-feeder segregated portfolio of the Fund that will pursue exclusively a money market strategy as detailed further below.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Fasanara, the portfolio manager of the Fund, is authorised and regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) as an investment firm.</p>\n<p>Fasanara is currently an Exempt Reporting Adviser (“ERA”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).</p>\n<p>Each of the Feeder Fund and the Master Fund fall within the definition of a “mutual fund” in terms of the Mutual Funds Act and accordingly will be regulated in terms of that Mutual Funds Act. As regulated mutual funds, the Fund will be subject to the supervision of the Cayman Island Monetary Authority (“CIMA”).</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, and exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is a mutual fund regulated by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA).</p>\n<p>The Fund has not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), or qualified under any applicable state statutes and may not be offered, sold or transferred in the United States (including its territories and possessions) or to or for the direct or indirect benefit of any U.S. Person, except pursuant to registration or an exemption. FAST has not been, nor will be, registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Pursuant to an exemption from registration under the 1933 Act and the exception from the characterization of each of the portfolios as an investment company found in Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, FAST may make a private placement of the shares/tokens to a limited category of U.S. Persons. The shares/tokens will only be available for purchase by U.S. Persons who are both (i) “accredited investors”, as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the 1933 Act and (ii) “qualified purchasers” as defined in Section 2(a)(51) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is</strong> <strong>bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>Bankruptcy remoteness is established for assets of this product through the jurisprudence of Cayman Islands law.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Issuer does not have more than one product.</p>\n<p>A legal opinion on statutory segregation for segregated portfolio companies under Cayman Islands law issued by Walkers will be an appendix and emailed separately so will not be available in the forum submission.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Investors hold all of the standard shareholder rights and protected by both the UK’s fair practices regulatory regime as well as under Cayman Islands law. In particular:</p>\n<p>(i) Upon an investor becoming a shareholder (i.e. a token holder), they will be bound by the terms of the memorandum and articles of the Feeder Fund (the “Articles”) which take effect as a contract between the shareholders and the Feeder Fund. Shareholders will have the rights and obligations set out in the Fund’s offering documents.</p>\n<p>(ii) The Articles may be amended by a special resolution of shareholders as provided under the Articles.</p>\n<p>(iii) The Articles and the Application Form (as defined [above]/[below]) are each governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p>(iv) The rights and restrictions that apply to Shares (i.e. tokens) may be modified and/or additional terms agreed by way of side arrangements with the Feeder Fund (subject to such terms being consistent with the Articles). In certain cases, these side arrangements may be governed by the laws of a different jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>(v) Although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in a foreign jurisdiction (other than judgments rendered by a superior court which may be enforced under the Cayman Islands Foreign Judgments Reciprocal Enforcement Act (1996 Revision)), a judgment obtained in a foreign jurisdiction will be recognised and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment:</p>\n<p>a) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction;</p>\n<p>b) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given;</p>\n<p>c) is final;</p>\n<p>d) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty; and</p>\n<p>e) was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p>In the event their tokens are ever lost, hacked or corrupted, the investor can be minted new tokens either identical to their original tokens or on an alternatively supported blockchain. The latter allows investors to switch chains, removing a large array of known-unknowns as a result of this new technology and practice.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or Sky</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s portfolio/asset Manager, Fasanara, is a fiduciary to the Fund and therefore is required to act in its best interests. Further information on Fasanara’s Conflicts of Interest policy will be provided in the Fund Documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>It is the responsibility of all persons interested in purchasing tokens to inform themselves as to any tax consequences from their investing in the Fund and the Fund’s operations or management, as well as any foreign exchange or other fiscal or legal restrictions, which are relevant to their particular circumstances in connection with the acquisition, holding or disposition of tokens.

An ONCHAINID can be enriched with claims - verifiable credentials - that will prove sets of data onchain for eligibility and compliance checks.</p>\n<p>The two main differences between ERC3643 and other tokenization processes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full onchain logic: the logic of the eligibility and compliance checks is performed onchain, adding transparency and trust to the validation process.</li>\n<li>Identity-based checks: wallets are not enough to enforce compliance.

This can be used, for example, to represent capital calls or subscription and redemption events.</li>\n<li>Freezing and unfreezing: blocks (resp. unblocks) parts or totality of the balance in the wallet of the investor. Blocked positions still sit on the wallet of the investors but can’t be transferred. This can be used, for example, to represent a commitment or to enforce a legal obligation.</li>\n<li>Forced transfer: this is a corrective function that can be used to correct a mistake or enforce a legal obligation. This transfer completely bypasses the compliance check (but not the eligibility checks), it is to be used with caution.</li>\n<li>Pause and unpause token: this can be used to completely stop the exchange capabilities on a token. Agent actions can still be executed but no investor transfers can be performed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ERC3643 can also manage different transfer rules.

Sky Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with Sky and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>While Fasanara itself has not yet engaged directly with Sky in formal partnerships, we have a deep-rooted history in the crypto and blockchain space. Fasanara’s extensive experience in managing complex crypto financial products and infrastructure has provided Fasanara with valuable insights into the operational dynamics of decentralized platforms. Over the years, Fasanara has maintained a positive relationship with Sky through its platform, Untangled Finance Ltd (Untangled), entering exploratory discussions on multiple fronts, including but not limited to Real-World Assets (RWA). Untangled has been working with Sky community since 2021 and took part in an RFP on providing monitoring service for RWA. The feedback received from the community inspired Untangled to create Credio to address some of the missing infrastructure in the RWA on-chain credit market.</p>\n<p>Recognizing Sky’s significant influence in the DeFi space, we have made the strategic decision to accept DAI as the token for minting FAST. This decision underscores our commitment to aligning with Sky’s ecosystem and catering to its extensive user base.</p>\n<p>With our team’s expertise in navigating both traditional finance and digital assets, we are well-positioned to collaborate with DAOs. Our proven track record with other reputable DAOs demonstrates our ability to navigate DAO governance, meet KYC requirements, and deliver financial products that uphold the high transparency and security standards demanded by decentralized organizations like Sky. Fasanara also has experience working with a wide range of legal structures, including SICAV-RAIFs, Securitisation Vehicles, LLPs, corporations, trusts, and other legal entities, further reinforcing our capability to support Sky’s strategic objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the Spark Star and Sky ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>FAST offers investors stability and peace of mind, delivering uncorrelated returns in a simple ERC-20. Advised by Fasanara, FAST brings 15+ years of professional asset management on-chain. FAST’s CEO, Francesco Filia, has 30+ years of experience and is responsible for managing $4B+ AUM across multiple funds.</p>\n<p>Project FAST draws its name from a blend of Fasanara’s forward-thinking ethos and the demands of the digital age. The “FAS” represents the agility and pioneering spirit of Fasanara, while “T” stands for Transparency – symbolising the core of the project: short-term liquidity, transparent and efficient management of real-world assets through a decentralized ecosystem. The name encapsulates the essence of speed, innovation, and simplicity, critical in today’s fast-evolving financial landscape.</p>\n<p>In addition to FAST, Fasanara is committed to expanding its portfolio of real-world asset (RWA) products, further deepening our collaboration with Sky in the future. By launching new RWA offerings tailored to the needs of decentralized ecosystems, we aim to provide Sky with a broader range of asset-backed products that enhance stability and liquidity. This evolving suite of RWA solutions will not only support Sky’s treasury diversification goals but also create new opportunities for long-term cooperation and growth within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Integrating FAST can also attract a broader range of institutional and retail participants from Fasanara’s ecosystem, who prioritize the security and stability of RWA-backed assets. Additionally, Sky can leverage Fasanara’s extensive RWA global network, gaining access to traditional finance resources like asset sourcing, and community building.</p>\n<p>This broader participation could help to further diversify and strengthen Sky’s treasury, aligning with long-term strategic goals of risk management and capital efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>N/A as Fund has not yet been launched.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other Stars?</strong></p>\n<p>Fasanara’s alternative credit strategies offer a unique and powerful solution for tokenized money markets and short duration asset management. With over nine years of experience in managing diverse, global portfolios, Fasanara is well-positioned to address the specific needs of decentralized finance initiatives like SparkDAO. Fasanara’s expertise in short-duration, self-liquidating instruments aligns perfectly with the requirement for exposure to three-month or lower duration US T-Bills, while its focus on liquidity management ensures efficient capital deployment and rapid redemption capabilities.</p>\n<p>At the heart of Fasanara’s edge is its innovative use of technology, which is particularly relevant for tokenized asset management. Fasanara employs a proprietary, man + machine driven infrastructure that underpins every aspect of its operations, from rigorous due diligence to advanced risk management and fraud mitigation tools. This technological prowess enables Fasanara to offer a seamless integration with blockchain-based systems, potentially providing real-time transparency and automated reporting crucial for DeFi ecosystems. Fasanara’s approach to maximum diversification across various dimensions naturally immunizes its portfolio against various risks, a critical factor in managing reserves backing stablecoins like DAI.</p>\n<p>In the current market landscape, Fasanara is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the emerging world of decentralized finance. By leveraging its expertise in efficient origination and management of short-term, highly liquid assets, Fasanara can offer a sound legal structure with bankruptcy remoteness for SparkDAO’s reserve management. Fasanara’s experience in navigating complex regulatory environments can provide valuable insights into tax implications and compliance considerations for tokenized assets. As the financial world continues to evolve, Fasanara stands ready to be a strategic partner in pioneering tokenized money market solutions, offering not just investment management but also contributing to the development and adoption of DeFi technologies.</p>\n<p>Fasanara is not just an asset manager, but a catalyst in advancing the SparkDAO and broader Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong><em>: The information in this document pertaining to Fasanara Capital Ltd (“Fasanara”) or its partners mentioned herein is for general information purposes only, as per date of publication, and should not be considered exhaustive.

(“BUIDL”) as part of the Spark Tokenization Grand Prix. BUIDL offers a tokenized U.S. Treasury product designed to provide decentralized organizations and other institutional investors a secure, yield-generating, blockchain-based investment solution. Since its launch in March 2024, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenized fund in the world, reaching over $500 million in assets under management in its first 6 months and  has become the category leader.</p>\n<p>We believe BUIDL is differentiated from competing funds and uniquely well positioned to address Sky’s needs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>World’s largest asset manager combined with the world’s leading RWA infrastructure provider:</strong>  BlackRock, with $10 trillion in assets under management, is the world’s largest asset management firm, having earned the trust of clients around the world over multiple decades.  BlackRock has invested heavily into the digital assets space, building capabilities that have allowed it to become the largest crypto asset management firm and largest tokenized fund manager in the world.</p>\n<p>Securitize, which serves as the transfer agent, tokenization platform and broker dealer for BUIDL, is the longest-standing and largest company in the RWA space, with over 100 RWA tokenized projects and more than $1B in issuances on chain since its inception.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the direct issuance of a fund by BlackRock in tokenized form cuts out a layer of intermediation and counterparty risk relative to funds where the fund issuer and reserve manager are separate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Instant on-chain liquidity:</strong>  As a result of a longstanding partnership between BlackRock and Circle, for whom BlackRock manages the USDC reserve assets, BUIDL offers the prospect of instant on-chain liquidity between BUIDL and USDC through smart contracts enabled by Circle (1).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Risk mitigation flexibility:</strong>  The scale and breadth of counterparty relationships of BlackRock’s Global Cash Management team, which oversees $778 billion of the firm’s $10 trillion in AUM, enables significant access to repurchase agreement supply as an investment alternative to U.S. short term treasuries, a critical capability to mitigate the potential risk of future U.S. debt ceiling concerns.</p>\n<p>Specifically, BlackRock currently manages $200 billion in outstanding repo balances across all segments. This is enabled by the connectivity BlackRock has to 53 unique repo counterparties, supported by 12 sponsors within the FICC cleared repo service model. This provides robust operational support across various structure types, including tri-party, delivery versus payment, and FICC settlement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Influence across the TradFi and digital assets ecosystems:</strong>  BlackRock’s role in both the traditional finance and digital assets ecosystems provides it the capacity to help drive digital asset adoption, including widening the usage of BUIDL across an expanse of platforms as well as supporting Sky’s growth ambitions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Depth of product lineup:</strong>  BlackRock intends to work with Sky to determine how BlackRock’s multi-faceted lineup of funds across its Cash Management, ETFs, Active Fixed Income, and Alternatives platforms may be able to supplement BUIDL and support enhanced yield generation or other investment goals of Sky.</p>\n<p>Further, Securitize has the largest roster of tokenized funds in the ecosystem, which would also be available alongside an investment in BUIDL.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>BlackRock and Securitize are committed to strengthening the Sky ecosystem by continually enhancing BUIDL’s features and working closely with decentralized finance (DeFi) participants to increase liquidity and utility across DeFi protocols. We look forward to collaborating with the Sky ecosystem to set a new standard for compliant, secure, and scalable treasury solutions, bringing to bear the joint capabilities of the largest asset manager and the largest RWA company in the space .</p>\n<p><strong>I.

We believe short-term assets are most effectively managed when decisions are based on the collaborative approach between these three groups. Clients’ cash management needs and investment strategies can vary based on their risk tolerance and investment horizon for their cash. Customized investment solutions are built based on these needs. We have sector-specific portfolio management teams that focus on Government, Prime, Short Obligation &amp; Collective Trust Funds, Separately Managed Accounts and Municipal mandates in Canadian dollars, Euros, Sterling, and U.S. dollars.</p>\n<p>Being one of the largest global asset managers of cash, with $778 billion in cash management assets under management as of 30 June 2024, we believe the CM Group’s investment team is able to provide scale-related benefits, which include: more efficient trade execution, increased liquidity, tighter bid/offer spreads and greater buying power. The CM Group’s scale also provides the investment team with deep capital markets participation, creating what we believe to be unique access to exclusive investment opportunities, along with the ability to source new issue allocations when they come to market. In the second quarter 2024, the CM Group executed approximately $82 trillion in trades across our Cash Management platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio risk oversight</strong><br>\nRQA partners with BlackRock’s investment teams to help ensure: (1) risks in the portfolios are appropriate across strategies and consistent within each mandate; and (2) positioning reflects the team’s current investment themes as well as adhering to each client’s formal risk constraints. RQA is an integral pillar to our Cash Management investment process that attends our formal Investment Strategies Group (“ISG”) meeting and credit committee meetings in an effort to provide portfolio perspectives on the current and forecasted upcoming risks to our portfolios. Specific to RQA Cash, positioning along the spectrum of maturities is dependent upon careful analysis of the liquidity demands of a fund, guidelines and other constraints including regulations, central bank policy, market behavior, inflation, and supply or availability of appropriate investments. This theme is echoed throughout all of our Global Cash Management client portfolios. Across the suite of Global Cash Management Stress Test reporting, there are more than 200 different shock scenarios run for every portfolio daily, collectively translating to over 100,000 shock/stress scenarios run weekly as of 30 June 2024 through the scaled Aladdin analytics platform.</p>\n<p>Specific risk factors that BlackRock’s CM Group addresses include, amongst others:<br>\n●\t<strong>Liquidity risk</strong> - The risk stemming from the lack of marketability of an investment that cannot be bought or sold quickly enough to prevent or minimize a loss.<br>\n●\t<strong>Interest rate risk</strong> - The risk that an investment’s value will change due to a change in the absolute level of interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or any other interest rate relationship.<br>\n●\t<strong>Spread risk</strong> - The risk associated with the change in value of a security due to a change in the relative spreads in the market.<br>\n●\t<strong>Credit risk</strong> - Associates adverse changes of a security’s value due to a ratings downgrade of the investment or in a distressed case, default of the security.</p>\n<p>BlackRock’s emphasis on risk management serves to help meet our objective of generating excess return within a risk-controlled investment framework. Our real-time analysis of a vast array of risk measures allows us to assess the potential impact of various sector and security strategies on total return. We believe the substantial investment we have made in proprietarily developed analytical systems and personnel strongly differentiates our firm.</p>\n<p>BlackRock performs daily stress testing of every Global Cash Management money market fund in accordance with both the SEC and EU’s standards. Stress testing involves challenging a fund’s ability to maintain both a stable net asset value per share, if relevant, and sufficient weekly liquid assets when faced with a series of specified hypothetical stress-events. These tests include but are not limited to the following hypothetical events: (i) a change in short-term interest rates; (ii) credit deterioration, such as a downgrade of or default on portfolio securities; and (iii) the widening or narrowing of spreads between yields on an appropriate benchmark the strategy has selected for overnight interest rates and commercial paper and other types of securities held by the strategy. These tests are each conducted in combination with various increases in shareholder redemptions as expected in a stressed scenario. BlackRock will also test other hypothetical events, as it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p>Our comprehensive Risk and Quantitative Analysis (RQA) mandate seeks to ensure we invest transparently and deliver value to our clients</p>\n<p>●\tRQA’s governance framework seeks to ensure risks are appropriate and portfolio positioning is deliberate, diversified, scaled and consistent with clients’ and/or fund shareholders’ risk/return expectations<br>\n●\tMore than 200 different shock scenarios run for every USD portfolio daily, and over 100,000 shock/redemption scenarios run weekly through the scaled Aladdin analytics platform<br>\n●\tMeets the requirements set forth by the Rule 2a-7 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stress testing guidance</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/5/8586c5bc75627378ae016f140b878c46a5073825.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/j3efD9d2zYbJQ1yoR55zDdR5VPv.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/5/8586c5bc75627378ae016f140b878c46a5073825_2_690x258.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"j3efD9d2zYbJQ1yoR55zDdR5VPv\" width=\"690\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/5/8586c5bc75627378ae016f140b878c46a5073825_2_690x258.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/5/8586c5bc75627378ae016f140b878c46a5073825.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/5/8586c5bc75627378ae016f140b878c46a5073825.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C1B5A8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Securitize</strong></p>\n<p>Securitize is the exclusive tokenization platform for the Fund and serves as BUIDL’s transfer agent and placement agent through our registered broker-dealer, Securitize Markets.

(i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Subscription and redemption flows operate as such:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Subscription:</strong></p>\n<p>Investors may purchase BUIDL shares via USD or, imminently, via USDC through payment conversion on-ramps. Investors may engage in peer to peer transfers on the secondary market (as available) as well (18).</p>\n<p>To subscribe to BUIDL, the investor must first complete onboarding with Securitize. This includes passing all KYC/B requirements for approval into the Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>USD:</strong><br>\nAfter a prospective investor is fully permissioned and onboarded, they will be able to access the Fund subscription document, which collects investor details related to bank accounts (for future distributions) and a wallet for minting the BUIDL tokens to.</p>\n<p>Once signed, the subscription is reviewed by the Transfer Agent. The investor provided wallet is also screened for AML/sanctions before the agreement is countersigned.</p>\n<p>Upon countersigning, the investor will be provided with funding instructions, accessible both via email and the Securitize portal, in order to send US Dollars to the Fund custodian demand deposit account at BNY Mellon. The Fund Transfer Agent monitors the custodial demand deposit account via API for all deposits received.</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of funds, tokens will be minted to the wallet address provided during the subscription process. US Dollar funds must be cleared and received in good order by the custodian by 2:30 pm ET on an applicable business day in order for shares to be issued that day at 2:45 pm ET. Otherwise, any late receipt of subscription funds will be issued tokens effective the next business day.</p>\n<p><strong>USDC (release imminent):</strong><br>\nInvestors using this service can subscribe to the Fund via USDC through an integration with a payment conversion provider. A unique and segregated wallet is created for each investor, which the investor will fund with USDC. The conversion partner facilitates the conversion to USD and transmits the USD to the Fund custodian demand deposit account at BNY Mellon.</p>\n<p>Identical to the USD subscription path, BUIDL tokens are minted on the business day in which USD funds are received to the Fund custodian at BNY Mellon by 2:30 PM ET.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary / Peer to Peer:</strong><br>\nSecondary market subscriptions into BUIDL are available via ecosystem partners to whitelisted investors. While the secondary market is available 24/7/365, liquidity is at the sole discretion of providers and partners and is not guaranteed. BlackRock and Securitize continue working with various partners to build the liquidity ecosystem and breadth of acceptance around BUIDL.</p>\n<p><strong>Redemption:</strong></p>\n<p>Investors can redeem BUIDL tokens for USD, as well as liquidate instantly for USDC via the Circle liquidity contract (19).  Additionally, BUIDL partners with a 3rd party payment converter to facilitate exit from the Fund in USDC. BUIDL investors may also engage in peer-to-peer secondary market transactions with other whitelisted investors to exit their position.</p>\n<p><strong>USD:</strong><br>\nInvestors may redeem directly with the Fund to receive USD by sending tokens to the redemption wallet monitored by the Transfer Agent. This can be facilitated through the Securitize platform UI, or by directly sending tokens to the redemption wallet via transfer on-chain.</p>\n<p>Tokens received in the redemption wallet by 3:00 PM ET each business day are processed with a same day wire payment. Redemptions received in the redemption wallet after the cutoff time will be paid during the next business day.  Generally, USD wires for redemption proceeds are released at 4:00 PM ET on each business day.</p>\n<p><strong>USDC:</strong></p>\n<p>As part of an upcoming feature, investors may redeem BUIDL for USDC via a payment conversion partner. In the case of certain investors, particularly those without access to traditional banking rails, performing a USD redemption (see USD redemption above) will result in the redemption proceeds being routed through the USDC conversion partner for further client instruction away from the Fund (20).  Similar to the USD redemption, this is initiated by performing a direct redemption with the fund by sending tokens to the redemption wallet monitored by the Transfer Agent.</p>\n<p><strong>On-chain Native Secondary Market Exit</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract:</strong><br>\nBUIDL partners with Circle to provide smart contract functionality that allows holders of BUIDL to transfer their shares to Circle for USDC (21).  Transactions can be facilitated through the Securitize platform UI or by directly interacting with the smart contracts. This smart contract provides BUIDL investors with an instant, atomic, 24/7 BUIDL off-ramp that brings to bear the core benefits of tokenized assets: speed, transparency and efficiency. Since the inception of the smart contract, 106M BUIDL tokens have been atomically transferred to the liquidity contract for instant USDC.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Market:</strong><br>\nSecondary market transfers of BUIDL are available via ecosystem partners. While the secondary market is available 24/7/365, liquidity is at the sole discretion of providers and partners and is not guaranteed. BlackRock and Securitize continue working with various partners to build the liquidity ecosystem and breadth of acceptance around BUIDL.</p>\n<ol start=\"15\">\n<li><strong>Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As redemptions are of paramount importance - both in terms of size of redemption and liquidity options available - BUIDL engages with an ecosystem of partners across 3rd party payment providers, conversion partners, and market makers to enhance liquidity and redemption efficiency. The ability to meet large redemptions is supported by BlackRock’s Global Cash Team’s expertise, the highly liquid fund composition, and the breadth of ecosystem partners willing to acquire BUIDL shares in the secondary market.</p>\n<p>Primary market redemption is managed by the same portfolio managers that manage the $778 billion in Cash held with BlackRock’s Cash Management group. The Cash Management group engages in risk analyses and stress testing to determine portfolio makeup that enables redemption demand to be met. (See Section II.1 for more details)</p>\n<p>As noted above, BUIDL has partnered with Circle to provide a seamless, 24/7 liquidity option to BUIDL token holders (22).

These tokens represent ownership in the fund and allow holders to participate in the economic benefits generated by BUIDL, such as receiving dividend distributions. While these shares do not carry voting rights, token holders benefit from the following key rights:</p>\n<p><strong>Participation in Dividends:</strong><br>\nTokenholders have the right to receive regular dividends based on the fund’s performance, providing a steady yield on their investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Transparency and Security:</strong><br>\nAs digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, tokenholders can verify their holdings in real time via the blockchain.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquidity and Flexibility:</strong><br>\nIn addition to subscription and redemption flows, investors can transfer their tokens between whitelisted participants, subject to regulatory compliance, giving them flexibility while ensuring a compliant and secure environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Blockchain-Based Investor Protections:</strong><br>\nThe Ethereum blockchain contributes to the security and immutability of ownership records, providing an added layer of security for token holders beyond traditional financial instruments.</p>\n<p>Token holders have access to the fund’s financial and performance data, enabling informed decisions about their investments.</p>\n<p>These rights and features make BUIDL a compelling option for both traditional investors and decentralized entities, combining the trust of BlackRock’s institutional infrastructure with the accessibility and innovation of the Securitize digital asset ecosystem.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>No.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or Sky.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are no conflicts of interest with Sky or Spark.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We have highlighted certain U.S. federal income tax and British Virgin Islands (BVI) tax considerations relevant to an investment in BUIDL. Investors are urged to fully review the tax considerations described in the Offering Memorandum and consult their tax advisors as to the potential tax consequences to them of any purchase, ownership and sale of BUIDL shares based on their particular circumstances and jurisdiction of domicile.</p>\n<p><strong>U.S. Federal Income Taxation:</strong><br>\nBUIDL will be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. BUIDL intends to manage a portfolio of assets that are eligible for an exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax.</p>\n<p><strong>U.S. Holders:</strong><br>\nBUIDL shares may be treated as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) or a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) in the hands of a U.S. holder depending on whether the fund shares held by U.S. persons exceed certain thresholds. The fund will provide annual PFIC statements to U.S. holders to facilitate their annual U.S. tax compliance. The fund has not committed to providing CFC reporting at this time. U.S. holders are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding their tax compliance obligations under these two regimes.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-U.S. Holders:</strong><br>\nBUIDL payments to a non-U.S. holder that provides appropriate tax certifications to the fund and gain realized on a sale or other disposition of the shares by the non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, unless (i) such income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, or (ii) in the case of gain, such non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who holds the shares as a capital asset and is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are satisfied.</p>\n<p><strong>BVI Taxation:</strong><br>\nBUIDL and all dividends, interest, rents, royalties, compensations and other amounts paid by BUIDL to persons who are not persons resident in the BVI are exempt from the provisions of the Income Tax Act in the BVI and any capital gains realized with respect to any shares of BUIDL by persons who are not persons resident in the BVI are exempt from all forms of taxation in the BVI.</p>\n<p>This is a brief summary of certain tax considerations relevant to an investment in BUIDL. Tax laws and practices in both the U.S. and BVI can change, potentially impacting the fund’s tax status. Individual tax situations vary significantly. We strongly encourage all investors to consult both the fund’s Offering Memorandum and their own tax advisors to fully understand the tax treatment specific to their jurisdiction and circumstances.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>V.

This allows the token to benefit from the well-established infrastructure of the Ethereum blockchain while incorporating critical compliance controls and governance features unique to the DS Protocol. By implementing the DS Protocol, the token retains full compatibility with the ERC-20 ecosystem, ensuring easy integration with wallets, custodians, and smart contracts while adding layers of regulatory compliance. This protocol enables features such as whitelisting investors, managing transfers within regulated environments, and automating compliance across jurisdictions, ensuring that securities regulations are adhered to.</p>\n<p>The fractionalization capabilities of the token (up to six decimal points) facilitate flexible fund representation, making it suitable for various investor types, from retail to institutional players. Importantly, because it conforms to the ERC-20 standard, the token can be integrated seamlessly into the broader DeFi ecosystem, enabling functionalities like staking, lending, and liquidity provision without needing any bespoke integrations. For example, some clients have chosen to manage their holdings using Gnosis Safe without requiring further customization, demonstrating the plug-and-play ease that the ERC-20 standard provides.</p>\n<p>The Securitize DS Protocol has been instrumental in the success of several high-profile tokenization projects and it is the most widely used on-chain protocol for RWA tokenization that represent securities. It was a critical factor in BlackRock’s choice to employ it for the BUIDL token, given the protocol’s stringent compliance and security guarantees and history of wide usage without any issues. Moreover, this technology has been adopted by other leading financial institutions such as KKR and Hamilton Lane, enabling them to tokenize their products effectively and securely. The DS Protocol’s ability to manage the entire lifecycle of digital securities - from issuance to ongoing compliance and cap-table management - ensures that tokenized assets remain compliant at all times.</p>\n<p>The DS Protocol powers every Securitize token deployment and enforces the underlying compliance rules required by each asset. As of July 2024, Securitize has facilitated over $1 billion (23)  worth of investments in tokenized securities through its platform, with 100+ tokenized securities issuances.</p>\n<p>Details of the DS Protocol can be found in the below links:<br>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jorge.serna/ds-protocol-first-code-release-7470e4d45ae6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DS Protocol</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/securitize/ds-protocol-the-basic-elements-23fabcb5c85f\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DS Protocol Basics</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/securitize/ds-protocol-the-trust-and-registry-services-91d1c4630f78\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DS Protocol Trust &amp; Registry Service</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/securitize/ds-protocol-the-compliance-service-b6fe472d625d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DS Protocol Compliance Service</a></p>\n<p>From a technical security perspective, the administration of the BUIDL token, including actions such as minting, burning, or any updates to the token or its smart contract, is secured by Fireblocks’ institutional-grade controls. Fireblocks offers an advanced framework for securing private keys through multi-party computation (MPC) technology, ensuring that access to token administrative functions is highly resilient to attacks. This advanced level of security not only mitigates unauthorized access but also complies with the rigorous standards expected in regulated financial markets.</p>\n<p>In addition, as a precautionary measure, all newly minted tokens undergo a 24-hour lockup period to further safeguard against any potential unauthorized transfers. During this lockup, tokens cannot be transferred, ensuring that any unexpected minting or suspicious activities can be promptly detected and addressed before the tokens become active. Once this period passes, BUIDL tokens can be freely transferred between whitelisted Ethereum addresses, ensuring compliance with security and regulatory requirements while maintaining the flexibility of a decentralized environment.</p>\n<p>To provide ongoing, proactive security monitoring, Securitize has partnered with Hexagate, a leader in Web3 security and risk analytics. Hexagate offers continuous on-chain monitoring, employing sophisticated algorithms to detect and prevent potential exploits, hacks, or vulnerabilities before they can cause any financial loss. This proactive approach ensures that the deployed tokens are safeguarded against real-time threats, providing an additional layer of protection to both the platform and its investors. This partnership reflects Securitize’s commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security in the rapidly evolving digital securities landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Implementation Information:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SecuritizeID Portal:</strong><br>\nOnboarding, investor account access, and reporting are managed through the SecuritizeID Portal at <a href=\"https://id.securitize.io/login\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://id.securitize.io/login</a>. All investor activity can be managed via the portal, or conversely, many routine token operations can be managed by interacting with the token directly on-chain. For additional portal details, refer to section V.2 above.</p>\n<p><strong>Operator Control Panel:</strong><br>\nAll Broker Dealer &amp; Transfer Agent functions are performed in the Control Panel. Additionally, all token transactions are monitored in real-time, and if necessary can be restricted. Transfer Agent control operators use Fireblocks institutional controls, requiring multiple key persons approval for any new token minting, further enhancing token security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>Securitize has been issuing digital asset tokens on the DS protocol since 2018, and also released the DS protocol for open-source development soon after. The contract is fully upgradeable using a proxy-delegate pattern and furthermore the structure of DS services allows not just the token upgrade but specific functions like compliance or registry services to be upgraded separately. The DS Protocol and related contracts have been audited multiple times over the years since the initial deployment, most recently by Certik in June 2024.</p>\n<p>All digital asset tokens issued by Securitize since inception have never been hacked or compromised in any way. Securitize is currently a SOC 1 and 2 Type 1 compliant organization.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Halborn audited the BUIDL-USDC swap smart contract provided by Circle. The smart contract code for BUIDL has been reviewed in detail by several partners, including Circle, Coinbase, and Anchorage. Etherscan has also reviewed and verified token information.</p>\n<p><strong>Internal DS Protocol Audits</strong> (reports to be share privately with the selection committee)<br>\nJuly 2018, June 2020 - CoinFabrik<br>\nSept 2023, June 2024 - Certik</p>\n<p><strong>External Audits &amp; Evaluations</strong> (can be reviewed privately)<br>\nOct 2023 - Halborn (Circle USDC contract)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>VI. Sky Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe any previous relationship with Sky and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>BlackRock and Securitize have substantial experience working with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and addressing their unique needs. Despite the differences in governance structures, DAOs share fundamental similarities with traditional entities like foundations and endowments, where BlackRock has long been a leading investment manager. Managing these types of entities requires managing perpetual portfolios, ensuring proper asset-liability alignment, investing with an infinite time horizon, and growing capital responsibly through effective risk management.</p>\n<p>BUIDL has successfully onboarded multiple decentralized organizations (including ArbitrumDAO, after being granted the largest allocation in the STEP grant program) and has distributed over $9.3M in dividends to BUIDL holders (many of which are DAO participants) without tax withholding due to the fund’s BVI offshore structure. This experience has allowed Securitize to develop a streamlined onboarding framework for DAOs incorporating a variety of legal structures, including U.S. and non-U.S. corporations, trusts, and foundations.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, BlackRock is well-equipped to work within jurisdictions that are friendly to digital assets and decentralized entities, such as the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands (BVI), and other global regimes that support DAOs. Our flexibility in navigating both international and U.S. regulatory frameworks ensures that we can offer DAOs tailored, globally-compliant solutions across multiple jurisdictions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the Spark Star and/or Sky ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>BUIDL gives Sky access to BlackRock’s world-class expertise in managing multi-asset portfolios, powered by Securitize’s market-leading infrastructure.</p>\n<p>With $10 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock has an unparalleled track record in advising  institutional portfolios, including organizations with highly bespoke needs such as Sky. In addition to the differentiated product dynamics and capabilities of BlackRock and Securitize highlighted elsewhere in this application, we believe two other dynamics are critical to expand upon:</p>\n<p><strong>Critical risk mitigation through repo capability:</strong><br>\nBlackRock ‘s Global Cash Management team manages $778 billion in global liquidity assets, as of 30 June 2024. BlackRock’s market-leading position in the financial ecosystem includes significant access to repurchase agreement supply, a critical capability that can offer several benefits compared to Treasuries. In the event of periods of concern around U.S. Treasuries, catalyzed by a U.S. debt ceiling issue or otherwise, it could be advantageous to vastly reduce exposure to U.S. Treasuries for some period of time.  In such an episode, extensive repo capacity would be a potentially critical advantage and risk mitigating capability. Through BlackRock, BUIDL portfolio managers can access the repo market through 53 unique counterparties and 12 sponsors within the FICC cleared repo service, enabling maximal liquidity and flexible, diversified counterparty exposures.</p>\n<p><strong>Institutional commitment and influence across TradFi and digital assets ecosystems:</strong><br>\nBlackRock’s senior leadership has shown a strong commitment to the future of tokenization and digital assets, ensuring that BUIDL can continue to align with the most innovative trends in decentralized finance. Through the strength of BlackRock’s platform, client relationships, and effective advocacy for digital assets, BlackRock has driven such robust flows into its cryptoasset and tokenized fund products that it has become the world’s largest crypto asset manager, growing AUM from cryptoasset products by over 8,000% on a YTD basis, to more than $20 billion today.  As part of this, BlackRock had to enlist the support and participation of a breadth of traditional finance players (including market makers, banks and fund administrators) in order to make the crypto ETP ecosystem viable.</p>\n<p>This unique ability to drive institutional demand for cryptoassets and galvanize support among traditional finance players would continue to benefit Sky and the decentralized finance ecosystem, positioning BlackRock as a valuable long-term collaborative partner to Sky in supporting the growth of the Sky and digital assets ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Further, BlackRock intends to continue to drive adoption and acceptance of BUIDL, and as this occurs, BUIDL’s utility to Sky as a foundational part of the Sky treasury assets will continue to grow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>BUIDL, via BlackRock and Securitize, is actively engaged in efforts across the DeFi ecosystem to extend the reach and acceptance of BUIDL to further enhance its utility to digital asset native investors. Please refer to III.7 for a list of integrated partners and service providers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BlackRock Cash Management Solutions Across Liquidity Needs</strong></p>\n<p>An investor’s cash typically falls into three distinct categories or tiers. Understanding liquidity needs can help investors segment their cash and identify opportunities to optimize. While an entity’s investment policy will typically dictate their own definitions, generally we see some variation of the following classifications.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/d/5d139a3974357ff1782e876d3b8fa4323ac518c0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dhooYiHP23t6yZiT3jJyt0qIEHS.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d139a3974357ff1782e876d3b8fa4323ac518c0_2_690x339.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"dhooYiHP23t6yZiT3jJyt0qIEHS\" width=\"690\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d139a3974357ff1782e876d3b8fa4323ac518c0_2_690x339.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d139a3974357ff1782e876d3b8fa4323ac518c0_2_1035x508.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/d/5d139a3974357ff1782e876d3b8fa4323ac518c0.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDB78F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>BlackRock provides diversified investment management to institutional clients, intermediary clients and individual investors through various investment vehicles.

Once onboarded to BUIDL through Securitize, Sky will have immediate access to any tokenized offerings available, which leverage the same processes, systems and investment experience as BUIDL. Securitize provides the unique ability for Sky to leverage existing KYC data, accreditation status, wallet(s) and other account information to access high quality products able to be managed alongside BUIDL through Sky’s Securitize ID account.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as the leading platform in tokenizing real-world assets, Securitize is committed to<br>\ndeveloping solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems, specifically by bringing digital asset securities to different markets for treasury management, portfolio<br>\ndiversification, and secured ecosystem utility.</p>\n<p>For example, the Hamilton Lane Senior Credit Opportunities Securitize Fund (“SCOPE”) offers several compelling advantages as a treasury management complement to BUIDL.<br>\nThe Hamilton Lane fund targets senior credit opportunities, aiming for yields that can outperform traditional fixed-income securities in a declining interest rate environment. The average deal is 450 bps above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR is currently 5.38% and is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities). As interest rates decline, existing credit assets often appreciate in value. This potential upside not only strengthens the overall value of a DAO’s treasury but also aligns with long-term growth objectives, making the Hamilton Lane fund an attractive investment option.</p>\n<p>And, through Securitize, the tokenized structure of the feeder fund provides on-chain daily liquidity via on-demand redemptions when needed, and allowing quick access to treasury funds for operational requirements without facing significant liquidation penalties or waiting for off-chain transactions to settle.</p>\n<p><strong>Hamilton Lane Senior Credit Opportunities Securitize Fund - Historic NAV</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/9/19e16f19ab869136b83779afe71c6c250bd240c8.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3GWVsNIgv0Hs2MXr01uaB4YllLW.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/19e16f19ab869136b83779afe71c6c250bd240c8_2_690x505.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"3GWVsNIgv0Hs2MXr01uaB4YllLW\" width=\"690\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/19e16f19ab869136b83779afe71c6c250bd240c8_2_690x505.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/19e16f19ab869136b83779afe71c6c250bd240c8_2_1035x757.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/19e16f19ab869136b83779afe71c6c250bd240c8_2_1380x1010.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C3CAD5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>By providing higher yields, liquidity, expert management, capital preservation, and potential<br>\nappreciation, SCOPE can enhance a DAO’s treasury management strategy in the face of anticipated lower interest rates, creating a balanced and resilient investment.</p>\n<p>The above are just a few examples of how BlackRock and Securitize both bring access to a wide array of complementary products that can be used to construct portfolios across a spectrum of desired outcomes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>VII.

Here’s how a strategic partnership and investment in TBLs will benefit SparkDAO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Direct On-Chain Ownership:</strong> TBLs offer SparkDAO direct access to the US Treasury market on-chain, removing unnecessary centralized intermediaries and reducing counterparty risk. This provides SparkDAO with enhanced control over its investments and capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unparalleled Liquidity:</strong> TBLs are the most liquid on-chain asset during market hours, backed by PV01’s issuance of 4-week TBLs with flexible rollover options. To ensure uninterrupted liquidity, PV01 is committing close to $100 million in weekend repo facilities, providing SparkDAO with USDC liquidity at all times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Robust Legal Foundation:</strong> PV01’s bankruptcy remote issuers, transaction structure and legal documentation developed in accordance with TradFi practices, together with legal opinions confirming the legality and validity of the bonds ensure our TBLs meet the highest of legal standards. PV01 is also fully compliant with applicable laws and regulations including securities laws and sanctions/AML regulations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Seamless Transferability:</strong> TBLs are easily transferable, with minimal restrictions or approval requirements, ensuring operational efficiency and agility for SparkDAO’s investment activities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Market-Leading Net Yield:</strong> Leveraging US T-bills directly as collateral, TBLs cut out intermediaries, delivering higher net yields and maximizing returns for SparkDAO, as compared to reverse repo alternatives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Composability:</strong> TBLs are designed for integration with other decentralized financial applications, enabling SparkDAO to build passive or rule-based investment strategies, which promote innovation and strategic flexibility within the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Strategic Diversification:</strong> As a modular financial instrument, TBLs can serve as a core building block for other financial products in the Sky/SparkDAO portfolio, diversifying risk and enhancing the overall resilience of the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>II.

Product Information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TBL: Product Overview</strong></p>\n<p>PV01’s digital bonds are the highest yielding short-term Treasury product in the market. With fewer intermediaries than competitors, they offer direct access to the underlying US T-Bill market and benefit from its immense liquidity.</p>\n<p>PV01’s core product, the ‘TBL’ is a digitally-native zero coupon bond secured by US Treasury Bills, subscribed for and redeemed by investors directly on-chain in USDC. TBLs are the world’s first fully blockchain-native bearer debt securities issued under English law - the gold standard for TradFi bond issuance. As bearer securities, TBLs are the most readily transferable Treasury product in the market – no approval whatsoever is required, a simple transfer from wallet to wallet suffices.</p>\n<p>Each TBL bond is a direct, secured, limited recourse debt obligation of its issuer, a regulated, bankruptcy-remote, orphan SPV established in Bermuda. Represented by a transferable ‘bearer’ bond token in ERC-20 format, the TBL tokens have a notional value of 1 USDC per token and are fully negotiable and freely transferable on the blockchain in any USDC amount, subject to a sanctions blacklist.</p>\n<p>With title to the TBL bonds passing by delivery of the TBL tokens on-chain, the need to maintain a register of ownership is eliminated. Ownership of TBL bonds is determined exclusively by possession (control) of the TBL tokens and is generally identified by the digital wallet address on which the TBL tokens are held.</p>\n<p>Each TBL is linked 1:1 to an equal USD principal amount of a specific US T-Bill (an “Underlying T-bill”) with a matching maturity date. The Underlying T-bills are held in a segregated, secured securities account with a regulated custodian.</p>\n<p>When the Underlying T-bill matures, the USD proceeds are converted to USDC and paid back to the holders of the corresponding TBL token, via the TBL smart contract.</p>\n<p>Prior to maturity, a TBL can also be tapped (increased in size) or redeemed early by buying or selling the Underlying T-bill during its lifetime. This provides unlimited and same-day liquidity during US government bond market hours.</p>\n<p>Outside of market hours (e.g. on weekends), PV01 has commitments from market makers to provide liquidity (in repo form and as outright purchases) for an aggregate amount just under $100mm. The fact that TBLs can be transferred without any approval by PV01 facilitates secondary liquidity.</p>\n<p>The TBL product is designed to mirror as closely as possible the commercial features of a direct holding of US T-bills on-chain, while meeting traditional finance standards in terms of structure and documentation - without unnecessary TradFi intermediaries such as registrars, paying agents and clearing systems - making it the most compliant, secure, cost-effective and liquid way to get access to US Treasury yields on-chain.</p>\n<p>Importantly, TBLs are not funds, they are simple debt securities with a fixed repayment amount and defined maturity date backed by a static number of matching underlying US T-bills and paying out in stablecoins. As such, they do not depend on an asset manager to carry out an investment mandate on behalf of investors.</p>\n<p>As modular, building block-like financial instruments, TBLs can be reused to build other financial products on-chain. Due to their bearer nature, TBL bonds can be deposited, transferred, posted as collateral, etc., by simple delivery of the TBL tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>rTBL: The ‘Perpetual’ TBL via Automatic Rollover</strong></p>\n<p>PV0 created an ERC-4626 vault to enable the automatic rollover of TBLs. At any point in time, the vault contains an “on-the-run” 4-week TBL. Holders of that same TBL can deposit their tokens into the vault. At maturity, the 4-week TBL inside the vault is rolled into the new 4-week TBL. This feature allows for the “invest-and-forget” convenience of money market funds, while avoiding their overhead and redemption delays. Our research also indicates that investors generate higher all-in yields compared to competing products thanks to those savings.</p>\n<p>At any moment before maturity, investors that deposited TBL tokens in the vault can withdraw them from the vault, and redeem their USDC at maturity instead of rolling automatically.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/1/6154bb78a23b7beded5f3687f4a7a3859dc086cf.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dT1QS2OCWQ6X332OT9eBeHIol7F.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/1/6154bb78a23b7beded5f3687f4a7a3859dc086cf_2_624x352.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"dT1QS2OCWQ6X332OT9eBeHIol7F\" width=\"624\" height=\"352\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/1/6154bb78a23b7beded5f3687f4a7a3859dc086cf_2_624x352.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/1/6154bb78a23b7beded5f3687f4a7a3859dc086cf_2_936x528.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/1/6154bb78a23b7beded5f3687f4a7a3859dc086cf.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"BBC3BD\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Currently PV01 conducts primary issuances of rollable TBLs every 4 weeks and has plans to introduce a 2-week rollable TBL.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Transferability: Efficient Yielding Collateral</strong></p>\n<p>The full transferability of TBLs enables them to be used efficiently as yielding collateral. Importantly, the transfer of TBL tokens as collateral does not trigger the usual selling restrictions afflicting US investors.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset:</strong></p>\n<p>Each TBL is backed by a USD principal amount of a specific US Treasury Bill (identified by its CUSIP) equal to the USDC principal amount of the TBL issued. They have the same maturity date. ​​</p>\n<p>The Underlying T-bill is deposited in a secured collateral account of the TBL Issuer (Digital Bonds Ltd, a special-purpose vehicle) and held there to maturity (unless liquidated in connection with an early redemption). No other assets form part of the collateral and there is no active management of the collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the token holder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs are zero-coupon debt securities offered at a discount to par, mirroring US T-bills. There are no periodic interest payments. Investors in TBLs are paid back using the redemption proceeds of the Underlying T-bill, which pays out at 100% of its principal amount in USD, converted to USDC by the TBL Issuer.</p>\n<p>The yield on TBLs comes from the difference between their issue price (or purchase price in the secondary market) and their final payout amount, equal to their principal amount.</p>\n<p>The final payout amount is claimed by TBL holders from the TBL smart contract at maturity, on the same day that the Underlying T-bill matures. Investors can take their gains or let their TBL roll by depositing TBL tokens in the rTBL ERC-4626 vault before maturity. In that case, no payment is received by the investor, but gains compound by greater and greater amounts with successive TBL series.</p>\n<p>As would be expected, both minting and redeeming are atomic operations in the smart contract.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>Bermuda is the jurisdiction of incorporation of both: (i) Digital Bonds Ltd (the “SPV”), and (ii) PV01 Capital Markets Ltd. (the “Arranger” and the “Tokenizer”).</p>\n<p><strong>Digital Bonds Ltd</strong></p>\n<p>The SPV was established in Bermuda in September 2023 as an exempted company and is registered as a segregated accounts company. Digital Bonds Ltd is registered in the Bermuda Registrar of Companies with registration number 202302760. The legal entity identifier (LEI) of Digital Bonds Ltd is 9845001ACD9A9DCCF060 and its registered office is at c/o Walkers Corporate (Bermuda) Limited, Park Place, 55 Par-la-Ville Road, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. The SPV’s sole business purpose and activity is the issuance of digital bonds and the purchase of collateral for such digital bonds through its segregated accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>PV01 Capital Markets Ltd.</strong></p>\n<p>PV01 is also incorporated in Bermuda, with registered company number 202302581 and its registered office at c/o Walkers Corporate (Bermuda) Limited, Park Place, 55 Par-la-Ville Road, Hamilton, HM 11, Bermuda.</p>\n<p>Both entities are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).</p>\n<p>HDL MF SA (“HDL”), the parent company of PV01, is a société anonyme incorporated and existing under the laws of Belgium, with registered office at 10 Boulevard de l’Empereur, 1000 Brussels, Belgium and registered under number 0793.243.927 in the Register of Legal Entities (Brussels, French-speaking section). HDL supplies administrative, legal, commercial and technological support to PV01.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to Sky’s RWA-15-A (‘Andromeda’) investments, TBLs are outright bonds and not a pre- constructed portfolio. Each TBL corresponds 100% with the underlying US T-bill.</p>\n<p>Sky and Spark DAO’s overall objectives in regards to concentration, duration and desired maturity profile can be implemented with the use of rTBL vaults in a rule-based and automated way. We propose to spread the investment 50:50 across the 2-week and 4-week rTBL vaults.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>The portfolio of TBL for Sky / SparkDAO consists only of bonds. No derivatives, no hedges, no reverse repos with banks.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

PV01 successfully completed its first two issuances in April 2024 with an initial USDC 5M transaction sold by PV01 partners B2C2, Keyrock and BlockTower Capital.</p>\n<p>Since then, PV01 has completed over USDC 50M in TBL issuance volumes.</p>\n<p>Figures above are for the Ethereum mainnet.</p>\n<p><strong>9. What are the standard fees (i.e., subscription, redemption, management, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>The standard TBL product fee is 20 basis points running, i.e. 0.20% annualized, which is factored into the purchase price/yield of each TBL upon issuance.</p>\n<p>PV01’s fee is among the lowest in the market as there are no active management fees or other intermediary fees. There is no issuing or redeeming fee.</p>\n<p>PV01 is committed to waiving its fee for the first $50M invested into our TBL product and to offer the subsequent $50M allocation at just 10 bps. For any amounts thereafter, the standard 20 basis point fee would apply and we guarantee that indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Crucially, our research also indicates that our product generates the highest after-fee yield in the market (give or take temporary fee holidays) by avoiding the inherently costlier structures of fund products or indirect US T-bill investments such as reverse repos via banks.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</strong></p>\n<p>No other fees or expenses are charged or passed on to investors. Importantly, there are no hidden fees charged by an underlying fund, which is one of two reasons identified by our research for the underperformance of competing offerings.</p>\n<p>The other reason is the use of reverse repos, which yield less than US T-bills due to their interaction with the balance sheets of the banks offering them.</p>\n<p><strong>11. How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users).</strong></p>\n<p>Our product is permissioned in a similar way as USDC.</p>\n<p>Specifically, direct subscriptions and redemptions require the investor to have been screened by PV01. These are primary users who would mint and redeem directly with PV01.</p>\n<p>Secondary users, including users of the rTBL vault, do not need to be screened by us.</p>\n<p>As has become standard in the industry, we use a crypto address blacklist for sanctions, both the one maintained by Chainalysis and our own blacklist.</p>\n<p>Token transfers are permissionless except for wallets in the blacklist. Those are rejected at the level of the smart contract.</p>\n<p>Note that TBL tokens are bonds under English law. As in TradFi, whether a bond transfer is permitted by the settlement technology (here, the blockchain as opposed to the clearing system) does not imply that it is legal to perform for the transferee and the transferor. Participants must make their own assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>12. What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>The monthly transaction volume has been circa USDC 25M.</p>\n<p><strong>13. What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>Our issuances and redemptions occur on the same day. We did allow for an extra day in our initial proof-of-concept issuance, but afterwards have always performed those actions within the day.</p>\n<p>PV01 has never had any interruptions in our ability to process redemptions and subscriptions.</p>\n<p>The yield accrues exactly from the time of the purchase to redemption (or sell), avoiding any gaps which results in loss of interest and lower yields to investors, unlike other products where intermediaries skim some extra interest by hanging onto the funds for a few days.</p>\n<p>See the section entitled “Issuance and Redemption” in the sample Offering Memorandum.</p>\n<p><strong>14. Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>The TBL primary subscription and redemption process on Pivio (as opposed to secondary transactions) involves the investor/TBL Holder completing the following steps:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Step</th>\n<th>Timing</th>\n<th>Parties</th>\n<th>Time for Completion</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1. <strong>Subscription and Issuance period of new TBLs</strong></td>\n<td>Subscribe to new TBL issues and settle bond tokens and stablecoin instantly and atomically</td>\n<td>Investor interacting with the Smart Contract via Pivio Platform or a direct technical integration</td>\n<td>Less than 2 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2. <strong>Outstanding period:</strong> Transfer or deposit TBLs into the Bond Token Vault for Automatic Rollover</td>\n<td>The period from the Issue Date to the Maturity Date</td>\n<td>TBL Investors, market counterparties (incl.

Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary Liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>TBL primary issuance occurs from time to time and every 4 weeks for the series used in the rTBL vault. Existing TBLs can be tapped or redeemed early within a day if the process starts early enough in US hours. Our process is lighter, more direct and therefore faster than competing fund structures and their overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>PV01 has commitments from market makers to provide repo and outright liquidity outside of market hours. The aggregate amount is just under $100mm.</p>\n<p><strong>16. With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.).</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs are currently USDC-denominated (subscribed and redeemed on-chain in USDC), however, they can easily be issued in other stablecoins such as USDT or even DAI and other cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>Our legal documents also have fallback provisions to settle in alternative currencies, should the need (or desire) arise.</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>We are adding full TBL secondary market trading functionality to our PV01 portal (currently manual).</p>\n<p>An automated market maker (AMM) product is being rolled out, initially using a Curve StableSwap Pool to allow swaps from rTBL to USDC. After creation, the pool will not be owned by PV01 but by the Curve DAO. Curve Pools are designed to be permissionless, any user can freely add or remove liquidity and swap between assets.</p>\n<p>In partnership with Sky, PV01 envisions a DAI denominated risk free DeFi yield curve with market participants investing, transferring and making liquid secondary markets in TBLs at scale.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>PV01</strong>, a Bermuda-domiciled and licensed entity, acts as arranger and tokenizer of the digital bond issuance transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Digital Bonds Ltd</strong>, also a Bermuda-domiciled and licensed entity, issues digital bonds (TBLs) through its segregated accounts.</p>\n<p>Both entities conduct their activities from within Bermuda and are subject to regulatory oversight of the BMA in Bermuda.</p>\n<p><strong>TBLs</strong> (and other digital bonds arranged by PV01) are legally classified as securities and as such are subject to compliance with securities laws in Bermuda and in each jurisdiction in which they are offered or sold.</p>\n<p>Notably, none of PV01’s or Digital Bonds Ltd’s activities are subject to compliance with the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (‘MICA’) in the EU, due to the status of our products as securities. Rather, PV01’s activities and products are subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, such as the Prospectus Regulation and MiFID in the EU and equivalents in the UK and other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>PV01 is dedicated to compliance with the laws and regulations to which it and its products are subject in all jurisdictions. Our products are not currently offered to investors in the US or to US Persons and are offered only in off-shore transactions to investors outside the US in accordance with Regulation S under the US Securities Act and as such are not subject to registration in the US.</p>\n<p><strong>English law</strong> is the governing law of our TBLs (and other digital bonds) and the framework within which they are created and issued. There is not currently a specific statutory framework for the issuance of DLT-based securities under English law. However, we have developed the structure and documentation of our products on the basis of English common law, with the advice of our international and local counsels, which firms have issued us with legal opinions confirming the legality and validity of our TBL bonds under English and Bermuda law. Copies of these opinions are available upon request.</p>\n<p>The TBLs are “zero coupon, secured, limited recourse, rollable digital bonds”. As noted above, each TBL bond (each ‘TBL’) is a bond (meaning a direct debt obligation) of the TBL Issuer secured against Underlying T-bills. The ‘limited recourse’ nature of the TBLs means that the liability of the issuer is limited to the amounts received by it in respect of the collateral (on a bond-by-bond basis), which ensures that the TBL Issuer remains solvent, as its liabilities cannot exceed its assets. See further under Question 3 re: bankruptcy-remoteness below.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple Documentation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Deed Poll:</strong> Each Series of TBL bonds is constituted under a Deed Poll entered into by the relevant Issuer for the benefit of the TBL Holders. This is a unilateral document, executed by the Issuer electronically and made available to Holders via a link included in the TBL smart contract.</p>\n<p>The Deed Poll creates the Issuer’s obligations under the TBL bonds and provides for those obligations to be attached to the bond tokens (thereby “tokenizing” them).</p>\n<p><strong>TBL Conditions:</strong> The Conditions of each TBL bond are included in the Deed Poll and are also set out in the Offering Memorandum for the Series. The Conditions are generally the same for each Series of TBLs, although they have evolved over time as new product features (such as the rollover option) have been added.</p>\n<p><strong>Brokerage and Custody Agreement:</strong> The Underlying T-bills are held in segregated cash and securities accounts maintained in the name of the TBL Issuer with StoneX as custodian, which also provides the brokerage services.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Deed:</strong> Security (in the form of an English law fixed charge) over the collateral accounts of each TBL Issuer is granted to the Security Agent under a Series-specific Security Deed.</p>\n<p><strong>SACA:</strong> A Securities Account Control Agreement (‘SACA’) is in place between each TBL Issuer, the Custodian and the Security Agent, giving the Security Agent the ability to immediately seize control over the collateral if a Realization Event occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Arrangement and Tokenization Services Agreement (‘ATSA’):</strong> PV01 as Arranger and Tokenizer provides arrangement and tokenization services, as well as expenses coverage to each TBL Issuer under a separate ATSA for each Series.</p>\n<p><strong>Arranger Agreement:</strong> under this umbrella agreement between PV01 and Digital Bonds Ltd, PV01 provides arrangement services and ongoing expenses coverage to the ‘general’ account of the SPV.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bma.bm/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) </a>- Fintech Authorization and Licensing Committee (the “FALC”)</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>PV01 obtained its license from the BMA’s FALC in 2024 and is licensed under the Digital Asset Business Act 2018 of Bermuda to operate as a digital asset services vendor. PV01 is authorized to operate in the categories of undertaking digital asset transactions on behalf of others and as a market maker for digital assets.</p>\n<p>Digital Bonds Ltd also obtained its license from the BMA’s FALC in 2024 and is licensed under the Digital Asset Business Act 2018 of Bermuda to operate as a digital assets business in the category of issuing, selling or redeeming virtual coins, tokens or any other form of digital asset.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>Digital Bonds Ltd (“DBL”) is structured as a fully bankruptcy-remote entity in accordance with TradFi standards for special purpose vehicles.</p>\n<p>DBL was established in September 2023 as an orphan special purpose vehicle in the form of an exempted company. The entire issued share capital of DBL is held by Zobec Trust Company Limited as share trustee (the “Share Trustee”) on trust for charitable purposes. This ownership structure means the SPV is not a subsidiary of PV01 and therefore it and its assets are not liable to become consolidated with the assets of PV01 in the event of PV01’s insolvency. It also protects against any voluntary winding up of the SPV without PV01’s consent.</p>\n<p>DBL has been registered as a ‘segregated accounts company’ or ‘SAC’ under the laws of Bermuda. The segregated account company structure creates a statutory segregation or ‘ring-fencing’ of assets and liabilities between each of its segregated accounts and the main or ‘general’ account of the SPV. This means that the assets (ie the collateral) of any individual TBL Issuer (as a segregated account of DBL) are not available to satisfy the liabilities (ie TBLs) of any other TBL Issuer or the liabilities of the general account of the SPV. As such, TBL Holders of any given Series have access only to the collateral backing that Series and vice versa.</p>\n<p>The sole business purpose and activity of DBL is the issuance of digital bonds and the purchase of collateral for such digital bonds through its segregated accounts. Each TBL Series is issued by a separate segregated account of DBL, which itself has no other business or liabilities. Even where TBLs are rolled via the token vault, the new TBL tokens received are those issued by a ‘fresh’ segregated account of the SPV and are therefore not exposed to any residual liabilities of the preceding TBL Issuer.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of the SAC structure is that the insolvency of one segregated account of the SPV will not result in the insolvency of any other segregated account or of the SPV as a whole - therefore, in the unlikely event of an insolvency of one TBL Issuer, the holders of other Series of TBLs would not be affected.</p>\n<p>Other features designed to protect against any potential insolvency of each TBL Issuer include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>limited recourse</strong> nature of the TBLs themselves and inclusion of market standard limited recourse and non-petition provisions in each of the Transaction Documents - ensuring that the liabilities of any TBL Issuer at any time do not exceed its assets;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Negative covenants</strong> given by each TBL Issuer in the TBL Conditions and the Security Deed whereby it undertakes not to:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>incur any other indebtedness, or issue any other class of debt securities or shares;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>amend its constitutive documents;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>dissolve or liquidate;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>form any subsidiaries;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>conduct business under any name other than its own;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>have any employees (other than directors or managers to the extent they are employees);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>consolidate or merge with or transfer its assets; or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>engage in any business or activity other than issuing and performing its obligations under the TBLs; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity/expenses support</strong> provided by PV01: in its capacity as Arranger, PV01 pays the ongoing and transaction-specific expenses of the SPV and TBL Issuers, including the fees payable to their service providers. This ensures that the full redemption proceeds of the Underlying T-bills are available for repayment to investors at maturity. In the event of a pricing mismatch between the TBL issuance proceeds and the price payable for the Underlying T-bills, PV01 also provides additional funding to the TBL Issuer to make up any shortfall.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any insolvency of a TBL Issuer or of the general account of DBL would constitute a Realization Event under the TBL Conditions, triggering their automatic acceleration and enforcement of the Security by the Security Agent. Under Bermuda law, the Security Agent would not be prevented from seizing the collateral and liquidating it to satisfy investor’s claims upon an insolvency.</p>\n<p>To protect against any insolvency of the Broker/Custodian, the collateral backing each TBL Series is held in a segregated custody account with StoneX, which operates in compliance with the FCA’s CASS regulatory framework [<a href=\"https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/CASS.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Link</a>]. This requires each TBL Issuer’s assets to be held segregated from other custody clients’ assets and from those of the custodian.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>As a bondholder, TBL investors have a secured limited recourse debt claim against the bankruptcy-remote TBL Issuer holding the underlying collateral.</p>\n<p>See the section of the Offering Memorandum entitled “Description of the Digital Bonds - Rights Attached to the Digital Bonds”.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO.</strong></p>\n<p>There is no conflict of interest between the company (either Digital Bonds Ltd or PV01 Capital Markets Ltd.) or products with the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p>See the section of the sample Offering Memorandum entitled “Interests of Natural and Legal Persons Involved in the Issue/Offer”.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product.</strong></p>\n<p>Our TBLs are currently issued as zero-coupon bonds. As such they do not pay out periodic interest, rather they are offered at a discount and pay out at maturity at their face value/principal amount. We view them as bonds for tax purposes as well.</p>\n<p>PV01 has not withheld any tax. If required by law, the TBL Issuer has the right, but not the duty, to withhold or deduct from any amounts otherwise payable to the Holder(s) such amount as the TBL Issuer determines in its sole discretion is necessary for the payment of such taxes, duties, assessments and/or governmental charges. Holders are not entitled to receive additional amounts to compensate for any amounts so withheld or deducted (i.e. there is no ‘grossing-up’ for any withholding or deduction by the TBL Issuer).</p>\n<p><strong>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark.</strong></p>\n<p>The average APY across TBL series 1 to 6 has been 5.25%, compared to 4-week US T-bills returning 5.45% APY.</p>\n<p>PV01’s TBLs mirror the performance of their underlying RWAs - each TBL being backed by a single US T-bill identified by its CUSIP.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p>Custody reports in the form of cash and securities custody account statements are produced by the custodian for each TBL on a daily basis. See the form included below. These are made available to investors via the Pivio Platform and are shared with the Security Agent upon completion of any further issuances of TBLs during Additional Issuance Settlement Windows (where additional Underlying T-bills are purchased by the TBL Issuer) or any partial early redemptions (where a portion of the Underlying T-bills are sold by the TBL Issuer).</p>\n<p><strong>Custody Reports</strong></p>\n<p>Sample Cash and Securities Custody Account Statement produced by StoneX for the TBL Issuer “DB Series-5”.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/d/5d55b430cef9d393150f66580047c961781bcadf.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/djG1vY8subANWBiE1bg1R1PjANV.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d55b430cef9d393150f66580047c961781bcadf_2_624x439.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"djG1vY8subANWBiE1bg1R1PjANV\" width=\"624\" height=\"439\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d55b430cef9d393150f66580047c961781bcadf_2_624x439.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d55b430cef9d393150f66580047c961781bcadf_2_936x658.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/d/5d55b430cef9d393150f66580047c961781bcadf_2_1248x878.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E8EBEF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Transactions in the TBLs themselves and TBL cash flows can be monitored with blockchain explorers such as Etherscan.

Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product.</strong></p>\n<p>As PV01 is not a fund product, there are no portfolio accounting reports. Each TBL is a single bond backed by a US Treasury Bill as opposed to a portfolio of assets. PV01 is committed to furnishing Sky with any reports it requires (such as the ones above).</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product.</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs are implemented on-chain through a combination of two smart contracts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>TBL Smart Contracts:</strong> Each Series of TBLs is implemented by a Series-specific ERC-20 smart contract governing the TBL tokens of that Series.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PV01 Vault Smart Contracts:</strong> These are <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-4626 compliant</a> contracts that each manage a single TBL as their asset token, allowing investors to deposit that TBL token into the vault in exchange for a “Bond Token Receipt”. Upon TBL maturity, PV01 as vault owner calls the Rollover Function in the vault smart contract, triggering an automatic exchange of tokens between the vault smart contract and the TBL smart contract of the next TBL Series. TBL tokens in the vault representing the maturing TBLs are exchanged for TBL tokens representing a new Series of TBLs - a process referred to as “rolling over” the asset.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This occurs seamlessly without requiring any action from investors. They continue to hold their Bond Token Receipts, which can be used to withdraw their entitlement of TBL tokens from the Bond Token Vault at any time up to the next Rollover.</p>\n<p>A single bond token vault is deployed as a separate ERC-4626 smart contract managing rollovers of TBLs with a specific tenure (period from issuance to maturity). The current ERC-2626 vault runs rollovers of TBLs maturing on 4-week intervals, with the ‘vault asset’ updating to the next TBL Series upon each rollover.</p>\n<p>All smart contracts are written in Solidity. The design goals, in order of priority, are: <strong>security, simplicity</strong>, and <strong>efficiency.</strong> The contracts leverage trusted and audited templates and libraries, primarily from OpenZeppelin. Simplicity is a key design principle, minimizing errors and reducing costs for future modifications. Gas efficiency is also considered, provided it does not compromise the primary goals of security and simplicity.</p>\n<p>All Solidity smart contract source code is published on Etherscan.</p>\n<p>The table below provides an overview of the operational contracts, along with links to detailed technical documentation.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs.</strong></p>\n<p>Our firm has extensive experience working with decentralized organizational structures, identifying their yield and cash management requirements and devising Treasury management solutions for them. In previous roles, our team members have worked with AMMs and have actively participated in DAO events, including as the market maker for the biggest L1 launch of 2021. PV01 is committed to working with decentralized organizations and importantly, has the knowledge and experience required to service the particular needs of Sky.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>PV01’s TBL product benefits the SparkDAO and Sky ecosystem by driving liquidity, efficiency, and growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancing SparkDAO’s Liquidity and Efficiency</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs are the highest yielding Treasury products and benefit from the greatest market hours liquidity through direct access to the actual US government bond market.</p>\n<p>TBLs also rely on fewer intermediaries. For instance, several fund products make use of reverse repos, which typically involve the large “too big to fail” banks. A reverse repo means that the fund lends dollars to a bank and receives a government bond in guarantee. While safe, the approach is economically inferior to purchasing T-Bills outright. We also view the unnecessary involvement of more TradFi actors as less consistent with the crypto ethos. Dealing with the US government by purchasing its debt can already be seen as a necessary evil that we accept only because it supports the growth of the crypto ecosystem.</p>\n<p>TBLs provide SparkDAO with the most competitive returns, a frictionless investment process, and rapid redemption (within hours). In comparison to managed funds, a 50:50 investment in 2-week and 4-week rolling TBLs reduces governance complexity, risk, and unnecessary costs, ultimately improving ROI and Sky ecosystem stability.</p>\n<p><strong>A Composable DeFi Primitive for Innovation</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs act as modular financial instruments, easily transferable and reusable. Their non-rebasing structure makes them ideal for building other financial products, opening up new opportunities for financial innovation within the Sky ecosystem. They’re also growing in acceptance as yielding collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>Scaling USDS and De-risking Maker Core</strong></p>\n<p>Issuing USDS against TBLs — secure, risk free, yield-bearing assets — would support USDS’s growth as the DeFi “risk-free currency.” TBLs’ simple structure, fast liquidation, and legal recourse to underlying US T-Bills further enhance Maker Core’s stability and reduce risk.</p>\n<p>Because TBLs are the most direct on-chain representation of government bonds, they can help scale USDS as much as that market will support.</p>\n<p><strong>Driving User Acquisition for the Sky Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>TBLs’ transparency and ease of understanding appeal to DeFi and non-DeFi users alike, helping attract new participants and align incentives for all stakeholders. PV01’s deep expertise in TradFi and crypto, alongside its institutional connections, will support SparkDAO and Sky as it introduces new products like corporate bonds, expanding community engagement and participation.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>PV01’s products are available on <a href=\"https://www.polytrade.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Polytrade</a> and we are finalizing several other partnerships, including one already announced with <a href=\"https://www.plumenetwork.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Plume Network</a>, a Layer 2 for RWAs.</p>\n<p>PV01 is currently exploring integrations with major DeFi protocols including Curve, Morpho and a few others. PV01’s TBL is also being on-boarded with major custodians, exchanges and other venues where it will be accepted as yielding collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>PV01’s mission is to build and operate a debt capital market on which a healthy digital asset ecosystem can thrive. The first iteration of PV01’s products are TBLs. However, PV01’s legal structure lends itself naturally to corporate bond issuances. PV01 will soon issue corporate bonds of crypto native companies directly on-chain. The crypto credit market exceeded $30bn at its peak and has the potential to be even bigger in this new cycle. Having the ability to invest in the debt of major crypto-native companies on-chain could be relevant for Spark and other SubDAOs, especially as assets less tethered to TradFi than government bonds.</p>\n<p>Our vision for PV01 is to make our credit products widely accessible to on-chain investors across different ecosystems and protocols. We are actively engaging with lending protocols, DEXs, and other blockchain players to ensure our products are available where they will be most value added.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-pv01/25199\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-pv01/25199","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 22:37:34 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25199"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-pv01/25199.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - PV01"}},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Midas mTBILL","dc:creator":"Midas","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<h3><a name=\"p-99124-i-product-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99124-i-product-summary-1\"></a>I.

Product Information</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Describe the product:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>mTBILL is an ERC-20 token designed to provide onchain exposure to short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills, offering stable dollar-denominated yield. It is an ideal solution for investors and DeFi protocols looking for reliable returns, particularly in volatile market conditions. By leveraging U.S. Treasuries, one of the safest assets globally, mTBILL offers a predictable yield with minimal risk.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of mTBILL is its permissionless transferability. This means the token can seamlessly integrate into DeFi protocols for a variety of use cases, including lending, borrowing, and yield generation. Its flexibility allows it to be used in DeFi money markets, liquidity pools, and collateralized loan platforms, contributing to the overall liquidity and efficiency of these ecosystems. Additionally, the token can be traded on secondary markets, providing liquidity to investors when needed.</p>\n<p>In terms of accessibility, mTBILL is available to a wide range of investors. Unlike most tokenized onchain Treasuries, mTBILL is available to retail investors during primary market issuance and with no minimum investment requirement, truly democratizing access to onchain yield-bearing assets. This is because the issuance of Midas’s products is approved by regulators, instead of relying on prospectus exemptions commonly utilized by RWA issuers in the market, which limit the products to a limited group of accredited investors with $100,000 investment minimum thresholds in addition to net worth requirements.</p>\n<p>This broad accessibility aligns with Sky’s vision of making institutional-grade financial products available to everyone, fostering inclusivity, and making Midas the internet’s best place to save and invest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Midas-issued tokens are not available to persons and entities in the US, China, and to those in sanctioned countries. Midas-issued tokens are also not available to individuals in the UK.</em></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Describe the underlying asset</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>mTBILL is exclusively composed of short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills, as well as funds and ETFs that are comprised of US Treasury Bills, ensuring that the asset is of the highest credit quality and liquidity. Such funds might include the BUIDL fund whose assets are managed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, ensuring that they are held in a highly liquid, low-risk portfolio.</p>\n<p>Ankura Trust, serving as both an independent data verification agent and security agent, plays a critical role in ensuring that the assets backing mTBILL qualify as eligible collateral. If the assets fall outside of the established criteria, an ineligible collateral event is triggered. Ankura’s primary responsibility is to safeguard the interests of tokenholders by continuously monitoring and enforcing compliance. Further details about Ankura’s specific responsibilities regarding ineligible collateral are outlined in later sections.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yield from mTBILL is transferred via price accrual, which mirrors the interest earned from the underlying U.S. Treasury Bills. The token’s value usually appreciates daily, reflecting the accrued interest and it does not require manual reinvestment. Performance reporting is provided by the independent verification agent Ankura Trust.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>mTBILL is issued by Midas Software GmbH, a German-based SPV that operates under the jurisdiction of BaFin (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority). The FMA in Liechtenstein has approved a Base Prospectus for Midas Software GmbH, which governs the issuance of mTBILL.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The portfolio for mTBILL is exclusively composed of short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills, as well as funds and ETFs that are comprised of US Treasury Bills, ensuring that the asset is of the highest credit quality and liquidity. The concentration limits are designed to maintain a diversified exposure across different Treasury Bill issuances, minimizing risk while ensuring that the portfolio remains stable and low-risk. The independent verification agent, Ankura Trust, monitors and enforces that the collateral is invested within the predefined eligible scope of securities.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>No, the mTBILL portfolio does not utilize hedging or derivatives or permit such activity.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product.

Provide a breakdown by blockchain.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>mTBILL currently has an AUM of $7 million, with all assets currently on the Ethereum blockchain. As Midas expands, we plan to deploy mTBILL on other chains, which will further diversify and grow the product’s AUM, enhancing its accessibility and utility within DeFi. Midas also has 8 figures of capital commitments from various ecosystems to seed mTBILL and mBASIS liquidity with the largest being an LOI for $50mn of seeded liquidity in a nascent L2 ecosystem.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>What are the standard fees (i.e., subscription, redemption, management, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gross Yield</strong>: <em>~5.16%</em>*</li>\n<li><strong>Annual Tokenholder Fee</strong>: 10% of earned interest (waived for Sky)</li>\n<li><strong>Instant Mint Fee</strong>: 0.0%</li>\n<li><strong>Instant Redeem Fee</strong>: 0.07% (waived for Sky)</li>\n<li><strong>Mint Fee</strong>: 0.0%</li>\n<li><strong>Redeem Fee</strong>: 0.0%</li>\n<li><strong>Net Yield</strong>: ~5.16%</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>*<em>yield at the time of writing</em></p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong>Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>No other fees are applicable.</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li><strong>How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In <strong>primary markets</strong>, the issuance and redemption of mTBILL tokens to primary users requires accepted counterparties (e.g. those who have successfully passed KYC and AML checks and have successfully onboarded to Midas). There is also a blacklist function to prevent sanctioned individuals and operators of scam/fraud operations from utilizing the asset.</p>\n<p>In <strong>secondary markets</strong>, mTBILL is permissionless and freely transferable. This makes mTBILL a suitable collateral asset for SparkLend &amp; DeFi lending protocols strategically aligning itself with Sky’s DeFi <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959\">roadmap</a>.</p>\n<p>The token’s permissionless and freely transferable nature makes it an ideal collateral asset for DeFi lending protocols like SparkLend. This flexibility allows users to seamlessly use mTBILL as collateral, supporting lending markets’ continuous liquidity and stability. Its design ensures that any participant can engage in lending and borrowing, which we touch on more deeply in Section VI of this proposal.</p>\n<p>By integrating mTBILL into SparkLend, Sky can elevate the base lending rate in DeFi markets. This aligns with Sky’s roadmap to scale DeFi and make high-quality financial products accessible to everyday users. The on-chain composability of mTBILL also supports efficient liquidations, ensuring that lenders are protected in volatile market conditions.</p>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li><strong>What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Midas deployed mTBILL earlier this year on Ethereum Mainnet. It has had a few million dollars in monthly transaction volume. It’s important to note that this soft launch was intentionally limited as Midas worked to secure regulatory approval for its Prospectus, which was recently obtained in August 2024. This approval is a significant milestone, as it removes all initial investment minimums and opens mTBILL allocations to non-accredited investors (excluding the US and sanctioned jurisdictions), which we believe will dramatically increase its use and adoption within DeFi markets.</p>\n<p>As Midas exits its soft launch phase at the end of September, we expect transaction volume to grow substantially. We are particularly excited about a $50 million Letter of Intent (LOI) of seed liquidity from a major Foundation, which has committed to having Midas natively deploy mTBILL in their chain. This liquidity injection will help fuel even greater adoption and enhance the product’s presence across the DeFi ecosystem. The team has also worked alongside vault curators Steakhouse, Re7, and Leadblock to launch multiple Morpho vaults on both Ethereum and Base.</p>\n<p>Midas also has an integration roadmap with both regulated custodians and non-custodial wallets, which, coupled with no initial investment minimums and accessibility (outside of the US and sanctioned entities) for retail, will lead to future growth. With this upcoming liquidity and the removal of restrictions, mTBILL is well-positioned to become a pervasive asset in the DeFi space, driving higher transaction volumes in the months ahead.</p>\n<ol start=\"13\">\n<li><strong>What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Subscriptions and redemptions for mTBILL against USDC are processed atomically and are settled within the blocktime of the Ethereum Blockchain. Other stables would be processed quickly, though not atomically.

Legal Structure</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The mTBILL token is issued by Midas Software GmbH, a Germany-domiciled SPV, under the laws of the European Union. The product is structured as a tokenized debt instrument classified as a MiFIDII security.</p>\n<p>The legal framework governing mTBILL is based on German and Liechtenstein law, which provide a robust legal environment for financial products, ensuring compliance with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) regulations. The product operates primarily within the European Economic Area (EEA) but is accessible to global investors, subject to local regulatory restrictions. The issuer, Midas Software GmbH, is responsible for ensuring that the product adheres to all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The mTBILL product is subject to oversight by several key regulatory bodies, ensuring rigorous compliance with European and international financial regulations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>BaFin (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht)</strong>: As the primary regulator for Midas Software GmbH, BaFin oversees the product within Germany. BaFin is responsible for ensuring that mTBILL complies with both national regulations and broader EU-wide standards, including those set by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). This ensures that the product adheres to strict investor protection and market transparency requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA)</strong>: The Liechtenstein FMA plays a crucial role in overseeing aspects of mTBILL given their approval of the Base Prospectus. The FMA’s approval signifies that the product meets all necessary regulatory standards under both Liechtenstein and EU law.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>European Passporting</strong>: The FMA’s approval of the Base Prospectus also enables European passporting, which is a critical feature of the EU’s single market for financial services. European passporting allows mTBILL to be offered and marketed across all member states of the European Economic Area (EEA) without the need for additional regulatory approvals in each country. This facilitates the permissionless distribution of mTBILL throughout Europe, broadening its accessibility to investors across multiple jurisdictions while ensuring that it remains under the supervision of a unified regulatory framework.</p>\n<p>Together, these regulatory bodies ensure that mTBILL is governed by the highest standards of financial regulation, providing a robust and transparent investment product that is both secure and compliant. The combined oversight of BaFin and the FMA, reinforced by the advantages of European passporting, offers investors confidence in the product’s integrity and its widespread availability across Europe.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Midas Software GmbH has received the authorizations for the issuance of mTBILL by having received approval of the Base Prospectus and these Final Terms together, which constitute the formal issuance documentation required for regulatory approval under the Prospectus Regulation (EC) 2017/1129. This means that Midas has adhered to regulatory process, ensuring transparency and compliance for the issuance of mTBILL tokens.</p>\n<p>In addition, Midas complies with EU AML regulations, which are enforced through rigorous KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML procedures, overseen by Compliance Labs Liechtenstein.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bankruptcy remoteness for mTBILL is established through the use of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), Midas Software GmbH, which is legally separate from the parent company, Midas Protocol Limited.</p>\n<p>Midas has pledged Collateral comprising securities to the Security Agent as representative of the Tokenholders (the <strong>“Pledge”</strong>). For Collateral comprising tokens, Midas has transferred the both the tokens and the proceeds and claims from a sale or other disposal of tokens by way of security to the Security Agent and assigned its claims to demand delivery and possession (Lieferungs- und Herausgabeansprüche) against the relevant crypto custodian to the Security Agent as security in order to secure claims of the investors (the <strong>“Tokenholders”</strong>) against Midas and the claims of the Security Agent for compensation of its costs and expenses incurred in connection with its function as Security Agent (together the <strong>“Secured Claims”</strong>). The Security Agent has accepted the Pledge, and the custodian has been notified of the Pledge.</p>\n<p>The assets underlying mTBILL are held in a bankruptcy-remote trust structure managed by the Security Agent, <strong>Ankura Trust Company</strong>. Ankura ensures that the assets can be liquidated and distributed to investors if necessary.

BlockTower has managed several MakerDAO vaults, helping Maker diversify into real-world credit assets and enhance the resilience of DAI by providing access to stable, non-crypto-related cash flows. Additionally, BlockTower Andromeda, <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-blocktower-andromeda-rwa015-a-onboarding-risk-parameter-changes-dsr-increase-spark-protocol-proxy-activation-mkr-vesting-transfers-june-14-2023\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWA015</a>, a subsidiary of BlockTower, has been instrumental in facilitating MakerDAO’s expansion into RWAs, with its holdings reaching $752 million.</p>\n<p><strong>Framework Ventures</strong>, another lead investor and close advisor for Midas, worked with Sky in a pivotal role during a crucial event in Sky’s history. Specifically, during a major MKR auction held to recover DAI collateral after the “Black Thursday” crash, Framework Ventures joined the <a href=\"https://blog.makerdao.com/the-dai-backstop-syndicate-decentralization-at-work/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dai Backstop Syndicate</a>. This syndicate was formed to act as a buyer of last resort during the auction, stepping in to purchase MKR if auction prices dropped below a certain threshold. Framework’s involvement was critical for ensuring the stability of DAI during a time of crisis. <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmbBVg2D\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MIP13c3-SP1</a> was later introduced which helped formalize the community’s response to similar crises.</p>\n<p><strong>Ankura Trust</strong> serves as a Security Agent and Verification Agent for mTBILL and has worked with MakerDAO on select real-world asset projects (see <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP117#MIP117c2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MIP117</a>). As a Security Agent in certain RWA vaults, Ankura has overseen and safeguarded the collateral placed in these vaults, ensuring compliance with MakerDAO’s terms. In partnerships involving structured credit, like those managed by BlockTower, Ankura’s role includes managing the collateral backing these investments and overseeing liquidation processes in the event of default, ensuring compliance with MakerDAO’s liquidation protocols to protect the interests of tokenholders.</p>\n<p><strong>Jacek Czarnecki</strong> is an investor in Midas’ parent company.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Berto</strong> is the advisor on Midas’ risk management framework. During her tenure at Aave Companies, Alex was instrumental in setting resilient DeFi risk standards that endured extreme market conditions. After helping to propel the protocol’s growth, Alex supported its consolidation, developing a risk management framework covering tracking, alerting, and mitigations.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or Sky ecosystem?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Midas is committed to enhancing the utility of USDS and the Sky ecosystem. This commitment begins with integrating USDS into Midas’ product suite, enabling users to request issuance and redemption of mTBILL or mBASIS using USDS. This integration offers USDS holders a variety of investment options: exposure to tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills through mTBILL or delta-neutral perpetual futures funding yield via mBASIS. This bolsters the overall utility of the USDS token by providing additional ways for USDS holders to earn yield across different market cycles, bull or bear. As USDS becomes more pervasive over time, it’ll enhance the stability and foster the growth of the Sky ecosystem. Midas is positioned to further support Sky with the introduction of new products that leverage a broader collateral base, potentially including corporate bonds, non-U.S. foreign debt, and other structured products while maintaining composability with USDS.</p>\n<p>In SparkLend, Midas plays a crucial role in the liquidation process, which is open to anyone. Midas’ tokens are permissionless in the secondary market, allowing liquidators to bid on defaulted loan assets and efficiently recover lenders’ debts. This feature is vital for DeFi money markets and has already proven successful in Midas’s Morpho Vault, where its permissionless design facilitates seamless participation in loan recovery. By enabling anyone to participate in liquidations, SparkLend fosters a more inclusive and efficient market, driving the adoption of its decentralized lending protocol. Moreover, as SparkLend continues to grow within the Sky ecosystem, the integration of Midas tokens like mTBILL and mBASIS will help elevate the base rate of lending in DeFi, bringing it closer in line with traditional finance rates.</p>\n<p>Additionally, since mTBILL provides instantaneous redemptions, liquidators can immediately redeem the underlying assets’ net asset value (NAV). This mitigates market exposure risks, as liquidators do not need to worry about volatility during the liquidation process. This ensures that lenders are protected even in the event of market instability, enhancing the overall stability of the SparkLend protocol and its ability to manage risks. Moreover, as mTBILL narrows the arbitrage gap between DeFi and CeFi markets, it ensures that SparkLend will remain competitive with traditional financial institutions.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/3/63faa93659293022b8cd025c6dc68af8860aa04e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/egsj6WNbue7kGtd4pafO8iwqxfU.png?dl=1\" title=\"Loop Breakdown\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/3/63faa93659293022b8cd025c6dc68af8860aa04e_2_690x345.png\" alt=\"Loop Breakdown\" data-base62-sha1=\"egsj6WNbue7kGtd4pafO8iwqxfU\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/3/63faa93659293022b8cd025c6dc68af8860aa04e_2_690x345.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/3/63faa93659293022b8cd025c6dc68af8860aa04e.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/3/63faa93659293022b8cd025c6dc68af8860aa04e.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CEE0ED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Given that the DAO relies on a network of actors to automatically identify and process liquidations, Midas intends to develop Keepers to support and maintain the health and security of both SparkLend and Maker Core. These Keepers will automate parts of the liquidation process, ensuring the timely and accurate execution of liquidations, which is essential for preserving the integrity of the lending system. By building these tools, Midas ensures that SparkLend and Maker Core can scale securely while continuing to offer efficient and truly decentralized financial services.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>mTBILL is integrated with Morpho’s lending markets on both Ethereum and Base and is available as an eligible collateral within Leadblock and Gaunlet’s USDC metamorpho vaults.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As the US Federal Reserve cuts rates over time, Midas sees a palpable need onchain for non-US Treasury-backed tokenized products, where users can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Midas basis trading token, mBASIS, provides Spark users with a high-yield opportunity to earn delta-neutral returns on high-volume cryptocurrencies such as ETH and BTC. The mBASIS token is backed by a strategy that is actively managed by an institutional asset manager that is issued by the same Midas entity with investor assets that are held in a bankruptcy remote vehicle. Users can leverage mBASIS to create “bullish” positions, anticipating an increase in the market price for BTC, ETH, or the largest crypto altcoins. And while investors will seek higher yields from products like mBASIS, there is also an argument that reduced borrowing costs will boost overall investment in the crypto ecosystem, which still makes mTBILL an invaluable asset given the proven utility and need for tokenized yield-bearing assets in DeFi. This is why Midas believes in creating a toolkit for investors where numerous tokenized products can be utilized in different rate environments.</p>\n<p>Further, we are positioned to tokenize any number of RWAs and high-yield structured products based on market conditions, such as Euro and high-yield corporate bonds. These products will provide diversified yield opportunities for SubDAOs as the Sky ecosystem continues to scale USDS well beyond $100 billion. This diversified collateral approach ensures that lending markets like Spark remain efficient and competitive through different market conditions.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/2/32d1bfe3668ae415f6412cddbd0b8fb9568618e3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7fzg712Yxv49pds9thY7hkWQgqn.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Roadmap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/2/32d1bfe3668ae415f6412cddbd0b8fb9568618e3_2_690x401.jpeg\" alt=\"Roadmap\" data-base62-sha1=\"7fzg712Yxv49pds9thY7hkWQgqn\" width=\"690\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/2/32d1bfe3668ae415f6412cddbd0b8fb9568618e3_2_690x401.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/2/32d1bfe3668ae415f6412cddbd0b8fb9568618e3_2_1035x601.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/2/32d1bfe3668ae415f6412cddbd0b8fb9568618e3_2_1380x802.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D1D1D3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>More About Midas:</strong></p>\n<p>Midas shares deep ties with large active participants in the Sky ecosystem. <strong>BlockTower</strong> and <strong>Framework Ventures</strong> are also significant holders of MKR and long-standing ecosystem participants and co-lead Midas’s $9mn <a href=\"https://midas.app/blog/midas-raises-8-75-million-funding-round-led-by-framework-ventures-blocktower-and-hv-capital\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">investment round</a>.

It allows investors to preserve capital while engaging in blockchain-based issuance and transference. The token is issued on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and interoperability with various DeFi platforms. ArCoin’s daily interest accrual mechanism makes it an attractive option for yield-seeking investors, while its blockchain-based structure provides liquidity and ease of transfer.</p>\n<p>Alongside its blockchain-based liquidity, ArCoin is also listed on an Alternative Trading System (ATS), which provides investors with additional liquidity options.

This integration of daily interest accrual with blockchain-based transparency positions ArCoin as an appealing choice for investors seeking a stable and predictable source of yield.

By choosing to operate within the U.S., Arca Labs has worked to build the environment around tokenized funds to ensure that ArCoin and future products remain fully compliant with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>Asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations:<br>\nThe portfolio supporting ArCoin is exclusively composed of U.S. Treasury securities, cash, and cash equivalents. To mitigate risk and enhance diversification, the Fund will invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities, which include bills, bonds, and notes issued by the U.S. Treasury (“Treasury Securities”). Assets not invested in Treasury Securities may be held in cash or cash equivalents. For these purposes, “cash equivalents” include high-quality, highly liquid investments that typically have maturities of less than 90 days, including, but not limited to, bankers’ acceptances, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, short-term government bonds, treasury bills, and registered money market funds that operate by Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will have a maximum average portfolio duration of zero to eight years and a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity between zero and five years. This strategy reduces exposure to specific maturities and enhances the product’s overall stability. The asset eligibility criteria for ArCoin are designed to ensure that the portfolio remains highly liquid and secure. By concentrating solely on U.S. Treasury securities and cash, Arca Labs offers a historically predictable investment option tailored to the needs of conservative investors…</p>\n<p>The combination of strict asset eligibility criteria and concentration limitations ensures that ArCoin remains a secure and stable investment option. These criteria are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that the portfolio meets the highest security and liquidity standards.</p>\n<p>Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?<br>\nNo, the ArCoin portfolio does not engage in hedging or the use of derivatives. The investment strategy is focused solely on holding U.S. Treasury securities, cash, and cash equivalents to maintain the product’s simplicity, transparency, and risk profile. By avoiding complex financial instruments, Arca Labs ensures that ArCoin remains a straightforward and secure investment option.</p>\n<p>Arca Labs’ decision to avoid hedging and derivatives reflects its focus on maintaining transparency and simplicity. By concentrating on U.S. Treasury securities, Arca Labs offers a Closed-End 40 Act Fund that is designed to be low-risk and straightforward, appealing to conservative investors who value security and clarity. This approach keeps ArCoin closely tied to U.S. Treasury securities, aiming to provide a predictable return without the complexities and risks associated with more aggressive investment strategies.</p>\n<p>List of all counterparties and service providers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Administrator: Ultimus Fund Solutions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advisor: Arca Capital Management, LLC</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Custodian: UMB Bank NA</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Distributor: UMB Distribution Services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transfer Agent: Securitize, LLC</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each of these entities plays a crucial role in the issuance, management, and security of ArCoin.

The Advisor oversees the management of the assets, ensuring that they are managed in accordance with the terms of the offering memorandum. The Administrator is responsible for providing regular updates on the performance of the portfolio, while the Transfer Agent facilitates the issuance and redemption of tokenized shares, ArCoin.

The distribution across blockchains reflects Arca Labs’ strategy to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchain ecosystems to enhance liquidity, interoperability, and security.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ArCoin’s initial investment traction was modest, largely due to the challenging environment faced by upstart asset managers like Arca during that period. When we received authorization to launch ArCoin in 2020, the broader market conditions were particularly unfavorable for attracting significant investment. At that time, portfolios were yielding near zero due to historically low interest rates, which made it difficult to highlight the potential yield advantages of ArCoin to prospective investors. Additionally, as a new player in the asset management space, establishing credibility and gaining investor trust posed inherent challenges. The combination of these factors contributed to a slower accumulation of assets under management (AUM) during the initial phase, as investors were more inclined to stay with established institutions or opt for risk-averse strategies in a low-yield environment.</p>\n<p>Arca Labs is committed to maintaining and growing the AUM of ArCoin, ensuring that the product remains competitive and attractive to a broad range of investors. This growth is supported by ongoing efforts to expand the token’s presence across additional blockchains and DeFi platforms.</p>\n<p>Standard fees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Management fee: 0.05%</li>\n<li>Blockchain Administration Fee: 0.20%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arca Labs adheres to a transparent fee structure designed to be competitive while ensuring that the product remains sustainable. These fees cover the costs associated with managing, issuing, and redeeming ArCoin and maintaining its underlying portfolio.</p>\n<p>The management fee covers the portfolio’s costs, including fees paid to service providers and regulatory compliance costs. This fee is a common feature in today’s registered products. The blockchain administration fee covers compensation for the development and administrative services necessary for the issuance of the Fund’s shares and the ongoing maintenance of Fund Shares. Arca Labs is committed to maintaining a fee structure that is fair, transparent, and competitive. The fees are regularly reviewed by the Funds Board of Directors and adjusted as necessary to ensure that they remain aligned with the costs of managing the product and the needs of investors.</p>\n<p>Product permissioning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary users: Accredited investors, institutional clients, retail clients</li>\n<li>Secondary users: Approved DeFi protocols, liquidity providers<br>\nThe permissioning structure of ArCoin ensures that it is accessible to a wide range of users while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. Accredited investors, institutional clients, and retail are the primary users, while secondary users include DeFi protocols and liquidity providers that have been vetted and approved by Arca Labs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ArCoin remains compliant with U.S. securities laws while providing broad access to the product within the DeFi ecosystem. As a Registered Investment Advisor, Arca Labs meets the regulatory requirements associated with issuing digital securities. The inclusion of approved DeFi protocols and liquidity providers as secondary users ensures that ArCoin remains liquid and accessible within the broader DeFi market.</p>\n<p>Arca Labs is committed to maintaining a flexible and inclusive permissioning structure that meets the needs of traditional investors and DeFi space participants. This structure is regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it remains aligned with the evolving regulatory landscape and market dynamics</p>\n<p>Monthly transaction volume:</p>\n<p>Arca Labs is committed to supporting the growth of ArCoin’s transaction volume, leveraging potential partnerships with DeFi platforms, liquidity providers, and institutional clients to drive adoption and increase market activity.</p>\n<p>Expected and maximum time for subscriptions/redemptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arca Labs is committed to providing investors with a seamless experience. Its subscription and redemption processes are designed to be efficient and reliable. To date, there have been no interruptions in processing, underscoring the robustness of ArCoin’s operational framework.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Arca U.S. Treasury Fund is subject to all rules and regulations set forth by the 1940 Act. Thus, all subscriptions and redemptions follow stringent guidelines as laid out by the SEC. Subscriptions into the Fund are processed at the Net Asset Value (NAV) on the day that the corresponding wire is sent to the Fund Transfer Agent. Investors will receive their share representation as tokens in their Ethereum-compatible wallet after NAV is struck for the day their wire is received.</p>\n<p>The Fund currently offers investors the ability to redeem shares once a month during the redemption period, which is typically the first 10 business days of each month. Investors may submit the requested redemption amount at any time during that period. The shares submitted for redemption will be priced on the redemption pricing date. USD proceeds will be paid back to the investor within 7 days of the redemption pricing date.</p>\n<p>The expected time for subscriptions and redemptions is designed to be as short as possible while complying with relevant rules and regulations, providing investors with access to the market. Arca Labs has implemented robust processes and systems to ensure that these timeframes are consistently met, providing investors with accessibility to ArCoin.</p>\n<p>Arca Labs regularly reviews and optimizes the subscription and redemption processes to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of investors and remain aligned with market expectations. This commitment to operational excellence is a key driver of investor confidence and the overall success of ArCoin.</p>\n<p>Subscription and redemption process:<br>\nSubscriptions and redemptions for ArCoin can be made via USD. The process involves transferring funds to the transfer agent, who then issues or redeems the corresponding amount of ArCoin. This process is streamlined to ensure that investors can access or exit their positions with minimal friction. A detailed flowchart of the fund flow is available upon request, providing transparency into each transaction process step.</p>\n<p>The subscription process begins when an investor submits a request to purchase ArCoin. The investor transfers the required funds to the transfer agent, who then issues the corresponding amount of ArCoin to the investor’s blockchain wallet. The redemption process works in reverse, with the investor submitting a request to redeem ArCoin for fiat. The transfer agent then liquidates the necessary amount of U.S. Treasury securities and transfers the proceeds to the investor.</p>\n<p>The subscription and redemption processes are designed to be seamless and efficient, providing investors with access to ArCoin. The use of blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are transparent, secure, and fully traceable.</p>\n<p>Liquidity vehicles:<br>\nArca Labs has established paths to liquidity in the form of secondary markets operated by approved liquidity providers to enhance the efficiency of redemptions and subscriptions. These vehicles ensure that ArCoin remains liquid and accessible, even during high demand or market volatility periods. Additionally, listing ArCoin on an Alternative Trading System (ATS) provides investors with further liquidity options, allowing them to trade ArCoin on a regulated secondary market. This dual approach to liquidity ensures that ArCoin remains highly liquid and accessible, catering to the needs of both institutional and retail investors.</p>\n<p>The liquidity vehicles are designed to provide additional flexibility for investors. They allow them to buy and sell ArCoin on secondary markets without waiting for the standard subscription and redemption processes. This enhances the product’s overall liquidity and provides investors with greater control over their investments.</p>\n<p>Arca Labs works closely with approved liquidity providers to ensure that these vehicles operate smoothly and efficiently, providing a reliable source of liquidity for ArCoin holders. The use of secondary markets, including the ATS listing, helps to ensure that ArCoin remains competitively priced, reflecting its true market value at all times.</p>\n<p>Future development plans:<br>\nArca Labs is actively exploring opportunities to expand ArCoin to additional blockchains, thereby increasing its interoperability and accessibility. Future plans also include integrating new DeFi protocols and introducing additional U.S. Treasury-backed products that align with the needs of a diverse and growing investor base.</p>\n<p>The expansion to additional blockchains is a key part of Arca Labs’ strategy to increase the reach and impact of ArCoin. By making the token available on multiple blockchains, Arca Labs can tap into new markets and user bases, increasing the adoption and utility of the product. This expansion also enhances the security and resilience of ArCoin, as it reduces the reliance on a single blockchain infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In addition, we look to create new opportunities and applications for ArCoin inside and outside of the DeFi ecosystem. Our partnerships initiative aims to take advantage of those opportunities through dedicated teams that engage with upstart ideas that can leverage our unique '40 Act Fund structure.</p>\n<p>We look to create new opportunities and applications for ArCoin inside and outside of the DeFi ecosystem.

By decoupling yield from stability through AmpFi.Digital, you can address depegging risks, support higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios for issuers and users, and enhance returns through concentrated discount yield. Additionally, it can provide permissionless stability tokens linked to DAI.</li>\n<li>Zeconomy’s AmpFi.Digital ecosystem’s native token may be distributed to early participants, with further opportunities to purchase and participate in market making.</li>\n<li>If MakerDAO integrates GDCP into its treasury with a specified allocation, it could gain the right to appoint a representative on the governing board of the AmpFi.Digital.</li>\n<li>Finally, GDCP offers a straightforward on/off ramp with instant liquidity, off-chain transparency, and reduces credit risk and reliance on custodians, enabling more institutional participation in USDS and future synthetic real-world assets (RWAs).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We look forward to playing a role supporting the growth of Spark/Sky/MakerDAO’s ecosystem and joining forces to help shape the future of finance!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>DISCLAIMER:</p>\n<p>Nothing in this document or communication should be construed as, and may not be used in connection with an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or hold, an interest in any security or investment product in any jurisdiction, including the United States of America, its territories and possessions.

A separate portfolio is maintained for each sub-fund established under the Delta Master Trust, with each sub-fund having its own investment objectives and risks.<br>\nThe manager of the Fund is FundBridge Capital Pte. Ltd, a Singapore-based, MAS-licensed Fund Manager. The Investment Manager, through its Singapore-regulated fund management entity, will act as sub-advisor for the Fund.<br>\nThe Fund has been designed and structured in compliance with the existing financial regulations in Singapore, a leading legal and regulatory jurisdiction. The umbrella unit trust structure was specifically selected as the fund vehicle of choice for due to its many years of use by the industry for open-ended funds (including in the retail investor space) at scale off-chain.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please also referred to additional information submitted privately to GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>What regulatory bodies oversee the product?<br>\nTo be submitted privately to GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?<br>\nTo be submitted privately to GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product?

Consequently, the assets of the Fund will be held in trust by the Trustee and will not be affected by the liquidation of the Trustee, the Manager, the Sub-Advisor, Libeara or the liabilities of other sub-funds of the Delta Master Trust. In the event of the liquidation of the Trustee, the assets of the Fund will not form part of the Trustee’s own property and will not be included in the pool of assets to be distributed to the Trustee’s creditors.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Fund has been designed and structured in compliance with the existing financial regulations in Singapore, a leading legal and regulatory jurisdiction.

As such, the liquidation of the Custodian should not affect the assets of the Fund, which should be assessed by the liquidators to be held in trust for the Trustee (in its capacity as trustee of the Fund) and not be included in the pool of assets to be distributed to the Custodian’s creditors.

Once the Fund Administrator has reviewed the requests and performed the necessary off-chain activities needed to fulfill them, they then utilize a dedicated administrative portal to mint/burn the associated Fund tokens and complete the requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?<br>\nAudit performed by NCC Group. Further details submitted privately to GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs<br>\nAs the fund is new, there has been no previous relationship with MakerDAO or other DAOs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?<br>\nWhile there are a number of other tokenized funds in the market, we believe ours is among the most secure due to the legal approach to structuring (Unit Trust, a structure tested over decades in TradFi fund management) and the jurisdiction of issuance (Singapore, which has a clear framework for the regulation of tokenized securities). The  Fund is an offshore entity from a U.S. standpoint and maintains no U.S. nexus, reducing the potential risk of intervention by the U.S. SEC, the securities regulator in a jurisdiction that has not yet clarified treatment of tokenized securities, including tokenized U.S. Treasuries and Treasury funds.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Fund’s technology partner, Libeara, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Chartered Group, a leading global banking group and a supporter of digital asset initiatives across custody, trading, tokenized deposits, tokenized supply chain finance, wholesale and retail CBDCs and more. Standard Chartered Bank also banks a number of leading web3 projects in Asia and globally.</p>\n<p>The Fund is the second tokenized fund to be established by the Manager in collaboration with Libeara (the first being SGD Delta Fund, on which more information is provided in Section VI.4, below), with more tokenized funds and asset classes in the product pipeline. Once onboarded with the Manager, SparkDAO/MakerDAO will be able to access many of these other tokenized products as well.</p>\n<p>We believe the MakerDAO/Sky community would benefit greatly from the presence of the Investment Manager and Standard Chartered Group and their partners in the ecosystem.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Fund is not yet integrated in any other protocols or platforms, though we expect it to be within three-to-six months of launch. We view Fund and the subsequent tokenized funds we plan to issue as bridges between TradFi capital and DeFi functionality, especially given our relationship with Libeara, the tokenization platform provider, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<pre><code>Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Manager has also established the SGD Delta Fund which is another sub-fund of the Delta Master Fund that invests in invests in securities issued by the Government of Singapore, which could be relevant for any low-risk, currency diversification needs.</p>\n<p>The following documents will be submitted privately as supplementary information:<br>\n•\tInformation Memorandum<br>\n•\tTrust Deed<br>\n•\tSubscription Agreement<br>\n•\tNCC audit report<br>\n•\tSample of Investor monthly NAV report<br>\n•\tFund Factsheet<br>\n•\tRating Report for the SGD Delta Fund</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-libeara-usdlta-fund/25190\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-libeara-usdlta-fund/25190","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 17:03:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25190"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-libeara-usdlta-fund/25190.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application – Libeara (USDLTA Fund)"}},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Archax Ltd","dc:creator":"Archax","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<p>Grand Prix Application</p>\n<p>I.

Company Details</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Company description:<br>\nArchax has been focused on securities since its incorporation 6.5 years ago.

This combination of regulatory permissions enables us to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. Our vision is the tokenisation of all financial assets – we are a tokeniser, custodian, marketplace, and broker, allowing us to offer a one-stop shop for RWAs.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Key personnel biographies</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Graham Rodford | CEO &amp; Co-Founder<br>\nGraham is a qualified accountant, with over 25 years’ experience in financial services.

Product Information</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describe the product:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The basket token (bToken) is a weighted basket of up to 4 tokenised money market funds (tMMFs) that are accessed via Archax’s formal distribution agreements with some of the largest global asset managers (note: our distribution agreements allow us to tokenise more than just Money Market Funds).</p>\n<p>The specific asset managers and funds will be listed in the accompanying email.</p>\n<p>We create Beneficial Ownership Tokens (BoTs) that represent legally enforceable rights to the units in the underlying MMFs held in our FCA-regulated, London based custodian. [We can create natively digital MMFs too] The MMFs we tokenise tend to be the most institutional share classes of the respective asset managers (meaning the lowest fee structures) that trade at par to their NAV (1.0000 versus USD).</p>\n<p>All the funds are available for same day (T+0) subscription and redemptions, subject to cut-off times, and would settle T+1 if cut-off times are not met. In some cases, the products also provide intraday liquidity. Because of our connectivity to Circle, these amounts can be swapped to/from fiat seamlessly. Yields from the MMFs can either be distributed via airdrops of more tokens or distributed as stablecoins. There are no minimum or maximum subscription or redemption sizes.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Describe the underlying asset:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The specific asset managers and MMFs are included in a separate email. All the funds below are in USD, but Archax also provides MMFs in other currencies, such as GBP and EUR.</p>\n<p>Money Market Fund 1</p>\n<p>Domicile: Luxembourg</p>\n<p>The Fund invests in high quality US Dollar denominated money market instruments, with minimum liquidity maturity requirements, and invests in securities with an outstanding term to maturity of no more than 397 days. The entire Fund must have a weighted average maturity of no more than 60 days and a weighted average life (WAL) of no more than 120 days.</p>\n<p>Money Market Fund 2</p>\n<p>Domicile: Ireland</p>\n<p>The Fund invests in a broad range of government fixed income securities (such as bonds) and money market instruments (MMIs) (i.e. debt securities with short term maturities), reverse repurchase agreements and in cash. At least 99.5% of the Fund’s assets will be securities, instruments or obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States government or another sovereign government and reverse repurchase agreements referencing such assets and in cash.</p>\n<p>Money Market Fund 3</p>\n<p>Domicile: Ireland</p>\n<p>The fund invests in a diversified range of short-term instruments, including high quality money market instruments (including government securities, bank obligations, commercial paper and other short-term obligations), high quality securitisations and asset-backed commercial paper, deposits, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and units or shares in eligible money market funds. The weighted average maturity is expected not to exceed 60 days.</p>\n<p>Money Market Fund 4</p>\n<p>Domicile: Ireland</p>\n<p>The Fund invests in a range of investment grade fixed and adjustable-rate money market instruments which are transferable securities and primarily denominated in USD.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The 4 tMMFs detailed above are distributing share classes, meaning they maintain a price of 1.0000 (being at par to their NAV).</p>\n<p>This allows for T+0 (same day) subscription and redemption flows, with accrued interest either reinvested or air-dropped to the whitelisted wallet address of the bToken holder (note MMF will credit fiat or units at monthly).</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Depending on which of the MMFs, the issuer is based in either Luxembourg or Ireland, subject to the respective financial regulator in both jurisdictions (CSSF or CBI respectively) while Archax as the tokeniser and regulated custodian is based in London.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The bToken consists of tMMFs that are all beneficial ownership tokens representing legal title interests in AAA-rated public debt CNAV or LVNAV MMFs. Their respective investment mandates are dictated by the official prospectus of the individual fund and the appropriate EU regulations (EU Regulation on MMF and UCITS). The information on the specific funds will be provided directly to the process administrator via email.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each fund has its own hedging strategy. Whilst most money market funds do not explicitly contain hedges, the investment restrictions of each product may allow the asset manager to hedge depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc). Provide flow-charts or diagrams for all related entities and counterparties, if available.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This will be provided in a separate email.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>What is the AUM of the product?

Using our structure, we can usually avoid minimum subscription or redemption sizes creating a more flexible product.</p>\n<p>Archax will then charge the client a single fee (bps of aum) to cover fund access, tokenisation and custody. The fee will be included in a separate accompanying email, along with any information on a proposed discount. Archax does not charge any transaction, deposit or withdrawal fees for use of the MMF products.</p>\n<p>Note, in the event Archax issues an RWA utility token in the future, use of our tokenised RWA products may result in airdrops of that token to users as a long-term incentive for product adoption.</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Under UK and EU regulation, MMFs and tMMFs are considered security instruments. Archax therefore maintains a directory of whitelisted, KYC’d wallets that these tokens can be held in.</p>\n<p>Archax also owns a majority stake in Montis, a company applying for Central Securities Depositary regulation in Luxembourg under CSSF. Combined with Archax’s own permissions outlined above, Archax believes they will be uniquely positioned to be able to create, custody and trade digital securities in the near future bringing enhanced liquidity to RWA.</p>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li>What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The nature of these funds (see AUM reference in question 8), means daily and monthly volume is in the hundreds of millions.</p>\n<ol start=\"13\">\n<li>What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All the MMFs that would form the bToken are available on a same day subscription and redemption basis, subject to cut-off times, with the relevant transfer agent in some cases processing multiple daily redemption windows. If cut-off times are missed, the subscription or redemption will be processed T+1.</p>\n<p>We have not had any interruptions in our subscriptions and redemptions processing.</p>\n<ol start=\"14\">\n<li>Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process.

(i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Subject to the appropriate AML/KYC and chain analysis, Archax can accept subscriptions in USDC, Dai, other stablecoins or fiat currency. Archax may be able to accept other cryptocurrencies subject to operational considerations.</p>\n<ol start=\"17\">\n<li>What are your future development plans for the product?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Archax is developing a collateral transfer network across crypto, cash, securities and tokenised securities (including tMMFs) where KYC’d participants will be able to borrow, lend, purchase or sell, any asset at any time to any participant. This, and connectivity into other collateral networks, will bring significant utility to these tMMFs.</p>\n<p>IV. Legal Structure</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The referenced MMFs are investment companies incorporated with limited liability in Ireland or Luxembourg under the UCITs regime, and then duly authorised in Ireland or Luxembourg as a MMF UCITS.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The referenced MMFs and their managers are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) in Ireland and the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financie (CSSF) in Luxembourg respectively.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The underlying products are authorised in Ireland/Luxembourg as MMFs under the EU UCITs directive and the European Money Market Funds (MMF) Regulation.</p>\n<p>Archax is regulated as an exchange, broker, and custodian in the UK and was the first name on the FCA’s cryptoasset register. Archax has formal distribution agreements in place with the regulated global asset managers of the MMFs.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Legal assessment will be emailed to the process administrator.</p>\n<p>At the MMF level, the funds are run under the UCITS regime, adopted as the global gold standard of regulated fund structures. We will email further information to the process administrator.</p>\n<p>Archax operates subject to the FCA’s CASS regime. CASS rules are the regulations that financial service providers must follow when they hold or control client money or assets. The rules are designed to protect client assets if a firm fails or leaves the market.</p>\n<p>Underlying assets are held by Archax Nominees Limited, a bankruptcy remote entity which operates under English Trust law.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>What rights do tokenholders have?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For all securities offered on Archax, we pass through the rights to the Tokenholder.</p>\n<p>In addition to the rights on each issuance, the Tokenholder has rights with Archax as a client to whom Archax is providing a regulated service, including the right to complain to the regulator of Archax (the FCA) and to seek timely resolution.</p>\n<p>As a leading London based firm in the industry, we have a significant compliance function that can address any concerns.</p>\n<p>At the token instrument level itself, the Tokenholder has a legal claim under the Archax trust deed to enforce their (RWA) asset ownership in the English Courts, which we believe is recognised globally as one of the strongest and most readily enforceable claims that can be associated to an instrument.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>None. Ireland and Luxembourg do not claim taxing rights and Archax provides a custody service (to a foreign entity) which falls outside the UK taxing scope. We would however always recommend a client undertakes its own professional tax assessment based on its own unique set of circumstances.</p>\n<p>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The underlying funds follow transparent benchmarking, which is readily available - links will be provided by email to the process administrator.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All fund performance information is publicly and transparently available, but Archax will also provide account statements on a weekly or monthly basis in addition to account balances being visible on our platform.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The underlying UCIT funds are independently custodied by leading global custodians and the funds’ NAV and accounts are maintained by leading fund administrators. This is also subject to Depository oversight.</p>\n<p>Archax, being subject to CASS regulations, must reconcile client positions multiple times daily and is itself subject to audit.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Describe the technical implementation of your product:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The investing entity would open a regulated custody account with Archax. Once KYC has been completed the client can immediately instruct Archax to mint (subscribe) and (burn) redeem. Archax would then either custody the resulting tMMFs or whitelist &amp; send to the client’s self-hosted wallet.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Archax tokenisation engine was built in conjunction with 3rd party developer Applied Blockchain who routinely conduct internal audit processes. Additionally, by nature of the tMMFs being Beneficial Ownership Tokens, the underlying legal ownership of the actual MMF units sits in our FCA regulated custodian, so are protected from digital bad actors.</p>\n<p>Archax is also ISO27001 accredited, and Cyber Essentials certified.</p>\n<p>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Archax team met with Rune Christensen and team in 2019 to discuss the future of digital securities and the staff of Archax have used MakerDAO on a personal level.</p>\n<p>We are currently in the process of creating DAO structures for clients and working with local regulators to secure consent to issue. We therefore have a significant understanding of how to service a DAO Client.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have an inhouse built crypto due diligence platform which we use to service over 20 crypto companies. This platform provides due diligence reports on a number of DAOs on which our compliance team make decisions.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Archax is one of the leading regulated players in RWA and tokenised funds. We understand regulation and crypto alike. We can help the ecosystem move forward in a regulatory appropriate way whilst maintaining your innovative nature.</p>\n<p>In addition, by investing in these products, Archax will be bridging the gap between traditional finance companies and your DAO. This will help understanding on both sides whilst we strive toward a more efficient financial market.</p>\n<p>Once onboarded, you can access the full range of services Archax offers (all tokenised funds, custody, tokenisation, OTC trading, crypto exchange, plus support and consulting services related to digitising native and tradfi product offerings).</p>\n<p>As a regulated securities exchange and registered crypto exchange, Archax can also consider listing all related instruments, subject to appropriateness checks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in the event of an Archax issued utility token, the use of our tokenised RWA products may result in airdrops of that token to users of our products as a long-term reward for product adoption.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We work with a number of L1 / L2 / side chains to offer MMFs and other products to their ecosystems. We are also integrated with wealth and aggregator platforms in multiple jurisdictions to promote the product(s).</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yes. Our product roadmap will continue to manufacture further tokenised RWA products, including longer duration and higher yielding credit-linked funds, plus products from other asset classes.</p>\n<p>A single onboarding to Archax would give access to a multitude of treasury management products and fund offerings across the asset class and credit spectrum.</p>\n<p>Archax would like the chance to consider integration of our products more seamlessly into the ecosystem.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-archax-ltd/25189\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-archax-ltd/25189","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 16:06:24 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25189"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-archax-ltd/25189.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Archax Ltd"}},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Figure Markets Tokenized Treasury (FMTT)","dc:creator":"FigureMarkets","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-99107-i-product-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99107-i-product-summary-1\"></a>I.

One important integration which is yet to occur is 1inch - we believe that there is sufficient time period until spell execution for the implementation, assuming this recommendation is approved by the Stability Facilitator and executed by the Sky Decentralized Governance. We believe that sufficient time period has passed since the initiation of the migration process and that all remaining reserves in PSM-USDC-A should be migrated in order to optimize yield generation on Sky Ecosystem stablecoin reserves. At this point in time, we believe that LitePSM is sufficient for ensuring USDS &amp; DAI peg stability and PSM-USDC-A can be disabled.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99101-psm-usdc-a-related-parameter-changes-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99101-psm-usdc-a-related-parameter-changes-6\"></a>PSM-USDC-A Related Parameter Changes</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, once the liquidity migration is completed, the PSM-USDC-A will be disabled, by altering DC-IAM Line to 0 and disabling the DC-IAM.

Therefore, sufficient debt throughput and reserves have to be available in order to allow for efficient arbitrage with external markets which ensures price stability. Through the migration process, we recommended to maintain constant DC-IAM throughput availability, this proposal is following the same recommendation. Finally, the buf parameter (preminted DAI in the contract available for gas consumption optimized trading), which is excluded from the circulating supply, is set to 400M.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-99101-proposed-language-edits-to-atlas-v2-a3-the-stability-scope-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99101-proposed-language-edits-to-atlas-v2-a3-the-stability-scope-8\"></a>Proposed Language Edits to Atlas V2: A.3 - The Stability Scope</h1>\n<p>Should the above recommended parameter changes be approved and executed by Sky Decentralized Governance, BA Labs, acting as Stability Scope Advisor, requests the Governance Facilitator to reflect the updated values in the following Atlas articles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.3.4.1.5.1.3_Lite_Peg_Stability_Module_Parameter_Values-dc95774f-c069-4bfc-92a0-bad845c84cd2%7C57ea599773d45150b263\">A.3.4.1.5.1.3</a> - Lite Peg Stability Module Parameter Values</p>\n<p>The current values of the Lite Peg Stability Module parameters are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>tin</code>: 0%</li>\n<li><code>tout</code>: 0%</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>line</code>: 10,000,000,000</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>gap</code>: 400,000,000</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>ttl</code>: 43,200 seconds</li>\n<li><code>buf</code>: 400,000,000</li>\n<li>Authorized Parties: None</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lite-psm-usdc-a-phase-3-final-migration-proposed-parameters/25183\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lite-psm-usdc-a-phase-3-final-migration-proposed-parameters/25183","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 12:40:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25183"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lite-psm-usdc-a-phase-3-final-migration-proposed-parameters/25183.rss","#text":"LITE-PSM-USDC-A Phase 3 (Final Migration): Proposed Parameters"}},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Backed","dc:creator":"Backed","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-99100-i-product-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99100-i-product-summary-1\"></a>I.

Each bToken represents a debt certificate fully collateralized 1:1 by an underlying asset, such as ETFs or equities. Issued under an approved EU prospectus, bTokens are designed as retail-grade financial products, offering both security and compliance within the blockchain ecosystem. Regarding the specific bTokens proposed in this document, the following information is provided:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://assets.backed.fi/products/bib01\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bIB01 - Backed IB01 $ Treasury Bond 0-1y</a></p>\n<p>The Backed IB01 Treasury Bond 0-1yr (ticker symbol: bIB01) is a tracker certificate issued as an ERC-20 token. bIB01 tracks the price of the iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF (the underlying).</p>\n<p>The investment objective of the underlying is to track the investment results of an index composed of US dollar-denominated government bonds issued by the US Treasury, with remaining maturities between zero and one year.</p>\n<p>bIB01 is designed to give eligible cryptocurrency market participants regulatory-compliant exposure to US dollar-denominated government bonds issued by the US Treasury, whilst maintaining the benefits of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>One of our new products may be interesting for Sky, due to the 1-3 month maturity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://assets.backed.fi/products/bzpr1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bZPR1 - Backed ZPR1 $ 1-3 Month T-Bill (bZPR1)</a></p>\n<p>The Backed ZPR1 $ 1-3 Month T-Bill (ticker symbol: bZPR1) is a tracker certificate issued as an ERC-20 token. bZPR1 tracks the price of the SPDR® Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill UCITS ETF (Acc.) (the underlying).</p>\n<p>The investment objective of the underlying is to provide investors with a total return, taking into account both capital and income returns, which generally reflects the return of the Bloomberg US Treasury Bills 1-3 Month Index.</p>\n<p>Since bZPR1 is a new product that has not yet been minted, we will focus mainly on bIB01 for this application. However, the product structure is exactly the same. We tokenized bZPR1 specifically for use in stablecoin collateralization.</p>\n<p>With the recent Fed rate cut of 50bps, alternative real-world assets may become an important part of Sky’s needs. Backed is uniquely positioned to support Sky with future tokenization needs. Due to our scaleable product structure, we can deploy new tokenized versions of publicly traded ETFs and securities within a month. We already offer other fixed-income products such as Corporate Bonds, Eurobonds, and alternative US Bond ETFs.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Describe the underlying asset</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2.1) <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/307243/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF</a>:</p>\n<p>The iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1 yr UCITS ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of US dollar-denominated government bonds issued by the US Treasury, with remaining maturities between zero and one year.</p>\n<p>2.2) <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/no/en_gb/institutional/etfs/spdr-bloomberg-1-3-month-t-bill-ucits-etf-acc-zpr1-gy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SPDR® Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill UCITS ETF (Acc)</a></p>\n<p>The Bloomberg US Treasury Bills 1-3 Month Index is designed to measure the performance of public obligations of the U.S. Treasury that have a remaining maturity of greater than or equal to 1 month and less than 3 months.

Since Backed is not a broker/authorized participant it only onboards and sells its products to professional/qualified/accredited clients.</li>\n<li>Backed does not actively market nor solicit users outside Jersey / the EU / EEA. To the extent that qualified investors might come from outside the EU / EEA, this is done on a reverse solicitation basis.\n<ul>\n<li>Backed does not hold a Virtual Asset Service Provider (“VASP”) license, as it exclusively issues and redeems its own proprietary products (which are EU MIFID compliant securities in tokenized form). Backed does not provide any virtual asset services to its clients aside from selling its own issued products.

Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All Backed products are bankruptcy remote. bTokens are issued by an SPV, which is legally separated from Backed Finance AG, the tokenizer and the operator of the employment activity. A 1:1 ratio of underlying assets is maintained at all times and legally must be adhered to. The underlying assets are held with regulated Swiss custodian banks. An appointed security agent has the authority to seize the assets on behalf of token holders in case there is any deviation from the commitments the issuer has made or in a bankruptcy event. In a bankruptcy or insolvency situation, Security Agent Services AG take control of the custody accounts and liquidates the assets in favor of the token holders.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>What rights do token holders have?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Holders of bTokens are the legal owners of our structured products. The blockchain is the primary ledger in which ownership is defined. Holders of bTokens have the primary claim to the collateral value.</p>\n<p>The structured product is directly linked to the underlying asset, ensuring a connection between the real-world asset and the token counterpart. This can be viewed in the Final Terms of any of our products. As our products are issued under an approved EU prospectus, risks are clearly defined, and the products are retail-grade.</p>\n<p>When a user buys bTokens, they enter into a three-way agreement between themselves, Backed, and Security Agent Services AG. This Security Agent is obligated to act in the interest of the token holder in any instance where a complaint is lodged against Backed or if we go bankrupt. In the event we go bankrupt - and to be clear, this isn’t something we expect to happen - The Security Agent takes control of the custody accounts and liquidates the assets in favor of the token holders.</p>\n<p>The underlying assets are owned by our special-purpose vehicle, Backed Assets (JE) Limited, to ensure there is no commingling of user funds and to keep them separate in the event of bankruptcy.

Such taxes depend on the jurisdiction of the token holder and can not be anticipated by Backed.</p>\n<p>Backed recommends that Sky seeks professional tax advice to understand their specific tax obligations and reporting requirements related to investing in these products.

This unique solution has been developed by experienced institutions and professionals ensuring strict adherence to the highest standards in investment management, regulatory compliance and bankruptcy-protection. This strategic partnership combines the strengths of traditional finance and digital assets, offering tailored solutions designed to meet Sky’s specific investment needs.</p>\n<p><strong>A Partnership Built on Trust and Expertise</strong></p>\n<p>Project Serenity is built on a foundation of trust, shared expertise, and a proven track record. By leveraging decades of experience in both capital markets and the digital asset ecosystem, Sygnum and Fidelity International deliver compliant, regulated investment solutions that prioritize security, transparency, and flexibility.</p>\n<p>Sky (formerly MakerDAO) and Sygnum share a long and successful history of being the first partnership worldwide to implement real-world-assets treasury diversification at scale (see <a href=\"https://www.sygnum.com/news/sygnum-lead-partner-in-maker-half-billion-treasury-diversification/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">article</a> <em>“Sygnum lead partner in Maker half-billion treasury diversification”</em>).

The ICE BofA US Treasury Bills 0-3m Index serves as benchmark for the investment portfolio of the discretionary mandate.</p>\n<p>This on-chain investment solution is designed to be highly adaptable, allowing regular adjustments to meet Sky’s evolving investment and liquidity needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b) Institutional Liquidity Fund (ILF) – FIUSD Token</strong></p>\n<p>FIUSD Token: Fidelity International’s Institutional Liquidity Fund (ILF), a short-term money market fund known for its strong track record of performance.</p>\n<p>This on-chain investment solution offers direct access to a well-established multi-billion money market investment fund designed for simplicity and cost-efficiency.</p>\n<p>Both investment options are structured to offer attractive yields, competitive fee models and are safeguarded by the bankruptcy-remoteness of traditional securities and digital assets applicable for assets held in custody with a Swiss bank. Thanks to Sygnum’s ability to act as a collateralized lender against the FIBILL and FIUSD tokens, and in collaboration with Circle, as direct access point to USDC, Sygnum can offer 24/7/365 liquidity between $25m-$100m for both options.</p>\n<p>Project Serenity delivers a secure pathway into on-chain representation of the allocated assets. Combining the expertise of Sygnum and Fidelity International, this initiative provides a compliant, regulated approach to on-chain traditional securities investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Sygnum?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Pioneers in Digital Asset Banking:</strong></em> Sygnum is recognized as the world’s first digital asset bank with more than $4 billion in assets under custody and trusted by +1’900 institutional clients globally including leading digital asset foundations, entrepreneurs/founders, family offices, asset managers, brokers as well as other banks, deeply rooted in Switzerland and Singapore.

Product Summary</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Project name</strong></p>\n<p>Project “Serenity” embodies the harmonious and transformative partnership between Sygnum Bank AG (“Sygnum”) and Fidelity International, combining their respective strengths to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital assets economy.</p>\n<p>Sygnum and Fidelity International have formed a strategic partnership to pioneer the integration of institutional investment products into the blockchain ecosystem. As a significant first milestone of this partnership, Sygnum successfully launched the FIUSD (Fidelity ILF USD Fund Class G Acc) Token on ZKsync Era, marking a significant step towards the creation of an on-chain ecosystem for traditional securities. Building on this achievement, Sygnum partnered with Chainlink to bring the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund on-chain, further enhancing transparency and efficiency for future use cases.</p>\n<p>This partnership exemplifies a cross-industry approach aimed at advancing the tokenization of investment products and fostering collaboration within the global financial industry. Sygnum and Fidelity International aim to explore and launch additional strategic initiatives and products within the Web3 space, underscoring our shared vision for the future of finance.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Product name</strong></p>\n<p>Two investment products have been identified to suit this Request for Proposal (RFP), each offering distinct risk-return profiles. The options are designed to cater to different investment strategies and objectives, providing a range of options in terms of liquidity, duration and expected returns. The details of the two options are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>a)</strong> <strong>FIBILL Token:</strong> Discretionary Mandate: 0-3 Month US Treasury Bills (”T-Bills”), Benchmark: ICE BofA US Treasury Bills 0-3m Index</p>\n<p><strong>b)</strong> <strong>FIUSD Token:</strong> Fidelity International Institutional Liquidity Fund (ILF)</p>\n<p>Throughout this document, these options will be referred to as Option a) (FIBILL) and Option b) (FIUSD). An allocation can be made independently in Option a) or Option b), or in both.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Product type / underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Option a):</strong></em></p>\n<p>Direct Investment in a portfolio of short-dated T-Bills, managed under a Discretionary Mandate* by Sygnum, with Advisory Services** provided by Fidelity International. Sygnum issues tokens representing each a fraction T-Bills portfolio.***</p>\n<p>*<em>A discretionary mandate refers to an arrangement where an investor grants Sygnum full authority to make investment decisions and manage the client’s investment portfolio according to predefined investment guidelines or objectives set out in advance.</em></p>\n<p>**<em>Investment advisory refers to Fidelity International providing investment guidance and recommendations to Sygnum on how to effectively allocate the investment amount within the pre-defined investment guidelines and objectives.</em></p>\n<p>***<em>To enhance transparency at the asset level for the community, tokens can be issued for the underlying assets upon request.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Option b):</strong></p>\n<p>Investment into Money Market Fund - Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund (ILF) - The United States Dollar Fund distributed by Sygnum, who issues tokens through its regulated primary market issuance platform representing the ILF fund units.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

The portfolio will be rebalanced on a monthly basis, aiming to maximize returns while optimizing cost-efficiency, particularly in terms of portfolio turnover.</p>\n<p>As a discretionary mandate, the investment guidelines can be easily adjusted to accommodate Sky’s evolving needs, providing flexibility.

These are short-term government debt instruments issued by the US government with a high rating.

How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option a):</strong></p>\n<p>The yield generated by the T-Bill portfolio is passed on to tokenholders through daily price accrual, which directly incorporates the earned interest into the value of the FIBILL tokens. As a result, the token price consistently reflects the value of the (respective fraction of the) underlying T-Bill portfolio, including the cumulative interest earned by that T-Bill portfolio. When a bond reaches maturity, the funds made available are seamlessly reinvested in accordance with the mandate, ensuring continued alignment with the investment strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b):</strong></p>\n<p>The net income generated by the fund is allocated to tokenholders through daily price adjustments, directly integrating the earned net income into the value of the FIUSD token.

How is your product permissioned?

If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p>Sygnum with its direct access to state-of-the-art fiat and cryptocurrency/stablecoin capabilities, as well as its ability as a bank to provide collateralized lending facilities is uniquely positioned to provide maximum redemption and subscription efficiency.</p>\n<p>Sygnum, as a lender against the FIBILL or FIUSD tokens, in collaboration with Circle, as a direct access point to USDC, has designed a liquidity facility concept which increases the redemption and subscription efficiency significantly above current industry benchmarks. The designed process increases the 24/7/365 redemption and subscription capacity for option a) to more than $100 million and option b) to about $25m.</p>\n<p>The above liquidity facility setup is currently being established with final approvals from the respective governance bodies of both parties still pending.</p>\n<p><strong>16. With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p>Subscriptions are generally to be made in the currency of the underlying asset(s), which in both options is USD (e.g., if U.S. Treasury bills are only available for purchase in USD, then USD is the preferred currency the same applies for the ILF fund). Sygnum offers on- and off-ramping services for various cryptocurrencies including DAI and USDC, aiming to provide a seamless and efficient service. Please note that volume limits may apply.</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option a):</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks to the flexible discretionary mandate agreement setup the product can be adjusted to Sky’s needs and different market environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b):</strong></p>\n<p>Sygnum has concrete plans to enhance token features to include multi-chain compatibility as well as interoperability with other on-chain platforms and ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>In broad terms and applicable to both Options a) and b), the overall product can be described as a tokenized on-chain representation of the allocated treasury assets of Sky at Sygnum Bank. The legal structure of the token remains in principle (see the slightly different design below) the same for Option a) and Option b), however, the underlying assets will change.</p>\n<p><strong>Token</strong></p>\n<p>The FIBILL and FIUSD tokens are designed as an instruction token (Anweisungstoken; see art. 466 Swiss Code of Obligations) that represents the right of the respective token holder (i.e., Sky) vis-à-vis Sygnum to demand the delivery/sale of the underlying custody asset:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Option a):</strong> The FIBILL token gives the token holder the right to a fraction of the underlying asset portfolio (e.g., if there are 100 tokens, one token represents 1% of the underlying asset portfolio).</li>\n<li><strong>Option b):</strong> One token represents one fund unit of the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund (ILF). A new FIUSD token is issued for each new fund unit that is subscribed. If a fund unit is sold or redeemed, the corresponding FIUSD token is burnt. The FIUSD tokens therefore always represent the exact number of fund units invested via Sygnum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The FIBILL and FIUSD tokens will be issued as a ledger-based security under Swiss law in accordance with art. 973d et seqq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations. With ledger-based securities, Swiss law explicitly provides for the legal possibility of representing a value or right on-chain. Together with the well-established legal system in Switzerland, this provides full legal certainty in a renowned jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The proposed setup is structured in such a way that Sygnum will hold the assets in its own name but on behalf of Sky (i.e., a fiduciary setup in accordance with art. 16 para. 2 of the Swiss Banking Act to ensure that the assets are segregated in the unlikely event of Sygnum’s bankruptcy).</p>\n<p><strong>Option a)</strong> – Discretionary Mandate</p>\n<p>Sygnum will enter into a portfolio management mandate with Sky (or the relevant counterparty). Based on this portfolio management mandate Sygnum will be mandated to (i) acquire the underlying assets (of the product) and (ii) ensure that the strategy underlying Option a) is being adhered to on an ongoing basis. For this purpose, Fidelity International will advise Sygnum on the selection of the underlying assets and composition of the overall portfolio.</p>\n<p><strong>Underlyings</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option a):</strong></p>\n<p>For an overview of the underlyings see above <em>“3. Product type / underlying asset” under “I. Product Summary”</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b):</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is part of the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund, which is an umbrella fund with segregated liability between funds established as an open-ended investment company with variable capital organised under the laws of Ireland as a public limited company pursuant to the Companies Act 2014.</p>\n<p>There are currently four sub-funds established in the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund, The Euro Fund, The Sterling Fund, The United States Dollar Fund and The United States Dollar Treasury Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>On institution level:</strong></p>\n<p>Regarding the token(s) as such (i.e., not the underlying asset level), there is no direct product supervisory body. However, as a regulated Swiss bank, Sygnum is prudentially supervised by FINMA. This supervision aims at protecting creditors and maintaining the stability of the financial system (see <a href=\"https://www.finma.ch/en/supervision/banks-and-securities-firms/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Banking supervision | FINMA</a>). The authorization to operate as a bank in combination with Sygnum’s approved Organizational Regulations also authorizes Sygnum to operate as a portfolio manager as envisaged in Option a) (see art. 6 para. 1 of the Swiss Federal Act on Financial Institutions).</p>\n<p><strong>On product/underlying asset level:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund is domiciled in Ireland and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>On an institution level:</strong></p>\n<p>Sygnum Bank AG is an authorized Swiss bank and securities firm supervised by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and is authorized to operate as a portfolio manager.</p>\n<p><strong>On an advisory level:</strong></p>\n<p>FIL (Luxembourg) S.A. who acts as the counterparty for the advisory set-up is authorised and supervised in Luxembourg by the CSSF (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier). FIL (Luxembourg) S.A. is a MiFID Investment firm, authorised to provide amongst others portfolio management and investment advice.</p>\n<p>The company is registered in Luxembourg under the company number R.C.S. Luxembourg B 29112. The registered address is 2a, rue Albert Borschette, BP 2174 L-1021 Luxembourg.</p>\n<p><strong>On a product level:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund PLC – The United States Dollar Fund is an Irish domiciled fund which is authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland (the “Central Bank”) as an UCITS under the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2011.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>The chosen setup, in which Sygnum will hold the underlying assets in its own name but on behalf of Sky, is a fiduciary setup.</p>\n<p>According to art. 16 para. 2 of the Swiss Banking Act, tangible assets, securities and claims which a bank safekeeps on behalf of the depositor (i.e., Sky) are considered to be deposits as per art. 37d of the Swiss Banking Act and are therefore segregated by law in case of an unlikely event of bankruptcy of Sygnum. In other words, the underlying assets held by Sygnum on behalf of Sky are bankruptcy remote.</p>\n<p>This applies both to the underlying portfolio of T-Bills (Option a) as well as the underlying fund units (Option b).</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>The FIBILL and FIUSD tokens are designed as an instruction token (Anweisungstoken). The instruction token represents the right of the respective token holder (i.e., Sky) vis-à-vis the bank to demand the delivery or sale of a certain custody asset. <em>For further information see above: Section 4.1.</em></p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>As of the date of submission of this RFP, there are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers that would have a material impact on the products/services described herein.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong>.</p>\n<p>At this time, there is no known (unmitigated) conflict of interest that requires disclosure. Sygnum Bank AG has appropriate policies and procedures in place to adequately identify and mitigate (potential) conflicts of interests.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product.</strong></p>\n<p>Tokenizing the claim to the assets themselves is not expected to have any additional tax implications in Switzerland.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Sygnum is not entitled to provide any tax advice, hence the above information is for general information purposes only and does not constitute tax, legal or financial advice. It is recommended to consult a qualified tax, legal and/or financial advisor for specific tax questions or matters.

Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option a):</strong></p>\n<p>The solution replicates the BofA Treasury Bills 0-3m Index and delivered the following backtested performance. The deviation can be attributed, among other factors, to the goal of replicating the portfolio in a more (cost-)efficient manner.

Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs.</strong></p>\n<p>The Sky (formerly MakerDAO) and Sygnum relationship was established in early 2022 as a decisive moment for the digital assets industry to progress on the adoption of real-world-assets on-chain. Started per Improvement Proposal 65, Sygnum was selected as lead brokerage and custody partner by the Sky (formerly MakerDAO) community to diversify $500 million of the collateral asset pool backing DAI into traditional securities, particularly into liquid bond strategies under the structure of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) marking thereof one of the most notable collaborations to enable the adoption of real-world-assets by blockchain communities. Most notably this was the first collaboration established with a banking institution attesting Sygnum’s conviction into the blockchain ecosystem and particularly Sky (formerly MakerDAO) and its vision.</p>\n<p>Sygnum’s extensive experience in serving as interface between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem is built on the premise of our unique regulatory status as bank and securities firm which provides additional assurances to Sky such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extensive options for liquidity</strong> achieved via Sygnum’s ability to act as a lender as well as professional broker with access to an underlying network of institutional liquidity providers built and operated over 5 years.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bankruptcy remoteness</strong> for traditional securities and digital assets held under custody with Sygnum anchored in the Swiss Banking Act, art. 16 and 37d.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Strong industry presence</strong> and existing partnerships with key members of the Spark ecosystem such as ZKsync and Chainlink (as Sygnum tokenized $50m of Matter Labs’ treasury reserves onto the ZKsync blockchain, see <a href=\"https://www.sygnum.com/news/sygnum-matterlabs_treasury-fidelity/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">article</a>) or Polygon, on which Sygnum built its multi-chain tokenization stack (supporting Hamilton Lane, leading global private markets investment management firm with over $800bn in assets, in launching DLT-registered shares for a flagship product on the Polygon blockchain, see <a href=\"https://www.hamiltonlane.com/en-us/news/sygnum-bank-apex-dlt-registered-shares\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">article</a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The transparent on-chain portfolio construction used in option a) is a powerful showcase of asset management solutions leveraging the blockchain’s key features of transparency and efficiency.</p>\n<p>We believe that on-chain representation of individual components such as T-Bills, equities and derivatives will enable real-world-asset (RWA) DeFi applications such as collateralized RWA lending, on-chain portfolio management solutions and on-chain structured products.</p>\n<p>Consequently, we see this proposal as a major showcase and industry enabler to drive adoption of on-chain RWA asset management and structured finance solution. These solutions may be integrated into SparkDAO and/or the Sky ecosystem in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>The FIBILL and FIUSD tokens use the ERC20 standard. Through using the ERC20 standard we ensure compatibility with any platform adhering to that standard.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>Fidelity International and Sygnum are currently in the process of developing a new product to shape future on-chain finance. Due to the sensitive nature of this product, Fidelity International and Sygnum are unable to disclose specific details publicly at this time. Fidelity International and Sygnum look forward to sharing more information confidentially with Sky and to making it public when appropriate.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-sygnum-bank-ag-fidelity-international-fibill-fiusd/25177\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-sygnum-bank-ag-fidelity-international-fibill-fiusd/25177","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 10:28:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25177"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-sygnum-bank-ag-fidelity-international-fibill-fiusd/25177.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Sygnum Bank AG & Fidelity International (FIBILL & FIUSD)"}},{"title":"Risk Assessment and Parameter Recommendations: Spark DDM to Aave Lido Market","dc:creator":"monet-supply","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<p>Reviewing the items proposed by Phoenix Labs <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-proposal-for-integrations-into-aave/25005\">here</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>sUSDS supply on Aave V3 Main Market are eligible for the SPK pre-farming airdrop incentive program for 3.33m SPK tokens per month (50% of SparkLend)</li>\n<li>USDS D3M to Aave Lido Market with an initial debt ceiling of 100m to boost adoption</li>\n</ol>\n<p>BA Labs supports the proposed changes.

There is an <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboard-steaklrt-to-aave-v3-lido-instance/18613\">active proposal</a> to list Steakhouse’s Mellow/Symbiotic restaking vault steakLRT as a collateral asset, and additional Mellow/Symbiotic vaults or other Lido aligned collaterals may be listed in the future at the discretion of Aave governance. It is also assumed that USDS will be listed as a borrowable asset to facilitate injection of liquidity via the proposed DDM, and potentially other stablecoins may be listed as borrowable and/or collateral assets (for example Aave’s GHO stablecoin).</p>\n<p><strong>Normal Mode Parameters</strong></p>\n<p>Parameters for the existing listed collaterals, ETH and wstETH, are quite safe. wstETH features 81% liquidation threshold (1% higher than SparkLend) and 6% liquidation penalty (1% less than Sparklend), while ETH features equivalent LT and penalty parameters vs SparkLend. All of these parameters are reasonably conservative and should not present any serious concern even for very large deployments of USDS liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquid Restaking Tokens</strong></p>\n<p>Addition of steakLRT presents some potential risk due to the asset’s liquidity profile and proposed parameters at Aave. SteakLRT currently has less than $1 million worth of secondary market liquidity depth from a single Balancer pool. Due to the way Mellow LRTs work, large number of LRT vault operators fragmenting liquidity, and Mellow’s expected business strategy, we do not anticipate secondary market liquidity will improve much in the future. Given this, exchanging steakLRT (or other Mellow LRTs) for underlying wstETH will primarily rely on the native redemption process. This is expected to take around 1 week in normal conditions, but may take up to a maximum of 90 days if the vault curator in question is unresponsive.</p>\n<p>This delay period is not too problematic when considering borrowing ETH correlated assets, but may increase risk for steakLRT collateral positions that borrow stablecoins such as USDS, as liquidators will not be able to loop their capital atomically if the small amount of DEX liquidity has been exhausted. The proposed liquidation threshold parameter of 75% is acceptable given the initial supply cap of 240 units of steakLRT, but will require DEX liquidity to scale up to maintain adequate safety if supply caps are raised in the future. Risk could be mitigated by setting lower normal mode liquidation threshold and higher liquidation penalty for steakLRT, or by implementing an isolation mode mechanism that prevents excessive borrowing of stablecoins from accounts with steakLRT collateral. Alternatively, the recently proposed new version of the Aave codebase (version 3.2) includes a feature called <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-2-liquid-emodes/19037\">Liquid eModes</a> which may allow for more fine tuned parameterization of LRT assets, which may offer a more efficient way to address these liquidity risks.</p>\n<p>Additional Lido aligned LRTs may be considered for listing in the future. However, because the existing Balancer pool pairs four separate LRTs with the same finite amount of wstETH, listing additional LRTs is not expected to improve the functional liquidity profile of the given assets (LRTs compete for the same pool of liquidity resources).</p>\n<p><strong>ETH Efficiency Mode</strong></p>\n<p>Aave v3 features an efficiency mode (e-mode) mechanism allowing for subsets of listed assets to have greater capital efficiency. Typically this is applied to price correlated assets such as stablecoins or liquid staking tokens. In the case of the Lido market, e-mode is currently applied to ETH and wstETH, with a proposal to also list steakLRT in e-mode when it is formally onboarded by governance.</p>\n<p>Parameters for ETH e-mode in the Lido market are fairly aggressive, featuring a 93.5% maximum LTV and 95.5% liquidation threshold, each 0.5% higher than the comparable Aave main market and the LT being 2.5% higher than the SparkLend mainnet market. Aave uses a redemption rate pricing mechanism for wstETH (and plans to do the same for steakLRT), so there is no risk of price manipulation or flash crashes causing insolvencies in the market. Note that Aave main market and SparkLend also use redemption rate pricing rather than a live market price.</p>\n<p>While redemption rate is better from a risk perspective overall, it means that the margin system will not account for any secondary market price depegs that may occur during stressed market conditions. If the price of wstETH or a supported LRT depegs at least as much as the liquidation penalty (currently 1%), then it will not be profitable for liquidators to bid on positions collateralized by the given collateral; liquidations would not be triggered based on market price, but might become eligible due to interest accrual if the interest rate on the borrowed asset exceeds yield earned on collateral. And if the collateral asset depegs below the liquidation threshold (eg. if price trades below 95.5% of redemption price), then end users will be able to borrow more than the value of their collateral. This implies that if the price of a supported e-mode collateral ever falls below the e-mode LT, all borrowable liquidity for ETH will be exhausted. This could increase risk of insolvency of accounts that supply ETH to borrow stablecoins, where even a temporary inability to withdraw ETH from the market can prevent liquidators from participating fast enough to avoid bad debt.</p>\n<p>ETH currently has a 0% LTV parameter set, which was implemented to avoid non-economical recursive borrowing of ETH while Lido incentives are provided for ETH suppliers. In practice, this means that accounts supplying ETH as collateral cannot open any new borrow positions, so the risk to stablecoin suppliers including the proposed DDM is currently not applicable. However, it is expected that this 0% LTV limit will be lifted at some point in the future and ETH’s liquidity risk will become an important factor for evaluating the DDM’s overall risk profile. Potential mitigation strategies include implementing a market price oracle based kill switch like the one in use on SparkLend (which prevents borrowing activity when stETH depegs), careful calibration and maintenance of supply caps to avoid ETH reaching 100% utilization, a higher slope 2 rate model parameter to incentivize liquidity, or adjustments to ETH e-mode parameters to reduce the likelihood of collateral price falling below LT in worst case conditions.</p>\n<p>While the ETH liquidity risk factors noted above are more pronounced with the Aave Lido market vs SparkLend, due to higher e-mode LT for wstETH, we note that stETH has not experienced a significant depeg that would approach the 95.5% LT since Ethereum staking withdrawals were enabled in April 2023. The largest price divergence over the past year was a very brief depeg down to ~0.993 ETH per stETH on 10 January 2024. So while additional mitigation measures may help improve risk profile, overall we find the liquidity risk to be acceptable for the proposed DDM deposit of USDS.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99090-recommended-parameters-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99090-recommended-parameters-3\"></a>Recommended Parameters</h3>\n<p>The proposed DDM mechanism will utilize a facilitator multisig to direct increases or decreases to DDM exposure, rather than a <code>bar</code> parameter that increases or reduces exposure based on a borrow rate target.</p>\n<p>The relevant parameters for the DDM are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>line</code>: Maximum debt ceiling</li>\n<li><code>gap</code>: Temporary debt ceiling / maximum incremental debt ceiling change</li>\n<li><code>ttl</code>: Minimum cooldown period between when <code>gap</code> debt ceiling increases can be triggered</li>\n<li><code>tau</code>: Period after which bad debt is written off</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the <code>line</code> parameter, this is recommended to be set initially at 100 million USDS, aligning with the strategic agreement for the Aave Lido market DDM. Given the low risk profile of market collateral assets and parameters, this exposure limit should be quite safe, and it is expected that Spark may progressively raise the <code>line</code> parameter in the future if there is strong borrowing demand and the risk profile of the market doesn’t significantly change.</p>\n<p>Because increases in exposure are directed via the facilitator multisig, which is a trusted role, the <code>gap</code> parameter is only needed as a secondary safeguard against excessive pace of exposure growth. We recommend to set <code>gap</code> at 50 million USDS, which will allow for exposure to be scaled up quickly after launch of the DDM and provide flexibility for managing exposure, while still serving as a meaningful limit against rapid exposure growth. We recommend setting <code>ttl</code> at 24 hours, as operationally it is not expected that the facilitators will perform more than one allocation action per day.

Product Information</strong><br>\n<strong>1.\tDescribe the product</strong></p>\n<p>The principal investment objective of this Fund is to maximise current income in USD terms consistent with liquidity and the preservation of capital.</p>\n<p>The Fund will invests all or substantially all of its assets in a Short-term Money Market Fund as defined in the European Securities and Markets Authority’s Guidelines of 19 May 2010 on a Common Definition of European Money Market Funds (“Underlying Fund”). The Underlying Fund invests only in US Treasury securities and repurchase agreement relating to those instruments. Key focus is on safety, diversification and liquidity in the portfolio construction process.</p>\n<p>The Underlying Fund uses SOFR – Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a reference benchmark. We therefore have investment guidelines governing how much risk we are allowed to take and how much flexibility / allocation bandwidth we have, but it is not against the reference benchmark.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tDescribe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>In pursuit of its investment objective, the Underlying Fund will invest in U.S. Treasury bills (short term fixed rate U.S. government issued debt instruments with maturities ranging from a number of days to a year). Such instruments will have, or will be deemed to have, remaining maturities of 397 days or less. The Fund will maintain (i) a weighted average maturity of no more than 60 days; and (ii) a weighted average life of no more than 120 days.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tHow is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>Daily price accrual.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tWhat is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>The issuer/Fund is a Singapore domiciled Variable Capital Company (“VCC”) which was incorporated with limited liability in Singapore.</p>\n<p>The investment manager appointed to manage the issuer is a holder of a capital markets services license for fund management and dealing in capital markets products pursuant to the Securities and Futures Act 2001 of Singapore and is regulated by the MAS.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>The Underlying Fund shall hold at least 10% of its Net Asset Value in daily maturing assets, reverse repurchase agreements which are able to be terminated by giving prior notice of one Business Day or cash which is able to be withdrawn by giving prior notice of one Business Day.</p>\n<p>The Underlying Fund shall hold at least 30% of its Net Asset Value in weekly maturing assets, reverse repurchase agreements which are able to be terminated by giving prior notice of five Business Days or cash which is able to be withdrawn by giving prior notice of five Business Days.</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tAre any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>The Underlying Fund may, while observing the investment guidelines, conduct derivative transactions.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong><br>\n<strong>1.\tDescribe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>The Asset Manager and DigiFT are strategic partners to bring RWA securities to Web3, making blockchain driven finance a reality, providing critical infrastructure for value exchange across new and mature investment ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>Asset Manager</strong><br>\nThe Fund Token smart contract was developed and deployed by Asset Manager’s in-house tokenization service. It was designed to bring various “real world assets\" on-chain and is a core part of Asset Manager’s global distributed ledger technology corporate strategy, focused on leveraging public and private blockchains networks for enhanced fund issuance and distribution</p>\n<p><strong>DigiFT</strong><br>\nDigiFT is the first and only RWA exchange on Ethereum public blockchain with a Capital Market Services (CMS) License and is approved as a Recognized Market (RMO) Operator by MAS. With these licenses, DigiFT is approved to offer:<br>\n•\tPrimary market issuance and broker-dealer services<br>\n•\tSecondary marketplace ‘wallet to wallet’ order-matching (via AMM, OTC or P2P), transfer agent and settlement services<br>\n•\tAccept fiat, stablecoins and cryptocurrencies for trading of RWA tokens</p>\n<p>DigiFT has been successfully granted authorisation to deploy a hybrid approach that combines DeFi technology and processes, offering decentralised ‘wallet to wallet’ RWA trading, while successfully configuring public chain permission standards (ERC-20) to meet the highest regulatory and compliance standards, acceptable to the Singapore MAS. This well vetted combined approach allows DigiFT to confidently provide the required “Trust Anchor” bridge when delivering sustainable yield and value transfer between both DeFi and TradFi industries.</p>\n<p>DigiFT has successfully listed over 12 tokens in the past 24 months, including a corporate debt note by Diners Club, single U.S. T-Bills, high-yield bank bonds and money market fund. As an on-chain exchange, DigiFT’s team also have experience working with DeFi protocols and decentralized organizations, such as payment channels, lending protocols and CeDeFi protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tBeyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Adding Stability and Credibility to the Stablecoin Reserve</strong><br>\nThe Fund lowers the counterparty risk for SparkDAO and/or Sky ecosystem. With an established presence across the world, the Asset Manager has been a dependable partner globally for over 100 years. The Asset Manager brings exacting standards, robust investment processes and a true focus on high-quality client service delivery, all underpinned by the safety and security of the broader group.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversification of Assets</strong><br>\nDigiFT is grateful for the opportunity to provide SparkDAO and/or Sky the opportunity to diversify its holdings across both asset class and managers. Digital assets have developed substantially over the last ~10 years and have further room to mature. Diversified allocation to lower volatility assets is critical to ensure long term success. Our long-term investment and risk management experience in developed investment markets (TradFi) guides this core principle. We believe the Fund offers an unique opportunity for SparkDAO and/or Sky to benefit from Asset Manager’s experience and institutional approach in money market investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Capital Efficiency and Best Execution</strong><br>\nAsset Manager operates a global research platform shared by all of the firm’s research analysts located in the main financial centres around the world. We employ a team of 30+ credit research analysts divided into industry and regional coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>Institutional Risk Management</strong><br>\nRisk control is an important aspect for the asset management business particularly to prevent liability and reputation damage. The highest standards of risk identification, risk management, and risk control are indispensable to the success, reputation, and continuing strength of the business group, and its management and staff is thus committed to developing and applying best market practice to all risk activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple liquidity solutions</strong><br>\nThe settlement period for redemption at the Fund level is T+0. In addition, SparkDAO and/or Sky will be able to experience instant liquidity solution as well as P2P and OTC facility on DigiFT’s platform, offering SparkDAO and/or Sky multiple access points to liquidity 24/7.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic Collaborations</strong><br>\nAs the distributor, DigiFT can offer other Asset Manager’s solutions across major traditional and alternative asset classes – from active to passive including a comprehensive sustainable investing offering to diversify SparkDAO and/or Sky collateral base, adding high quality reserve assets to the portfolio.</p>\n<p>Secondly, DigiFT, as a regulated channel for DeFi and TradFi, can connect DeFi protocols with mainstream finance. For example, we can structure sDAI or sDAI-backed products as a security to allow family office/fund access to sDAI in a regulatory compliant manner. DigiFT can also list DAI/USDS as a trading currency against capital market products on DigiFT Exchange, expanding the use case for Sky’s DAI/USDS.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tDoes the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>SparkDAO and/or Sky will be among the first few protocols that the Fund is made available to, with the aim to extend the use cases with other suitable protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tDo you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. We offer investment capabilities and styles across all major traditional and alternative asset classes – from active to passive including a comprehensive sustainable investing offering to institutions.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-digift-on-behalf-of-a-tier-1-asset-manager/25174\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-digift-on-behalf-of-a-tier-1-asset-manager/25174","pubDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 09:22:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25174"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-digift-on-behalf-of-a-tier-1-asset-manager/25174.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - DigiFT (on behalf of a Tier-1 Asset Manager)"}},{"title":"Postmortem: Incorrect Total Supply Metric on Info SKY dashboard","dc:creator":"commanderkeen","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Date: 2024-09-20</p>\n<p><strong>Incident Summary:</strong><br>\nWe discovered that the total supply metric displayed on our dashboard <a href=\"https://info.sky.money/\">info.sky.money</a> was inaccurate due to an incorrect calculation.

To keep the momentum going, I am preparing an Atlas edit proposal that will pave the way for a rapid short term expansion and deep integration of Sky on Solana by bridging SKY, USDS, and sUSDS via Wormhole, and implementing a short term liquidity incentive program that provides SKY tokens for DeFi integrators of USDS and SKY on Solana, to pave the way and build early network effects for the full Solana SkyLink deployment.</p>\n<p>Solana is the second major DeFi ecosystem after Ethereum and its L2s, and while still not nearly as big as Ethereum it has the potential to soon catalyze larger scale growth as many of the key primitives already exist and have significant lindy effects on Solana. What is currently missing, however, is exactly what USDS and Sky offers: A decentralized stablecoin that can access a native savings rate and token rewards, and eventually deploy large scale capital into high value opportunities in trusted Solana DeFi protocols.</p>\n<p>There is a huge opportunity for synergy and integration from deploying Solana SkyLink, but it is also more advanced due to the differences between EVM and SVM.

Product Information</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe the product</strong><br>\nWe introduce IVVIA, a novel approach to real estate acquisition through tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). The term “to ivviate” has been coined to describe the process of gradually buying out a tokenized property. The ivviator can progressively acquire tokens, eventually becoming the sole owner—similar to a mortgage but without the burdens. Meanwhile, ivviatees (investors) profit by selling their tokens at market value and collecting rental income.<br>\nThis process begins with creating a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), raising funds to purchase the property, and tokenizing it via the IVVIA smart contract.</p>\n<p>Based on historical data (see Example calculations), IVVIA offers several advantages over traditional mortgages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Faster:</strong> Full ownership can be achieved in 15.5 years, compared to 20 years with the same monthly payments.</li>\n<li><strong>Cheaper:</strong> The ivviator can save $166K in total expenses versus a comparable mortgage.</li>\n<li><strong>More lucrative:</strong> Investors could see $1.2M in gains compared to $533K in a traditional mortgage scenario.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IVVIA will attract people who want to buy a home or are currently paying off a mortgage and are looking for relief from it. It also appeals to individual real estate investors who would usually have to borrow the remaining amount from a bank to buy property.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=14NtP7Ue5JhJgZO7-Vf1chzMjP8OFobTZ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">White Paper</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1znlc43AdaqG-WpylMEOS04aSCy78_HlY-IYLFltkG7g/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Example calculations</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Describe the underlying asset</strong><br>\n<strong>Real Estate.</strong> The underlying asset in IVVIA is real estate, typically residential, though commercial properties can also be tokenized. In the basic IVVIA model, investors pool their funds to form a trust, which then purchases the property and issues tokens representing trust units. These ivvia tokens reflect ownership units in the trust. Alternatively, parties may choose different legal entities for their DAO, such as corporations (e.g., RealT in the U.S.) or DAO LLCs (e.g., in Wyoming), to structure their DAO vehicles and manage the property.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong><br>\n<strong>Property Value Appreciation:</strong> Ivviatees (investor token holders) earn yield through the monthly buyout process, where the ivviator (the beneficiary) purchases their tokens. Ivviatees can set their own selling price, and their profit comes from the margin between the original investment price and the sale price of their token share. If the ivviator does not purchase the tokens, they are auctioned publicly, allowing ivviatees to exit and new investors to enter.<br>\n<strong>Rent Distribution:</strong> The property is leased, and rental profits are distributed regularly to token holders. This distribution can occur monthly, weekly, or fortnightly, as specified in the smart contract.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong><br>\nAt this stage, it’s important to distinguish between <strong>IVVIA as an asset class</strong> (a type of DAO) and <strong>IVVIA Partnership</strong> as a software development company, which does not intend to operate as an asset provider.<br>\n<strong>IVVIA Partnership</strong> is a <strong>protocol-level project</strong> offering B2B services to facilitators and operators of property tokenization (ivviation) using the IVVIA protocol. We provide the technology to service providers, who then offer it to consumers in various jurisdictions.<br>\nIn this structure, the <strong>issuer</strong> is the entity responsible for tokenizing (ivviating) a particular property. It is generally expected that the issuer operates in the same jurisdiction as the property or, at minimum, holds the necessary legal authorization (such as a financial license) required in that jurisdiction.<br>\nWe plan to launch <strong>demo cases</strong> in <strong>Australia</strong> and the <strong>UK</strong>, with future expansions into the <strong>US</strong>, <strong>EU</strong>, and other regions. These plans are tentative, and entering the US market may be prioritized.<br>\nThis version keeps the focus clear while improving flow and readability. Let me know if you’d like any further adjustments!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong><br>\nThe property (a land title or an apartment unit) must be marketable, meaning it must be registered in a land registry (in the UK, Australia, or the EU) or have an unbroken chain of title (for the U.S.). The property may have an existing mortgage; however, as a result of ivviation (tokenization), it must be free from any encumbrances or third-party interests. The title should then be transferred to a trust controlled by the interested parties: the ivviator (the property beneficiary) and the ivviatees (investors). If this condition is not met, the property cannot be ivviated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong><br>\nNo. At least in the first version of the ivvia smart contract.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc). Provide flow-charts or diagrams for all related entities and counterparties, if available.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>IVVIA Partnership (Tech Provider)</strong>: (it’s us) Provides the IVVIA application and smart contracts to facilitate property tokenization.

The Trust Manager may be a professional licensed provider or a non-professional custodian in self-managed DAOs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ivviator (DAO Beneficiary)</strong>: The primary investor of the DAO, who holds rights such as the <strong>BUYOUT ROFR</strong> and <strong>LEASE ROFR</strong>. The ivviator can gradually buy tokens from ivviatees and pay rent for the property.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ivviatee (DAO Investors)</strong>: Investors who hold tokens in the DAO.

This ensures compliance with legal and regulatory standards while maintaining the integrity of the tokenized property system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong><br>\nIrrelevant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Maximum/Expected Term:</strong><br>\nIVVIA is designed to function as a mortgage replacement, with an expected term similar to traditional mortgages, typically around 20 years or more, providing long-term stability. Our projection however shows that acquiring the property under the similar conditions will take 15.5 years.<br>\n<strong>Minimum Possible Term:</strong><br>\nUnlike traditional mortgages, IVVIA offers flexibility with its entry and exit points. The minimum possible term is as short as one day from the token’s issuance, allowing for rapid liquidity if needed. Additionally, IVVIA guarantees an exit time of up to two months at any point, ensuring users can always exit within a reasonable period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DAO’s Phases:</strong><br>\n<strong>Initial Phase:</strong> This phase involves investment subscriptions (contributions) from members to fund the property purchase. If the target is met, the property is bought. If not, all contributions are fully redeemed and returned to investors.<br>\n<strong>Operational Phase:</strong> In this phase, the DAO beneficiary (ivviator) buys tokens from other investors (ivviatees) and pays rent for the property. If the ivviator does not purchase the tokens, they are sold in a public auction.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Subscriptions and Redemptions:</strong><br>\n<strong>Ivviator’s Down Payment:</strong> The ivviator, who intends to acquire the property, initiates the DAO with their down payment and becomes the first subscriber. In addition to receiving tokens proportional to their investment, the ivviator gets two tokens representing Rights of First Refusal (ROFR):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BUYOUT NFT:</strong> This grants the ivviator the priority right to buy out ivviatees’ tokens through periodic installments.</li>\n<li><strong>LEASE NFT:</strong> This grants the ivviator the right to lease the property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ivviatees’ Contributions:</strong> Ivviatees invest to reach the target property price. Their contributions are locked during the fundraising period (set between 1 to 12 months), and refunded in full if the target is not raised. After reaching the target, funds are converted to fiat by the Ivvia Manager, who facilitates the property purchase and title conveyance.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational BUYOUT Subscriptions and Redemptions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Regular Monthly Buyouts:</strong> The Ivviator have the right to purchase ivviatees’ tokens at a price determined by the ivviatees each month. Ivviators usually follow a long-term plan (similar to a mortgage, around 20 years) to buy out all the tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Outstanding Buyouts:</strong> Ivviatees can offer to sell any number of tokens to the ivviator, who has a month to respond. If the ivviator does not purchase, the tokens are auctioned.</p>\n<p><strong>Ivvia Auction:</strong> Auctions occur when the ivviator does not buy tokens during the outstanding offer or the regular monthly cycle. An English-style auction is held, where bids increment until the highest bidder wins. Ivviators can use a reserve price, effectively bidding to prevent underpriced sales.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational LEASE Subscriptions and Redemptions:</strong><br>\nThe ivviator pays rent based on the established price, which is locked for each 12 months. Two months before the lease ends, members can propose a new rent price, voted on proportionally by token holdings. A 75% majority is required to pass a new rent. If no proposal succeeds, the rent remains the same. The person who puts forward the proposal is not allowed to vote, ensuring that someone holding 75% of the shares cannot both offer the price and vote for it to manipulate the decision. This prevents the ivviator from depriving the ivviatees of rent revenue once her share reaches 75%, or an ivviatee to jack up the price.</p>\n<p><strong>Price Feeds by Oracles:</strong><br>\nOracles provide property and rent price data, which helps guide buyout pricing. It is optional, parties may always pursue their own economic strategy that aligns with the concept of decentralized finance and free market.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong><br>\nIVVIA has established a liquidity mechanism through the IVVIA auction, designed to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency by letting members sell shares publicly if private sales are not agreed upon. This ensures liquidity and fair pricing through open market participation.<br>\nThe auction works by setting a price for the shares, and if not accepted, the tokens are sold at auction with bids incrementing until a final buyer is determined. This process ensures efficient and transparent transactions.<br>\nFor details, see IVVIA White Paper, section 'Ivvia auction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong><br>\nThe smart contract will feature its own legal tender (or multiple tenders), which all parties agree to accept unconditionally, providing a stable and reliable medium for transactions. This legal tender will likely be a stablecoin to ensure consistency in value.<br>\nIn addition to the legal tender, the contract will allow for optional assets that members can agree upon on a case-by-case basis for specific exchanges. This flexibility enables parties to use various assets when mutually agreed upon, while ensuring stability through the base legal tender.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What are your future development plans for the product?</strong><br>\nWe plan to develop the full IVVIA technology stack, which includes smart contracts and a user-facing application, and commercialize it as a SaaS platform.<br>\nTo demonstrate its business viability, we will launch demo cases in selected jurisdictions. Local operating companies are intended for sale (once they accomplish their mission on introduction of ivvia on the local market), as IVVIA Partnership adheres to a no-competition policy, ensuring fair market competition among independent IVVIA operators.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-99082-iv-legal-structure-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99082-iv-legal-structure-5\"></a>IV.

Product Information</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p>USDM is a regulated and permissionless yield-bearing USD stablecoin. Technically, USDM is an ERC-20 token, with a rebasing mechanism that provides increased balances of USDM on a daily basis, based on the USDM reward rate, currently at a 4.75% APY.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>The following short-term maturity assets are the only accepted assets that can comprise the USDM Reserves, as the underlying assets for USDM:</p>\n<p>(i) US Short Term bonds (Treasury Bills);</p>\n<p>(ii) Near maturity longer-term bonds;</p>\n<p>(iii) FDIC-insured bank deposits;</p>\n<p>(iv) Repurchase agreements; and/or</p>\n<p>(v) Money Market Funds or other Funds that invest in short term US federal bonds.</p>\n<p>(vi) Assets in transit: Fiat and supported stablecoins (e.g. USDC) can comprise a nominal portion of reserves until they are invested.</p>\n<p>Full investment mandate (link: <a href=\"https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/reference/usdm-reserves-investment-mandate\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USDM Reserves - Investment mandate | Mountain Protocol</a>) and attestations (link: <a href=\"https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/reference/usdm-reserves-attestations\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USDM Reserves - Attestations | Mountain Protocol</a>) can be found in our documentation (link: <a href=\"https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>Rebasing, daily.

What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Bermuda Monetary Authority</p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://www.bma.bm/digital-asset-business\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Digital Asset Business - BMA</a></p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Mountain Protocol Limited holds a “Class F” license, which represents the highest level of authorization attainable for digital asset businesses in Bermuda. It was issued after the company had proven the maturity of its operation under ~9 months on a Class M license.<br>\nThis is the same licensing level held by companies like Coinbase, Kraken and Circle.</p>\n<p>License can be found in the BMA’s website: <a href=\"https://www.bma.bm/regulated-entities\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Search the regulated entities - BMA</a></p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>All assets issued in Bermuda are required to be Bankruptcy remote in order for a license to be issued, under DABA. DABA’s regulation recognizes customer assets as separate from the issuers and mandates that the company makes arrangements to ensure the return of client assets in the event the DAB is placed into liquidation (Source: <a href=\"https://www.bma.bm/viewPDF/documents/2018-12-29-05-19-21-Digital-Asset-Custody-Code-of-Practice.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.bma.bm/viewPDF/documents/2018-12-29-05-19-21-Digital-Asset-Custody-Code-of-Practice.pdf</a>).</p>\n<p>This means that Maker’s USDM holdings would be bankruptcy remote, along with all other USDM holders’ claims.</p>\n<p>All custody of securities is done under a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), fully owned by a regulated trust company in Bermuda: Carey Olsen Fiduciaries Bermuda Limited, owner of USDM Reserves Limited. This company structure isolates the USDM Reserves in case of insolvency of Mountain Protocol Limited, loss of license or other unforeseen factors.</p>\n<p>In the case that such a scenario materialized, the BMA would designate a Joint Provisional Liquidator (JPL), as per Bermuda law, who will begin processing redemptions for USDM holders, without going through a bankruptcy proceeding.<br>\nNote that USDM Reserves Limited is over-capitalized to cover liquidation costs (JPL, accounting, operations).</p>\n<p>All financial institutions that Mountain Protocol works with require a risk assessment and subsequent no-objection by the regulator, to ensure safe handling of assets. Bankruptcy of brokers/custodians fall under the standard re-allocation process and do not fall under the bankruptcy estate of the broker/custodian as assets are customer assets held off their balance sheets.</p>\n<p>USDM Reserves Limited holds nominal (as minimum as operationally possible) bank deposits, stablecoins, and off-ramper claims. The rationale is these have proven to be the weakest assets on a stablecoin’s balance sheet and the root cause for most recent depeg scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>The Company will ensure US$ 1 or an equivalent amount of USD-denominated assets will be held in the name of the Company with regulated financial institutions in bankruptcy-remote accounts, segregated from the operating accounts of the Company, held on behalf of, and for the benefit of, Users that request a redemption of USDM (“Redeeming Users”).</p>\n<p>Every USDM minted and sold by the Company and remaining in circulation, either US$1 or an equivalent amount of USD-denominated assets in such segregated accounts, will be held in the name of the Company in such segregated accounts on behalf of and for the benefit of, Redeeming Users.</p>\n<p>The Company commits to redeem 1 USDM for US$1 from a Redeeming User, subject to compliance with the Company’s policies and procedures and the “Terms of Service” accepted by Users.</p>\n<p>SOURCE: <a href=\"https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/reference/product-structuring#rights-conferred-by-the-usdm-token\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Product Structuring | Mountain Protocol</a></p>\n<p><strong>6.

Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>Mountain Protocol is not licensed to provide tax advice.

WisdomTree Digital related subsidiaries were formed beginning in 2021 and WTGXX commenced operations on November 7, 2023.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>III. Product Information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tDescribe the product</strong></p>\n<p>The WisdomTree Government Money Market Digital Fund (“WTGXX” or the “Fund”) seeks to provide investors with a high level of current income consistent with preservation of capital and liquidity and the maintenance of a stable $1.00 net asset value (“NAV”) per share. The Fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by government securities or cash.</p>\n<p>WTGXX is made available to institutions via our institutional platform, WisdomTree Connect™. WisdomTree Connect is a comprehensive solution for both business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-business-to-consumer (“B2B2C”) interactions.  WisdomTree Connect enables clients to interact with WisdomTree-issued tokens, in any eligible self-hosted wallet or third-party custodial wallet service, across supported blockchains via a web portal and API. The WTGXX token available via WisdomTree Connect is an ERC-20 compatible token on Ethereum. WisdomTree facilitates orders and dividend payments in WisdomTree Connect via fiat (USD) and USDC (via the Stablecoin Conversion Service*). For the purposes of this proposal, we assume Spark elects to use USDC and the Stablecoin Conversion Service and all references to process and flows reflect this election.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree is also in the process of establishing an offshore private fund, with a similar mandate of U.S. Treasury and government securities, available to non-U.S. qualified investors that is anticipated to be made available via WisdomTree Connect.</p>\n<p><small>* <em>Please note investors cannot directly purchase shares of the Fund via USDC but are processed via the Stablecoin Conversion Service that is an operational process facilitated by WisdomTree. All future references to the Stablecoin Conversion Service and operations are describing the client’s experience.</em></small></p>\n<p><strong>2.\tDescribe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX invests in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury and government securities. Such securities may include: U.S. Treasury Notes (both fixed and floating rate), U.S. T-Bills, U.S. Government Agency Notes, including Discount Notes, that are either fixed or floating rate and issued by government agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Bank System, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the Federal Farm Credit Bank. The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements collateralized fully by U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government Agency securities or cash. The Fund may also invest in other investment companies that are government money market funds to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).</p>\n<p>The Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in government securities and repurchase agreements that are collateralized by government securities.</p>\n<p>The securities purchased by the Fund are subject to the quality, diversification, and other requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the1940 Act, and other rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).</p>\n<p>Please see the Prospectus and SAI for additional information, including additional strategy information and risk factors.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s weighted average life is 48 days and weighted average maturity is 29 days with a 7-Day yield of 5.03% as of 9/18/24. Please see definitions and disclosures below the link to holdings details*.</p>\n<p>Holdings details can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/digital-funds/money-market/wtgxx#money_market_holdings\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/digital-funds/money-market/wtgxx#money_market_holdings</a></p>\n<p><small>*<em>Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. The Fund’s yield may be affected by changes in interest rates and changes in credit ratings. Income and/or dividends are not guaranteed. Performance data for the most recent month-end is available at <a href=\"http://wisdomtree.com/investments\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">wisdomtree.com/investments</a>.</em></small></p><small>\n<p>7-Day Yield – The current yield reflects the current earnings of the Fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year. It is the Fund’s total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement. Absent such waivers or reimbursements, the returns would have been lower.</p>\n<p>Weighted Average Life (WAL) – For money market funds, this is the weighted average of the life of the securities held in a fund or portfolio and can be used as a measure of sensitivity to changes in liquidity and/or credit risk. Generally, the higher the value, the greater the sensitivity. WAL is based on the dollar-weighted average length of time until principal payments must be paid, taking into account any call options exercised by the issuer and any permissible maturity shortening features other than interest rate resets. For money market funds, the difference between WAM and WAL is that WAM takes into account interest rate resets and WAL does not.</p>\n<p>Weighted average maturity (WAM) – The weighted average maturity of the portfolio represents the market-weighted average of the maturities of the portfolio’s individual holdings. A money market fund in the United States must maintain a weighted average maturity of 60 days or fewer.</p>\n</small><p><small>Visit <a href=\"http://sec.gov\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sec.gov</a> to obtain the most recent 12 months of publicly available information filed by the Fund with the SEC on Form N-MFP.</small></p>\n<p><strong>3.\tHow is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX declares dividends of net investment income every U.S. trading day (each day the NYSE is open for trading) as of 4:00 pm ET and distributions are made monthly (first business day of the following month). WisdomTree facilitates orders and dividend payments in WisdomTree Connect via fiat (USD) and USDC, via the Stablecoin Conversion Service. For the purposes of this proposal, we assume   Spark elects to use USDC and the Stablecoin Conversion Service and all references to process reflects this flow. Accordingly, the value of the dividends is paid to   Spark’s wallet via USDC.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tWhat is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WTGXX and Its Service Providers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trust (issuer of WTGXX):</strong> WisdomTree Digital Trust - United States (Delaware)</li>\n<li><strong>Investment Adviser:</strong> WisdomTree Digital Management, Inc. - United States</li>\n<li><strong>Sub-Adviser:</strong> Voya Investment Management Co.

The Fund maintains a policy pursuant to Rule 2a-7 to which the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser must follow. Rule 2a-7 is the principal rule governing money market funds in the U.S. This rule covers a range of topics that seek to ensure the ability of WTGXX to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and meet redemption orders in a timely manner. These topics include maturity of investments, type and quality of investments, issuer diversification, disclosure of portfolio holdings, fund liquidity, determination of amortized cost-based and market-based NAVs, and stress testing. Stress testing includes periodically testing and reporting to the WisdomTree Digital Trust Board of Trustees, which oversees the Fund (“Fund Board”), the test results, assumptions, and related assessments of the Fund’s ability to withstand stressful economic and financial market conditions. Further, with respect to portfolio liquidity, WTGXX must hold securities that are sufficiently liquid to meet reasonably foreseeable shareholder redemptions in light of the Fund’s obligations under section 22(e) of the 1940 Act to timely process shareholder redemptions. Specifically, this means WTGXX must maintain 25% of total assets in Daily Liquid Assets, 50% of the total assets in Weekly Liquid Assets, and a 5% maximum limit for investment in “illiquid” securities at the time of acquisition (defined as any security that cannot be sold or disposed of within seven days at approximately the market value ascribed to it).</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tAre any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No, this is not permitted in the Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>7.\tProvide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc).

WisdomTree issued soulbound NFTs cannot be transferred and can be revoked by WisdomTree in the event that client status or conditions change.  Shareholders can also peer-to-peer transfer WTGXX tokens to other onboarded shareholders with registered wallets as described above with the Transfer Agent maintaining the official record of share ownership. In this manner, WisdomTree prevents transactions between unknown persons or unknown blockchain wallets.</p>\n<p>Separately, the WisdomTree Connect Portal for Fund subscriptions and redemptions is permissioned via IP whitelisting, a process completed during onboarding. Each entity and authorized person must validate, among other qualifications, that it is an institutional investor as defined by U.S. law.</p>\n<p><strong>12.\tWhat is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see below for monthly transaction volume for WTGXX since inception.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/1/91f3833dcf927a77d12a80cb1b1ebd2c7c9a19a4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kP8XjvjRNsHtRJajdKU5Ex2pCm0.png?dl=1\" title=\"WisdomTree Monthly Flows\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/1/91f3833dcf927a77d12a80cb1b1ebd2c7c9a19a4_2_345x345.png\" alt=\"WisdomTree Monthly Flows\" data-base62-sha1=\"kP8XjvjRNsHtRJajdKU5Ex2pCm0\" width=\"345\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/1/91f3833dcf927a77d12a80cb1b1ebd2c7c9a19a4_2_345x345.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/1/91f3833dcf927a77d12a80cb1b1ebd2c7c9a19a4_2_517x517.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/1/91f3833dcf927a77d12a80cb1b1ebd2c7c9a19a4_2_690x690.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"272F2F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Please note, the monthly transaction volume of the Fund does not generally affect its ability, under normal market conditions, to facilitate subscriptions or redemptions on trading days, which may generally be accommodated in all sizes.

If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, investors purchase and redeem shares of WTGXX via a primary market subscription or redemption by interacting directly with the WisdomTree Connect platform. API connectivity is also available via WisdomTree Connect for investors to access WTGXX.</p>\n<p>We are working on multiple solutions to further enhance the experience of clients entering and exiting positions of WTGXX. In the near term, we are developing one-way pricing for instant sales of WTGXX (with a daily capacity cap via WisdomTree) for USDC via the Stablecoin Conversion Service.</p>\n<p>We are exploring functionality to provide two-way pricing for instant liquidity on both purchases and sales. This functionality would allow investors to purchase and sell WTGXX instantly via USDC using the Stablecoin Conversion Service, without a daily capacity cap. We believe this functionality would provide investors with a strong user experience, and, while there are no guarantees of its timing or ultimate availability due to a need for existing regulations and/or required licenses to evolve, we will continue to work towards this functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>16.\tWith what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p>WisdomTree can facilitate subscriptions and redemptions via USDC and fiat (USD).</p>\n<p><strong>17.\tWhat are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>We are continually working on developing, improving, and expanding our capabilities to meet our client’s unique needs. We are working on primary market developments specifically related to WTGXX. Our development plans include dividend reinvestment optionality and expanding existing funding and conversion mechanisms. We are also developing functionality whereby share purchases and redemptions can be facilitated via a service that includes additional currencies, crypto native assets, and stablecoins. We are also working to increase operational efficiency by extending order cutoff times. In the future, we also plan to leverage an onchain conversion mechanism to seamlessly process transactions from USDS to USDC via the Stablecoin Conversion Service to facilitate fund subscriptions or redemptions. Finally, we are exploring other novel methods of interaction via decentralized application (“dApp”) to allow primary market order placement for purchases and sales via smart contracts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the instant liquidity developments for purchases and sales detailed above in question 15, we are focused on the development of secondary market functionality for our offerings with the goal of utilizing the full potential of blockchain technology. Research &amp; development efforts currently underway include integration of atomic swaps, contingent transactions, oracles, time locks, account abstraction, third party attestations for KYC / AML verification, and zero knowledge proofs. We are also leveraging our position and connectivity to the wider financial markets to deliver on our vision to bring more traditional financial services onchain, including market making, pricing, credit facilitation and advanced risk management.</p>\n<p>We are continuously evaluating and evolving our practices to further our mission to provide regulated financial products to the onchain community. We have been a pioneer in this space since launching our Digital Assets division in 2020, which today includes: (1) launched 13 digital funds that are all tokenized 1940 Act funds with strategies across fixed income, equities, and asset allocation models, (2) launched real world asset tokens including a gold token (serving as certificate of title to physical gold) and a stablecoin, and (3) built a proprietary tokenization platform and tech stack that integrates blockchain technology with traditional finance infrastructure. We are committed to this space as an organization and believe onchain finance is the next evolution of financial services.</p>\n<p><em>The features detailed above would also be subject to then-existing regulations, regulatory interpretations and/or regulatory license requirements with no guarantees of timing or ultimately availability.</em><br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tExplain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is an open-ended government money market fund registered under the 1940 Act in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The Fund is a series of the WisdomTree Digital Trust (the “Trust”). The Trust was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on April 19, 2021, and has multiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an open-end management investment company, registered under the 1940 Act. The Fund is “diversified” within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The offering of the Trust’s shares is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The securities purchased by the Fund are subject to the quality, diversification, and other requirements of Rule 2a-7 under 1940 Act, and other rules adopted by the SEC.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree Digital Management, as the investment adviser, has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the WisdomTree Digital Trust and the Fund.

(“WTS”), a broker-dealer registered with the SEC, Member FINRA. WTS does not receive or hold client funds or securities and is not a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”).</p>\n<p>WisdomTree Transfers, Inc. is an SEC-registered transfer and serves as the transfer agent of the Funds.</p>\n<p>Each WisdomTree Digital entity will provide the applicable institution with the relevant services.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tHow is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>The WisdomTree Digital Trust structure in place is to limit bankruptcy risks and protect shareholders under the 1940 Act. The Trust’s assets are held with an independent custodian, State Street, in a segregated account. In the case of a bankruptcy of WisdomTree or any of its providers, including the custodian, WisdomTree, Inc. and its affiliates would have no claim to the Trust’s assets and the Trust would not be part of the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree Digital Trust issues 13 digital funds, all governed under the 1940 Act and this structure.</p>\n<p>In addition, WisdomTree is proud of its robust compliance program. It is WisdomTree’s policy to comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. Each employee is responsible for adhering to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to accounting and auditing matters.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree maintains a rigorous culture of compliance. There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks the group faces through the corporate governance system.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree has developed a strong governance process, which covers the group-wide strategy, risk management process and regulatory compliance. In addition, external advisors inform WisdomTree of any changes to the regulatory environment to ensure we fulfill all regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX is a registered 1940 Act Fund that enables shareholders to manage balances onchain while receiving the investor protections and benefits of shareholder rights under applicable U.S. law, including the 1940 Act. Shares of the Fund have a pro rata interest in its assets. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and distributions declared by the Fund Board with respect to the Fund, and in the net distributable assets of the Fund on liquidation.</p>\n<p>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which a shareholder vote is required consistent with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. These shareholder voting rights generally include election of, or changes in, the Fund Board under applicable circumstances and approval of advisory agreements, including increases in management fees, each as further described in and subject to the Fund’s governing documents, Prospectus or otherwise as prescribed in the 1940 Act, as applicable.</p>\n<p>The Ethereum token is a record of the investor’s Fund ownership. Under WisdomTree’s integrated recordkeeping system, the onchain record is aligned with book-entry records maintained by WisdomTree Transfers. WisdomTree Transfers maintains a master shareholder file for all primary market purchases, primary market sales, and peer-to-peer transfers of the token between eligible tokenholders.</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tAre there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against WisdomTree Digital Management, WisdomTree Digital Trust, WisdomTree Securities, or WisdomTree Transfers. Please see the public filings of WisdomTree, Inc. on the SEC’s EDGAR site (e.g., 10-K, 8-Ks, etc.) associated with WisdomTree, Inc. and/or other affiliates.</p>\n<p><strong>7.\tDescribe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO.</strong></p>\n<p>There are no known conflicts of interest that WisdomTree or our products have with its officers or Sky (formerly known as MakerDAO).</p>\n<p><strong>8.\tExplain the potential tax implications associated with the product.</strong><br>\nIn the case of WTGXX, income distributions generally are characterized as “interest-related dividends,” which are generally exempt from U.S. withholding taxes, provided certain other requirements are met.</p>\n<p>Please refer to WTGXX’s Prospectus and SAI for a more detailed explanation of the tax consequences of investing in the Fund.</p>\n<p>Neither WisdomTree, Inc., nor its affiliates provide tax advice.

The principal responsibilities of the Audit Committee are the appointment, compensation and oversight of the Trust’s independent registered public accounting firm, including the resolution of disagreements regarding financial reporting between Trust management and such independent registered public accounting firm, among other responsibilities. Annually, the independent registered public accounting firm reviews with the Audit Committee its audit of the Fund’s financial statements.</p>\n<p>A smart contract audit has been conducted by Oxorio. Audit reports for the smart contract are available at <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/TOKEN-STANDARDS-FRAMEWORK/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standards</a> and <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/ERC20-REVOCABLE-COMPLIANCE-STANDARD-SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standard Annex</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tDescribe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p>WisdomTree’s tokenization platform is designed to facilitate onchain ownership and transferability while seamlessly integrating with established traditional frameworks in the asset management industry. This convergence encompasses asset custody, risk management, portfolio management, and regulatory compliance.</p>\n<p>The onchain component utilizes common token standards, modified to meet the specific requirements of this use case. Specifically, the Fund tokens are ERC-20 compatible with additional functionalities to enhance ownership control. These functionalities include the ability to pause the token, freeze individual addresses, claw back tokens, and implement transferability checks.</p>\n<p>The token represents ownership of the Fund shares; however, regulatory requirements necessitate maintaining offchain records. To ensure compliance without limiting token functionality, we have implemented a bespoke integrated record-keeping system that continuously monitors onchain ownership changes and maintains alignment with the offchain ledger.</p>\n<p>A novel feature of our platform is the transferability checks, ensuring that only eligible wallets can hold the tokens. Onchain identity attestation is achieved by implementing a soulbound NFT (ERC-721) linked to the known wallet. Whenever a transfer method is called, a compliance oracle performs a check to ensure the receiving address also holds this soulbound NFT. We believe that using this soulbound NFT enables us to develop more decentralized identity management solutions compared to traditional allow lists or whitelists.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree has developed our own code base based on opensource standards that utilizes a beacon proxy pattern for upgradability. This enables us to have the maximum flexibility to respond to both client needs and regulations. This is a deliberate decision to build and manage this ourselves in order to leverage the power and innovation of the DeFi ecosystem and apply those learnings to our products and solutions.</p>\n<p>The code base we have deployed is aimed to serve as a foundation for future enhancements, particularly as we seek increased integration into DeFi enabled workflows and we continue on our goal to migrate more operations onchain over time.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>We have had two rounds of audit on the existing code base as of August 31, 2024. Any future adjustments or changes to the code base will be audited prior to deployment. A smart contract audit has been conducted by Oxorio. Audit reports for the smart contract are available at <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/TOKEN-STANDARDS-FRAMEWORK/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standards</a> and <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/ERC20-REVOCABLE-COMPLIANCE-STANDARD-SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standard Annex</a>.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tDescribe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs.</strong></p>\n<p>We have actively engaged with Sky, affiliated stakeholders, and other DAOs in efforts to fully understand the unique needs and objectives of the onchain community. To meet the ecosystem’s unique needs, we have built solutions that (1) unlock access to tokenized real-world-assets, (2) have the ability to facilitate stablecoin conversion (e.g., to USD) to serve as a form of payment, (3) facilitate non-custodial wallet transactions and (4) implement onchain identity attestation via soulbound NFTs.</p>\n<p>Leveraging our traditional finance and blockchain expertise, we have developed products and platforms that seek to seamlessly integrate between the TradFi and DeFi worlds while implementing WisdomTree’s robust and rigorous compliance framework. We are committed to delivering best-in-class service for our clients, including adapting, building, and evolving our products, solutions, platforms, and integration points. As the industry evolves, WisdomTree will continue to develop bespoke solutions to provide regulated financial products, which could potentially include solutions built to the specific needs of Sky and its affiliates.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tBeyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to WTGXX, we have developed a full suite of 13 tokenized funds covering equity, fixed income, and asset allocation models, in addition to tokenized gold and a stablecoin. By onboarding to our platform and subject to applicable onboarding requirements, Spark can potentially access current and future products as they become available and as we continue to innovate, which we believe will be the types of products and services of benefit to Spark. Our products provide increased optionality to Spark’s treasury management through enhanced diversification as well as additional yield opportunities. Together, these funds ensure investors have access and selection to the asset class, structure, and accessibility required by their own unique situation while being assured of a regulated, established asset manager issuing and managing the Funds. Our full suite of digital funds may be found here: <a href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/digital-funds\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/digital-funds</a>.</p>\n<p>We are also in the process of establishing an offshore private fund, with a similar mandate of U.S. Treasury and government securities, available to non-U.S. qualified investors, as stated earlier in our responses.</p>\n<p>We believe that by providing access to real world assets across multiple asset classes, focusing on increasing liquidity and efficiency in primary and secondary markets, and issuing products via a robust legal framework, we are building an onchain experience for more users to interact with the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tDoes the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX is currently able to be minted on Ethereum and Stellar.

Describe the product</h3>\n<p>The Frictionless Institutional Cash US Treasury Fund (fsISTUSTD) is a Luxembourg-based tokenized fund that offers investors exposure to the BlackRock Institutional Cash Series (ICS) US Treasury Fund. This underlying fund is a public debt constant net asset value (CNAV) short-term money market fund that aims to maintain a stable net asset value of 1.00 USD.</p>\n<p>The fund’s primary objective is to preserve principal and provide same-day liquidity to USD by maintaining a portfolio of high-quality, short-term government debt and repurchase agreements. It invests in US Treasury bills, notes, and other obligations guaranteed by the US Government, as well as repurchase agreements collateralized by these securities. This strategy ensures increased liquidity and aims to offer investors a stable and secure investment option.</p>\n<p>Structured as a floating rate note, the fsISTUSTD Fund is tokenized using ERC-20/ERC-3643 standards, allowing for permissioned trading on various blockchain networks including Avalanche, Ethereum, and Base.</p>\n<p>The fund offers daily dealing with a minimum investment of USD 1,000 and a minimum redemption of just USD 0.01. It provides daily distributions and monthly coupon redemptions, catering to investors seeking regular income. The fund is rated by major agencies including S&amp;P, Moody’s, and Fitch, reflecting its commitment to maintaining high standards of quality and stability.</p>\n<p>Managed by Frictionless Markets S.à.r.l and domiciled in Luxembourg, the fund operates under the Securitisation Law of 22 March 2004. It’s important to note that this fund is exclusively available to accredited (professional client) investors in compliance with MiFID II regulations.</p>\n<p>In summary, the Frictionless Institutional Cash US Treasury Fund represents an innovative blend of traditional money market fund stability with the advantages of blockchain technology, offering professional investors a unique option for managing cash holdings in the evolving digital financial landscape.</p>\n<p>At Frictionless, we can customise and white-label our Institutional Cash Funds for clients. Specifically for SparkDAO, we propose the optional creation of a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong> with the Ticker <strong>skyUST</strong>. This fund has a similar structure to our fsISTUSTD fund but with some enhancements to cater to the SparkDAO community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-2-describe-the-underlying-asset-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-2-describe-the-underlying-asset-19\"></a>2.

Yields from investments are accrued daily, including non-business days, ensuring continuous returns for investors. These daily yields are represented by transferable, permissioned ERC-3643 tokens, referred to as ‘Daily Distribution Tokens’. This tokenization of yield allows for greater flexibility and transparency in yield management.</p>\n<p>A key feature of these Daily Distribution Tokens is their conversion schedule. All Daily Distribution Tokens issued within a given month become convertible to fiat cash on the first business day of the following month. This means that regardless of when the yield was accrued during the month, all tokens for that period share the same maturity date. This standardisation simplifies accounting and provides a clear timeline for investors expecting cash conversions. Another innovative aspect of these Daily Distribution Tokens is their tradeability. Unlike traditional yield distributions that may be locked until a specific date, these tokens can be traded 24/7. This feature provides investors with enhanced liquidity and the ability to manage their yield positions more dynamically, potentially opening up new strategies for cash management and short-term investing.</p>\n<p>Please see our daily attestation and reporting on token distributions at:</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://frictionless.markets/transparency\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://frictionless.markets/hubfs/frictionless-icon-black-2.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://frictionless.markets/transparency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">frictionless.markets</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    \n\n<h3><a href=\"https://frictionless.markets/transparency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Transparency, Stability, and Trust</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Always secure, always transparently &amp; independently attested</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the underlying asset will be the same and the skyUST will have its own independent daily reports of the same calibre as fsISTUSTD.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-4-what-is-the-jurisdiction-of-the-issuer-and-key-entities-32\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-4-what-is-the-jurisdiction-of-the-issuer-and-key-entities-32\"></a>4.

Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</h3>\n<p>The fsISTUSDT Fund (‘the Fund’) does permit the use of hedging and derivatives in its underlying portfolio, but this is managed within a strict risk management framework. The Portfolio Manager employs a comprehensive risk management process to monitor and measure the risk associated with all open derivative positions and their impact on the overall risk profile of the Fund’s portfolio.</p>\n<p>This process is designed to be continuous, allowing for real-time monitoring of the Fund’s exposure. The Portfolio Manager specifically uses a methodology known as the Commitment Approach to measure and manage the global exposure from Financial Derivative Instruments (FDIs). This approach aggregates the underlying market or notional values of FDIs to determine the degree of global exposure of the Fund to these instruments. Importantly, there are regulatory limits in place to control the use of these instruments. In accordance with the requirements of the Central Bank of Ireland, even if a Fund uses leverage through FDIs, the global exposure for such a Fund must not exceed 100% of that Fund’s Net Asset Value. This ensures that the use of derivatives and hedging strategies does not lead to excessive risk-taking. The Portfolio Manager maintains the flexibility to employ new techniques and instruments as they become available, subject to regulatory approval and proper risk management protocols. This approach allows the Fund to potentially benefit from financial innovations while maintaining a strong focus on risk control.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that while these tools are permitted, their use is closely monitored and controlled to ensure alignment with the Fund’s investment objectives and risk profile. The ultimate goal is to use these instruments, when appropriate, to enhance the Fund’s ability to meet its objectives while carefully managing associated risks.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the risk mitigation framework and Committed Approach, oversight and regulatory criteria will apply as it has done for the fsISTUSTD fund.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-7-provide-a-list-of-all-counterparties-and-service-providers-used-by-your-product-ie-custodians-trustees-reporting-agents-exchange-agents-banks-etc-provide-flow-charts-or-diagrams-for-all-related-entities-and-counterparties-if-available-37\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-7-provide-a-list-of-all-counterparties-and-service-providers-used-by-your-product-ie-custodians-trustees-reporting-agents-exchange-agents-banks-etc-provide-flow-charts-or-diagrams-for-all-related-entities-and-counterparties-if-available-37\"></a>7.

How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</h3>\n<p>The fsISTUSTD Fund (‘the Fund’) establishes bankruptcy remoteness for its assets through several mechanisms provided by the Luxembourg Securitisation Law. This legal framework effectively separates the securitised assets, including those in digital format, from any insolvency risks of the securitisation vehicle, the Issuer, service providers, and all other parties involved in the transaction.</p>\n<p>In the event of bankruptcy of the originator or the servicer responsible for collecting cash flows from the assets (including digital assets and digital securities), the Luxembourg Securitisation Law ensures that the securitisation vehicle can claim ownership transfer of the securitised assets and any cash collected on its behalf before liquidation proceedings begin. This provision safeguards the Fund’s assets from being included in the bankruptcy estate of these entities.</p>\n<p>The Securitisation Law further strengthens the Fund’s bankruptcy remoteness through three key provisions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Subordination Provision: This allows investors and creditors to subordinate their payment rights to other creditors or investors, which is crucial for structuring the securitisation transaction.</li>\n<li>Non-recourse Provision: Investors and creditors may waive their rights to request enforcement. For instance, if an interest payment defaults, investors can agree to defer payment without initiating legal action, accommodating known or temporary situations.</li>\n<li>Non-petition Provision: This allows investors and creditors to waive their rights to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against the securitisation vehicle, protecting it from individual investors who might have an interest in such proceedings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Regarding multiple products, the issuer, FRICTIONLESS MARKETS SECURITIES Securitisation Fund, utilises a compartment structure. The fsISTUSTD Fund operates within its own bankruptcy-remote and orphan-entity-protected compartment. This structure allows the issuer to have multiple products, each in its own compartment, without risking cross-contamination of assets or liabilities between different products.<br>\nDetailed legal opinions and supplementary documents regarding the structure of the Fund, are provided in the supplement. These documents offer a comprehensive legal analysis of the Fund’s structure and its compliance with the relevant provisions of the Luxembourg Securitisation Law, Financial Collateral Act and MiCA.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the same regulatory posture will exist.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-5-what-rights-do-token-holders-have-64\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-5-what-rights-do-token-holders-have-64\"></a>5. What rights do token holders have?</h3>\n<p>Tokenholders of the Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds enjoy a comprehensive set of rights and protections, underpinned by robust Luxembourg and European Union legislation. These rights are designed to ensure that tokenholders have equivalent protections to traditional securities holders, while also benefiting from the advantages of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>The rights of token holders are protected under several key pieces of Luxembourg legislation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Luxembourg Securitization Law of 2004 (as amended)</li>\n<li>The Financial Collateral Act 2005 (as amended)</li>\n<li>The Blockchain Acts I, II, and III (as amended)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These laws collectively ensure that tokenholders have the same legal and economic rights as traditional investors in orphan entities, and bankruptcy-remote securitization compartments. This means that token holders can expect:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clear ownership rights of their tokens, legally recognized and protected.</li>\n<li>The right to receive any distributions or interest payments associated with their tokens.</li>\n<li>The ability to transfer their tokens, with such transfers recognized as valid and binding.</li>\n<li>Protection of their assets from potential bankruptcy of the fund issuer or service providers.</li>\n<li>Equal treatment among all token holders of the same class.</li>\n<li>The right to access relevant information about their investment.</li>\n<li>Legal recourse through the Luxembourg legal system if their rights are violated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s important to note that the Luxembourg Securitisation Law of 2004 was recently amended, with changes coming into force in March 2022. These amendments were specifically designed to provide enhanced investor protection, further strengthening the rights of tokenholders.</p>\n<p>By leveraging Luxembourg’s position as the world’s dominant securitization location, tokenholders benefit from the legal protections of both Luxembourg and the broader European Union. This dual layer of protection provides a robust framework for safeguarding investor interests in the evolving landscape of blockchain-based financial instruments.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the same protections are provided.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-6-are-there-any-pending-or-threatened-legal-proceedings-or-investigations-against-the-company-or-any-of-its-officers-65\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-6-are-there-any-pending-or-threatened-legal-proceedings-or-investigations-against-the-company-or-any-of-its-officers-65\"></a>6.

In general, there are several advantages to utilising this structure considering the scale of investment the Spark DAO community can leverage in Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds.</em></p>\n<p>A Luxembourg SOPARFI (Société de Participations Financières) is a holding and financing company that offers several key advantages, especially for investors looking to optimise tax efficiency, financial structuring, and operational flexibility, such as:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-tax-efficiency-68\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-tax-efficiency-68\"></a>Tax Efficiency</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Participation Exemption: SOPARFIs can benefit from the participation exemption regime, which allows for tax exemptions on dividends received and capital gains from qualifying holdings. This can significantly reduce or eliminate taxes on income generated from investments in subsidiaries.</li>\n<li>Interest Deduction: Interest payments made by a SOPARFI can generally be deducted from its taxable income, lowering its effective tax rate.</li>\n<li>No Withholding Tax on Liquidation Proceeds: Distributions made during the liquidation of a SOPARFI are generally free from withholding tax, making it an attractive structure for exit planning.</li>\n<li>Favourable Double Tax Treaties: Luxembourg has an extensive network of double tax treaties that can reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and royalties paid to or by a SOPARFI in cross-border transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-flexible-corporate-structure-69\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-flexible-corporate-structure-69\"></a>Flexible Corporate Structure</h4>\n<p>Although primarily used as a holding company, a SOPARFI can engage in various financial activities, including holding shares, granting loans, financing activities, managing intellectual property rights, and even real estate investments.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-no-specific-regulatory-supervision-70\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-no-specific-regulatory-supervision-70\"></a>No Specific Regulatory Supervision</h4>\n<p>A SOPARFI is not considered a regulated entity like an investment fund or financial institution, meaning it is not subject to the direct supervision of Luxembourg’s financial regulator, the CSSF (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier). This makes the setup and ongoing operation simpler and less costly in terms of regulatory compliance.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-efficient-holding-structure-71\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-efficient-holding-structure-71\"></a>Efficient Holding Structure</h4>\n<p>SOPARFIs are ideal for international holding structures, enabling investors to manage and consolidate their global investments under one umbrella. They can hold interests in both EU and non-EU companies, providing flexibility for cross-border operations.</p>\n<p>Luxembourg’s stable and business-friendly environment ensures legal certainty and an attractive framework for managing complex financial structures.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-attractive-capital-gains-treatment-72\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-attractive-capital-gains-treatment-72\"></a>Attractive Capital Gains Treatment</h4>\n<p>In addition to the participation exemption on capital gains, Luxembourg also offers favourable conditions for individuals holding shares in a SOPARFI, with low capital gains tax rates for residents under certain conditions.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-vat-exemptions-73\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-vat-exemptions-73\"></a>VAT Exemptions</h4>\n<p>A SOPARFI can benefit from VAT exemptions on financial services it provides, such as granting loans or managing subsidiaries, which further enhances its cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-confidentiality-and-investor-protection-74\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-confidentiality-and-investor-protection-74\"></a>Confidentiality and Investor Protection</h4>\n<p>Luxembourg provides strong investor protection laws and respects confidentiality regarding financial matters, ensuring that investors’ privacy is maintained while enjoying the benefits of this corporate structure.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-attractive-exit-opportunities-75\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-attractive-exit-opportunities-75\"></a>Attractive Exit Opportunities</h4>\n<p>Given the participation exemption and the favourable tax treatment of liquidation proceeds, SOPARFIs offer attractive conditions for investors looking to exit their holdings through liquidation, M&amp;A transactions, or divestitures.</p>\n<p>In summary, by utilising a Luxembourg SOPARFI, Spark DAO can benefit from a combination of tax efficiency, flexibility, and international legal frameworks, for holding and financing activities into any tokenized asset class or fund issued by Frictionless Markets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99065-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-76\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-76\"></a>V.

Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</h3>\n<p>A key benefit of the Luxembourg issuance of our Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds is the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Act 2005. All financial instruments issued by Frictionless Markets enjoy the classification of legal financial collateral under the Luxembourg and E.U laws and are globally recognized. This enables the tokens to be used legally in leverage positions as derivatives and by prime desks as collateral. Furthermore, this is extended to the deposit tokens in any currency denomination, therefore the Spark community can exercise global protection of their assets under these collateralization laws.</p>\n<p>As our Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds are exclusively invested in the BlackRock Institutional Cash Series there is no cash drag in the funds, once the order is fulfilled and accepted by the transfer agent on business days, the cash is put to work instantly, returning the daily distributions on the following business day. This maximises the capital efficiency of the Spark DAO and Sky community.</p>\n<p>As the issuer of multiple public constant NAV funds with multiple currencies at both spot and fwd FX, our solution can ensure that the Spark DAO community can react quickly to changing interest rate environments on the horizon, by deploying Dollar/USDC/USDS into potentially higher returning funds such as the Sterling Gov Liquidity fund.</p>\n<p>Finally, our globally recognised structure and issuance ensure that the Spark DAO community and Sky Money can attract investors without worrying about opaque tax structures, FATCA, CRS, and other key international agreements and regulations.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-93\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-93\"></a>3.

Product Information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tDescribe the product:</strong></p>\n<p>U.S. Treasury Bills Fund with the objective to seek current income as is consistent with liquidity and stability of principal, targeting returns in line with the federal funds rate.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tDescribe the underlying asset:</strong></p>\n<p>The underlying asset is a mix of U.S. Treasury Bills or equivalents with varying maturity dates or equivalents.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tHow is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>MUSF shares may be issued as a yield-bearing ERC-20 token or as Book Entry shares. Each MUSF token is one share in MUSF, and the number of shares issued (MUSF tokens minted) is equal to the Purchase Amount ($) divided by the Net Asset Value per share (NAV/S) on a given Market Day. Market Days are when both the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are open.</p>\n<p>Investors redeeming MUSF may elect to receive USDC, USDT, DAI or USD equivalent to the number of shares/tokens times the NAV/S on a given Market Day.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tWhat is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>The jurisdiction is the Cayman Islands. OPI has established partnerships with Law Firms, Fund Admins, Originators, Custodians, Auditors etc. in the Caymans.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>As all underlying assets are U.S. Treasury Bills or equivalents, there will be no eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations.</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tAre any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>7.\tProvide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc).

Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>MUSF will offer daily liquidity each Market Day. Market Days are when both the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are open.</p>\n<p><strong>14.\tProvide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>OPI has established partnerships with Law Firms, Fund Admins, Originators, Custodians, Auditors etc. We will provide these partnerships under further due diligence.</p>\n<p>Onboarding will be completed once the user undergoes the KYC/AML onboarding process. Once approved, they will be whitelisted. This address will be the primary address where all MUSF tokens will be minted.</p>\n<p>Once onboarding is completed, Oasis Pro Tokenization will mint the tokens to the whitelisted address.</p>\n<p>When a token is burned the event will be recorded and the dollar value of redemption to be paid will be based on the NAV per share of the fund.</p>\n<p>Based on the value of the burned token, treasury bills will be sold to produce USD.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/5/b5fb2278c1c121dad3eba446031788cb6a741303.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pXStut5wW6hdXeuhum2Fy8cxb8L.png?dl=1\" title=\"Maker Flow of Funds\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/5/b5fb2278c1c121dad3eba446031788cb6a741303_2_690x417.png\" alt=\"Maker Flow of Funds\" data-base62-sha1=\"pXStut5wW6hdXeuhum2Fy8cxb8L\" width=\"690\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/5/b5fb2278c1c121dad3eba446031788cb6a741303_2_690x417.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/5/b5fb2278c1c121dad3eba446031788cb6a741303.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/5/b5fb2278c1c121dad3eba446031788cb6a741303.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"488685\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>15.\tHave any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency?

The team’s deep insights into market trends, regulatory landscapes, and asset valuations will be invaluable for shortlisting assets that have high potential and align with the MakerDAO community’s objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tExplain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></p>\n<p>MUSF is a private fund in the Cayman Islands. The Fund is available to Qualified Purchasers in the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, as well as jurisdictions in EMEA that permit reverse inquiry by qualifying investors.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tWhat regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Regulated by the Cayman Island Monetary Authority (CIMA).</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tWhat licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Matterhorn is a Swiss GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung). It is a wholly owned subsidiary of OPI and was incorporated under the laws of Switzerland on 26 April 2023 by way of a notarial deed.</p>\n<p>According to the articles of association of Matterhorn, its established purpose is to acquire, hold, and administer majority and minority participation in companies in the DeFi industry and tokens. In addition, Matterhorn may:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>advise domestic and foreign clients and/or companies in the areas of distributed ledger technology, tokens and liquidity;</li>\n<li>stablish branches and subsidiaries in Switzerland and abroad;</li>\n<li>participate in or hold other enterprises of identical or similar nature in Switzerland and abroad, or establish, merge, acquire, or finance such enterprises; and</li>\n<li>acquire, hold and sell real estate in Switzerland and abroad.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A subsidiary of OPI, Oasis Pro Markets LLC (“OPM”), can access regulated financial markets in the United States by virtue of its regulatory authorization. OPI is also in the process of incorporating entities in the UK and India.</p>\n<p>Regulatory Compliance: Engaging in both the traditional and DeFi financial spaces requires navigating a complex web of regulations. OPM, acting as broker-dealer and ATS, for instance, holds the required regulatory permissions to undertake such activities, ensuring that activities are compliant with US securities laws.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tHow is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>MUSF is bankruptcy-remote from Oasis Pro Inc as it is a separate entity set up in the Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Tokenholders are granted shareholder rights. Shareholders have rights to the fund’s assets under Cayman Islands bankruptcy law.</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tAre there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>7.\tDescribe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>There are no conflicts of interests the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>8.\tExplain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>Navigating the complex web of regulations is paramount to the success of integrating RWAs into a decentralized ecosystem. OPI’s legal and compliance team, which has extensive experience in dealing with both traditional and crypto-assets, will be an invaluable resource. Matterhorn will work closely with the legal team to ensure that the tokenization of RWAs complies with regulatory standards. They will also structure the tokens in a way that adheres to the legal frameworks of various jurisdictions, thereby safeguarding both Matterhorn and the MakerDAO community from potential legal pitfalls.</p>\n<p>Any gain realized between the redemption proceeds and the original purchase amount is subject to taxation at the investor’s applicable tax rate.</p>\n<p>MUSF does not distribute dividends or make other distributions, so the primary tax consequence arises from the gain or loss realized on redemption. No taxes are withheld on any transactions within the Fund.</p>\n<p>The Fund Admin will prepare a Schedule K-1 annually for each investor, detailing their share of the Fund’s gains or losses for the year. Foreign investors will also receive a Form 1042-S reflecting that none of the Fund’s income is considered ECI.</p>\n<p><strong>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tProvide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark</strong></p>\n<p>The fund has recently launched, and the return mirrors the performance of a short-term treasury bond.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tDescribe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p>Continuous monitoring and reporting mechanisms will be implemented to ensure the smooth functioning of the integrated assets. This will include tracking the performance of the assets and adherence to compliance standards. One of our partners will provide this.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tDescribe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product</strong></p>\n<p>We have partnered with multiple accounting and auditing groups.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tDescribe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p>The asset tokenization platform enables issuers to convert their real-world assets into a digital representation of the same. The tokenization platform is built on modular architecture and supports all tokenization features through UI and APIs.  The platform will mint Digital Asset Securities based on real-time valuation using ERC-3643 and ERC-1404 security token standards. We have created our own standard regulatory and compliant ERC token.</p>\n<p>Our platform supports the minting of tokens on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Base, Solana, Provenance, and Aptos blockchains along with private blockchains like R3 Corda, and Canton. All blockchains are built on the same standard. Offers the ability to easily add support for more tokenization standards and blockchains.</p>\n<p>The tokens are designed with the following advanced features: on-chain compliance, upgradeability, a factory pattern for efficient deployment, multi-signature (multisig) support, and account abstraction. They also incorporate custom asset control contracts, capital call and distribution functionalities, and waterfall mechanisms. Additionally, the tokens have the capability to mint, burn, freeze, and forcibly transfer assets.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our smart contracts integrate with a custom oracle to retrieve real-time pricing data, enabling on-chain calculations and decision-making. The contracts also support commitment mechanisms and Delivery vs. Payment (DvP) features for secure and efficient transactions.</p>\n<p>Regarding tokenization, we are a founding member of the ERC-3643 foundation, and we have submitted our own ERC token standard for securities to the Ethereum Foundation for review.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.erc3643.org/news/industry-leaders-form-erc3643-association-to-propel-standardization-of-tokenization\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/0/20b97ff9bad2bc72b1b825a05cee7799dba5bd87.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"C3DCF8\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.erc3643.org/news/industry-leaders-form-erc3643-association-to-propel-standardization-of-tokenization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">erc3643.org</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/361;\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/2/520decef9fadb171765948661f0875c3dac6cbfa_2_690x361.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"D9EAF6\" width=\"690\" height=\"361\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.erc3643.org/news/industry-leaders-form-erc3643-association-to-propel-standardization-of-tokenization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Industry Leaders Form ERC3643 Association to Propel Standardization of...</a></h3>\n\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>For more information about the ERC-3643 token standard, please see official website: <a href=\"https://www.erc3643.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.erc3643.org/</a></p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>We have partnered with many 3rd party providers, such as Certik, who will review the source code of the smart contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>VI.

Product Summary</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Project name:</strong><br>\nRealize</p>\n<p><strong>2. Product name:</strong><br>\nRealize T-BILLS Fund (the “Fund”)</p>\n<p><strong>3. Product type / underlying asset:</strong><br>\nThe Fund is the first Abu Dhabi Global Market (“ADGM”) tokenized open-ended investment fund based out of Abu Dhabi, UAE. The principal purpose and investment objective is to invest into and tokenize Exchange-Traded Funds that hold short-term U.S treasury bills and short-term U.S. treasury bills directly. The tokenized asset, $RBILL, will be available to investors on Ethereum and other major Blockchains.</p>\n<p>The Fund is the first tokenized fund to be authorized by the regulator in ADGM, a historical achievement made possible through the close alignment and collaboration between Realize, its partners and the regulator. Based on English common law, ADGM is one of the most exciting jurisdictions for traditional finance and especially for the digital assets space, as ADGM has created the necessary legal and regulatory framework for asset issuers, investment managers and investors to operate with clarity, safety and certainty.</p>\n<p>The Fund is also one of the first directly tokenized funds globally, where the actual units in the fund are tokenized. This gives investors into the $RBILL fund direct ownership rights, legal and regulatory protection, and better oversight of fund operations. This is in contrast to many competing structures which have opaque, expensive, complex and convoluted structures using third-party custodians, pledging agreements and SPVs. In many cases, the structures are unregulated and therefore their products carry potential risk of closure in the future as regulations tighten. Competitor products use a Custodian as the participating shareholder which means the structure falls outside of the parameters of securities and fund rules in the relevant domicile of the fund. This means there is no oversight by the relevant regulator, and provides little to no protection to investors into those products.</p>\n<p>The $RBILL token represents a direct, tokenized ownership right in the ADGM-authorized Realize T-BILLS Fund.

Company Details</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Company description:</strong></p>\n<p>Realize is a tokenization platform that focuses on unlocking the full potential of real-world assets in Web3. Based in Abu Dhabi, Realize leverages strategic regional connections, clear regulatory framework and institutional partnerships to provide a seamless solution for tokenizing assets. Together with our partners, Realize is merging the worlds of traditional finance and decentralized finance out of one of the most exciting, safe and crypto-friendly jurisdictions. We are bringing the future of tokenization from the UAE to the world.</p>\n<p>Realize is the fund sponsor of the Realize T-BILL Fund (OEIC), the first tokenized fund to be authorized by Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), one of the leading finance ecosystems in the world.</p>\n<p>Together with Neovision Wealth Management Limited (the “Fund Manager” or “Neovision”), Realize and Neovision have created a scalable and robust framework to tokenize regulated funds. We are currently working towards tokenizing several additional funds to be operational and accessible fully on-chain, including trade finance funds, UAE real estate, government-backed bonds and other ETFs. With this platform, Realize is positioned to bring safe, yield-bearing assets on-chain and offer new opportunities for crypto native treasury managers, DAOs and HNWIs to diversify and manage their portfolio entirely on-chain.</p>\n<p>Unlike many current tokenization efforts, Realize operates within a framework designed for broadening accessibility, liquidity and utility of tokenized assets. Most companies in the tokenization space focus on building closed ecosystems that they can control, charging high fees for limited services and restricting liquidity. These systems frequently stifle innovation, asset composability and limit the flexibility and opportunities that tokenization can offer.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Realize is committed to maximizing composability, liquidity, transparency, and security in the tokenization space. We are expanding the utility of tokenized assets across the Web3 ecosystem, providing deep integrations and partnerships with major L1 and L2 blockchains. The Realize platform empowers investors to tokenize their assets and access a wide array of applications, including asset collateralization, unlocking yield opportunities beyond the limits of traditional finance. By breaking down the barriers of closed ecosystems, Realize fosters an open, interconnected environment where investors can fully unlock the value of their tokenized assets, diversifying and managing their capital with new investment opportunities.</p>\n<p>Our mission is to democratize access to real-world assets by seamlessly integrating them within Web3. We strive to offer a secure, efficient, and transparent gateway for investors to gain exposure to a diverse range of assets, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and yield opportunities that are traditionally unavailable in conventional finance.</p>\n<p>Watch this short video to learn more about Realize:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eLatmPge88A?feature=shared\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/8/7801aa12908d077db9be4defc6ab8fd97fe397cd.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"h7CRsFOQFYTv6nPBIWyjpMOAMON\" width=\"690\" height=\"359\" role=\"presentation\"></a><br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2.

Product Information</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.1 Realize T-BILLS Fund (OEIC) Limited</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is the first tokenized fund to be authorised by the regulator in the UAE (ADGM) and is managed by Neovision (see section 4 for more information pertaining to key counterparties).</p>\n<p>The Fund is an open-ended investment fund allowing investors to gain access to U.S. government bonds as digital tokens on the blockchain. Each RBILL token represents a claim on underlying T-Bills, with rights and obligations managed by smart contracts. These tokenized T-Bills, with one-year maturity or less, are backed by shares in underlying U.S. Treasuries ETFs. Available initially on both Ethereum, IOTA and other major L1 / L2 Blockchains, RBILL tokens can be exchanged for stablecoin or FIAT currency, with a minimum investment of $50,000.</p>\n<p>This approach eliminates the traditional barriers faced by non-U.S. investors, offering a seamless and global investment opportunity. The combination of low-risk T-Bills and the transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology makes $RBILL a compelling option for diverse investor profiles. $RBILL provides real-time accountability and 24/7 subscriptions and redemptions, ensuring flexibility and convenience for investors.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>1.2. Key innovations of the Fund</strong></p>\n<p>Authorized structure in major crypto-friendly jurisdiction:</p>\n<p>Abu Dhabi is widely recognized as the top FinTech hub in the MENA region, with ADGM playing a pivotal role in championing the development of a sustainable and vibrant FinTech ecosystem. ADGM has set numerous “firsts” in the region, including the first FinTech regulatory regime and the first FinTech RegLab, which is now the second most active FinTech sandbox globally, after London.</p>\n<p>ADGM’s commitment to technological innovation within financial services aligns with its mission to support growth in FinTech while promoting systemic safety and consumer protection. Positioned strategically between European and Asian markets, Abu Dhabi serves as a global crossroads, where ADGM’s partnerships with regulators and private sector entities foster a thriving FinTech ecosystem.</p>\n<p>By being domiciled in ADGM, the Fund is being supervised by one of the most progressive, advanced and protective legal jurisdictions. ADGM is based on UK common law, making it a perfect domicile for the Fund:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clear and transparent regulation</li>\n<li>Best-in-class investor protection</li>\n<li>Strict supervision and compliance of the fund operations</li>\n<li>Thriving ecosystem with many of the largest financial institutions having set up their operations to ADGM in recent years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Direct tokenization of fund shares:</p>\n<p>Direct tokenisation is where the securities of the fund are directly tokenized, ie, instead of an issuance of participating shares in a fund, the fund issues security tokens which would then be traded on a platform. The Fund is managed by the Fund Manager in the same manner a traditional fund would.</p>\n<p>Some of the key benefits of this structure are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduction of complexity</li>\n<li>Less operational risks</li>\n<li>Increased investor protection</li>\n<li>Faster and easier issuance and redemption</li>\n<li>Real-time settlement on blockchain</li>\n<li>Counterparty risk reduced against a regulated investment fund</li>\n<li>Direct claim on assets in the fund, rather than in synthetic indirect tokenization structures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike competing solutions, the Realize T-BILLS Fund provides investors a directly tokenized fund structure, a rarity in the market. We believe this model represents a best-in-class approach for tokenizing funds, setting a new standard for fund tokenization within ADGM and globally.</p>\n<p>In stark contrast, indirect tokenization involves the fund operating as a more traditional vehicle, issuing participating shares as part of an investment round. These shares are typically subscribed to by a single entity (often offshore), referred to as the Custodian. The Custodian then issues tokens that provide contractual rights to the underlying assets it holds, with investors receiving tokens representing their interests in the ‘Fund.’ However, since the Custodian remains the participating shareholder, the tokenization may fall outside the scope of securities and fund regulations in the fund’s jurisdiction. This results in reduced oversight, higher operational costs, and the introduction of unknown risks for investors.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/i23tE3nkeJwDeLd0pzzUu0bHdwu.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_690x271.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"i23tE3nkeJwDeLd0pzzUu0bHdwu\" width=\"690\" height=\"271\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_690x271.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_1035x406.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_1380x542.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0E1DF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>0% Management fees and 0% Performance fees:</p>\n<p>Due to its pioneering direct tokenization model, the operational costs of the Fund are significantly lower compared to competing structures.

The Fund will not have any management fee and no performance fee.</p>\n<p>The Fund Manager reserves the right to introduce a potential 0.1% tokenization fee once the Fund reaches $100M AUM. However, depending on the success and demand of the product, this fee may be further reduced or waived.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>1.3.

We address the following issues:<p></p>\n<p>Isolated assets: Many tokenized assets exist in isolation, lacking Web3 compatibility and preventing them from being effectively integrated into DeFi ecosystems. We bridge this gap, enabling true interoperability and usability of tokenized assets across various dApps.</p>\n<p>Misaligned audience: Realize is addressing the growing demand in the Middle East for innovative financial solutions by focusing on real-world asset tokenization. With our launch in this region, we are positioned to meet the needs of sophisticated investors seeking reliable, compliant opportunities that align with the Middle East’s forward-looking financial landscape.</p>\n<p>Opaque fund structures: Many tokenization platforms rely on unregulated offshore structures, creating opacity around the funds and raising compliance concerns. Realize operates within a regulated framework, including the first direct tokenized fund structure launched under ADGM, providing clarity and security to investors.</p>\n<p>Indirect funds: Ineffective tokenization processes result in indirect fund structures, limiting the benefits of blockchain technology. We offer a direct tokenization model, unlocking greater liquidity, transparency, and yield-generating opportunities for investors.</p>\n<p>Extra fees: Many tokenization platforms charge [high] fees for the process itself, reducing overall returns. Realize offers a more cost-effective, transparent solution, ensuring that investors can maximize the value of their tokenized assets without unnecessary overhead.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>1.4. Legal framework for the tokenization of the Fund</strong></p>\n<p>In order to tokenize the Fund, the Fund will conduct an “Initial Token Offering” (an “ITO”) and offer tokens (the “Tokens”). The ITO will be a direct tokenization of an ADGM fund: The regulation permits fund-raising using DLT with the tokens representing a “traditional” regulated issuance, such as Shares, Debentures or Units in a Collective Investment Fund. In these instances, a DLT platform may also comprise a share or bond register. The issuance of the Tokens is akin to the issuance of “Units” in the Fund and will constitute Digital Securities. Accordingly, each holder of a Token could be considered a “Unitholder”. There is no express legislation or rules in ADGM as to process or requirements for an ITO. In order to try and adopt best-in-class principles and ensure transparency and compliance with ADGM laws and rules, the ITO will be undertaken on the same basis as an offering of Units in the Fund, together with customary elements that would form part of a “White Paper” used in token offerings, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detailed information about the token: The economic and legal features and characteristics of the Token which make it an FSRA regulated ‘security’.

The Fund will also accept Sky and USDS.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>A. We are in discussions with our regulator to find ways to ensure RBILL can be more interoperable in DeFi and to allow for secondary transfers. We are looking to build and support an RWA ecosystem in which RWAs can be utilized within DeFi. This will include partnerships with, or launching of our own, DeFi RWA-focused applications; management of RWA tokens on behalf of investors; and creation of RWA DeFi strategies.</p>\n<p>B. Outside of RBILL, Realize is an RWA tokenization platform which is capable of supporting additional RWA tokens. Realize currently has plans to launch two additional tokenized funds, and is in talks with several key players (both local to UAE and abroad) to tokenize further assets.</p>\n<p>At Realize, we see the tokenization of RWAs as the first step towards building a truly global, immersive, free and fair economy. In order to realize this vision, tokenized RWAs must have additional utility along with the ability to be traded on secondary markets.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>IV. Legal Structure</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund has been created with the sole purpose to support the launch of the RBILL token in a regulated and transparent manner. The Fund will not issue any separate or additional products to its investors.</p>\n<p>The Fund is managed by NeoVision, a licensed investment manager headquartered in UAE. Ascent Fund Services Limited is the regulated Administrator who will calculate the daily NAV and perform daily subscriptions and redemptions.</p>\n<p>Following the RBILL minting process, investors’ tokens are provided directly to the investor and are not retained by Realize, the Fund or any of its affiliates, unless the investor chooses to use a full custody service provider (partnerships to be announced shortly).</p>\n<p>Shares in US Treasury ETFs are acquired and custodied through our broker, Interactive Brokers LLC. Additional regulated brokers and custodians of the ETFs will be added in the future. Realize does not hold or retain any rights to the Fund’s assets and the Fund’s assets are not recognised on Realize’s or the Fund Manager’s balance sheet. Furthermore, no operational capital of Realize or its affiliates are commingled with the Fund’s assets (digital or otherwise). Assets are also not leveraged or managed within an investment strategy which ensures the assets are not at risk.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, the Fund is subject to an annual external audit, provided by Grant Thornton. This ensures that the management and administration of the Fund is in line with its legal and regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p>We are working with Chainlink and the Fund Administrator to implement off-chain proof of reserves and are exploring implementing a transparency council which would include a number of trusted partners who would have view access of the asset accounts for the Fund. We would be happy to add members of SparkDAO / MakerDAO to this council.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>The rights of token holders are entrenched in the Articles of Association of the Fund, of which a contractual nexus exists between the Fund and the token holders. Any subsequent transferee of a token, or a fraction of a token, will sign customary documents adhering to the various Fund documents binding it to the obligations thereunder and affording it their rights therein. In summary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The tokens afford the token holder a proportionate share in the assets of the Fund (in the same manner as participating shares would afford the holder a right in the assets of the fund in a traditional structure).</li>\n<li>The tokens may be subscribed for (minted) and redeemed (burned) in accordance with the Fund documents.</li>\n<li>Subscribers sign a token purchase agreement that will reflect substantially the form of a fund subscription agreement as well as containing all other information necessary in connection with the issuing of the investor’s tokens.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>6.

Performance, Reporting, and Technical</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is due to launch in October 2024 and as such we are unable to provide any historical performance records relative to benchmark.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports.</strong></p>\n<p>A daily NAV report will be issued by the Fund Administrator. We are also currently working towards Chainlink Proof of Reserves adoption together with a Transparency Committee which could include members of SparkDAO / MakerDAO. The Transparency Committee is planned to have view-access of both bank and custody accounts.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product:</strong></p>\n<p>Ascent has been appointed by the Fund as the fund administrator, pursuant to the terms of the administrative services agreement. The Administrator is responsible for providing services required in connection with the Fund’s operations, including (i) calculating the net asset value of the Fund; (ii) verifying the identity of investors for the purposes of anti-money laundering regulations; and (iii) preparing and submitting to the Fund and the Fund Manager all ancillary documentation that are used for the annual audit and the preparation of financial statements. The annual financial statements will be prepared in line with Ascent’s policies and procedures, and will be audited by <a href=\"https://www.grantthornton.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Grant Thornton</a>.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product:</strong></p>\n<p>Our product is built using Solidity for Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) but is designed with future scalability in mind, as we plan to extend support to non-EVM virtual machines. The core of the system operates through a series of smart contracts that manage tokenization, user interactions, price oracles, and whitelisting functions, all while ensuring high security and compliance standards.</p>\n<p>At the heart of our system is the TokenManager contract, which holds the core logic for both the current and future tokens issued on the platform. The TokenManager contract orchestrates essential functions like minting and burning tokens, managing pricing through oracles, and interacting with permissioned lists of users. The modular nature of TokenManager allows the system to be easily extendable, making it adaptable to new types of tokens or evolving business logic.</p>\n<p>Supporting the TokenManager are a series of contracts designed for specific purposes. Hub.sol handles user requests for minting and redeeming tokens, ensuring that collateral is deposited and tokens are issued appropriately. The Hub contract serves as the central point for token operations, coordinating between various contracts in the system, including pricing and whitelisting mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The ListAggregator.sol contract ensures that users meet all necessary criteria by checking multiple whitelists, providing an aggregated view of allowed or disallowed accounts. This is critical in ensuring compliance with various KYC and AML regulations, as different token providers may have specific rules for whitelisted addresses. Administrators can add or remove users from these lists using the ManagedList.sol contract, which allows flexibility in managing permissions.</p>\n<p>The TokenPrice.sol contract acts as a price oracle, allowing specific operators to adjust token prices within predefined limits. This is key for ensuring that the system remains adaptive to market conditions while maintaining strict control over price changes. The use of price oracles ensures that token minting and redemption operations always occur at a fair value, protecting both the platform and its users from price manipulation or errors.</p>\n<p>One of the standout features of our system is its ability to handle multiple tokens and operations simultaneously. The Proxy.sol contract provides upgradability, ensuring that the system can evolve without disrupting existing operations. This is particularly important for a platform dealing with real-world assets (RWAs), as regulations and business requirements may change over time.</p>\n<p>A crucial aspect of the Realize platform is its integration with Fireblocks, which plays a key role in securing all on-chain operations. Every critical operation, from minting and burning tokens to handling sensitive user-related functions, is tied to a Fireblocks MPC (Multi-Party Computation) Vault. This means that no single entity or person can execute an operation on their own; instead, it requires approval from multiple authorized parties, making the system more secure and reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.</p>\n<p>The Fireblocks Vault ensures that all actions require a series of cryptographic signatures from a committee before execution. This process not only protects the system from insider threats but also provides a transparent approval chain for every transaction. Every operation is logged and requires multiple approvals, ensuring that no unauthorized action can take place.</p>\n<p>We will further enhance security by incorporating Chainlink Proof of Reserve (PoR), which ensures that the collateral backing the tokens is fully transparent. By integrating PoR, users and regulators can verify in real-time that the system is appropriately collateralized, thus enhancing trust in the platform.</p>\n<p>From an operational perspective, Realize connects to Ascent Group’s systems, which handle the onboarding and KYC processes. Ascent’s technology, including its global ID coverage and automated transaction monitoring, ensures that users are onboarded quickly and securely. All user information remains confidential, and Realize does not store any sensitive personal data. Ascent’s systems, integrated with One Constellation, allow for real-time access to fund data, ensuring transparency for both fund managers and investors.</p>\n<p>By combining the security and transparency provided by Fireblocks, Chainlink PoR, and Ascent’s onboarding technology, Realize offers a secure, compliant, and scalable solution for managing tokenized real-world assets. The integration of both on-chain and off-chain security measures ensures that users can confidently participate in the platform, knowing that their assets and personal data are fully protected.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>5. What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>The smart contracts for our product underwent a comprehensive audit by Zokyo Security in July 2024. The audit yielded a high score of 98/100, with no critical or high-severity issues. All identified medium and low-severity issues were resolved, and the audit covered key areas, including test coverage (97.27%), security against reentrancy, and overall adherence to industry best practices. The audit report confirmed that our contracts are well-crafted, organized, and secure for handling token minting and redemption processes backed by real-world assets.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs:</strong></p>\n<p>The team behind Realize has been involved in DAOs since early 2020. The primary experience has been in establishing the legal framework in establishing a Marshall Island DAO and guiding the process of establishing and getting community-approval for establishing the DAO. In addition to that, the Realize ecosystem team is in close contact with several major DAOs to invest into and diversify their treasury into the Fund. We expect to go through several other DAO governance processes to allocate part of the treasury of those DAOs to the Fund in the coming weeks.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Realize is an RWA tokenization, building out a range of tokenized regulated fund products, bringing yield-bearing assets on-chain and making them fully compatible and usable within Web3. As part of this ecosystem, Realize will launch a utility token in Q4 of this year. Realize is entirely self-funded and has no external investors, making it a pure token distribution that will be maximally community-oriented and aligned.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/v4f5MqKB2D21YAYa484NaitTKeC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_624x339.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"v4f5MqKB2D21YAYa484NaitTKeC\" width=\"624\" height=\"339\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_624x339.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_936x508.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_1248x678.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEAF8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Unlike other RWA ecosystems, where the token is a limited governance token with no real rights or participation in the success of the ecosystem, the Realize token will be deeply embedded in the Realize platform to directly benefit token holders from the growth and success of the Realize RWA ecosystem. In addition to that, token holders can unlock various rewards, access premium features, fee rebates and actively participate in governance decisions. It serves as a key driver of engagement within the ecosystem, encouraging active involvement and long-term commitment from the community.</p>\n<p>We take great inspiration from the incredible success of $MKR (now $SKY) and the MakerDAO governance process and community and want to work together to build the future of finance on-chain. Realize proposes to offer MakerDAO / SparkDAO <em><strong>up to a 5% token allocation and airdrop to $SKY holders</strong></em>. Details of the token airdrop and distribution will be discussed by both communities.</p>\n<p>Apart from the token allocation, the Realize team is very happy to work closely with the MakerDAO / SparkDAO teams on future products and tokenized assets.

I hope you can provide clear answers and address any concerns that other potential users like myself might have. Here are my key questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How is the security of my DAI deposit ensured?</strong><br>\nWhat mechanisms are in place to prevent the theft or loss of funds while interacting with the <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> protocol? Are there any smart contract audits or insurance policies in place to mitigate potential risks?</li>\n<li><strong>What happens if the website or protocol goes down?</strong><br>\nIn the unlikely event that <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> becomes unavailable due to technical issues, cyber-attacks, or even a complete shutdown, what will happen to my deposited DAI? Will I still be able to access and withdraw my funds through alternate means (e.g., interacting directly with the smart contract)?</li>\n<li><strong>Are there KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements?</strong><br>\nDoes <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> have any policies requiring KYC verification for users? If so, at what stage is it mandatory? This is crucial to understand from both a compliance and privacy perspective.</li>\n<li><strong>Can my wallet be frozen or restricted?</strong><br>\nUnder what circumstances, if any, could <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> or any associated entity freeze, restrict, or block access to my wallet? For example, would compliance with regulatory requests or suspicious activity trigger such actions?</li>\n<li><strong>What are the risks associated with depositing into the <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> protocol?</strong><br>\nWhile I understand that all DeFi protocols carry inherent risks, could you outline the specific risks that are most relevant to <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a>? Are there any particular vulnerabilities users should be aware of?</li>\n<li><strong>How is governance handled?</strong><br>\nDoes <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> have a governance model where users can vote on decisions? How decentralized is the protocol’s decision-making process, and how can I stay informed of governance updates or participate in governance myself?</li>\n<li><strong>Is there a withdrawal limit or fee structure?</strong><br>\nWhat are the withdrawal policies in terms of limits, fees, or delays? Are there any situations where withdrawals might be temporarily paused?</li>\n<li><strong>How are interest rates or yields determined?</strong><br>\nCould you explain how yields are calculated on DAI deposits and what factors might affect the return on investment? Are these yields subject to significant fluctuation?</li>\n<li><strong>What recourse is available in case of loss?</strong><br>\nIn the unfortunate event of a hack, exploit, or catastrophic failure of the protocol, is there any recourse for recovering lost funds? Does <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> have any protection funds, insurance mechanisms, or partnerships that users should be aware of?</li>\n<li><strong>How can I monitor the health of the protocol?</strong><br>\nAre there any recommended tools or dashboards I should use to track the performance and security of the protocol? What should I watch for in terms of metrics to assess its ongoing reliability?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I believe these questions are critical for anyone considering a substantial DAI deposit into <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> or any DeFi protocol, and I hope to receive detailed responses to make an informed decision.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.
