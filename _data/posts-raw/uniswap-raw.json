The initial onboarding packages of this program cost the Uniswap DAO at least $3.5M worth of assets.</p>\n<p>We propose that Uniswap DAO engage with Forse, our DAO intelligence and analytics platform, to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth program and assess if the current approach drives real growth.</p>\n<p>By holistically assessing the impacts of the Revitalization and Growth Program, the Uniswap DAO will have valuable insights to improve further iterations of the Revitalization and Growth Program or other incentive programs. Armed with this information, Uniswap DAO will be able to understand what was the most relevant user groups, and their acquisition cost, and evaluate if the Revitalization and Growth program effectively modified user behavior and led to increased stickiness of users, and therefore TVL and other top-level protocol metrics.</p>\n<p>Recently, StableLab supported the Arbitrum DAO as the Program Manager for the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program</a>, and we delivered a comprehensive <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stablelab-analyzing-stip-s-efficacy-and-ltipp-comparison/24777/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">analysis</a> of the STIP to the Arbitrium DAO.</p>\n<p>With Uniswap allocating over $3.5M worth of assets for the purpose of growing Uniswap’s market share, it is essential to ensure that the DAO analyses and reviews the impact of these incentives on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Forse?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forse.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Forse</a> is a data and intelligence platform built by StableLab helping DAOs analyze the impact of governance decisions in protocol growth, top-line metrics, and governance operations, including its cost and effort structures. <a href=\"https://www.stablelab.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">StableLab</a> is the leading provider of governance products and solutions for decentralized protocols.

The Accountability Committee will be responsible for updating this thread.</p>\n<p><strong>What does it mean for a deployment to be “official”?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uniswap v3 was initially released under a BUSL license to prevent others from forking the protocol and using it for commercial purposes. As of April 2023, the BUSL was converted to an open-source license, allowing for the commercial usage of the v3 contracts. Such a transition can lead anyone to deploy the relevant v3 contracts on any EVM, claiming those contracts to be “the official Uniswap”.</li>\n<li>In order to prevent entities apart from the Uniswap DAO, who may or may not have ill intentions or an ulterior motive behind deploying the given v3 contracts, the Uniswap Foundation implemented <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/38\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a process</a> to officiate deployments across numerous EVMs.</li>\n<li>This grants authority solely to the Uniswap DAO to declare which v3 deployments are official, thereby preserving Uniswap’s reputable brand.

Uniswap would make it easier for us to grow our market cap, and as we grow our market cap, more public goods will be funded.</li>\n<li>Facilitating embedded philanthropy into the wallets of Uniswap users. As the barrier of fees would be removed for users, they’d be more motivated to buy and hold Glo Dollars and fund public goods at no cost.</li>\n<li>Support the development of an alternative <a href=\"https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/EntityDetails.aspx/COMPANY/2376957\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">US regulated</a> stablecoin that benefits the public and the broader crypto ecosystem.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most swaps to Glo Dollar are made on Uniswap, and it could result in many more swaps if fees were waived to grow our market cap and fund more public goods. At scale, each additional million in Glo Dollar market cap would generate up to $50,000 in public goods funding per year—at no cost to the user.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-is-glo-dollar-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#what-is-glo-dollar-2\"></a>What is Glo Dollar?</h2>\n<p>Stablecoin companies generate $7.4 billion annually from their reserves.</p>\n<p>Our approach is different—we funnel 100% of profits to charitable causes. By adopting Glo Dollar, you fund your favorite public goods without paying for it. We call it Automatic Public Goods Funding (AutoPGF).</p>\n<p>Our users choose which causes to support: web3 public goods, fighting extreme poverty, or combating climate change.</p>\n<p>Individuals and companies embed zero-cost philanthropy with Glo in many ways. Gitcoin and Polygon Labs added Glo Dollars to their treasuries. Others pay salaries in Glo Dollars, or use Glo Dollar backed credit cards.</p>\n<p>When you hold Glo Dollars, you can choose the causes you’d like to support <a href=\"https://app.glodollar.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">from our dApp</a>. All our donations are made onchain and <a href=\"https://www.glodollar.org/articles/donations\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">reported on our website</a>.</p>\n<p>Glo Dollar is 100% fiat-backed, always redeemable 1:1 for USD and USDC, and is issued and regulated in the US. Glo Dollar is available across 7 blockchains: Ethereum, Celo, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Stellar, and Base.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Uniswap users can swap between USDC and USDT without paying fees.</p>\n<p>Swaps from USDT or USDC into Glo Dollar (USDGLO) incur a fee of 0.25%. For example, if a user exchanges $1,000 worth of USDC for USDGLO, they would pay a fee of about $25.</p>\n<p>Because holding Glo Dollars = funding public cost (at no cost), we believe that users should be motivated to swap Glo Dollars without paying fees.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"risks-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#risks-4\"></a>Risks</h2>\n<p>Glo Dollar is 100% fiat-backed, always redeemable 1:1 for USD and USDC, issued and regulated in the United States, and receives <a href=\"https://brale.xyz/stablecoins/USDGLO\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">monthly independent attestations</a>.</p>\n<p>In April, we received our <a href=\"https://bluechip.org/coins/usdglo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bluechip rating</a>, with an initial B grade.

We offer our members educational and professional development, in addition to project-based opportunities. Over the past six years, Michigan Blockchain has partnered with over 20 organizations and has governed a combined $30M in delegations. All new members go through a semester-long cohort that teaches them about the fundamentals of blockchain and provides them exposure to a diversity of blockchain applications. Our educational program prepares members for organizational involvement through three main avenues: governance, consulting, and investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Governance Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Our team has actively participated in governance voting and spearheaded proposal development for 5 primary protocols: Uniswap, Arbitrum, Compound, Origin Protocol, and Stader Labs. Each protocol is assigned a designated expert, responsible for continuous monitoring of the protocol’s developments on forums, social media, and voting platforms (Snapshot and Tally).</p>\n<p>At committee meetings, protocol leads share updates with the entire governance team on active proposals and debate the pros/cons to reach a collective decision on how to vote with our delegated tokens. We have a high participation rate, having reviewed and kept up our voting record for each delegated protocol. Additionally, our team has successfully led the establishment of proposals from start to finish. Prior to publicization, we collaborate with numerous stakeholders including investors, DAO service providers, and other protocols to draft proposals properly.</p>\n<p>By delegating to our organization, you permit your tokens to be effectively and actively used for furthering innovation on the leading decentralized exchange. We aim to have the Uniswap DAO serve as a role model for decentralized community participation and further solidify its position in the DeFi landscape.</p>\n<p>Historically, we have interacted on Uniswap forums under individuals’ names, but going forward it will be under the Michigan Blockchain name.</p>\n<p><strong>Values</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fostering an inclusive community that encourages diversity, education, and open-minded discussions to produce the best ideas</li>\n<li>Ensuring sustainability through the long-term success of the protocol, along with governance token value accrual for the benefit of the DAO without negatively impacting dapp users</li>\n<li>Promoting open communication and visibility to build trust while prioritizing flexibility to swiftly address issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Possible Conflicts of Interest</strong></p>\n<p>We are active governance contributors to ARB, COMP, OGN, and SD.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/michigan-blockchain-delegate-platform/24198\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/michigan-blockchain-delegate-platform/24198","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:31:23 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24198"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/michigan-blockchain-delegate-platform/24198.rss","#text":"Michigan Blockchain Delegate Platform"}},{"title":"GFX Labs - Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"GFXlabs","category":"Uncategorized","description":"<p><em>This thread is intended to provide a record of GFX Labs’ voting and communication around the reasoning of each vote.

Separate from this proposal, Manta has arranged for Oku to support Manta, and the contracts have been deployed.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Vote <strong>For</strong>. GFX Labs authored the proposal.

The proposal bundles four proposals that have previously been approved in individual temperature checks. While we typically like to avoid bundling proposals, we consulted with the Accountability Committee (AC) and other members of the DAO prior to posting the proposal to weigh the operational headache of getting four delegates to make proposals. In the future, the organization could consider upgrading our governance contract to make it easier to run multiple governance proposals.

The proposal is co-authored by Arana.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> Vote <strong>For</strong>. We support the DAO’s exploration of new ways to manage its treasury and are particularly interested in how it might handle protocol-owned liquidity. After deploying UNI incentives to several new EVM chains, it would be great if the DAO could begin allocating ETH-stablecoin and stable-stable LP to chains.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xf17f3ca6b3d1aa6d8061a733fc0d627558159e0057f76ddfe056ea492cf56163\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Temp Check - DeFi Education Fund</a><br>\n<strong>Summary</strong>: GFX Labs sponsored DEF’s proposal, which requested 1M UNI. 500K was transferred to the DEF’s Coinbase account, and the other 500K will be streamed to the DEF over 12 months. DEF’s founding grant came in July 2021. They have two years of operations currently, but for them to fight larger and longer battles, they need additional funding.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Vote <strong>For</strong>. The DEF has proven to be a great investment for the DAO and the ecosystem.

The program will run for three months. Qualifying delegates will receive compensation based on some basic metrics.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Vote <strong>For</strong>. GFX Labs is in favor of being a delegate compensation program. Delegate compensation is a key issue in attracting and retaining high-quality delegates. While this program is imperfect in many ways, we will not let perfection prevent progress. Instead, we invite (and have done so proactively) other organizations and delegates to propose improved programs. Ideally, the DAO can select a new and improved program each cycle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0x35ed89cbda5bd11e333202c62d89fa223eab651adeb5e2cf6640d22411cc0946\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Temp Check - Onboard Uniswap to Redstone</a><br>\n<strong>Summary</strong>: Redstone is requesting to become an official Uniswap deployment and an Onboarding Package. Due to Redstone’s limited TVL and market position, it does not merit an Onboarding Package at this time. We would be happy to reevaluate down the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:  Deploy without incentives. As always, we are in favor of new Uniswap deployments for any chain that follows the process and passes ownership back to the DAO.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/63\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi Education Fund</a><br>\n<strong>Summary</strong>: GFX Labs sponsored DEF’s proposal, which requested 1M UNI. 500K was transferred to the DEF’s Coinbase account, and the other 500K will be streamed to the DEF over 12 months.

In their application to Arbitrum DAO, the UADP stated that they would request a matching of funds from Uniswap. Gauntlet will manage the rewarded funds via Merkl’s platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Vote (1st) $250k, (2nd) Do Not Fund, (3rd) $500k, (4th) $750k, (5th) $1m. Uniswap has a strong position in Arbitrum. A modest matching of funds with the LTIPP seems appropriate, but we discourage significant investment in Arbitrum over other opportunities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/65\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap Arbitrum LTIPP Matching </a><br>\n<strong>Summary</strong>: The UADP secured 1M ARB from Arbitrum’s LTIPP program. In their application to Arbitrum DAO, the UADP stated that they would request a matching of funds from Uniswap. Gauntlet will manage the rewarded funds via Merkl’s platform. The prior temperature check resulted in $750K, which is requested in this onchain proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Vote <strong>For</strong>. While the amount is more than we had ideally considered, it is within reason. However, we will be unlikely to vote in favor of further UNI allocated to Arbitrum unless there is clear evidence of Uniswap losing meaningful market share and a clear plan for the UNI to combat that issue.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/24194\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/24194","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 01:52:32 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24194"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/24194.rss","#text":"GFX Labs - Delegate Communication Thread"}},{"title":"[RFC] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Mantle Network","dc:creator":"MantleCoreTeam","category":"Proposal Discussion","description":"<h2><a name=\"proposal-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#proposal-summary-1\"></a>Proposal Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The purpose of this post is to simply communicate alignment from the Mantle Core Contributor Team, describe the current state of Mantle, and allow for there to be a space on the forums tracking this deployment.</li>\n<li>All of the Uni v3 contracts have already been deployed (see below), and this deployment has been <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xd457a6cdb9e20002d74c30818b7b35a694af04c627cc7bf6d855d4ece9409333\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">elected by the DAO to receive $250k UNI worth of incentives</a>.</li>\n<li>No further actions need to be taken by the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"about-mantle-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#about-mantle-2\"></a>About Mantle</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"network-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#network-overview-3\"></a>Network Overview</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://mantle.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Network</a> is an optimistic Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution with an EVM-compatible execution environment. Mantle is DAO-governed and employs a modular approach to execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability. Mantle Network Mainnet Alpha v1 was launched on July 17, 2023. Mantle Network Mainnet v2 Tectonic was launched on March 15, 2024.</p>\n<p>Mantle Network distinguishes itself through a <a href=\"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/overview#modular-architecture\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">modular chain design</a> by separating transaction, execution, consensus, settlement, and storage into different modules. In Mantle Network’s architecture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The execution layer is EVM-compatible and responsible for transaction execution. A sequencer produces L2 blocks and sends state root data to layer 1 (L1).</li>\n<li>Consensus and settlement are conducted on Ethereum’s L1.</li>\n<li>Data availability is ensured through Mantle DA, leveraging EigenDA technology to store callback data, which in conventional rollups would be published directly to L1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This modular approach allows for greater flexibility and optimization across different functionalities of the network.</p>\n<p>Mantle Ecosystem comprises of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/concepts/optimistic-rollups#what-are-optimistic-rollups\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Network</a> - A modular Ethereum L2.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Governance</a> - A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.mantle.xyz/governance/parameters/treasury#treasury-holdings-core\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Treasury</a> - One of the largest on-chain treasuries in the industry.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mantle.xyz/meth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle LSP</a> - A permissionless, non-custodial ETH liquid staking protocol deployed on Ethereum L1 and governed by Mantle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mantle Network is governed by Mantle token (MNT), which serves as the central element in Mantle Ecosystem, fulfilling multiple roles including being the native gas token for transaction fees and fueling ecosystem growth. It’s also the governance token that empowers the community to make decisions about the ecosystem’s future directions.</p>\n<p>In an effort to spur innovation and development, Mantle also has financial initiatives like Mantle Grants Program and Mantle EcoFund, the latter boasting a sizable $200 million catalyzed capital pool, more on this below.

Out of the 17 major EVM &amp; Ethereum networks, the Uniswap contract accounts for less than 1% of the total total value locked (TVL) in 6 of them.</p>\n<p>Possible factors hindering Uniswap’s local market penetration include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited Reach - lack of an official Uniswap front-end support on many emerging Ethereum Layer-2 networks.</li>\n<li>Competitive Positioning - native DEXs have an inherent advantage in building local engagement by incentivising liquidity for native tokens.</li>\n<li>Absence of the canonical Uniswap-themed Interface - absence of a simple and familiar Uniswap front-end across some Layer-2s, creates for significant barriers to onboarding retail users</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"dapdap-proposal-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#dapdap-proposal-3\"></a>DapDap Proposal</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><a name=\"unique-value-proposition-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#unique-value-proposition-4\"></a>Unique Value Proposition</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"existing-user-base-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#existing-user-base-5\"></a>Existing User Base:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>DapDap is a platform with +130,000 retail users, averaging +10,000 daily visits and 2,000+ daily users completing on-chain transactions</li>\n<li>Direct accessibility to 200+ applications across 17 chains, giving us the ability to easily direct users to DapDap’s Uniswap frontend with a superior UX</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"front-end-composability-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#front-end-composability-6\"></a>Front-end Composability:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>DapDap’s main value lies in its frontend composability, giving access to Uniswap, LP vaults (e.g, Gamma), lending (e.g., Layerbank), and bridging (e.g., Across) within a single UI</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Simple user journey centred around Uniswap as a DEX</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Competitive UX compared to other local DEXs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"business-development-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#business-development-7\"></a>Business Development:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Existing relationships with 200+ integrated DeFi applications across 17 chains</li>\n<li>Natural fit to build business relationships for Uniswap with local complementary DeFi services like lending, bridges, vaults, etc.</li>\n<li>Ability to integrate external DeFi features into our Uniswap-focused interface, run marketing campaigns, and direct user attention towards Uniswap instead of local DEXs</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3><a name=\"development-and-deployment-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#development-and-deployment-8\"></a>Development and Deployment</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Allocation of 5k $UNI for DapDap team efforts per network:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>3k $UNI for initial development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UI/UX design (1 week)</li>\n<li>Front-end Development (4 weeks):</li>\n<li>Swap, Account component, Liquidity management</li>\n<li>Slippage settings, Local token whitelisting function, Smart-routing</li>\n<li>Additional functionality (2 weeks):</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Block explorer support, i18n, Transaction data page, Embedded bridge aggregator functionality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1k $UNI for maintenance (server and dev costs) for one year</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1k $UNI for continued integration of new DeFi services</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total cost per Network: 5k $UNI</p>\n<p>Selected Initial Networks to Deploy: Linea, Scroll</p>\n<p>Total Cost for 2 Networks: 10k $UNI</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3><a name=\"user-and-business-engagement-strategies-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#user-and-business-engagement-strategies-9\"></a>User and Business Engagement Strategies</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Allocation of 5k $UNI for Business Development &amp;

In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.</p>\n<p>Since Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This proposal requests a retroactive Onboarding Package for Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>While already deployed on Gnosis Chain, Uniswap is not currently capitalizing on it. This proposal aims to change that.</p>\n<p>One of the key areas of focus suggested by the Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee to expand the Uniswap ecosystem is “Uniswap Revitalization and Growth”. In their recent work, a large emphasis is on revisiting some of the old deployments and proactively capturing first-mover advantage on promising new chains.</p>\n<p>As Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth across Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we believe the chain aligns perfectly with the scope of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth initiative. Uniswap’s deployment on Gnosis Chain was completed in early 2022, hence Gnosis Chain was never a beneficiary of the “Onboarding Package” that is now included as a standard element of deployment proposals.</p>\n<p>We believe there are synergies between Uniswap and Gnosis Chain as well as a strong potential for Gnosis Chain to generate high volumes and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of its focus on payments and financial tools.</p>\n<p>As a comparison, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).</p>\n<p>We believe that additional visibility and an incentive program would enable both Uniswap and Gnosis Chain to tap into their synergies resulting in positive growth on both ends.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"about-gnosis-chain-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#about-gnosis-chain-3\"></a>About Gnosis Chain</h3>\n<p>Gnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. It features fast transaction times (5 seconds) and low transaction fees (500 tx for $0.01) with the unique advantage of having a stable token as a base asset for transactions and gas fees.</p>\n<p>One of the first Ethereum sidechains, Gnosis Chain’s core values are resilience and credible neutrality. By allowing contributors to easily run a node, Gnosis Chain created a community-owned, anti-fragile network secured by a geographically diverse validator set. Its strong culture of at-home stakers (not reliant on cloud providers or data centres) and its community governance ensure Gnosis Chain remains credibly neutral at a lower price point than Mainnet.</p>\n<p>Gnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralised financial tools accessible and usable for all. The collective features established blue chip projects like Safe as well as prominent ones like Gnosis Pay and Monerium.</p>\n<p>In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"benefits-to-uniswap-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#benefits-to-uniswap-4\"></a>Benefits to Uniswap</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Multichain Uniswap</a> approach has proven successful with approx. <a href=\"https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/uniswap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">35% of trading volumes</a> in the last 6 months come from non-Ethereum-Mainnet deployments.</p>\n<p>Since Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new and existing users leveraging Gnosis Chain as a payments infrastructure is a promising opportunity for the project to reach a new audience.</p>\n<p>Gnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects, building synergic services to Uniswap. Among those, Safe and Gnosis Pay. Safe Smart Accounts count 9.1 Million accounts deployed with $100B+ in total assets stored and VIP individuals (e.g. Vitalik) using them. Gnosis Pay is the world’s first on-chain spending account with a Visa Debit Card linked to a self-custodial blockchain wallet, connected with 80 Million merchants worldwide. Roll-out in Europe and the United Kingdom has already started, with upcoming new Countries including Brazil and Argentina. That is a combined population of approx. 1.45 Billion people.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Gnosis Chain powers a growing DeFi sector with numerous blue chip projects added since Q4 2023. These include Aave, whose market on Gnosis Chain has grown rapidly since its launch 7 months ago and is now larger than the lending protocol’s markets on Base and Scroll (as of May 2024). sDAI (MakerDAO’s interest-earning DAI) accumulated over $68 Million TVL since October 2023. Focusing on the on-chain trading vertical, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). This means, Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).</p>\n<p>Based on the above and observing Uniswap’s performance across blockchains, we anticipate the protocol will replicate its success in capturing market share on Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"bridges-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#bridges-5\"></a>Bridges</h3>\n<p>Gnosis Chain is committed to providing easy and secure access to Ethereum L1 and other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. For this reason, multiple bridging options are available to connect with Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/omnibridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Omnibridge</a> is a native token bridge that connects Ethereum and Gnosis Chain (and vice-versa) by minting the canonical representation of bridged assets on Gnosis. The Omnibridge is built on top of the <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/amb-bridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB)</a>, a key bridge primitive that is used inside higher-order bridges like the Omnibridge and allows Gnosis contracts to send data and trigger contract functions on Ethereum and vice-versa. Therefore, the Omnibridge relies on the same trust models and group of <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/management/validators#amb--omnibridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Trusted Bridge Validators</a> as the AMB. Part of these validators is Succinct Lab’s zkSNARK-enabled Light Client, Telepathy. Telepathy is a key component of the AMB bridge ecosystem as it enhances security and reliability for cross-chain transactions by providing validity proofs via zkSNARKs that ensure trustless verification of transaction events across chains.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/xdai-bridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">xDAI bridge</a> is a native DAI bridge from Ethereum that is used to mint and burn xDAI, the native asset used for gas and transaction fees on Gnosis.</p>\n<p>Gnosis has a long-term roadmap to move towards trustless bridges and is investing resources into trust-minimization of its bridges, to ensure trust and safety of users. <a href=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hashi</a> is an EVM Hash Oracle Aggregator designed to enhance cross-chain bridge security by aggregating block headers from various sources. It supports 15+ General Message Passing bridges and ZK light clients, promoting redundancy and reducing reliance on single mechanisms. By requiring validation from multiple independent mechanisms, Hashi ensures greater resilience against security incidents.

We are mindful that these are opinions from accepted grantees and naturally are inclined toward more positive experiences with the UAGP. However, we still believe its worthwhile to run this exercise to test ourselves for any apparent gaps. This assumption was stress-tested by the fact no individual response rated the likelihood to recommend the UAGP to peers lower than a 9.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"uagp-learnings-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#uagp-learnings-2\"></a>UAGP Learnings</h3>\n<p>Over the past five months, operating the UAGP has taught us several valuable lessons about managing a cross-ecosystem grant program, and we wanted to take a moment to highlight some of the more relevant learnings we’ve collected from our recent operations lately. A summary first, then addressing each learning in more detail below:</p>\n<p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reporting Alignment: We adjusted our reporting processes from monthly to bimonthly to better align with the long-term focus of UAGP grants, reducing burnout and creating a more streamlined reporting flow.</li>\n<li>Cross Ecosystem Collaboration: We initiated a Grant Program alignment group to streamline cross-ecosystem collaboration and communication, addressing eligibility and overlap issues between Uniswap and Arbitrum grant programs.</li>\n<li>Prospective Applicant Perspectives: Discussions with rejected applicants highlighted the need for specific evaluation feedback, a clearer assessment rubric, and more streamlined application forms; all concerns we feel confident we have addressed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One major insight was the opportunity to adapt our reporting processes to better align with the nature of our grants (and grantees!). Given the long-term focus of UAGP grants, and the associated longer feedback loops between project initiation and milestone achievement, we pushed reporting and tracking tasks from monthly to bimonthly. In practice, this reporting change allows grantees to focus on their work and report only the most salient details in a period, reducing the risk of burnout for both grantees and community members involved in monthly reporting. This adjustment has been the latest adjustment in what we believe to now be a very streamlined reporting flow for grantees and the DAOs.</p>\n<p>Another insight came about when awareness for the UAGP picked began to pick up: we faced increasing overlaps with applications relevant to other parts of the Uniswap or Arbitrum ecosystem. This resulted in a manual process of having multiple bilateral Telegram chats with the other relevant Grant Programs / Foundations on the Uniswap and Arbitrum side sending applicants to different parts of the ecosystem and checking potential eligibility. While in the Uniswap ecosystem the ways are short and we have one specific counterparty for Grants (Aaron), on the Arbitrum side there are several relevant Grant programs. This led us to initiate an overarching Grant Program alignment group and helped steer initiatives to streamline this process through joint communication channels, incl. tackling topics such as potential double-dipping.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have also had several open topics and learnings emerge from the vibrant UAGP community discussions which play out across many forums and include all stakeholders, from delegates to rejected &amp; prospective UAGP applicants.  In particular, in community discussions with rejected UAGP applicants who raised concerns about perceived incongruities in the program, we were given deeper insight into the applicant perspective and journey through the UAGP. While at times it is important to take these opinions with a grain of salt, we hear all opinions with the utmost respect and consideration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Provide specific feedback to every applicant:</strong> While we would love to provide personalized feedback to every applicant, it is difficult due to the sheer volume of applications. Currently, we offer detailed feedback to applicants who specifically request it. If the DAO decides that every applicant should receive detailed denial feedback, we are happy to factor this into capacity planning for a potential extension of the program.</li>\n<li><strong>Make evaluation of all grantees public:</strong> While we have public evaluation rubrics to promote transparency on how our committee is assessing projects, in line with other leading grant programs within web3 including Arbitrum Foundation Grants and Plurality Labs, we do not make specific evaluation of grantees public. We decided to follow this market standard due to mitigate potential negative follow-on effects on denied applicants that could results out of a bad rating.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce number of application questions:</strong> In response to feedback about the program’s application questions being difficult to align with projects, we have simplified them in our recent extension round update to make it streamline this process for applicants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We deeply appreciate the community’s ongoing support and feedback, which help us strengthen the UAGP. We welcome all community feedback as we strive to build the best possible program.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We hope this mid-term survey and learnings help shine transparency on the current operation of the program. Our DMs are always open for thoughts or comments on what other data points to include going forward. We’re thrilled with the progress so far and are excited to continue extended operations for a few more months. Please stay tuned for next month’s full reporting as more downstream milestones (and launches!) are beginning to be achieved.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"contact-points-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#contact-points-3\"></a>Contact Points</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/white_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":white_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> To find all info: <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/1c1e8b33bc60436993dd65e37d022f9d?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UAGP Information Hub</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/white_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":white_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> To reach out: <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/597638925346930701/1165739066365579314\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Discord</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/white_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":white_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> To stay up to date: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniArbGrants\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a></p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-midway-learnings-survey/24110\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-midway-learnings-survey/24110","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 08:16:00 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24110"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-midway-learnings-survey/24110.rss","#text":"Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) - Midway Learnings & Survey"}},{"title":"Diversity for Working Groups","dc:creator":"drllau_LexDAO","category":"Governance-Meta","description":"<p>My observation is that working groups tend to be the <a href=\"https://communityrule.info/templates/self-appointed-board.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">self-appointed board</a> followed by co-opting (election/ratification) of “inner” circle.

Here are the next steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Delegate Reward for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WXf8Z2AnLIyKGNKYjKKsfb-c-d1hmCLAX-5rYAbiHDk/edit#gid=1513921069\">12 Delegates</a> will be available starting June 2024. The basic requirement is of following:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>-Maintain 80% onchain and offchain voting participation for the past 3 months. Achieving this will provide $3,000 USD worth of $UNI</p>\n<p>The snapshot date for the past 3 months for June will be taken at July 1st 9pm CET. Only proposals that have been completed would be counted (so if there’s a voting that for example go for June 30 to July 4th, as the voting is still ongoing as of July 1st, it won’t count as part of voting participation)</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>There’s also additional reward (only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled):</li>\n</ol>\n<p>-Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile. Achieving this will provide an additional $3,000 USD worth of $UNI</p>\n<p>While there are some discussions around when writing the rationale would be the most effective (for example, some would argue while the voting is still happening while some say within a week or two after the voting), for this month, we believe having it available till July 3rd 9pm CET for votings that have finished in June seems reasonable so that even if it ended on the last day of June, a delegate has time to write up the rationale. For easier tracking as well as for transparency with the community, please create a delegate profile and share the updates and rationales there as is a standard across different DAOs. Of course, sharing via other ways such as snapshot or tally is possible but it won’t count as fulfilling this requirement for this month.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Accountability Committee will help to keep track of these and share the status and qualification by July 8th. The delegates and the community will have till July 12 to challenge the result (for example, a delegate voted on a certain proposal but Accountability Committee mistakenly marked it down as not voted and thus challenged). If all is good or corrected, the first payments can be sent by the Accountability Committee on the week of July 15th. We are sure as the process becomes more streamlined, the payments can be sent earlier as time goes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Regarding Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group will be given the template to fill the hours for the retro payment (the max hours will be 40 hours). Please fill them by June 7th 9pm CET. Some members might take longer but please fill them by June 10th 9pm CET by the latest. Then the Accountability Committee will proceed with sending the payments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The current Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group will be dissolved.

The options the DAO has to vote on are four: $250k, $500k, $750k, and $1M. We cannot guarantee that the DAO will vote to match incentives, but we will make a best-effort attempt and report the results of the temperature check”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We will be collaborating with Gauntlet and Merkl to distribute the incentives (cost breakdowns are below)</li>\n<li>To those ends, we are running this temperature check to see if the DAO is interested in matching the given LTIPP grant to some capacity</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"about-the-ltipp-application-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#about-the-ltipp-application-2\"></a>About the LTIPP Application</h2>\n<p>Uniswap did not apply to the first two rounds of Arbitrum incentives (STIP 1 &amp; 2). This was for two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Native DEXs and smaller protocols deserve a chance to make a name for themselves and perhaps offer unique protocols for trading</li>\n<li>We did not have a formal structure like the UADP to help facilitate an application</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since many native DEXs–and non-native ones–have already had the chance to apply for ARB incentives throughout the past year across multiple incentive distribution initiatives, the UADP decided that it’s now the right time for Uniswap to also partake in these programs, especially since other blue-chip protocols also applied for these incentives. Plus, the establishment of this committee has allowed Uniswap DAO to further mature its relationship with Arbitrum DAO. We’ve partaken in multiple discourses, participating in all of the votes taking place on Arbitrum since November 2023 (see <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/uniswap-arbitrum-delegate-program-uadp-communication-thread/19225\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Communication Thread here</a>).</p>\n<p>The LTIPP pilot program is a 3-month long incentive program, with 45M worth of ARB to be distributed among an elected group of protocols. A total of 174 applications were vetted by the LTIPP Advisors, with whom we interacted and obtained feedback during the month of March. One of the primary sticking points was the amount of capital that we initially requested, along with clarifications around some of the target KPIs behind our request.</p>\n<p>After some deliberation, in line with many other projects, we ended up lowering our ARB ask from 2.5M to 1M, which increased our chances of being admitted into the program by the Advisors and ARB delegates.

We believe in more than just participating; we believe in actively shaping and improving projects within our sphere and we are committed to expressing our principles and rationale in a clear, transparent, and detailed manner in this forum.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"seedorgseedgovuniswap-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#seedorgseedgovuniswap-4\"></a>SEEDOrg&gt;SEEDGov&gt;Uniswap</h3>\n<p>Participation in forum discussion threads and daily activities represent the opinions of SEEDGov and collaborators in their efforts to stay up to date with their roles and commitment to governance. Regular discussions occur prior to deciding our next steps and opinions about governance topics that arise, all through this profile.</p>\n<p>Our delegation will do its utmost to represent and embody our values to enhance Uniswap governance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Uniswap is one of the most decentralized DeFi protocols and all of our initiatives and proposals will align with this same principle. Along with this position, and as the ecosystem continues to mature and be driven by its community, we will collaborate in the creation, iteration, and improvement of governance processes to ensure broader participation and that the system remains secure.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Led Growth &amp; Sustainability:</strong> We will promote and support all initiatives that enable the growth, adoption, scalability and innovation for Uniswap ecosystem. Our focus will be placed on ensuring that all growth initiatives are reliable, secure, and sustainable over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> We will always make sure that no DAO decisions will jeopardize the security of the protocol and thus harm users.</li>\n<li><strong>Ethos and Support</strong>: We will actively contribute to the governance of the protocol and its ecosystem worldwide, looking forward to working with other interested delegates to promote the Uniswap mission and encourage others to actively participate in DAO governance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"why-uniswap-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#why-uniswap-5\"></a>Why Uniswap?</h2>\n<p>Uniswap’s success, achieved independently of the core development team since its deployment, demonstrates the significant demand for permissionless financial services. From our perspective, some strengths make this protocol a special case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Uniswap is consistently at the forefront of pioneering innovations in DeFi infrastructure technology. Its open and permissionless architecture fosters innovation by enabling anyone to create and encourages experimentation and the creation of novel financial instruments, driving the growth and diversity of the DeFi ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: The Uniswap ecosystem has outpaced others in driving widespread adoption. Its accessibility reduces barriers to entry, democratizing decentralized finance for users globally.</li>\n<li><strong>Capital efficiency:</strong> Uniswap typically outperforms other AMMs in terms of capital efficiency due to its concentrated liquidity model (V3). The efficient use of capital allows to handle larger trades with less price impact, making it very competitive and attractive among other AMMs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"our-case-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#our-case-6\"></a>Our case</h1>\n<p>We see Uniswap as an infrastructure layer set to drive innovation throughout the entire ecosystem. Being part of this space will enable us to continue understanding, building, and participating in the following verticals (among others):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Extensive Composability</strong>: Uniswap’s vast integration with hundreds of interfaces and applications ensures a smooth interaction within the DeFi ecosystem. Is our intention to actively participate in decisions that enhance and expand these integrations, further solidifying Uniswap’s position as a critical infrastructure layer in DeFi by contributing ideas for improvements and applications, whether for hooks (V4) or any other innovation/technology from Uniswap or external ones that we can implement into the protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance</strong>: Uniswap’s governance framework is designed to be as constrained as possible, focusing only on essential areas to maintain neutrality and trust minimization. Despite a large community, only a small fraction actively participates in governance, potentially limiting smaller stakeholders voices. Maintaining good participation rates, active discussions, and healthy governance with genuine engagement is crucial for a DAO’s effectiveness. We believe Uniswap can address these challenges by empowering community involvement, overcoming voter apathy, onboarding new participants, and streamlining governance frameworks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"disclosure-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#disclosure-7\"></a>Disclosure:</h2>\n<p>SEEDGov is a broad organization with a high participation in some of the most prominent governances in the ecosystem such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Starknet, Connext and we also constitute Sovereign Finance AVC in MakerDAO. As mentioned above we come to Uniswap Governance to bring value, in case there is any conflict of interest, we will communicate it to the community members.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/5/5212e4690ab95897579a9a6a4ccdd194b228aa7d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bI3CZPvuwlvLieuQfHU99E3o4y1.png?dl=1\" title=\"Captura de pantalla 2024-05-22 103046\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/5212e4690ab95897579a9a6a4ccdd194b228aa7d_2_690x266.png\" alt=\"Captura de pantalla 2024-05-22 103046\" data-base62-sha1=\"bI3CZPvuwlvLieuQfHU99E3o4y1\" width=\"690\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/5212e4690ab95897579a9a6a4ccdd194b228aa7d_2_690x266.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/5/5212e4690ab95897579a9a6a4ccdd194b228aa7d.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/5/5212e4690ab95897579a9a6a4ccdd194b228aa7d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"272427\"></a></div><p></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/seedgov-delegate-platform/23987\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/seedgov-delegate-platform/23987","pubDate":"Wed, 22 May 2024 13:36:38 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-23987"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/seedgov-delegate-platform/23987.rss","#text":"SEEDGov Delegate Platform"}},{"title":"Arana Digital Delegate Platform","dc:creator":"AranaDigital","category":"Delegation Pitch","description":"<h2><a name=\"arana-digital-delegate-platform-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#arana-digital-delegate-platform-1\"></a>Arana Digital Delegate Platform</h2>\n<p>Delegate address: 0x0579A616689f7ed748dC07692A3F150D44b0CA09</p>\n<p>Delegate ENS Address: aranadigital.eth</p>\n<p>Forum Username: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/aranadigital\">@AranaDigital</a> &amp; <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/abdullahumar\">@AbdullahUmar</a></p>\n<p>Twitter: <span class=\"mention\">@aranaventures</span></p>\n<p>Voting Activity: <a href=\"https://boardroom.io/voter/0x0579A616689f7ed748dC07692A3F150D44b0CA09\">Boardroom</a></p>\n<p>Historical Discussion Activity: <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/abdullahumar/activity\">https://gov.uniswap.org/u/abdullahumar/activity</a></p>\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:arana.governance@gmail.com\">arana.governance@gmail.com</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"about-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#about-2\"></a>About</h2>\n<p>We are a governance group composed of ex-Michigan Blockchain members.

decade of building trust from our network. Our team has lived through Mt. Gox, the launch of Ethereum, the first DAO, the rise and fall of ICOs, DeFi Summer, the NFT craze, and more. We have seen blockchain projects start, raise, and die, so we know what it takes to succeed and how to listen to the community and the market to build a robust product. Uniswap is evolving, and the DAO needs to guide it intelligently as the space continues to grow.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"team-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#team-5\"></a>Team</h3>\n<p>Tony Gomes is the President of the Blockchain Education Network (BEN). He graduated in 2020 from the Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida. As an immigrant, Tony was driven by the pursuit of alternative financial inclusion solutions, leading him to a conference in 2015 where Ethereum was first introduced by Vitalik Buterin. This pivotal moment launched his career in digital assets.</p>\n<p>Tony has held significant roles at Oracle Inc. and various venture capital firms, enhancing his expertise in strategic business alignment and operational execution. As the Capital Markets Architect at GDA.Capital, which has facilitated over $70M+ in private placements and managed over $100M+ in digital asset financings, underscoring his significant influence and deep expertise in the digital asset sector.</p>\n<p>Erick Pinos is the Ecosystem Lead at Nibiru (<a href=\"https://nibiru.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://nibiru.fi</a>), where he has deep experience in coordinating and aligning incentives across ecosystem projects and DAOs. Nibiru recently raised $6m through a Coinlist sale and launched the $NIBI token on four simultaneous exchanges reaching a $1b+ FDV. He is an angel investor in several industries outside of crypto, including biotech and sustainability. Previously he was the Americas Ecosystem Lead at Ontology Network, where he helped with the launch of Wing Finance, setting up the Wing DAO, various proposals to improve WING’s tokenomics, driving $350m in TVL to the platform, and more. Erick has a BS in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he was the President of the MIT Bitcoin Club and a researcher at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"reasons-we-are-a-delegate-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#reasons-we-are-a-delegate-6\"></a>Reasons we are a delegate</h3>\n<p>As a Uniswap delegate, we are committed to ensuring that a diverse range of voices are heard and represented in the governance process. Through our work with a16z in 2021 we brought representation to student voices across the board via a plethora of student club delegates, with an added focus on international student participation in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erickpinos/status/1404617833078722562\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">regions like Turkey</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the founders of the Uniswap Foundation, Ken Ng, is a BEN alum and former director, which encouraged us to take on an early role in Uniswap governance. Additionally, we maintain a close relationship with Devin Walsh and Erin Koen, continuously gathering feedback on how we can grow. By continuing as a Uniswap delegate, we aim to amplify diverse voices, advance educational initiatives, and uphold our mission to empower the next generation of blockchain innovators.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-do-you-want-to-see-happen-in-uniswap-governance-over-the-next-year-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#what-do-you-want-to-see-happen-in-uniswap-governance-over-the-next-year-7\"></a>What do you want to see happen in Uniswap governance over the next year?</h3>\n<p>We want to see more governance participation from qualified diverse voices, guiding the DAO to create real and tangible impact for the adoption of Uniswap. By encouraging a broader spectrum of qualified participants to engage in governance, we aim to bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas that can drive the platform’s growth and adoption. We believe that active and varied participation is crucial for the DAO’s success, as it fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among all stakeholders.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/blockchain-education-network-ben-delegation-platform/23966\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/blockchain-education-network-ben-delegation-platform/23966","pubDate":"Mon, 20 May 2024 04:58:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-23966"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/blockchain-education-network-ben-delegation-platform/23966.rss","#text":"Blockchain Education Network (BEN) Delegation Platform"}},{"title":"April ‘24 Uniswap Report","dc:creator":"Oku","category":"Uncategorized","description":"<p>Hello Uniswap Community,</p>\n<p>We published our most recent issue of the Uniswap Monthly Report, summarizing protocol metrics for April 2024.</p>\n<p>You can find our latest report at <a href=\"https://www.newsletter.oku.trade/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">newsletter.oku.trade </a> and subscribe for future monthly releases.</p>\n<p>Here’s the executive summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In April 2024, the Uniswap Protocol processed $77.48  billion in monthly volume (-14%) across $6.26  billion in liquidity (-11.9%), earning market makers $125.29  million in fees (-21.3%).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Across all chains, Ethereum saw the most Uniswap volume with $42.3 billion in v3 pools, seconded by Arbitrum.
