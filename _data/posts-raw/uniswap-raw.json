We offer our members educational and professional development, in addition to project-based opportunities. Over the past six years, Michigan Blockchain has partnered with over 20 organizations and has governed a combined $30M in delegations. All new members go through a semester-long cohort that teaches them about the fundamentals of blockchain and provides them exposure to a diversity of blockchain applications. Our educational program prepares members for organizational involvement through three main avenues: governance, consulting, and investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Governance Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Our team has actively participated in governance voting and spearheaded proposal development for 5 primary protocols: Uniswap, Arbitrum, Compound, Origin Protocol, and Stader Labs. Each protocol is assigned a designated expert, responsible for continuous monitoring of the protocol’s developments on forums, social media, and voting platforms (Snapshot and Tally).</p>\n<p>At committee meetings, protocol leads share updates with the entire governance team on active proposals and debate the pros/cons to reach a collective decision on how to vote with our delegated tokens. We have a high participation rate, having reviewed and kept up our voting record for each delegated protocol. Additionally, our team has successfully led the establishment of proposals from start to finish. Prior to publicization, we collaborate with numerous stakeholders including investors, DAO service providers, and other protocols to draft proposals properly.</p>\n<p>By delegating to our organization, you permit your tokens to be effectively and actively used for furthering innovation on the leading decentralized exchange. We aim to have the Uniswap DAO serve as a role model for decentralized community participation and further solidify its position in the DeFi landscape.</p>\n<p>Historically, we have interacted on Uniswap forums under individuals’ names, but going forward it will be under the Michigan Blockchain name.</p>\n<p><strong>Values</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fostering an inclusive community that encourages diversity, education, and open-minded discussions to produce the best ideas</li>\n<li>Ensuring sustainability through the long-term success of the protocol, along with governance token value accrual for the benefit of the DAO without negatively impacting dapp users</li>\n<li>Promoting open communication and visibility to build trust while prioritizing flexibility to swiftly address issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Possible Conflicts of Interest</strong></p>\n<p>We are active governance contributors to ARB, COMP, OGN, and SD.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/michigan-blockchain-delegate-platform/24198\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/michigan-blockchain-delegate-platform/24198","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:31:23 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24198"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/michigan-blockchain-delegate-platform/24198.rss","#text":"Michigan Blockchain Delegate Platform"}},{"title":"GFX Labs - Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"GFXlabs","category":"Uncategorized","description":"<p><em>This thread is intended to provide a record of GFX Labs’ voting and communication around the reasoning of each vote.

Mantle is DAO-governed and employs a modular approach to execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability. Mantle Network Mainnet Alpha v1 was launched on July 17, 2023. Mantle Network Mainnet v2 Tectonic was launched on March 15, 2024.</p>\n<p>Mantle Network distinguishes itself through a <a href=\"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/overview#modular-architecture\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">modular chain design</a> by separating transaction, execution, consensus, settlement, and storage into different modules. In Mantle Network’s architecture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The execution layer is EVM-compatible and responsible for transaction execution. A sequencer produces L2 blocks and sends state root data to layer 1 (L1).</li>\n<li>Consensus and settlement are conducted on Ethereum’s L1.</li>\n<li>Data availability is ensured through Mantle DA, leveraging EigenDA technology to store callback data, which in conventional rollups would be published directly to L1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This modular approach allows for greater flexibility and optimization across different functionalities of the network.</p>\n<p>Mantle Ecosystem comprises of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/concepts/optimistic-rollups#what-are-optimistic-rollups\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Network</a> - A modular Ethereum L2.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Governance</a> - A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.mantle.xyz/governance/parameters/treasury#treasury-holdings-core\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Treasury</a> - One of the largest on-chain treasuries in the industry.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mantle.xyz/meth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle LSP</a> - A permissionless, non-custodial ETH liquid staking protocol deployed on Ethereum L1 and governed by Mantle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mantle Network is governed by Mantle token (MNT), which serves as the central element in Mantle Ecosystem, fulfilling multiple roles including being the native gas token for transaction fees and fueling ecosystem growth. It’s also the governance token that empowers the community to make decisions about the ecosystem’s future directions.</p>\n<p>In an effort to spur innovation and development, Mantle also has financial initiatives like Mantle Grants Program and Mantle EcoFund, the latter boasting a sizable $200 million catalyzed capital pool, more on this below. All future products under the Mantle banner will be community-driven and initiated through voting by Mantle (MNT) token holders.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"network-architecture-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#network-architecture-4\"></a>Network Architecture</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/d26556ae4d1a4d75382439c44fe06ed22ece2e25.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/u1fnUM055Ng8DwewZa7nlu4jcON.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d26556ae4d1a4d75382439c44fe06ed22ece2e25_2_624x365.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"u1fnUM055Ng8DwewZa7nlu4jcON\" width=\"624\" height=\"365\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d26556ae4d1a4d75382439c44fe06ed22ece2e25_2_624x365.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d26556ae4d1a4d75382439c44fe06ed22ece2e25_2_936x547.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/d26556ae4d1a4d75382439c44fe06ed22ece2e25.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EFF1ED\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Source: <a href=\"https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/intro/system-components/architecture\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Docs</a></em><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"benefits-to-uniswap-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#benefits-to-uniswap-5\"></a>Benefits to Uniswap</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"mantle-network-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#mantle-network-6\"></a>Mantle Network</h3>\n<p>Since its launch, Mantle has seen more than <a href=\"https://explorer.mantle.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">104 million transactions and over 5.3 million unique addresses</a> transact on the network.

Our objective is to support emerging Ethereum Layer-2 networks and reinforce deployments where Uniswap is not the dominant player — specifically on Linea and Scroll — by deploying a user-friendly front-end and building strategic business relationships to drive liquidity and adoption.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"context-and-opportunity-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#context-and-opportunity-1\"></a>Context and Opportunity</h2>\n<p>DapDap serves as the ultimate gateway to Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, simplifying Web3 navigation for over 130,000 users since its launch in February, 2024. With a guiding mission to democratize DeFi access, the platform offers a one-stop portal to 200+ dApps across 17+ Ethereum Layer-2 networks.</p>\n<p>With a proven success in onboarding a significant amount of volume and transactions, DapDap continues to collaborate with industry-leading Ethereum solutions on a regular basis, such as: Base, Blast, Linea, Manta, Scroll, and more.

However, besides oku, there is a lack of local Layer-2 market focus and initiatives that lead to user conversion and market penetration. Out of the 17 major EVM &amp; Ethereum networks, the Uniswap contract accounts for less than 1% of the total total value locked (TVL) in 6 of them.</p>\n<p>Possible factors hindering Uniswap’s local market penetration include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited Reach - lack of an official Uniswap front-end support on many emerging Ethereum Layer-2 networks.</li>\n<li>Competitive Positioning - native DEXs have an inherent advantage in building local engagement by incentivising liquidity for native tokens.</li>\n<li>Absence of the canonical Uniswap-themed Interface - absence of a simple and familiar Uniswap front-end across some Layer-2s, creates for significant barriers to onboarding retail users</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"dapdap-proposal-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#dapdap-proposal-3\"></a>DapDap Proposal</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><a name=\"unique-value-proposition-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#unique-value-proposition-4\"></a>Unique Value Proposition</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"existing-user-base-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#existing-user-base-5\"></a>Existing User Base:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>DapDap is a platform with +130,000 retail users, averaging +10,000 daily visits and 2,000+ daily users completing on-chain transactions</li>\n<li>Direct accessibility to 200+ applications across 17 chains, giving us the ability to easily direct users to DapDap’s Uniswap frontend with a superior UX</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"front-end-composability-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#front-end-composability-6\"></a>Front-end Composability:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>DapDap’s main value lies in its frontend composability, giving access to Uniswap, LP vaults (e.g, Gamma), lending (e.g., Layerbank), and bridging (e.g., Across) within a single UI</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Simple user journey centred around Uniswap as a DEX</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Competitive UX compared to other local DEXs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"business-development-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#business-development-7\"></a>Business Development:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Existing relationships with 200+ integrated DeFi applications across 17 chains</li>\n<li>Natural fit to build business relationships for Uniswap with local complementary DeFi services like lending, bridges, vaults, etc.</li>\n<li>Ability to integrate external DeFi features into our Uniswap-focused interface, run marketing campaigns, and direct user attention towards Uniswap instead of local DEXs</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3><a name=\"development-and-deployment-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#development-and-deployment-8\"></a>Development and Deployment</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Allocation of 5k $UNI for DapDap team efforts per network:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>3k $UNI for initial development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UI/UX design (1 week)</li>\n<li>Front-end Development (4 weeks):</li>\n<li>Swap, Account component, Liquidity management</li>\n<li>Slippage settings, Local token whitelisting function, Smart-routing</li>\n<li>Additional functionality (2 weeks):</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Block explorer support, i18n, Transaction data page, Embedded bridge aggregator functionality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1k $UNI for maintenance (server and dev costs) for one year</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1k $UNI for continued integration of new DeFi services</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total cost per Network: 5k $UNI</p>\n<p>Selected Initial Networks to Deploy: Linea, Scroll</p>\n<p>Total Cost for 2 Networks: 10k $UNI</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3><a name=\"user-and-business-engagement-strategies-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#user-and-business-engagement-strategies-9\"></a>User and Business Engagement Strategies</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Allocation of 5k $UNI for Business Development &amp;

In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.</p>\n<p>Since Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This proposal requests a retroactive Onboarding Package for Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>While already deployed on Gnosis Chain, Uniswap is not currently capitalizing on it. This proposal aims to change that.</p>\n<p>One of the key areas of focus suggested by the Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee to expand the Uniswap ecosystem is “Uniswap Revitalization and Growth”. In their recent work, a large emphasis is on revisiting some of the old deployments and proactively capturing first-mover advantage on promising new chains.</p>\n<p>As Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth across Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we believe the chain aligns perfectly with the scope of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth initiative. Uniswap’s deployment on Gnosis Chain was completed in early 2022, hence Gnosis Chain was never a beneficiary of the “Onboarding Package” that is now included as a standard element of deployment proposals.</p>\n<p>We believe there are synergies between Uniswap and Gnosis Chain as well as a strong potential for Gnosis Chain to generate high volumes and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of its focus on payments and financial tools.</p>\n<p>As a comparison, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).</p>\n<p>We believe that additional visibility and an incentive program would enable both Uniswap and Gnosis Chain to tap into their synergies resulting in positive growth on both ends.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"about-gnosis-chain-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#about-gnosis-chain-3\"></a>About Gnosis Chain</h3>\n<p>Gnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. It features fast transaction times (5 seconds) and low transaction fees (500 tx for $0.01) with the unique advantage of having a stable token as a base asset for transactions and gas fees.</p>\n<p>One of the first Ethereum sidechains, Gnosis Chain’s core values are resilience and credible neutrality. By allowing contributors to easily run a node, Gnosis Chain created a community-owned, anti-fragile network secured by a geographically diverse validator set. Its strong culture of at-home stakers (not reliant on cloud providers or data centres) and its community governance ensure Gnosis Chain remains credibly neutral at a lower price point than Mainnet.</p>\n<p>Gnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralised financial tools accessible and usable for all. The collective features established blue chip projects like Safe as well as prominent ones like Gnosis Pay and Monerium.</p>\n<p>In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"benefits-to-uniswap-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#benefits-to-uniswap-4\"></a>Benefits to Uniswap</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Multichain Uniswap</a> approach has proven successful with approx. <a href=\"https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/uniswap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">35% of trading volumes</a> in the last 6 months come from non-Ethereum-Mainnet deployments.</p>\n<p>Since Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new and existing users leveraging Gnosis Chain as a payments infrastructure is a promising opportunity for the project to reach a new audience.</p>\n<p>Gnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects, building synergic services to Uniswap. Among those, Safe and Gnosis Pay. Safe Smart Accounts count 9.1 Million accounts deployed with $100B+ in total assets stored and VIP individuals (e.g. Vitalik) using them. Gnosis Pay is the world’s first on-chain spending account with a Visa Debit Card linked to a self-custodial blockchain wallet, connected with 80 Million merchants worldwide. Roll-out in Europe and the United Kingdom has already started, with upcoming new Countries including Brazil and Argentina. That is a combined population of approx. 1.45 Billion people.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Gnosis Chain powers a growing DeFi sector with numerous blue chip projects added since Q4 2023. These include Aave, whose market on Gnosis Chain has grown rapidly since its launch 7 months ago and is now larger than the lending protocol’s markets on Base and Scroll (as of May 2024). sDAI (MakerDAO’s interest-earning DAI) accumulated over $68 Million TVL since October 2023. Focusing on the on-chain trading vertical, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). This means, Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).</p>\n<p>Based on the above and observing Uniswap’s performance across blockchains, we anticipate the protocol will replicate its success in capturing market share on Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"bridges-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#bridges-5\"></a>Bridges</h3>\n<p>Gnosis Chain is committed to providing easy and secure access to Ethereum L1 and other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. For this reason, multiple bridging options are available to connect with Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/omnibridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Omnibridge</a> is a native token bridge that connects Ethereum and Gnosis Chain (and vice-versa) by minting the canonical representation of bridged assets on Gnosis. The Omnibridge is built on top of the <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/amb-bridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB)</a>, a key bridge primitive that is used inside higher-order bridges like the Omnibridge and allows Gnosis contracts to send data and trigger contract functions on Ethereum and vice-versa. Therefore, the Omnibridge relies on the same trust models and group of <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/management/validators#amb--omnibridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Trusted Bridge Validators</a> as the AMB. Part of these validators is Succinct Lab’s zkSNARK-enabled Light Client, Telepathy. Telepathy is a key component of the AMB bridge ecosystem as it enhances security and reliability for cross-chain transactions by providing validity proofs via zkSNARKs that ensure trustless verification of transaction events across chains.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/xdai-bridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">xDAI bridge</a> is a native DAI bridge from Ethereum that is used to mint and burn xDAI, the native asset used for gas and transaction fees on Gnosis.</p>\n<p>Gnosis has a long-term roadmap to move towards trustless bridges and is investing resources into trust-minimization of its bridges, to ensure trust and safety of users. <a href=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hashi</a> is an EVM Hash Oracle Aggregator designed to enhance cross-chain bridge security by aggregating block headers from various sources. It supports 15+ General Message Passing bridges and ZK light clients, promoting redundancy and reducing reliance on single mechanisms. By requiring validation from multiple independent mechanisms, Hashi ensures greater resilience against security incidents. Gnosis plans to <a href=\"https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-93-should-gnosisdao-support-the-integration-of-hashi-within-gnosis-chains-canonical-bridges/8245\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gradually migrate</a> its canonical bridges to Hashi’s distributed trust model with the goal of strengthening security, decentralisation and interoperability.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Gnosis Chain is supported within independent bridge solutions that enable the cross-chain connection with other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. These include Jumper (provided by <a href=\"http://Li.Fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Li.Fi</a>), Bungee, Hop, Connext, DLN (debridge), LayerZero, Chainlink CCIP and Wormhole.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cost-and-timeline-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#cost-and-timeline-6\"></a>Cost and Timeline</h3>\n<p>This proposal requests a retroactive Onboarding Package for Gnosis Chain as well as costs for Merkl and Oku integrations.

We are mindful that these are opinions from accepted grantees and naturally are inclined toward more positive experiences with the UAGP. However, we still believe its worthwhile to run this exercise to test ourselves for any apparent gaps. This assumption was stress-tested by the fact no individual response rated the likelihood to recommend the UAGP to peers lower than a 9.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"uagp-learnings-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#uagp-learnings-2\"></a>UAGP Learnings</h3>\n<p>Over the past five months, operating the UAGP has taught us several valuable lessons about managing a cross-ecosystem grant program, and we wanted to take a moment to highlight some of the more relevant learnings we’ve collected from our recent operations lately. A summary first, then addressing each learning in more detail below:</p>\n<p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reporting Alignment: We adjusted our reporting processes from monthly to bimonthly to better align with the long-term focus of UAGP grants, reducing burnout and creating a more streamlined reporting flow.</li>\n<li>Cross Ecosystem Collaboration: We initiated a Grant Program alignment group to streamline cross-ecosystem collaboration and communication, addressing eligibility and overlap issues between Uniswap and Arbitrum grant programs.</li>\n<li>Prospective Applicant Perspectives: Discussions with rejected applicants highlighted the need for specific evaluation feedback, a clearer assessment rubric, and more streamlined application forms; all concerns we feel confident we have addressed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One major insight was the opportunity to adapt our reporting processes to better align with the nature of our grants (and grantees!). Given the long-term focus of UAGP grants, and the associated longer feedback loops between project initiation and milestone achievement, we pushed reporting and tracking tasks from monthly to bimonthly. In practice, this reporting change allows grantees to focus on their work and report only the most salient details in a period, reducing the risk of burnout for both grantees and community members involved in monthly reporting. This adjustment has been the latest adjustment in what we believe to now be a very streamlined reporting flow for grantees and the DAOs.</p>\n<p>Another insight came about when awareness for the UAGP picked began to pick up: we faced increasing overlaps with applications relevant to other parts of the Uniswap or Arbitrum ecosystem. This resulted in a manual process of having multiple bilateral Telegram chats with the other relevant Grant Programs / Foundations on the Uniswap and Arbitrum side sending applicants to different parts of the ecosystem and checking potential eligibility. While in the Uniswap ecosystem the ways are short and we have one specific counterparty for Grants (Aaron), on the Arbitrum side there are several relevant Grant programs. This led us to initiate an overarching Grant Program alignment group and helped steer initiatives to streamline this process through joint communication channels, incl. tackling topics such as potential double-dipping.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have also had several open topics and learnings emerge from the vibrant UAGP community discussions which play out across many forums and include all stakeholders, from delegates to rejected &amp; prospective UAGP applicants.  In particular, in community discussions with rejected UAGP applicants who raised concerns about perceived incongruities in the program, we were given deeper insight into the applicant perspective and journey through the UAGP. While at times it is important to take these opinions with a grain of salt, we hear all opinions with the utmost respect and consideration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Provide specific feedback to every applicant:</strong> While we would love to provide personalized feedback to every applicant, it is difficult due to the sheer volume of applications. Currently, we offer detailed feedback to applicants who specifically request it. If the DAO decides that every applicant should receive detailed denial feedback, we are happy to factor this into capacity planning for a potential extension of the program.</li>\n<li><strong>Make evaluation of all grantees public:</strong> While we have public evaluation rubrics to promote transparency on how our committee is assessing projects, in line with other leading grant programs within web3 including Arbitrum Foundation Grants and Plurality Labs, we do not make specific evaluation of grantees public. We decided to follow this market standard due to mitigate potential negative follow-on effects on denied applicants that could results out of a bad rating.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce number of application questions:</strong> In response to feedback about the program’s application questions being difficult to align with projects, we have simplified them in our recent extension round update to make it streamline this process for applicants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We deeply appreciate the community’s ongoing support and feedback, which help us strengthen the UAGP. We welcome all community feedback as we strive to build the best possible program.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We hope this mid-term survey and learnings help shine transparency on the current operation of the program. Our DMs are always open for thoughts or comments on what other data points to include going forward. We’re thrilled with the progress so far and are excited to continue extended operations for a few more months. Please stay tuned for next month’s full reporting as more downstream milestones (and launches!) are beginning to be achieved.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"contact-points-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#contact-points-3\"></a>Contact Points</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/white_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":white_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> To find all info: <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/1c1e8b33bc60436993dd65e37d022f9d?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UAGP Information Hub</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/white_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":white_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> To reach out: <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/597638925346930701/1165739066365579314\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Discord</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/white_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":white_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> To stay up to date: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniArbGrants\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a></p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-midway-learnings-survey/24110\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-midway-learnings-survey/24110","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 08:16:00 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24110"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-midway-learnings-survey/24110.rss","#text":"Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) - Midway Learnings & Survey"}},{"title":"Diversity for Working Groups","dc:creator":"drllau_LexDAO","category":"Governance-Meta","description":"<p>My observation is that working groups tend to be the <a href=\"https://communityrule.info/templates/self-appointed-board.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">self-appointed board</a> followed by co-opting (election/ratification) of “inner” circle.

Here are the next steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Delegate Reward for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WXf8Z2AnLIyKGNKYjKKsfb-c-d1hmCLAX-5rYAbiHDk/edit#gid=1513921069\">12 Delegates</a> will be available starting June 2024. The basic requirement is of following:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>-Maintain 80% onchain and offchain voting participation for the past 3 months. Achieving this will provide $3,000 USD worth of $UNI</p>\n<p>The snapshot date for the past 3 months for June will be taken at July 1st 9pm CET. Only proposals that have been completed would be counted (so if there’s a voting that for example go for June 30 to July 4th, as the voting is still ongoing as of July 1st, it won’t count as part of voting participation)</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>There’s also additional reward (only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled):</li>\n</ol>\n<p>-Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile. Achieving this will provide an additional $3,000 USD worth of $UNI</p>\n<p>While there are some discussions around when writing the rationale would be the most effective (for example, some would argue while the voting is still happening while some say within a week or two after the voting), for this month, we believe having it available till July 3rd 9pm CET for votings that have finished in June seems reasonable so that even if it ended on the last day of June, a delegate has time to write up the rationale. For easier tracking as well as for transparency with the community, please create a delegate profile and share the updates and rationales there as is a standard across different DAOs. Of course, sharing via other ways such as snapshot or tally is possible but it won’t count as fulfilling this requirement for this month.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Accountability Committee will help to keep track of these and share the status and qualification by July 8th. The delegates and the community will have till July 12 to challenge the result (for example, a delegate voted on a certain proposal but Accountability Committee mistakenly marked it down as not voted and thus challenged). If all is good or corrected, the first payments can be sent by the Accountability Committee on the week of July 15th. We are sure as the process becomes more streamlined, the payments can be sent earlier as time goes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Regarding Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group will be given the template to fill the hours for the retro payment (the max hours will be 40 hours). Please fill them by June 7th 9pm CET. Some members might take longer but please fill them by June 10th 9pm CET by the latest. Then the Accountability Committee will proceed with sending the payments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The current Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group will be dissolved. We welcome formations of new groups / ideas for the upcoming Cycle 2</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/next-steps-for-uniswap-delegate-reward/24070\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/next-steps-for-uniswap-delegate-reward/24070","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Jun 2024 09:22:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24070"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/next-steps-for-uniswap-delegate-reward/24070.rss","#text":"Next Steps for Uniswap Delegate Reward"}},{"title":"Arbitrum LTIPP Incentive Matching","dc:creator":"AbdullahUmar","category":"Temperature Check","description":"<p><strong>Authors:</strong> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/abdullahumar\">@AbdullahUmar</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/juanbug\">@Juanbug</a> (<a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-delegate-program-uadp-communication-thread/22185\">Uniswap Arbitrum Delegate Program (UADP)</a>)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#tldr-1\"></a>TLDR:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In April, the UADP submitted an application to participate in the Arbitrum LTIPP (long term incentive program pilot)</li>\n<li>We were able to receive 1,000,000 of ARB, the largest amount out of all other DEX applicants</li>\n<li>In our application, we stated that\n<ul>\n<li>“the UADP will request the Uni DAO to decide whether or not it wants to partially match this 1.0M ARB ask. The options the DAO has to vote on are four: $250k, $500k, $750k, and $1M. We cannot guarantee that the DAO will vote to match incentives, but we will make a best-effort attempt and report the results of the temperature check”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We will be collaborating with Gauntlet and Merkl to distribute the incentives (cost breakdowns are below)</li>\n<li>To those ends, we are running this temperature check to see if the DAO is interested in matching the given LTIPP grant to some capacity</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"about-the-ltipp-application-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#about-the-ltipp-application-2\"></a>About the LTIPP Application</h2>\n<p>Uniswap did not apply to the first two rounds of Arbitrum incentives (STIP 1 &amp; 2). This was for two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Native DEXs and smaller protocols deserve a chance to make a name for themselves and perhaps offer unique protocols for trading</li>\n<li>We did not have a formal structure like the UADP to help facilitate an application</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since many native DEXs–and non-native ones–have already had the chance to apply for ARB incentives throughout the past year across multiple incentive distribution initiatives, the UADP decided that it’s now the right time for Uniswap to also partake in these programs, especially since other blue-chip protocols also applied for these incentives. Plus, the establishment of this committee has allowed Uniswap DAO to further mature its relationship with Arbitrum DAO. We’ve partaken in multiple discourses, participating in all of the votes taking place on Arbitrum since November 2023 (see <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/uniswap-arbitrum-delegate-program-uadp-communication-thread/19225\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Communication Thread here</a>).</p>\n<p>The LTIPP pilot program is a 3-month long incentive program, with 45M worth of ARB to be distributed among an elected group of protocols. A total of 174 applications were vetted by the LTIPP Advisors, with whom we interacted and obtained feedback during the month of March. One of the primary sticking points was the amount of capital that we initially requested, along with clarifications around some of the target KPIs behind our request.</p>\n<p>After some deliberation, in line with many other projects, we ended up lowering our ARB ask from 2.5M to 1M, which increased our chances of being admitted into the program by the Advisors and ARB delegates. Uniswap was able to attain the largest amount of incentives from the cohort of DEX applicants:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/5/5bd9be3a9591312893ded5cce5f93e225c3d8b6c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/d6xXEJTeDAFgTvALVLRPLhRfTaI.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-06-03 at 8.23.06 AM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/5bd9be3a9591312893ded5cce5f93e225c3d8b6c_2_690x155.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-06-03 at 8.23.06 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"d6xXEJTeDAFgTvALVLRPLhRfTaI\" width=\"690\" height=\"155\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/5bd9be3a9591312893ded5cce5f93e225c3d8b6c_2_690x155.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/5bd9be3a9591312893ded5cce5f93e225c3d8b6c_2_1035x232.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/5bd9be3a9591312893ded5cce5f93e225c3d8b6c_2_1380x310.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D8D6C8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"uniswap-ltipp-grant-structure-and-execution-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#uniswap-ltipp-grant-structure-and-execution-3\"></a>Uniswap LTIPP Grant Structure and Execution</h2>\n<p>Below is a breakdown of how the LTIPP funds will be used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>900k ARB for incentives:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>882k ARB:</strong> The bulk of these funds will be used to incentivize liquidity providers on Uniswap using Gauntlet’s dynamic optimization engine.</li>\n<li><strong>18k ARB:</strong> For Merkl to distribute the funds.

Regular discussions occur prior to deciding our next steps and opinions about governance topics that arise, all through this profile.</p>\n<p>Our delegation will do its utmost to represent and embody our values to enhance Uniswap governance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Uniswap is one of the most decentralized DeFi protocols and all of our initiatives and proposals will align with this same principle. Along with this position, and as the ecosystem continues to mature and be driven by its community, we will collaborate in the creation, iteration, and improvement of governance processes to ensure broader participation and that the system remains secure.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Led Growth &amp; Sustainability:</strong> We will promote and support all initiatives that enable the growth, adoption, scalability and innovation for Uniswap ecosystem. Our focus will be placed on ensuring that all growth initiatives are reliable, secure, and sustainable over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> We will always make sure that no DAO decisions will jeopardize the security of the protocol and thus harm users.</li>\n<li><strong>Ethos and Support</strong>: We will actively contribute to the governance of the protocol and its ecosystem worldwide, looking forward to working with other interested delegates to promote the Uniswap mission and encourage others to actively participate in DAO governance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"why-uniswap-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#why-uniswap-5\"></a>Why Uniswap?</h2>\n<p>Uniswap’s success, achieved independently of the core development team since its deployment, demonstrates the significant demand for permissionless financial services. From our perspective, some strengths make this protocol a special case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Uniswap is consistently at the forefront of pioneering innovations in DeFi infrastructure technology. Its open and permissionless architecture fosters innovation by enabling anyone to create and encourages experimentation and the creation of novel financial instruments, driving the growth and diversity of the DeFi ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: The Uniswap ecosystem has outpaced others in driving widespread adoption. Its accessibility reduces barriers to entry, democratizing decentralized finance for users globally.</li>\n<li><strong>Capital efficiency:</strong> Uniswap typically outperforms other AMMs in terms of capital efficiency due to its concentrated liquidity model (V3). The efficient use of capital allows to handle larger trades with less price impact, making it very competitive and attractive among other AMMs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"our-case-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#our-case-6\"></a>Our case</h1>\n<p>We see Uniswap as an infrastructure layer set to drive innovation throughout the entire ecosystem. Being part of this space will enable us to continue understanding, building, and participating in the following verticals (among others):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Extensive Composability</strong>: Uniswap’s vast integration with hundreds of interfaces and applications ensures a smooth interaction within the DeFi ecosystem. Is our intention to actively participate in decisions that enhance and expand these integrations, further solidifying Uniswap’s position as a critical infrastructure layer in DeFi by contributing ideas for improvements and applications, whether for hooks (V4) or any other innovation/technology from Uniswap or external ones that we can implement into the protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance</strong>: Uniswap’s governance framework is designed to be as constrained as possible, focusing only on essential areas to maintain neutrality and trust minimization. Despite a large community, only a small fraction actively participates in governance, potentially limiting smaller stakeholders voices. Maintaining good participation rates, active discussions, and healthy governance with genuine engagement is crucial for a DAO’s effectiveness. We believe Uniswap can address these challenges by empowering community involvement, overcoming voter apathy, onboarding new participants, and streamlining governance frameworks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"disclosure-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#disclosure-7\"></a>Disclosure:</h2>\n<p>SEEDGov is a broad organization with a high participation in some of the most prominent governances in the ecosystem such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Starknet, Connext and we also constitute Sovereign Finance AVC in MakerDAO.

Through our work with a16z in 2021 we brought representation to student voices across the board via a plethora of student club delegates, with an added focus on international student participation in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erickpinos/status/1404617833078722562\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">regions like Turkey</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the founders of the Uniswap Foundation, Ken Ng, is a BEN alum and former director, which encouraged us to take on an early role in Uniswap governance. Additionally, we maintain a close relationship with Devin Walsh and Erin Koen, continuously gathering feedback on how we can grow. By continuing as a Uniswap delegate, we aim to amplify diverse voices, advance educational initiatives, and uphold our mission to empower the next generation of blockchain innovators.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-do-you-want-to-see-happen-in-uniswap-governance-over-the-next-year-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#what-do-you-want-to-see-happen-in-uniswap-governance-over-the-next-year-7\"></a>What do you want to see happen in Uniswap governance over the next year?</h3>\n<p>We want to see more governance participation from qualified diverse voices, guiding the DAO to create real and tangible impact for the adoption of Uniswap.

After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702\">https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702</a></p>\n<p>The details of the findings were slightly different. However, this conclusion summarized the findings quite nicely:</p>\n<p>“There was a general consensus across most categories that a compensation program for delegates could improve participation quality and dedication. However, the enthusiasm varied, with those deeply involved in governance showing the strongest support.”</p>\n<p>The Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group explored several frameworks for implementing rewards, including a Committee structure that allows several non-delegates to get rewarded for helping to contribute to various scopes. However, some non-delegates in the Working Group preferred the Delegate-only model while other non-delegates in the Group suggested other alternatives.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we believe that the delegate-focused structure can be launched, but other members can also propose structures that focus on different aspects, ultimately leaving the decision up to governance.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Application Eligibility</strong></p>\n<p>There will be a week-long period for delegate candidates to submit their applications.

We are looking for feedback on the proposal below to contribute to their defense fund.</p>\n<p>We believe that Roman and Alexey’s cases are existential for the crypto industry and will set important precedent for protocols, developers, and users worldwide. They are facing significant legal costs on a monthly basis and are running out of resources to defend themselves. We hope that the Uniswap community will consider helping Roman &amp; Alexey defend our rights to privacy and to publish open-source code.</p>\n<p>Note: we are aware that <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/millerdef\">@millerDEF</a> from DeFi Education Fund has already <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-supporting-the-defi-education-fund/23631\">proposed</a> funding for their legal advocacy work including recent amicus briefs filed in support of <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_aff0399d95324a94af6b5f6cd3e31b91.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coin Centre v.

However, Roman and Alexey are <strong>running out of funds to defend themselves and need direct material support</strong>. For example, invoices for the month of April 2024 alone were over $350k USD. While we are very grateful to the DEF for their important advocacy work, we do not have enough funds to make it through Roman’s upcoming trial in September as well as potential appeals in Alexey’s case (depending on the trial outcome in May). These men are ordinary developers with families and children that love them, and they need our help to win this costly legal battle.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"context-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#context-2\"></a>Context</h3>\n<p>Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm, two developers who contributed to Tornado Cash, were arrested in different jurisdictions following OFAC’s sanctions in 2022. Their 2024 trials are setting important precedents for developers, privacy protocols, and the crypto industry more broadly. Alexey’s first trial took place on March 26 of this year (with verdict and further potential legal action scheduled for mid-May), and Roman’s trial is scheduled for late September.</p>\n<p>The government’s attempt to criminalize Roman and Alexey for a third party’s misuse of open-source software is unjust and unlawful. But while <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/286828/three-crypto-advocacy-groups-file-amicus-briefs-in-tornado-cash-developer-roman-storms-case\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">legal advocates are spending enormous effort and money</a> to defend Storm and Pertsev, the developers are faced with two governments using all of their resources to prosecute them and treat them like terrorists.</p>\n<p>Roman and Alexey need your help to build a strong legal defense not just for their sake, but for crypto users and developers worldwide. Justice DAO is advocating on their behalf and helping to raise funds for their legal defense. However, time and money are running out and we need support from influential protocols and organizations within the Ethereum ecosystem. This donation will not only help to fund ongoing legal defense work but also send a message of solidarity to Roman and Alexey while they fight against government overreach and abuse of power.</p>\n<p><strong>View Roman Storm’s statement here:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://x.com/rstormsf/status/1749490246000238942\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://x.com/rstormsf/status/1749490246000238942</a></p>\n<p><strong>Alexey and Roman’s legal defense fund on Juicebox:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://juicebox.money/@free-pertsev-and-storm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://juicebox.money/@free-pertsev-and-storm</a></p>\n<p><strong>Complete breakdown of associated funding and costs:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P69NhyLshI6kwfo7KqaA_rNUV5vpRw9JTJOfFAsdqAk/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P69NhyLshI6kwfo7KqaA_rNUV5vpRw9JTJOfFAsdqAk/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"addressing-legal-concerns-and-reasons-to-donate-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#addressing-legal-concerns-and-reasons-to-donate-3\"></a>Addressing Legal Concerns and Reasons to Donate</h3>\n<p><strong>A. Hundreds of donors have already stepped up to defend open-source code</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Since 2022, over 800 donations totaling ~750 ETH have been received.

It is about defeating the government’s narrative that crypto is only used by criminals and others who have wrongful motives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Donating to a defense fund is legal in the United States. So is discussing and supporting donation efforts publicly on platforms (as in the case with governance forums and voting portals, for example).</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no legal or ethical prohibition against defense funds. And in the US, donors arguably have First Amendment rights to contribute to causes like this one, free from government interference or retaliation.</li>\n<li>Both Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm are represented by reputable counsel based in the Netherlands and the state of California, respectively. There is an obvious, legitimate need for defense funding because they are in the middle of defending themselves against two different governments that have vast resources to use against them.</li>\n<li>Several advocacy groups including <a href=\"https://x.com/valkenburgh/status/1776327351657181293\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coin Center</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1776345227717951600\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockchain Association</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/amandatums/status/1776293907929714757\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi Education Fund</a>, have already recognized the need here and have filed public amicus briefs in support of the defense efforts.

We propose a canonical deployment of Uniswap v3 on Redstone, to facilitate the exchange of in-game assets that are beginning to propagate within onchain apps and autonomous worlds on Redstone.</p>\n<p>Redstone was developed to provide a home for MUD applications and autonomous worlds that would otherwise struggle to scale on traditional L2’s. The underlying protocol on which Redstone runs, <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/plasma.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Plasma Mode</a>, was designed in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.oplabs.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OP Labs</a>. Plasma Mode is a departure from traditional L2’s, which post all input data to L1 Ethereum. Instead, Plasma Mode posts only a commitment to input data to L1, while the actual data is stored offchain. This model brings two key affordances to developers: more flexibility when choosing DA providers and transactions that are in many cases cheaper than traditional L2’s. Crucially, the challenge contract for data inputs lives on L1, which means that Plasma Mode relies on only Ethereum to force data to be available.</p>\n<p>With Uniswap v3 on Redstone at launch, Uniswap would have the opportunity to be the immediate DEX available to the nascent autonomous worlds space. An important thing to note about onchain games and autonomous worlds is that tokens which exist within them have some form of <em>utility and context.</em> While onchain composability arguably started with the ERC-20 token, autonomous worlds can bring composability to an even more mature state. Onchain games have evolving economies, many of which have in-game tokens, and also promote modding, and new clients and plugins. Many of these plugins can extend the original game, app, or world, creating richer in-game economies.</p>\n<p>This deployment is being co-proposed by Redstone and <a href=\"https://aw.house/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AW House</a>, a grants-giving organization for autonomous worlds. AW House will be managing the frontend for Uniswap v3 on Redstone, and is responsible for maintenance of token lists, and other engineering matters. We have enlisted <a href=\"https://protofire.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Protofire</a> to build the frontend for the Uniswap v3 deployment.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"list-of-actors-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#list-of-actors-4\"></a><strong>List of Actors:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Proposer: Redstone and AW House</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deployer: Protofire</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Front-end: AW House</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bridge Provider: Standard OP Stack bridge</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sponsor: Michigan Blockchain</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"redstone-background-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#redstone-background-5\"></a><strong>Redstone Background</strong></h3>\n<p>We merged Plasma Mode into the OP Stack especially for Redstone, and expect other L2’s to use the protocol in the future. As stated above, Redstone (and Plasma Mode) were built for MUD applications and autonomous worlds–but what does this mean in practice? In the past two years we’ve seen a proliferation of data-intensive onchain games. <a href=\"https://zkga.me/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dark Forest</a>, as an example, is <a href=\"https://gnosis.blockscout.com/tx/0xafd5103a09da4534587104a403b98608513bb962307f539d8655318c703fbaa3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">~650bytes per transaction</a>, amounting to about <a href=\"https://gnosis.blockscout.com/address/0x0F8E1785f850d4bF1155614883c2cB778a69c463\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1 gigabyte over a ten day period</a> (which was the length of a previous Dark Forest round). Uniswap v3 contracts on L1, as a comparative example, <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3677674/6185339\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">post about 2.5 megabytes per day</a>, amounting to 25 megabytes over the same period (1/40th the amount of data).</p>\n<p>Even traditional L2’s struggle to support the data and throughput-intensitivity of onchain games. OPCraft, <a href=\"https://lattice.xyz/blog/making-of-opcraft-part-1-building-an-on-chain-voxel-game\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a game built by Lattice in 2022</a>, saw 2 million transactions in 10 days with a small user base, and cost 400-500k gas per transaction, mostly for its procedural world generation inside the EVM. Calldata was still large: 64 bytes per in-game move.</p>\n<p>These early examples illustrated to us that a chain like Redstone, custom-built for onchain games and autonomous worlds, needed to exist.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"redstone-testnet-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#redstone-testnet-6\"></a><strong>Redstone Testnet</strong></h3>\n<p>Redstone Holesky Testnet has been live since November 15th, 2023.

Games like DEAR, Sky Strife, and This Cursed Machine will all be launching with in-game tokens, and all games launching on Redstone support plugins, modding, and extensions – meaning that game mechanics could be further augmented by in-game assets launched in the future. As an example, <a href=\"https://x.com/biomesAW/status/1775934862803034475\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">plugin ideas from the Biomes team</a> includes rewards for winning in-game contests, and tax collection on digital land.</p>\n<p>Even before Redstone Mainnet was live to users, we already saw instances of user-generated content. At the <a href=\"https://aaworlds.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AA Worlds Summit in Lisbon in April 2024</a>, one team built <a href=\"https://x.com/damor_eth/status/1780977929054462291\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a plugin linking four games on Redstone testnet</a> which enabled players to mint tokens in-game.</p>\n<p>After Redstone launches to users, we expect to see an acceleration in the amount of composability and modding present in autonomous worlds.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"our-collaboration-with-optimism-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#our-collaboration-with-optimism-8\"></a><strong>Our Collaboration With Optimism</strong></h3>\n<p>As detailed in our introduction, Plasma Mode was built in collaboration with OP Labs. With Redstone, we are <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/cFewllyj7WcfZXUreo3mGct0PDRHDjxm8lCSAWPHhvk\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">committing to the Superchain, and joining the Optimism Collective as OP Stack core developers</a>.</p>\n<p>Our partnership with Optimism has emerged over the past year and a half. In late 2022, <a href=\"https://x.com/latticexyz/status/1582486082784210949\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">we deployed OPCraft</a>, a Minecraft-like game built with MUD, on an OP Bedrock testnet. While the game worked well, we also realized that if the game were posting transactions to mainnet, it would be prohibitively expensive for most users to play (and data-intensive for chains themselves to run). After researching optimal ways to scale transactions in MUD worlds, our research brought us to Plasma, an early option proposed by researchers attempting to scale Ethereum.</p>\n<p>It is not a coincidence that many of the leaders at Optimism were also early Plasma researchers. In early 2023, we began to collaborate more seriously with the Optimism team on developing what would eventually become Plasma Mode. In November 2023, <a href=\"https://lattice.xyz/blog/introducing-redstone\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">we formally announced</a> Redstone, Plasma Mode, and that we would be joining the Superchain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"success-criteria-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#success-criteria-9\"></a><strong>Success Criteria</strong></h3>\n<p>Uniswap v3 on Redstone will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expose Uniswap to an entirely new domain in the Ethereum ecosystem:</strong> onchain gaming and autonomous worlds. While Uniswap is present on many chains and different kinds of ecosystems, Uniswap does not yet have a deployment on a chain that is especially built for onchain games. This is an emergent ecosystem, and would benefit Uniswap to be the first DEX on Redstone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Undergird the burgeoning economy on Redstone:</strong> as explored above, Redstone will be launching with a number of games that use ERC-20 tokens in their gameplay. Uniswap has the opportunity to facilitate the swapping of these tokens. The goal is for Uniswap to the the de-facto global DEX on Uniswap. We currently have no other DEXes deployed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enable the discoverability of new games and tokens on Redstone:</strong> When new games with tokens deploy on Redstone, we do not want them to worry about whether users will be able to trade their assets on day 1. Uniswap will be able to alleviate this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"deployment-details-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#deployment-details-10\"></a><strong>Deployment Details</strong></h3>\n<p>Optimistic approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the below Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on Redstone. The approval wil be complete if there are no severe points of contention posed during the 7-day RFC stage and if the veto option during the Onboarding Package Snapshot does not attain a majority vote.</p>\n<p>As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended by the Accountability Committee to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts. This amendment will occur only after a successful RFC and Snapshot phase.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"relevant-uni-v3-contracts-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#relevant-uni-v3-contracts-11\"></a><strong>Relevant Uni v3 Contracts:</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Contract Name</th>\n<th>Redstone Mainnet Addresses</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>v3CoreFactoryAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0xece75613Aa9b1680f0421E5B2eF376DF68aa83Bb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xece75613Aa9b1680f0421E5B2eF376DF68aa83Bb</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>multicall2Address</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0xd57B52452a0FDfE3ff8e0A40Bd10D00D0bfe0723\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xd57B52452a0FDfE3ff8e0A40Bd10D00D0bfe0723</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>proxyAdminAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x320776fE9c8bed28dd6545A7B8e66114b7217153\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x320776fE9c8bed28dd6545A7B8e66114b7217153</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>tickLensAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x600749AA1c493aB8656AD3aeFd2Fd645C7Ba2CdA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x600749AA1c493aB8656AD3aeFd2Fd645C7Ba2CdA</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>nftDescriptorLibraryAddressV1_3_0</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0xe0e63e8a518b001A36FF8ac9F910CeC699D79c5A\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xe0e63e8a518b001A36FF8ac9F910CeC699D79c5A</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>nonfungibleTokenPositionDescriptorAddressV1_3_0</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x97EE1C920De6DD3317df2777886926861ea421cd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x97EE1C920De6DD3317df2777886926861ea421cd</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>descriptorProxyAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x57a1EcB334624899D6955057D6fB27DFc1847865\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x57a1EcB334624899D6955057D6fB27DFc1847865</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>nonfungibleTokenPositionManagerAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x6Cdd7Ad7a1CacCe6163ed26BBA22E0A04dF41AD8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x6Cdd7Ad7a1CacCe6163ed26BBA22E0A04dF41AD8</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>v3MigratorAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0xa46F04F08Ea3AA4e1D22dFEe7f1C014C85Fc2EF9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xa46F04F08Ea3AA4e1D22dFEe7f1C014C85Fc2EF9</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>v3StakerAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x32d8273909300339d01c097E3A79eA522C0CCb47\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x32d8273909300339d01c097E3A79eA522C0CCb47</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>quoterV2Address</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x2986d9721A49838ab4297b695858aF7F17f38014\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x2986d9721A49838ab4297b695858aF7F17f38014</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>swapRouter02</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0xEBe5eAC00Dbbe2b26D1112399d3795f865cD268e\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xEBe5eAC00Dbbe2b26D1112399d3795f865cD268e</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The Uniswap contracts are owned by <a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x2d00e94d78fc307fc5e6195bbe2fb6afc2fc07d4?tab=contract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this crosschain account</a> controlled by the Uniswap DAO on L1.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"uniswaps-onboarding-package-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#uniswaps-onboarding-package-12\"></a><strong>Uniswap’s Onboarding Package</strong></h3>\n<p>The purpose of the Uniswap Onboarding Package is to allow new deployments of Uniswap v3 to get set up with three month’s worth of liquidity incentives, a frontend, and an incentive distribution tool like Merkl.

After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to a formation of Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, which was composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702\">https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702</a>. The proposal seeks Retroactive reward for the Working Group for their contributions so far as well as potential further contributions in a short term.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details</strong><br>\nThe Working Group had two calls that involved the whole group, and once split into three groups, several other calls for both coordination as well as interviews with the stakeholders. The Working Group has another call later next week that involves the whole group, and might involve more calls before proceeding further into voting for the Uniswap Delegate Reward initiative.</p>\n<p>While some groups likely spent more time than others, generally, the contribution hours so far have been less than 30 hours. And in good faith as well as reasonable expectation, we believe that it should be less than 40 hours even if considering further contributions in the future. Therefore, using 200 USD per hour similar to the Accountability Committee, the proposal seeks 64,000 USD (40 hours * 8 members * 200 USD per hour) worth of UNI (which will be more specified in the number of UNI tokens during the onchain voting if this passes the offchain vote) to be at maximum distributed to the Working Group. The amount will be first sent to the multisig held by the Accountability Committee. In reality, there will likely be some leftover budget and believe that considering the Accountability Committee has various functions and initiatives, the leftover can be used as the operation or initiative budget for the Committee in the future.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-retroactive-reward-for-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23709\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-retroactive-reward-for-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23709","pubDate":"Sat, 20 Apr 2024 19:28:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-23709"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-retroactive-reward-for-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23709.rss","#text":"[RFC] Retroactive Reward for Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group"}}]}}}
