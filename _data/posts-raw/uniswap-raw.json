Regular discussions occur prior to deciding our next steps and opinions about governance topics that arise, all through this profile.</p>\n<p>Our delegation will do its utmost to represent and embody our values to enhance Uniswap governance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Uniswap is one of the most decentralized DeFi protocols and all of our initiatives and proposals will align with this same principle. Along with this position, and as the ecosystem continues to mature and be driven by its community, we will collaborate in the creation, iteration, and improvement of governance processes to ensure broader participation and that the system remains secure.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Led Growth &amp; Sustainability:</strong> We will promote and support all initiatives that enable the growth, adoption, scalability and innovation for Uniswap ecosystem. Our focus will be placed on ensuring that all growth initiatives are reliable, secure, and sustainable over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> We will always make sure that no DAO decisions will jeopardize the security of the protocol and thus harm users.</li>\n<li><strong>Ethos and Support</strong>: We will actively contribute to the governance of the protocol and its ecosystem worldwide, looking forward to working with other interested delegates to promote the Uniswap mission and encourage others to actively participate in DAO governance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"why-uniswap-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#why-uniswap-5\"></a>Why Uniswap?</h2>\n<p>Uniswap’s success, achieved independently of the core development team since its deployment, demonstrates the significant demand for permissionless financial services. From our perspective, some strengths make this protocol a special case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Uniswap is consistently at the forefront of pioneering innovations in DeFi infrastructure technology. Its open and permissionless architecture fosters innovation by enabling anyone to create and encourages experimentation and the creation of novel financial instruments, driving the growth and diversity of the DeFi ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: The Uniswap ecosystem has outpaced others in driving widespread adoption. Its accessibility reduces barriers to entry, democratizing decentralized finance for users globally.</li>\n<li><strong>Capital efficiency:</strong> Uniswap typically outperforms other AMMs in terms of capital efficiency due to its concentrated liquidity model (V3). The efficient use of capital allows to handle larger trades with less price impact, making it very competitive and attractive among other AMMs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"our-case-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#our-case-6\"></a>Our case</h1>\n<p>We see Uniswap as an infrastructure layer set to drive innovation throughout the entire ecosystem. Being part of this space will enable us to continue understanding, building, and participating in the following verticals (among others):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Extensive Composability</strong>: Uniswap’s vast integration with hundreds of interfaces and applications ensures a smooth interaction within the DeFi ecosystem. Is our intention to actively participate in decisions that enhance and expand these integrations, further solidifying Uniswap’s position as a critical infrastructure layer in DeFi by contributing ideas for improvements and applications, whether for hooks (V4) or any other innovation/technology from Uniswap or external ones that we can implement into the protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance</strong>: Uniswap’s governance framework is designed to be as constrained as possible, focusing only on essential areas to maintain neutrality and trust minimization. Despite a large community, only a small fraction actively participates in governance, potentially limiting smaller stakeholders voices. Maintaining good participation rates, active discussions, and healthy governance with genuine engagement is crucial for a DAO’s effectiveness. We believe Uniswap can address these challenges by empowering community involvement, overcoming voter apathy, onboarding new participants, and streamlining governance frameworks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"disclosure-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#disclosure-7\"></a>Disclosure:</h2>\n<p>SEEDGov is a broad organization with a high participation in some of the most prominent governances in the ecosystem such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Starknet, Connext and we also constitute Sovereign Finance AVC in MakerDAO.

Through our work with a16z in 2021 we brought representation to student voices across the board via a plethora of student club delegates, with an added focus on international student participation in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erickpinos/status/1404617833078722562\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">regions like Turkey</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the founders of the Uniswap Foundation, Ken Ng, is a BEN alum and former director, which encouraged us to take on an early role in Uniswap governance. Additionally, we maintain a close relationship with Devin Walsh and Erin Koen, continuously gathering feedback on how we can grow. By continuing as a Uniswap delegate, we aim to amplify diverse voices, advance educational initiatives, and uphold our mission to empower the next generation of blockchain innovators.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-do-you-want-to-see-happen-in-uniswap-governance-over-the-next-year-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#what-do-you-want-to-see-happen-in-uniswap-governance-over-the-next-year-7\"></a>What do you want to see happen in Uniswap governance over the next year?</h3>\n<p>We want to see more governance participation from qualified diverse voices, guiding the DAO to create real and tangible impact for the adoption of Uniswap.

After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702\">https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702</a></p>\n<p>The details of the findings were slightly different. However, this conclusion summarized the findings quite nicely:</p>\n<p>“There was a general consensus across most categories that a compensation program for delegates could improve participation quality and dedication. However, the enthusiasm varied, with those deeply involved in governance showing the strongest support.”</p>\n<p>The Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group explored several frameworks for implementing rewards, including a Committee structure that allows several non-delegates to get rewarded for helping to contribute to various scopes. However, some non-delegates in the Working Group preferred the Delegate-only model while other non-delegates in the Group suggested other alternatives.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we believe that the delegate-focused structure can be launched, but other members can also propose structures that focus on different aspects, ultimately leaving the decision up to governance.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Application Eligibility</strong></p>\n<p>There will be a week-long period for delegate candidates to submit their applications.

We are looking for feedback on the proposal below to contribute to their defense fund.</p>\n<p>We believe that Roman and Alexey’s cases are existential for the crypto industry and will set important precedent for protocols, developers, and users worldwide. They are facing significant legal costs on a monthly basis and are running out of resources to defend themselves. We hope that the Uniswap community will consider helping Roman &amp; Alexey defend our rights to privacy and to publish open-source code.</p>\n<p>Note: we are aware that <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/millerdef\">@millerDEF</a> from DeFi Education Fund has already <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-supporting-the-defi-education-fund/23631\">proposed</a> funding for their legal advocacy work including recent amicus briefs filed in support of <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_aff0399d95324a94af6b5f6cd3e31b91.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coin Centre v.

However, Roman and Alexey are <strong>running out of funds to defend themselves and need direct material support</strong>. For example, invoices for the month of April 2024 alone were over $350k USD. While we are very grateful to the DEF for their important advocacy work, we do not have enough funds to make it through Roman’s upcoming trial in September as well as potential appeals in Alexey’s case (depending on the trial outcome in May). These men are ordinary developers with families and children that love them, and they need our help to win this costly legal battle.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"context-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#context-2\"></a>Context</h3>\n<p>Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm, two developers who contributed to Tornado Cash, were arrested in different jurisdictions following OFAC’s sanctions in 2022. Their 2024 trials are setting important precedents for developers, privacy protocols, and the crypto industry more broadly. Alexey’s first trial took place on March 26 of this year (with verdict and further potential legal action scheduled for mid-May), and Roman’s trial is scheduled for late September.</p>\n<p>The government’s attempt to criminalize Roman and Alexey for a third party’s misuse of open-source software is unjust and unlawful. But while <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/286828/three-crypto-advocacy-groups-file-amicus-briefs-in-tornado-cash-developer-roman-storms-case\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">legal advocates are spending enormous effort and money</a> to defend Storm and Pertsev, the developers are faced with two governments using all of their resources to prosecute them and treat them like terrorists.</p>\n<p>Roman and Alexey need your help to build a strong legal defense not just for their sake, but for crypto users and developers worldwide. Justice DAO is advocating on their behalf and helping to raise funds for their legal defense. However, time and money are running out and we need support from influential protocols and organizations within the Ethereum ecosystem. This donation will not only help to fund ongoing legal defense work but also send a message of solidarity to Roman and Alexey while they fight against government overreach and abuse of power.</p>\n<p><strong>View Roman Storm’s statement here:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://x.com/rstormsf/status/1749490246000238942\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://x.com/rstormsf/status/1749490246000238942</a></p>\n<p><strong>Alexey and Roman’s legal defense fund on Juicebox:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://juicebox.money/@free-pertsev-and-storm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://juicebox.money/@free-pertsev-and-storm</a></p>\n<p><strong>Complete breakdown of associated funding and costs:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P69NhyLshI6kwfo7KqaA_rNUV5vpRw9JTJOfFAsdqAk/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P69NhyLshI6kwfo7KqaA_rNUV5vpRw9JTJOfFAsdqAk/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"addressing-legal-concerns-and-reasons-to-donate-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#addressing-legal-concerns-and-reasons-to-donate-3\"></a>Addressing Legal Concerns and Reasons to Donate</h3>\n<p><strong>A. Hundreds of donors have already stepped up to defend open-source code</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Since 2022, over 800 donations totaling ~750 ETH have been received.

It is about defeating the government’s narrative that crypto is only used by criminals and others who have wrongful motives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Donating to a defense fund is legal in the United States. So is discussing and supporting donation efforts publicly on platforms (as in the case with governance forums and voting portals, for example).</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no legal or ethical prohibition against defense funds. And in the US, donors arguably have First Amendment rights to contribute to causes like this one, free from government interference or retaliation.</li>\n<li>Both Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm are represented by reputable counsel based in the Netherlands and the state of California, respectively. There is an obvious, legitimate need for defense funding because they are in the middle of defending themselves against two different governments that have vast resources to use against them.</li>\n<li>Several advocacy groups including <a href=\"https://x.com/valkenburgh/status/1776327351657181293\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coin Center</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1776345227717951600\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockchain Association</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/amandatums/status/1776293907929714757\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi Education Fund</a>, have already recognized the need here and have filed public amicus briefs in support of the defense efforts.

We propose a canonical deployment of Uniswap v3 on Redstone, to facilitate the exchange of in-game assets that are beginning to propagate within onchain apps and autonomous worlds on Redstone.</p>\n<p>Redstone was developed to provide a home for MUD applications and autonomous worlds that would otherwise struggle to scale on traditional L2’s. The underlying protocol on which Redstone runs, <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/plasma.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Plasma Mode</a>, was designed in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.oplabs.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OP Labs</a>. Plasma Mode is a departure from traditional L2’s, which post all input data to L1 Ethereum. Instead, Plasma Mode posts only a commitment to input data to L1, while the actual data is stored offchain. This model brings two key affordances to developers: more flexibility when choosing DA providers and transactions that are in many cases cheaper than traditional L2’s. Crucially, the challenge contract for data inputs lives on L1, which means that Plasma Mode relies on only Ethereum to force data to be available.</p>\n<p>With Uniswap v3 on Redstone at launch, Uniswap would have the opportunity to be the immediate DEX available to the nascent autonomous worlds space. An important thing to note about onchain games and autonomous worlds is that tokens which exist within them have some form of <em>utility and context.</em> While onchain composability arguably started with the ERC-20 token, autonomous worlds can bring composability to an even more mature state. Onchain games have evolving economies, many of which have in-game tokens, and also promote modding, and new clients and plugins. Many of these plugins can extend the original game, app, or world, creating richer in-game economies.</p>\n<p>This deployment is being co-proposed by Redstone and <a href=\"https://aw.house/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AW House</a>, a grants-giving organization for autonomous worlds. AW House will be managing the frontend for Uniswap v3 on Redstone, and is responsible for maintenance of token lists, and other engineering matters. We have enlisted <a href=\"https://protofire.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Protofire</a> to build the frontend for the Uniswap v3 deployment.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"list-of-actors-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#list-of-actors-4\"></a><strong>List of Actors:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Proposer: Redstone and AW House</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deployer: Protofire</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Front-end: AW House</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bridge Provider: Standard OP Stack bridge</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sponsor: Michigan Blockchain</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"redstone-background-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#redstone-background-5\"></a><strong>Redstone Background</strong></h3>\n<p>We merged Plasma Mode into the OP Stack especially for Redstone, and expect other L2’s to use the protocol in the future. As stated above, Redstone (and Plasma Mode) were built for MUD applications and autonomous worlds–but what does this mean in practice? In the past two years we’ve seen a proliferation of data-intensive onchain games. <a href=\"https://zkga.me/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dark Forest</a>, as an example, is <a href=\"https://gnosis.blockscout.com/tx/0xafd5103a09da4534587104a403b98608513bb962307f539d8655318c703fbaa3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">~650bytes per transaction</a>, amounting to about <a href=\"https://gnosis.blockscout.com/address/0x0F8E1785f850d4bF1155614883c2cB778a69c463\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1 gigabyte over a ten day period</a> (which was the length of a previous Dark Forest round). Uniswap v3 contracts on L1, as a comparative example, <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3677674/6185339\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">post about 2.5 megabytes per day</a>, amounting to 25 megabytes over the same period (1/40th the amount of data).</p>\n<p>Even traditional L2’s struggle to support the data and throughput-intensitivity of onchain games. OPCraft, <a href=\"https://lattice.xyz/blog/making-of-opcraft-part-1-building-an-on-chain-voxel-game\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a game built by Lattice in 2022</a>, saw 2 million transactions in 10 days with a small user base, and cost 400-500k gas per transaction, mostly for its procedural world generation inside the EVM. Calldata was still large: 64 bytes per in-game move.</p>\n<p>These early examples illustrated to us that a chain like Redstone, custom-built for onchain games and autonomous worlds, needed to exist.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"redstone-testnet-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#redstone-testnet-6\"></a><strong>Redstone Testnet</strong></h3>\n<p>Redstone Holesky Testnet has been live since November 15th, 2023.

With Redstone, we are <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/cFewllyj7WcfZXUreo3mGct0PDRHDjxm8lCSAWPHhvk\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">committing to the Superchain, and joining the Optimism Collective as OP Stack core developers</a>.</p>\n<p>Our partnership with Optimism has emerged over the past year and a half. In late 2022, <a href=\"https://x.com/latticexyz/status/1582486082784210949\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">we deployed OPCraft</a>, a Minecraft-like game built with MUD, on an OP Bedrock testnet. While the game worked well, we also realized that if the game were posting transactions to mainnet, it would be prohibitively expensive for most users to play (and data-intensive for chains themselves to run). After researching optimal ways to scale transactions in MUD worlds, our research brought us to Plasma, an early option proposed by researchers attempting to scale Ethereum.</p>\n<p>It is not a coincidence that many of the leaders at Optimism were also early Plasma researchers. In early 2023, we began to collaborate more seriously with the Optimism team on developing what would eventually become Plasma Mode. In November 2023, <a href=\"https://lattice.xyz/blog/introducing-redstone\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">we formally announced</a> Redstone, Plasma Mode, and that we would be joining the Superchain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"success-criteria-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#success-criteria-9\"></a><strong>Success Criteria</strong></h3>\n<p>Uniswap v3 on Redstone will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expose Uniswap to an entirely new domain in the Ethereum ecosystem:</strong> onchain gaming and autonomous worlds. While Uniswap is present on many chains and different kinds of ecosystems, Uniswap does not yet have a deployment on a chain that is especially built for onchain games. This is an emergent ecosystem, and would benefit Uniswap to be the first DEX on Redstone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Undergird the burgeoning economy on Redstone:</strong> as explored above, Redstone will be launching with a number of games that use ERC-20 tokens in their gameplay. Uniswap has the opportunity to facilitate the swapping of these tokens. The goal is for Uniswap to the the de-facto global DEX on Uniswap. We currently have no other DEXes deployed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enable the discoverability of new games and tokens on Redstone:</strong> When new games with tokens deploy on Redstone, we do not want them to worry about whether users will be able to trade their assets on day 1. Uniswap will be able to alleviate this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"deployment-details-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#deployment-details-10\"></a><strong>Deployment Details</strong></h3>\n<p>Optimistic approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the below Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on Redstone. The approval wil be complete if there are no severe points of contention posed during the 7-day RFC stage and if the veto option during the Onboarding Package Snapshot does not attain a majority vote.</p>\n<p>As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended by the Accountability Committee to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts. This amendment will occur only after a successful RFC and Snapshot phase.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"relevant-uni-v3-contracts-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#relevant-uni-v3-contracts-11\"></a><strong>Relevant Uni v3 Contracts:</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Contract Name</th>\n<th>Redstone Mainnet Addresses</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>v3CoreFactoryAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0xece75613Aa9b1680f0421E5B2eF376DF68aa83Bb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xece75613Aa9b1680f0421E5B2eF376DF68aa83Bb</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>multicall2Address</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0xd57B52452a0FDfE3ff8e0A40Bd10D00D0bfe0723\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xd57B52452a0FDfE3ff8e0A40Bd10D00D0bfe0723</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>proxyAdminAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x320776fE9c8bed28dd6545A7B8e66114b7217153\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x320776fE9c8bed28dd6545A7B8e66114b7217153</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>tickLensAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x600749AA1c493aB8656AD3aeFd2Fd645C7Ba2CdA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x600749AA1c493aB8656AD3aeFd2Fd645C7Ba2CdA</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>nftDescriptorLibraryAddressV1_3_0</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0xe0e63e8a518b001A36FF8ac9F910CeC699D79c5A\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xe0e63e8a518b001A36FF8ac9F910CeC699D79c5A</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>nonfungibleTokenPositionDescriptorAddressV1_3_0</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x97EE1C920De6DD3317df2777886926861ea421cd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x97EE1C920De6DD3317df2777886926861ea421cd</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>descriptorProxyAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x57a1EcB334624899D6955057D6fB27DFc1847865\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x57a1EcB334624899D6955057D6fB27DFc1847865</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>nonfungibleTokenPositionManagerAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x6Cdd7Ad7a1CacCe6163ed26BBA22E0A04dF41AD8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x6Cdd7Ad7a1CacCe6163ed26BBA22E0A04dF41AD8</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>v3MigratorAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0xa46F04F08Ea3AA4e1D22dFEe7f1C014C85Fc2EF9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xa46F04F08Ea3AA4e1D22dFEe7f1C014C85Fc2EF9</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>v3StakerAddress</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x32d8273909300339d01c097E3A79eA522C0CCb47\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x32d8273909300339d01c097E3A79eA522C0CCb47</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>quoterV2Address</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x2986d9721A49838ab4297b695858aF7F17f38014\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x2986d9721A49838ab4297b695858aF7F17f38014</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>swapRouter02</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0xEBe5eAC00Dbbe2b26D1112399d3795f865cD268e\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xEBe5eAC00Dbbe2b26D1112399d3795f865cD268e</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The Uniswap contracts are owned by <a href=\"https://explorer.redstone.xyz/address/0x2d00e94d78fc307fc5e6195bbe2fb6afc2fc07d4?tab=contract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this crosschain account</a> controlled by the Uniswap DAO on L1.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"uniswaps-onboarding-package-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#uniswaps-onboarding-package-12\"></a><strong>Uniswap’s Onboarding Package</strong></h3>\n<p>The purpose of the Uniswap Onboarding Package is to allow new deployments of Uniswap v3 to get set up with three month’s worth of liquidity incentives, a frontend, and an incentive distribution tool like Merkl.

After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to a formation of Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, which was composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702\">https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702</a>.

And in good faith as well as reasonable expectation, we believe that it should be less than 40 hours even if considering further contributions in the future. Therefore, using 200 USD per hour similar to the Accountability Committee, the proposal seeks 64,000 USD (40 hours * 8 members * 200 USD per hour) worth of UNI (which will be more specified in the number of UNI tokens during the onchain voting if this passes the offchain vote) to be at maximum distributed to the Working Group. The amount will be first sent to the multisig held by the Accountability Committee.

After over a month of research and response gathering, we are happy to share our findings.</p>\n<p>The Working Group’s tasks were split into three groups:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Stakeholder Interviews</strong><br>\n<strong>2. Evaluating existing delegate composition, roles, contributions, and responsibilities</strong><br>\n<strong>3. Conducting market research to determine best practice</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group 1 : Stakeholder Interviews</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aim:</strong><br>\nConsolidate feedback from stakeholder interviews across Active, Small, and Inactive Delegates, Large Investors, and the Foundation regarding the proposal to introduce rewards for Uniswap delegates.</p>\n<p>The primary goal was to evaluate the community’s sentiment towards delegate rewards, understand the motivations of current delegates, and understand the goals that delegates and the broader stakeholder group hope to achieve with delegation writ large. The consensus points towards the need for a formal compensation scheme for delegates, though perspectives on implementation, oversight, and value vary.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>\nThere was a general consensus across most categories that a compensation program for delegates could improve participation quality and dedication. However, the enthusiasm varied, with those deeply involved in governance showing the strongest support.</p>\n<p>The interviews illustrated a variety of concerns and reservations about delegate compensation across different stakeholder groups, ranging from the potential for misaligned incentives to the practical challenges of implementing such systems.</p>\n<p>The primary reasons for supporting compensation were to ensure active participation, professionalize the delegate role, and align delegates’ activities with the strategic goals of the DAO.</p>\n<p>Alternatives were also proposed, including defining better paid committees with discrete scopes and experimentation with futarchy and information markets.</p>\n<p>In contrast, those less active or indirectly affected by governance outcomes, such as Liquidity Providers and Inactive Delegates, were less clear on the value and urgency of rewards, but recognized the potential benefits of incentivizing high-quality governance contributions.</p>\n<p>Full research can be found here: <a href=\"https://butterd.notion.site/Uniswap-Delegate-Rewards-Stakeholder-Interviews-2ff124cbfd4a4203ae4327f096bb1533\">https://butterd.notion.site/Uniswap-Delegate-Rewards-Stakeholder-Interviews-2ff124cbfd4a4203ae4327f096bb1533</a></p>\n<p><strong>Group 2 : Evaluating existing delegate composition, roles, contributions, and responsibilities</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aim:</strong><br>\nEvaluate existing delegate composition, roles, contributions, and responsibilities via quantitative and qualitative analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>\nDelegates help with the governance security. And their role has been becoming more important as the time goes, evidenced by the number of voters dropping but the voting power still being holding due to mostly delegates participating. Delegates contribute to discussions, voting, writing, reviewing proposals as well as participating in various working groups.

This approach aims to build on observed successes in protocols that have a similar mission and delegate profile to Uniswap, and ultimately save time while iterating on models that are already working.</p>\n<p>We chose to explore the Maker DAO and AAVE delegate compensation programs. These were chosen because they both have a track record of observed success and the programs appeared to match the scale of participants that we believe a Uniswap Delegate program would include.</p>\n<p>In this report, we present a high-level overview of both programs followed by a conclusion that identifies components of each that we believe would be of value to a Uniswap delegate compensation program.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>\na.Delegates’ compensation should be based on their commitment to the protocol based on criteria that are specific, quantifiable, and objective.</p>\n<p>b.Should include periodicity to remove stale delegates and add fresh delegates.</p>\n<p>c.Compensation should include gas fee component</p>\n<p>d.DAO’s should assess their own unique needs</p>\n<p>e.Limits should be set.</p>\n<p>Full research can be found here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DCRQeDt3VJGDbcUWnxURMGiFRBC68SsBJGqhF864Cns/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DCRQeDt3VJGDbcUWnxURMGiFRBC68SsBJGqhF864Cns/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>-We will appreciate the community’s feedback on those findings.

I am here to paint a picture of a world where Uniswap Labs loses the case against the SEC.</p>\n<p>Token and Security:</p>\n<p>The world would be better off if the SEC prevails. We’ve already witnessed a reality where it emerges victorious. In this scenario, Venture Capital privately raises funds at low valuations akin to accredited investors in the equity realm. All the value is siphoned away, and airdrops serve as golden parachutes for founders and VCs. These parachutes unfold over years through slow selling. There’s no incentive to generate value for the token in which people have come to believe. While a glimmer of hope exists for fee switches, token burns, and token memberships, implementing these could land those with the golden parachute in trouble for making the token resemble too much of a “security.”</p>\n<p>The Revolving Door of Nepotism:</p>\n<p>Insiders further extract value. Individuals closest to the information make moves to benefit themselves. A significant LP in the UNI pool withdrew funds and transferred them to Binance before the announcement of the fee switch transition. Upon reflection, it served as an excellent exit liquidity move. Who informed this person?</p>\n<p>Former labs members or friends of labs members seek significant sums of UNI tokens for equity in competing products or get aquired with little value add to other similar products, or look for users to donate to pay lawyers to case fires. Is this truly a user-first world? Or is it still reminiscent of traditional markets where those privy to information extract value from the public?</p>\n<p>Uniswap Losses, Good:</p>\n<p>The SEC should compel VCs and founders to burn the UNI acquired in private rounds—pre-airdrop. The airdropped and treasury tokens are the only legitimate ones. Those who have exploited their positions of power should only claim rights to these tokens at their fair user value. What have VCs done to enhance the protocol? Nothing. If they did, it would likely be deemed a security. They exist to create artificial value and subsequently destroy it. To rectify the system, the VC model must be dismantled to foster real value, and the SEC prevailing would aid in this endeavor. They would mandate the shutdown of the Uniswap Labs frontend, which raises fees without informing users. Its value lies in trust, yet that trust has been monetized to the detriment of users.</p>\n<p>FOSS Frontend Focus:</p>\n<p>With VC and founder tokens burned and the privately owned frontend shuttered, we can rebuild. Utilize voting and the treasury to finance genuinely open-source frontends. These frontends could specialize in various routes, communities, and user personalization. Direct use cases and fees toward liquidity, loyalty programs, and rewards. Rectify the liquidity layer of the internet.</p>\n<p>If the SEC wins, may the users triumph. It would usher in a world distinct from today’s—one where UNI can stand alongside BTC as decentralized infrastructure.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/sec-vs-uniswap-labs-is-losing-good/23646\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/sec-vs-uniswap-labs-is-losing-good/23646","pubDate":"Sat, 13 Apr 2024 20:51:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-23646"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/sec-vs-uniswap-labs-is-losing-good/23646.rss","#text":"SEC vs Uniswap Labs - Is losing good?"}},{"title":"RFC - Options for Supporting DeFi Education Fund","dc:creator":"Doo_StableLab","category":"Proposal Discussion","description":"<p>This is a parallel proposal regarding <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-supporting-the-defi-education-fund/23631\">DeFi Education Fund (DEF) 's recent proposal for 1 million $UNI</a>  , which means we will post it when DEF’s proposal is up, but just with more options so the community has more choices regarding how they want to support DEF.

Thank you all!</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-1\"></a></h3>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Since its founding via a timely Uniswap Governance governance proposal in 2021, the <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/\">DeFi Education Fund </a> (DEF) has fought to advance and protect the potential of DeFi in the public policy sphere. The threat that misguided policies and overreaching regulators pose to DeFi has never been clearer. This proposal is to provide DEF with one million UNI tokens in two tranches to support them in fulfilling their mission.</p>\n<p><em>See our CLO Amanda Tuminelli <a href=\"https://unchainedcrypto.com/gary-genslers-case-against-uniswap-does-the-sec-even-stand-a-chance/\">discuss our recent work </a> on Unchained this morning.</em></p>\n<p>DeFi promises to revolutionize how people engage in economic activities. In particular, the openly accessible and decentralized characteristics of DeFi protocols means that anyone with an internet connection and a wallet can participate in the global economy in a way that would not be possible without DeFi. To do so, DeFi upends the structure of traditional financial services and related policy making approaches. That upending has brought with it intense interest, suspicion, and hostility from entrenched interests and regulatory bodies around the world.</p>\n<p>DEF has defended DeFi from legislative threats that would require DeFi developers to implement protocol access restrictions or requirements designed for CeFi businesses; regulatory proposals that would mandate centralization if finalized; and in the courts against overzealous regulators. In late March, we sued the SEC over its policy on airdrops and its campaign of regulation by enforcement that is crippling DeFi and crypto development and participation in the United States.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, DeFi’s policy challenges have become more real, more imminent, and more numerous. For example, in the U.S. alone, there are at least half a dozen bills actively under consideration in Congress and two rulemakings pending finalization that would effectively prohibit DeFi development. Luckily, public policy education and advocacy has borne—and can continue to bear—fruit for DeFi.</p>\n<p>Without doubt, building a public policy environment welcoming of DeFi and decentralized governance will be a long and arduous struggle, but we know that Uniswap Governance shares our commitment to winning that debate—and it is winnable—so that the benefits of DeFi can be felt and enjoyed by as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>DEF is eager to continue leading the fight on behalf of DeFi. With additional resources, we can build out our team:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>super charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;</li>\n<li>expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;</li>\n<li>more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; and</li>\n<li>enhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from the myriad policy risks it faces while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing and appreciate your consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>DeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.</p>\n<p>At this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.</p>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.</p>\n<p>DEF focuses specifically on fighting for policy outcomes favorable to decentralized finance developers and users on the ground in Washington, DC. A summary of our past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US and around the world, below. This proposal would expand our budget so that we can expand our legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.</p>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>Team, Social, &amp; Contacts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/about\">Team</a>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/millercwl\">Miller Whitehouse-Levine </a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amandatums\">Amanda Tuminelli </a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbernstein6395\">Max Bernstein </a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LazPieper\">Lizandro Peiper </a></li>\n<li>Board: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xMarcB\">Marc Boiron</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jchervinsky\">Jake Chervinsky</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RebeccaRettig1\">Rebecca Rettig</a> (all elected by Uniswap Governance in '21)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://defieducationfund.substack.com/archive\">Weekly updates </a> on policy developments and activities</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTt5vI0P5MuBF2vq1UyhByKqmM6XbMp-twre8ahm_gs/edit\">12 Month Estimated Budget </a> (current burn)</li>\n<li>Historical financial <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/financial-information\">information </a> (annual and monthly)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fund_defi\">X </a></li>\n<li>Contact - Please reach out to discuss!\n<ul>\n<li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:miller@defieducationfund.org\">miller@defieducationfund.org</a></li>\n<li>Telegram: <span class=\"mention\">@millwl</span></li>\n<li>Twitter: <span class=\"mention\">@fund_defi</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The DeFi Education Fund is a nonprofit organization with a demonstrated history of being in the trenches fighting for DAOs and decentralized finance. Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.</p>\n<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>\n<p><em>Why are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?</em></p>\n<p>We are seeking Uniswap Governance’s further support now for three primary reasons.</p>\n<p>First, we need a good sense of our longer term funding in order to expand our efforts and take on the long term projects that our work often requires, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will likely take a total of at least two years from start to finish. Our lawsuit against the SEC will probably last several years. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting those efforts, we would not have been able to take them on at all. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.</p>\n<p>Second, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States would cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects while also expanding our day to day efforts and team.</p>\n<p>DeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.</p>\n<p><em>When and how would you plan on selling this proposal’s tokens?</em></p>\n<p>It is important to us that DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. Upon passage, 500k $UNI tokens would be transferred to DEF’s on-chain Coinbase $UNI <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xb39cb7Eb25CE07470Fb59F7548979Fae0Bb85824\">wallet</a>, and 500k would be locked up in a streaming contract that would “vest” linearly over 12 months. Governance could vote to stop the streaming of the remaining tokens at any time.</p>\n<p>We will hold half of any tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will pre-disclose all sales plans in writing.</p>\n<p><em>How are you going to keep Uniswap Governance up to date on your activities?</em></p>\n<p>The DEF team will host monthly community calls that Uniswap community members can join to hear updates on our work, learn about high priority policy and regulatory developers, and have questions answered. We’ll also keep a thread on the Uniswap governance forum up to date with our monthly updates.</p>\n<p><em>What about the tokens from the 2021 proposal?</em></p>\n<p>We received our initial grant of one million $UNI tokens from the Uniswap Governance in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens shortly thereafter. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18 month written <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/post/def-provides-update-on-our-funding\">sales plan</a>. We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.</p>\n<p><em>Why are you asking us for money and not other DAOs?</em></p>\n<p>We are, and we will definitely continue to “pass around the hat”! We seek Uni governance’s continued support as a community that is building for the long term. Uniswap Governance took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that Uni governance and other projects’ governance will continue to contribute to our work going forward.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-2\"></a></h3>\n<p><strong>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</strong></p>\n<p><em>Legal Advocacy</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEC v. Kraken - In February 2024, we submitted an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_7c5fd096e8234f9bb66e4629d5f31b60.pdf\">amicus brief</a> explaining the various incorrect and often inconsistent legal positions the SEC employs in its attempts to justify its position that digital asset transactions are securities transactions.</li>\n<li>Van Loon v. Treasury - In November 2023, we filed another <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_dc5e8345b3d34bd4af4d06663c12d413.pdf\">amicus brief</a> related to the Tornado Cash sanctions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We argued that the use of privacy-protecting technology is normal and not inherently illicit and that Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) exceeded its statutory authority in issuing sanctions that included purely domestic transactions.</li>\n<li>Harper v. Internal Revenue Service - In October 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_492b137460ef4263aa43f3fcb946a1cd.pdf\">amicus brief</a> in a case involving a challenge to a “John Doe” summons the IRS sent to Coinbase that resulted in the collection of information (including information revealing on-chain wallet addresses) about 14,355 Americans (none of whom were accused of any wrongdoing prior to the summons) over a three-year period. Our brief explained the sweeping Fourth Amendment implications of indiscriminately collecting digital asset transaction information and how doing so is more revealing than in the context of TradFi.</li>\n<li>SEC v. Coinbase - In August 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_05b10d3583a647b08dd071727ab8b7f1.pdf\">amicus brief</a> in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in support of Coinbase. We explained how wallets and staking actually work and supported Coinbase’s arguments that it is not a broker through its wallet software, nor did it offer securities through its staking program.</li>\n<li>Coin Center v. Treasury - In June 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_aff0399d95324a94af6b5f6cd3e31b91.pdf\">amicus brief</a> in support of a challenge to OFAC’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment ag. In October 2022, Coin Center and several individuals sued Treasury, challenging OFAC’s designation of Tornado Cash smart contracts. The plaintiffs argued that doing so exceeded the Treasury’s authority, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the First Amendment. Our brief supported arguments that the sanctions were beyond the Treasury Department’s statutory authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act, made the point that Tornado Cash is an important privacy-protection tool, and argued that the sanctions designations made no sense when considering the realities of the technology at issue.</li>\n<li>Van Loon v. Treasury - In April 2023, we submitted our first <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_347cf86b54b540e9be5773f8560d62bc.pdf\">brief</a> related to Treasury’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. In addition to Treasury’s lack of statutory basis for the actions, We argued that the downstream implications of sanctioning a software protocol will lead to not only a weakening of the digital asset industry, but will also seriously jeopardize law-abiding Americans’ financial privacy.</li>\n<li>CFTC v. Ooki DAO - In late 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) served Ooki DAO, alleging it is “illegally offering leveraged and margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets” without a Futures Commission Merchant designation or a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) program. The CFTC served “Ooki DAO” via a help chat box with a contemporaneous notice posted on a website purportedly affiliated with Ooki DAO. We filed a brief in the case explaining: “First, the Commission has named Ooki DAO as a defendant in this action, asserting that Ooki DAO is an “unincorporated association comprised of Ooki Token holders.” But nothing about the structure of a DAO inherently dictates that result. In many cases, DAOs lack any central organization or management, and many DAO token holders often lack coordination or common objectives. As a result, DAOs will often not be “associations” of any kind, and therefore will not be proper defendants in an enforcement action brought under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), which requires that a defendant be a “person” (defined to include “associations”). The Commission has not yet alleged facts sufficient to establish that Ooki DAO is an association, so its attempt to serve Ooki DAO here is premature.”</li>\n<li>Combatting crypto patent trolls: In September 2023, we took action to protect DeFi and crypto from invalid patent infringement claims. We filed a<a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_ed2f23226fbb4adaa53b86efa5d58f44.pdf\"> petition</a> with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to initiate an inter partes review and cancellation of all claims in a patent owned by True Return Systems LLC. TRS is a patent troll who first tried to sell the patent as an NFT, and when that didn’t work, sued both MakerDAO and Compound Protocol in federal court for alleged infringement of<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US10025797B1/en\"> U.S. Patent No. 10,025,797</a>. Our petition argued that the technology that TRS purported to patent was not in fact TRS’s invention, but was instead very similar to oracle technology that had been in development and use for years prior to the patent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Regulatory Advocacy</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In January 2024, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_a5bb9050d8414cbab3f0285202464a29.pdf\">urged</a> the Department of the Treasury to reconsider its proposed rule to classify crypto “mixing” transactions to be a “primary money laundering concern” subject to enhanced reporting requirements. Among the issues we commented on is the proposal’s all-encompassing definition of “mixing,” which would capture almost all crypto transactions and designate them to be “high risk.”</li>\n<li>In January 2024, we submitted <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_4bdb18a7e1b94bfea406dfbb0a0ffcc8.pdf\">our thoughts</a> on a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed rulemaking that could expand the CFPB’s supervisory authority to capture self-hosted wallets. We argued that the rulemaking should not move forward as it would further scramble the Federal government’s already-convoluted regulatory treatment of DeFi and crypto-related activities.</li>\n<li>In November 2023, we filed a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_40d4255857d142f2a1744be79f1dab3f.pdf\">comment letter</a> regarding the Treasury Department’s proposed “broker” rulemaking. The proposed rule would introduce a brand new category of broker called a “digital asset middleman,” a new term that is essentially limitless in scope and creates brokers out of thin air in DeFi and, as we argue, runs contrary to the statute and legislative history. Furthermore, we argued that the proposal violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on warrantless searches and seizures of a person’s papers and effects because individuals do not voluntarily turn over their personal data to “digital asset middlemen” who themselves neither collect nor have any legitimate business reason to collect that information. For a plain language review of our issues with the rulemaking, read: “<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/11/15/congress-gets-the-runaround-from-regulators-again/\">Congress Gets the Runaround From Regulators, Again</a>.”</li>\n<li>In October 2023, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_1dfebf33d77f40a0895314105ed47079.pdf\">responded</a> to France’s Autorité de Marchés Financiers (AMF) concerning their DeFi regulatory discussion paper. Our comment letter addressed many topics including permissionless blockchain protocols, legal enforceability of smart contracts, off-chain elements, etc. Importantly, we addressed the legal liability of smart contract developers, arguing that smart contracts’ code is open-source for anyone to audit and make informed decisions. Furthermore, we argued that open-source code is a form of expression as it conveys ideas for societal change and demands protection. We also argued against the AMF’s proposal to create a government-run certification regime for smart contracts.</li>\n<li>In September 2023, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_94bb62e0bac1428585c944bc06884bd2.pdf\">responded</a> to a request for comment from the Senate Finance Committee regarding the taxation of digital assets. In our submission, we recommended Congress: 1) Revise Section 6050I so that it does not “deputize recipients of digital assets to collect and report information about their payers;” 2) Do not tax staking rewards until a sale or other disposition; 3) Do not apply wash sale rules to taxpayers who utilize digital assets as a form of currency; and 4) explicitly extend the application of section 1058’s nonrecognition rule to “loans” of actively traded fungible tokens.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we submitted a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_e73f5656c9a047788521cf09259db7a4.pdf\">response </a>to a consultation from HM Revenue and Customs, the United Kingdom’s tax, payments, and customs authority, regarding “the taxation of DeFi involving the lending and staking of cryptoassets.” At a high-level, our submission noted that any changes to the tax regime that concern DeFi must: be flexible to account for future innovation; exhibit clarity and simplicity to promote compliance by minimizing the burden on taxpayers; and align with the underlying economic substance of a typical DeFi transaction.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we submitted a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_dbc796a8e44644539ffcd4722e1b442a.pdf\">response </a>to Banque of France’s Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) regarding their discussion paper: “Decentralised’ or ‘Disintermediated’ Finance: What Regulatory Response?” Our primary arguments included that ACPR should not directly regulate miners and validators by establishing standards for public blockchains; a policy that would “force centralization” would eliminate the core innovations of public blockchains; and a framework for smart contract certification would require centralization and the inappropriate regulation of speech.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we filed our <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_f997b07bbb6d43b8a3b6c0626f57cdf3.pdf\">third comment letter</a> on the SEC’s proposed “exchange” rulemaking. Our brief made two primary arguments: first, the proposal improperly reads and misapplies the Exchange Act and exceeds the SEC’s statutory authority and mandate under the Act; and second, the SEC has flatly failed to comply with numerous procedural and statutory rulemaking requirements.</li>\n<li>In August 2022, the DEF filed a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khRThXkBfev9uTTtSlakcckfKjP1_8TT/view\">response</a> to the U.S. Treasury Department’s request for comment on innovation in digital assets. In our response, we explained how DeFi protocols have the potential to benefit consumers, investors, and businesses in the United States and around the world by creating accessible financial infrastructure usable by any individual with an internet connection.</li>\n<li>In June 2022, we <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y6_UbL2DBMvICeuhdENSGGWPJrZCBAWM/view\">responded</a> to Abu Dhabi’s DeFi consultation, in which we expressed our view that decentralization and disintermediation serve important societal objectives and that forcing the reintroduction of intermediation via legal obligations is a misguided approach to DeFi that would undermine its core potential and innovation.</li>\n<li>In June 2022, In our second <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1inWXw7MSO8VjrbuPro8izeewgmRGNC9r/view\">letter</a> on the SEC’s exchange rulemaking, we argued that the proposed rule represents an improperly static regulatory response to a dynamic innovation and therefore needs to be reconsidered in total.</li>\n<li>In May 2022, we <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GC4QPms1JxzrBr7sLDlSzoVVk3EcTsNP/view\">commented</a> on the SEC’s “dealer” rulemaking, which could not only subject large DeFi market participants to the threat of arbitrary SEC enforcement actions but also, potentially, capture liquidity pools themselves as so-called “dealers” under the securities laws. But how would it do so? In what way? The SEC did not say when it proposed the rule nor when it later finalized the rule in early 2024, which we expect to see challenged in court. .</li>\n<li>In April 2022, we submitted the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cjQIDH3VE9303k-r55lQFfn1v-tH5l0n/view\">first</a> of three comment letters on the SEC’s “exchange” rulemaking, which would de facto ban DeFi protocols in the United States. We argued that the Proposal’s expanded definition of an “exchange” is so broad that it could be interpreted to cover DeFi market participants, yet the rule didn’t specify which or why—it didn’t even mention “crypto,” “DeFi,” or “digital assets” once. In January 2023 in response to these concerns, the SEC released 167 pages of additional information explaining that the proposal does apply to DeFi and crypto, which we also responded to.</li>\n<li>In April 2022, we submitted a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kaURtD9UIFBaB4mMkcZXRi15uGJ5d3dK/view\">comment letter</a> to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on its proposed <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/oecd-seeks-input-on-new-tax-transparency-framework-for-crypto-assets-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.htm\">framework</a> for tax reporting in the digital asset ecosystem. Broadly, when it comes to DeFi, the proposal fits squarely in the “how do we apply existing regulations and tactics to innovative systems” camp. This concept would force the creation of intermediaries where they do not exist for tax reporting purposes, a concept that the Treasury Department is now attempting to enshrine in the United States (see November 2023 comment letter on the IRS’s proposed “broker” rulemaking).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Legislative Advocacy</em></p>\n<p>The past year has yielded some fruit in the industry’s push for crypto-specific legislation, but legislation is still a few years out, in our view. In July, The House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) voted, with bipartisan support, to advance the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/20/us-house-republicans-introduce-crypto-oversight-bill-to-protect-investors/\">Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act</a>, a bill that would create a regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S. That same month, the HFSC advanced a bill to establish a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4766/BILLS-118hr4766ih.pdf\">federal regulatory regime</a> for stablecoins.</p>\n<p>More recently, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce passed the <a href=\"https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/H_R_Deploying_American_Blockchains_Act_Reps_Bucshon_and_Blunt_Rochester_e4ce972799.pdf\">Deploying American Blockchains Act</a> (by a 46-0 margin), which would direct the chief of the Department of Commerce “to promote the competitiveness of the United States related to the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology.” While these bills are not perfect, we’re pleased that Congress has taken a serious approach to these matters.</p>\n<p>There’s another factor that gives us hope for the long-term chances of good legislation passing both chambers. And that is the willingness of Congressional offices and policymakers to engage with DEF and learn about the foundational aspects of the technology. We do “DeFi Demos” on Capitol Hill and advocate for policies welcoming of DeFi and DAOs. We explain why we believe in DeFi and why government officials and elected representatives should be just as curious as we are as to how this technology can improve the lives of their constituents. Away from sensational media headlines and televised hearings, one can see that a better, more open future for DeFi is developing.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we’ve provided a perspective from DeFi’s corner on the following federal legislation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>H.R. 1122, CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act</li>\n<li>H.R. 1177/S. 427, Financial Freedom Act of 2023</li>\n<li>H.R. 1414.

In Q2, Sei v2 will go live on mainnet, and we believe that it’s prudent for the DAO to introduce Uniswap to the parallelized EVM space.</p>\n<p>Sei v2 introduces optimistic parallelization, enabling concurrent txn processing, thereby enhancing throughput and reducing fees. This, coupled with an optimized database, SeiDB, ensures that Sei can support high-volume applications without compromising speed or efficiency. Since Uniswap is yet to be tested in an alternative execution environment, it’s worth exploring how this deployment will affect the DEX’s usage and performance. No alterations to the Uniswap contracts will have to be made for this deployment as Sei v2 brings byte-code EVM compatibility–this mitigates concerns around security.</p>\n<p>Sei Foundation has committed up to $1M of liquidity for bootstrapping Uniswap-specific pools (see “Liquidity Bootstrapping and Incentives” below), with a firm plan of introducing $400k across three initial pools on day-one of the deployment. The other $600k will be split into 2 tranches of $300k. Each tranche will be deployed on a quarterly basis, depending upon Uniswap’s activity from the previous quarter. Sustained growth on Sei means that we will receive more liquidity.

The EVM and Cosmwasm contracts will be composable, able to communicate with one another, preventing liquidity and user fragmentation. Tooling for EVM-based dapps will also remain familiar, requiring no changes to RPC, wallet, and dev tooling setups.</p>\n<p>Uniswap has previously discussed potential deployments on alternative VMs, however, these conversations have so far fizzled out due to the complexity of rewriting the existing Uniswap contracts. For instance, a proposal was created to <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-starknet/19938\">deploy Uniswap on StarkNet</a>, but to carry this through, the Uniswap code would need to be transpiled from Solidity to Cairo. Such a move is subject to security issues, which the DAO has currently elected not to contend with. The parallelized EVM environment is now introducing an opportunity for Uniswap to explore a “different” VM without rewriting the v3 contracts.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/6e7efb941bd3b51a0c015d1d243f10636684eba8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fLuA1kpdQCCluOMpPlYvDMX1HS0.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/6e7efb941bd3b51a0c015d1d243f10636684eba8_2_690x383.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"fLuA1kpdQCCluOMpPlYvDMX1HS0\" width=\"690\" height=\"383\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/6e7efb941bd3b51a0c015d1d243f10636684eba8_2_690x383.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/6e7efb941bd3b51a0c015d1d243f10636684eba8_2_1035x574.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/6e7efb941bd3b51a0c015d1d243f10636684eba8.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"595F61\"></a></div><br>\n<em><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sei Blog</a></strong></em><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"optimistic-parallelization-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#optimistic-parallelization-5\"></a>Optimistic Parallelization</h2>\n<p>To further elaborate on the execution environment, we must highlight Sei’s rollout of optimistic parallelization. By enabling transactions to be processed in parallel rather than sequentially, Sei v2 enables significantly increased throughput and reduced txn fees.

Here’s where we need to mention the concept of state access, which is simply the ability for a txn to read/write to a blockchain’s state. State access plays a vital role in the efficiency and reliability of a blockchain when considering different approaches to parallelization—optimistic and deterministic. Although both parallelization strategies aim to scale blockchains via higher throughput, their methodologies for handling state access significantly influence their performance, security, and complexity.</p>\n<p>Sei v2 utilizes optimistic parallelization, where transactions are processed in parallel under the assumption that they will not conflict or interfere with each other’s state changes. This approach optimistically assumes that concurrent transactions can access and modify the blockchain state without creating inconsistencies. If conflict arises, then sequential re-execution of the txns is needed. Deterministic execution requires developers to assign the parts of state that can be accessed, but these assignments require more developer overhead. Hence, for Uniswap, it’s comparatively easier to deploy on an optimistically parallelized chain.</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://forum.sei.io/t/optimistic-concurrency-control/28?ref=blog.sei.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this page</a> to learn more about how Sei addresses conflict resolution via Optimistic Concurrency Control.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"seidb-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#seidb-6\"></a>SeiDB</h2>\n<p>More txns also means more problems, specifically around state management. If a blockchain cannot effectively manage high throughput at the state/storage level, it encounters another bottleneck. This undermines the advantages initially gained from employing a parallel execution environment.</p>\n<p>That’s where SeiDB comes in.</p>\n<p>Sei Labs has redesigned their database for high-performance storage, making sure that information is organized, stored, and accessed efficiently.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/1/1a5f86a08d574302888ddddc2eaf25e9bae25a4d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3Lj4NUKv8bKQSsaoKDkt0p9d2QB.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1a5f86a08d574302888ddddc2eaf25e9bae25a4d_2_432x375.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"3Lj4NUKv8bKQSsaoKDkt0p9d2QB\" width=\"432\" height=\"375\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1a5f86a08d574302888ddddc2eaf25e9bae25a4d_2_432x375.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1a5f86a08d574302888ddddc2eaf25e9bae25a4d_2_648x562.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1a5f86a08d574302888ddddc2eaf25e9bae25a4d_2_864x750.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"171816\"></a></div><br>\n<em><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://x.com/rhinostake/status/1750738751729393735?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@rhinostake on X</a></strong></em><p></p>\n<p>Operationally, efficiency and performance is achieved by separating state store (SS) and state commit (SC). This bifurcation is designed to optimize Sei for two requirements: handling vast historical data and processing new transactions efficiently.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>SS pertains to historical data. By organizing data as raw key values while minimizing unnecessary metadata, SeiDB ensures that historical records–encompassing txns, state changes, and other relevant data–are stored in a compact and accessible manner. This makes it easier to conduct auditing, transaction verification, and node synchronization. Such storage efficiency helps mitigate potential issues related to state bloat, ensuring that Sei remains scalable and efficient as it grows, not falling subject to diminishing performance from scale.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SC deals with the processing and validating of new transactions by performing state changes in-memory and streamlining access to the most recent state information. This way, SeiDB reduces the need for intensive Input/Output operations, enabling faster transaction validation and commitment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above architecture positions Sei in a place to aptly deal with high-volume applications.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-sei-ecosystem-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#the-sei-ecosystem-7\"></a>The Sei Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>Sei v2’s efficient design is meant to introduce an influx of applications that have not been previously possible due to the limited EVM design space. SVM and MoveVM chains will act as the direct architectural competitors to Sei going forward since they’ve been able to introduce unique applications like onchain order books. More parallelized EVMs will invariably be introduced in the coming months as well. Solana also has a parallelized EVM L2 called Neon, which has so far gained very little traction. This puts Sei in a strong position because it, ideally, enables high-throughput applications while simultaneously bringing forward a familiar developer environment.</p>\n<p>In the past few months, activity on the current Sei network has increased significantly, with organic growth around community-based NFT projects like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seiyansnft?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Seiyans</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheColonyNFT__\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Colony</a>.

There has only been one instance of a deployment proposal that did not pass the off-chain stage due to not meeting quorum: <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0x98e08d94e1174b0bfa2350c616d3cf2fb8f5e56c56c03dc0ae58fd29a6b29265\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Fantom</a>. We believe that this sets a precedent for optimistically acknowledging incoming EVM-based deployments as canonical. The same precedent can be set for v2 since there was a recent proposal to <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/58\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">deploy v2 across all target chains with v3</a> in one fell swoop.</p>\n<p>The v3-deployments.uniswap.eth &amp; v2deployments.uniswap.eth ENS subdomains act simply as records of the v3/v2 deployments that the DAO has “blessed”. From a legal as well as technical perspective, alterations to the subdomain don’t hold any weight–it’s merely a place onchain that the DAO can recognize v3/v2 deployments across various EVM chains. This way, there’s a public place to keep track of which deployments are official. Such recognition is important because it allows users and developers to ensure that the contracts they’re interacting with are representative of the real Uniswap (i.e. the Uniswap fork that has been approved by the DAO), thereby ensuring security and consistency across each fork.</p>\n<p>When the DAO currently approves deployments onchain, only the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth &amp; v2deployments.uniswap.eth text records are being altered.

To address the treasury’s volatility and underutilization, we propose forming the Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) to explore treasury management strategies aimed at achieving sustainability and growth for the DAO. This involves diversifying assets to stabilize the treasury and finding revenue-generating investments beyond the protocol’s core operations. The UTWG will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO based on 8 weeks of research and interviews with various entities and individuals familiar with treasury management and adjacent subject matters. A deliverable will correspondingly be released on the forum where we present at least two viable treasury management options for the DAO to begin pursuing. Both of these options will be presented as their individual RFC/RFP, ideally allowing treasury managers to present their products and services to the DAO. The UTWG will help facilitate this process.</p>\n<p>The proposal’s ultimate goal is to ensure the DAO’s long-term financial health and support the sustenance of Uniswap. However, there is one caveat–before implementing any of the proposed strategies, in other words, before moving any $UNI to and from the treasury, we must have clarity around the legal implications of administering this program. There has to be a way to pay taxes and limit liability. We hope that a simultaneous discussion around, say, DUNA, or other legal frameworks, takes place. It seems unlikely that the DAO will be able to conduct treasury management if it doesn’t open itself up to adopting a legal architecture. Our hope is that while the Foundation and potentially another working group sort out the legal side, we are able to make some strides on treasury management research. Upon adoption of a legal entity, we can then hit the ground running by actually implementing the conclusions derived from the UTWG’s research.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"treating-the-uniswap-treasury-as-an-endowment-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#treating-the-uniswap-treasury-as-an-endowment-2\"></a>Treating the Uniswap Treasury as an Endowment</h2>\n<p>“Treasury” is a broad term that typically mirrors the nature of its underlying protocol. Some treasuries quite literally reflect a protocol’s balance sheet, where the holdings are used to cover capital expenditures, and income is either paid out as a dividend to token holders or used to further grow the protocol. Other treasuries are integral in managing risk, with Aave and Compound being prime examples. Then, some treasuries, like that of Uniswap, are structured more similarly to an endowment, where the DAO must manage a large pool of capital to further the sustenance of the protocol in the long-term.</p>\n<p>The concept of an endowment refers to a collective pool of assets held by a nonprofit institution. These assets are employed to support an institution perpetually, with a clear directive of aligning with the desires of the contributing donor(s). In Uniswap’s case, the DAO was established upon the creation of the $UNI token–and 43% of the total supply was endowed to the DAO.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/76000bea555babf3a291c78f45d60ff388183708.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gPSrm6ogenfWtXlnSvrMVNgnzcI.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/76000bea555babf3a291c78f45d60ff388183708_2_690x445.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gPSrm6ogenfWtXlnSvrMVNgnzcI\" width=\"690\" height=\"445\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/76000bea555babf3a291c78f45d60ff388183708_2_690x445.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/76000bea555babf3a291c78f45d60ff388183708_2_1035x667.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/76000bea555babf3a291c78f45d60ff388183708.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DCAFD2\"></a></div><br>\n<em><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://blog.uniswap.org/uni\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap Labs</a></strong></em><p></p>\n<p>The goal of the DAO is to support Uniswap’s growth and development in a manner that aligns with the collective vision of the token holders and their entrusted cohort of delegates.

As of today, Uniswap’s treasury boasts nearly ~$6B of assets, larger than any other DeFi protocol. That number, however, is highly inflated due to the composition of the treasury. Nearly 100% of the treasury is solely composed of one asset: the native $UNI token. Hence, the value of the treasury, in dollar terms, should be massively discounted.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/7dfce21535664fe71e4026a570c2f767339a8fb3.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hYxtYi4xQ3NC0SdLbOUfEtA9Yc3.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/7dfce21535664fe71e4026a570c2f767339a8fb3_2_690x422.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hYxtYi4xQ3NC0SdLbOUfEtA9Yc3\" width=\"690\" height=\"422\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/7dfce21535664fe71e4026a570c2f767339a8fb3_2_690x422.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/7dfce21535664fe71e4026a570c2f767339a8fb3_2_1035x633.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/7dfce21535664fe71e4026a570c2f767339a8fb3.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F8F9\"></a></div><br>\n<em><strong>Source: DeepDAO</strong></em><p></p>\n<p>Imagine if a traditional endowment was allotted billions of dollars in a singular, volatile asset, with a directive of using that treasury to sustain its core business–preposterous, right? That’s exactly the position where Uniswap is. What’s more is that there’s no current plan to mobilize this treasury in a productive manner. There lies a large amount of dormant capital simply sitting in the treasury without any explicit plan to be utilized. From our perspective, there needs to be an initiative to spur this dormant capital into action, even if it means doing so little by little. <em><strong>The goal of this proposal is to create a committee to begin researching ways by which we can put this treasury into effect.</strong></em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-are-we-optimizing-for-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#what-are-we-optimizing-for-4\"></a>What Are We Optimizing For?</h2>\n<p><strong>This proposal optimizes for two variables:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> the DAO should be a self-sustaining entity, able to cover its future costs in perpetuity.</li>\n<li><strong>Growth:</strong> the DAO should utilize its capital to grow its principal $UNI allotment in terms of dollars, thereby further propelling the adoption of Uniswap and delivering value to relevant stakeholders.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sustainability is the bare minimum. It acts as a floor. Unless the $UNI price continues to increase forever, the DAO, whenever it reaches into its treasury reserves, is reducing its runway. Hence, the first objective in any treasury management initiative should be to diversify out of the native token and into a more stable asset, like a basket of stablecoins. One could go as far as stating that any $UNI held in the treasury should actually be written down to zero. This mindset, where <a href=\"https://uncommoncore.co/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">treasury $UNI is effectively treated as an unissued share,</a> should spur us towards diversification.</p>\n<p>Since crypto is prone to fat-tail events, the DAO should establish a more robust cushion in case the market crashes. In 2021, the Uni treasury value ran to nearly $19B, and it quickly fell into a limbo zone between $1.5B - $2B for nearly 1.5 years between Q2 2022 and Q1 2024. No endowment should be this volatile. We should be in a position where if the DAO needs to fund certain initiatives, there are reserves to draw from without causing significant impairment to the token price. For instance, when the Foundation needs to be funded again, it should ideally be the case that a large portion of those requested funds are given in the form of stablecoins for instant liquidity.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/d67aedddfa5e4da2746aa937e8fd07e7b408630c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uBnyiw9MMfCtcwwwqrz3ninSkVK.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d67aedddfa5e4da2746aa937e8fd07e7b408630c_2_690x428.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uBnyiw9MMfCtcwwwqrz3ninSkVK\" width=\"690\" height=\"428\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d67aedddfa5e4da2746aa937e8fd07e7b408630c_2_690x428.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d67aedddfa5e4da2746aa937e8fd07e7b408630c_2_1035x642.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/d67aedddfa5e4da2746aa937e8fd07e7b408630c.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"141725\"></a></div><br>\n<em><strong>Source: TokenTerminal</strong></em><p></p>\n<p>Beyond mere diversification, the DAO needs to pursue growth. Currently there are no programs in place for the treasury to increase its net asset value beyond $UNI appreciation. This is where the treasury can be used to generate revenue, either from operating or non-operating activities. Let’s break this concept down–distinguishing between the operating and non-operating income for the DAO is important for defining the source of treasury growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Operating Income:</strong> Operating income would pertain to any income generated from the primary business activities of the protocol, which, in Uniswap’s case, is fees from swaps. Currently, the DAO does not collect any income from fees and likely won’t in the future under the Uniswap Foundation’s <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936\">recently proposed fee architecture</a>. <em><strong>The Uniswap DAO will therefore not be sustainable in the long-run by relying on income from operations–fees generated will most likely be paid out to token holders in full, leaving the DAO with near zero income. To that end, we must rely on non-operating activities to ensure the sustainability of the Uni DAO.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Non-Operating Income:</strong> All income not generated from fees falls into this category. If the Uniswap DAO does not plan on attaining revenue from operations, then it must utilize its current treasury to collect income via alternative methods–likely through yield-bearing strategies and investments. Reliance on non-operating income further establishes why the Uni treasury mirrors the setup of an endowment, where the long-term sustainability of the protocol is built on indirect investments detached from the protocol’s core operations. <em><strong>These methods are to be further explored, and the present proposal aims to pioneer such exploration.</strong></em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"working-group-details-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#working-group-details-5\"></a>Working Group Details</h2>\n<p>Based on the above reasoning, the UTWG will conduct 8 weeks worth of research into the types of treasury management initiatives that the DAO may reasonably pursue in the short-to-medium term. The group will note on the experience of treasury management practices of other DAOs, adopting practices that have historically worked well and conforming them to Uniswap’s current situation, along with the presentation of new models that we believe are potentially more effective. Considering treasury management has been a key aspect of many prominent DAOs like Maker and Aave to Lido and Gnosis, we believe that there are many case studies and frameworks that can be explored to ensure initial experiments will return positive results.</p>\n<p>The UTWG will also try to collaborate with those working on various legal developments including the recent <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/duna-for-daos/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Wyoming Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) Act</a>. This process may fall outside of the jurisdiction of the treasury committee and may require outsourcing entirely to another party. It’s vital that this treasury research is analyzed in the context of potential legal structures, and we won’t move forward with implementing our research unless there are proper legal frameworks in place. The Uniswap DAO has yet to formalize its opinions on how to set up legal entities, so this caveat may delay the implementation of the proposed treasury initiatives. The UTWG’s research may conclude that a legal working group should work in concert with the treasury group to effectively bring this program to fruition.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to emphasize that the deliverables of the UTWG will aim to highlight potential treasury management options rather than pinpointing specific service providers. If the committee comes to the conclusion that an RFP process is the ideal manner by which treasury managers should be appointed, for example, then one of the UTWG deliverables will be a call to action for various service providers. After ample discussion in the forum, the most promising service providers will qualify for a vote of confidence from the DAO. The elected members will then collaborate with the UTWG to implement a proposed treasury management initiative–granted a legal framework is in place. At this point, the working group will act as the liaison between the DAO and the service providers, ensuring proper accountability and transparency for the sake of the DAO.</p>\n<p>Note that it’s too early in the research process to conclude the exact operations of the treasury initiatives–the above paragraph simply outlines a potential order of operations, which is subject to change based on our research. <em><strong>Our goal is to simply present the DAO with an assortment of options, backed by interviews and research.</strong></em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-uniswap-treasury-working-group-members-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#the-uniswap-treasury-working-group-members-6\"></a>The Uniswap Treasury Working Group Members</h3>\n<p>The UTWG will be composed of four members. 2/4 members are listed below and are a part of working group zero (WG0).</p>\n<p><strong>StableLab</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>StableLab is a governance firm focused on professional delegation, DAO framework design, and product development.

This thread is meant to capture more community sentiment around this.</p>\n<p><strong>Within this thread, we have 2 objectives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1. Inform you on runway extension:</strong> Operationally, the UAGP swapped our treasury ARB to USD to secure runway and mitigate currency risk impacting our ability to fund projects.</li>\n<li><strong>2. Align with you on program extension:</strong> With our extended runway, we propose to extend the core program to a maximum of 3 more months.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"topic-1-arb-to-usdc-swap-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#topic-1-arb-to-usdc-swap-3\"></a>Topic 1: ARB to USDC Swap</h1>\n<p>Off the back of discussions at GovSwap and aligning internally, the UAGP committee has decided to secure our program’s runway by converting a large proportion of the ARB in our treasury to USD to hedge against currency risk with ARB price fluctuations.</p>\n<p><strong>Key reasons for the decision are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our guiding objective for the UAGP is to enable builders to build, and provide value, for the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As such, we made the decision to swap a large portion of the ARB in our treasury to USDC, extending our runway and enabling us to fund almost twice as many projects as initially budgeted for at inception. This decision was made after initial discussions with delegates in Denver and after careful consideration of the potential impact of price volatility stemming from systemic risk and resulting from specific events (eg. ARB token unlocks).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Transaction in detail:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>On February 29th, we swapped 599k ARB within our treasury to USDC, which was executed at around ~$2/token, amounting to 1.195m USDC.</li>\n<li>All in all, a slippage of 0.25%, of which effectively the slippage was 0.17% and the rest was just price fluctuation/spread/others.</li>\n<li>See the discussed transaction here: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xa15eb0dda7189e1e46e920e833a4da4373f66ac05b1d25b4c793f64c636b61dd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xa15eb0dda7189e1e46e920e833a4da4373f66ac05b1d25b4c793f64c636b61dd</a></li>\n<li>A portion representing &lt;15% of our initial ARB allocation remains in the treasury to cover continued operational expenses of the UAGP committee and allow for potential program extension in the future (details below).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the price of ARB around the time of the UAGP’s inception, the program was allocated roughly ~$1.1m in USDC terms to direct towards funding projects that fit within our scope of core objectives. From that period, ARB token price has nearly doubled and our treasury has increased to ~$1.8m in USD terms (excl. amounts already paid out).</p>\n<h1><a name=\"topic-2-extension-of-the-uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#topic-2-extension-of-the-uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-4\"></a>Topic 2: Extension of the Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program</h1>\n<p><strong>Proposed extension</strong></p>\n<p>As described previously, the positive price action of ARB and our decision to secure our coffers has enabled us to fund almost 2x as many projects as initially anticipated.</p>\n<p>The increase in projects funded brings with them an extended period of assessment and tracking required, and as such:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’d like to extend the UAGP operation for up to a maximum additional 3 months depending on the quality of inbound applications (extending from ending in April ‘24 to July ‘24)</li>\n<li>Similarly, we want to block budget for an additional 6 months at 20% of full capacity for milestone-tracking and reporting, should that be necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to note that an increase in funding capacity does not necessarily equate to a proportional increase in program length due to the benefit of having already initiated and established a well-running program. More simply, the doubling in runway does not require a doubling in operational time/costs, given the biggest chunk of set-up costs and momentum creation has already been done.</p>\n<p><strong>UAGP Financial Overview</strong></p>\n<p>The UAGP has been operating for 4 months, and in that period has accepted 7 projects out of 93 applications. This resulted in reserving 586k UDSC to accepted projects to pay-out via milestones (103k USDC already paid out).</p>\n<p>Given the first month of operation was largely process initiation and set-up, we’ve averaged a rate of assessing ~31 applications per month and funded the selected ones with an average grant size of ~84k USDC.</p>\n<p>We plan to cease the committee’s operations once the final funds are distributed, or at that juncture, reassess and potentially request additional funding from Arbitrum based on the community’s perception of the program’s success.</p>\n<p><strong>What does that mean in practice?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Considering the remaining unallocated ~998k USDC in our treasury, we are now in the position to be able to fund a larger number of projects with an extension of the program, while maintaining the current assessment speed, we propose and extension for 3 months for all subsequent projects. This of course is not set in stone and will be educated by the quality level of applications.</li>\n<li>For the continuation of the operational management, we aim to reserve a maximum amount 109k ARB for the committee. This amount would be spent if all committee members would stay on board for another 3 months and work the maximum amount of hours (78k ARB), and includes another 6 months term to stay on with reduced capacity of 20% (31k ARB). We have been paid 100 ARB/hr since the beginning of the program bearing the up and down side for incentive alignment.</li>\n<li>In reality, as described above, we hope to meet the finalization of the program earlier and with less capacity needed considering our existing momentum and the rate of deal inflow we presently see.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Upon completion</strong></p>\n<p>When the UAGP committee is moving to an end we will either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pathway A:</strong> Propose extending the program and request additional funding from Arbitrum, provided the committee desires to proceed and the community views the initiative as successful.</li>\n<li><strong>Pathway B:</strong> Close down operation of the full committee and maintain a minimal capacity (20%) to see through tracking and reporting of existing Grants with a longer timeline, reporting at predefined periods to the DAO. In case this option is taken and there are excess funds (likely scenario) in the treasury, these funds will be sent back to the Uniswap Treasury / Airdrop contract, and the DAO can decide how to allocate those funds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-and-next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#timeline-and-next-steps-5\"></a>Timeline and Next Steps</h1>\n<p>We aim to provide ample time for feedback and discussion. While we have done significant pre-discussion on the ground in Denver we appreciate the importance of getting a wider consensus on this and your input, whether it’s voicing concerns, posing questions, or simply agreeing, would be valuable for our decision-making on topic 2.</p>\n<p>We plan to keep this discussion open for two weeks.

This means $UNI token holders can leverage their holdings to engage in strategic trades and potentially increase their returns.</p>\n<p>Revolutionary Interest Rate Model: The new interest rate model dynamically adjusts rates to maintain optimal utilization, maximising lender revenue and minimising borrower costs. This model benefits $UNI token holders by potentially offering higher yields on their deposits.</p>\n<p>Repay Using Collateral: V2 allows users to repay loans and margin trade positions using the position’s collateral. This feature provides flexibility for $UNI token holders, enabling them to manage their investments more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Expanded Asset Availability: Fringe Finance V2 supports a wide range of assets across multiple chains, including $UNI on the Ethereum network. This broad asset support, combined with features like multi-asset lending and integration of advanced price feeds, opens up new avenues for $UNI token holders to diversify their DeFi activities and enhance their earning potential.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"incentive-program-a-catalyst-for-lender-profits-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#incentive-program-a-catalyst-for-lender-profits-2\"></a>Incentive Program: A Catalyst for Lender Profits</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/18QKcLgEMU60sjjCCtJMdtkmKe4.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"18QKcLgEMU60sjjCCtJMdtkmKe4\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"6A694B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This program directly rewards lenders for their deposits, creating a cycle that benefits all participants in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The incentive program is structured around five lender Total Value Locked (TVL) milestones, with rewards issued as each target is met and sustained.</p>\n<p>The rewards, issued in FRIN tokens, are calculated based on the proportion of interest earned by a lender’s deposits relative to the total interest earned on the platform.
