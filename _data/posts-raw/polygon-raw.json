The bottom 40 validators (by total staked) control only %1 voting power.  Creating a partially shared staking mechanism, shared by all validators with a mechanism to consistently raise the overall stake of the lower half of the validator set, will disburse voting power throughout the validator set thus reducing risks of centralization.</p>\n<p>Additionally, creating a partially shared staking model will allow the entirety of the validator set to receive rewards which will continually offset operational costs and incentivize performance for the entirety of the validator set. This proposal outlines the considerations for such a shared staking model.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>Motivations for creating a partially-shared staking model within the Polygon PoS network are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Work toward a more equitable voting power distribution amongst the validator set and create a rewards model whereby the entirety of the validator set can see a reward share which will guarantee an offset of operational costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Benefit the validators who have successfully amassed large retail stakes and benefit the entirety of the validator group who also contribute to the success of the network.<br>\nIncentivize all validators to meet network performance thresholds to participate in the shared stake awards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Decrease Stake Centralization: Partial distribution of stake works toward a gradual leveling of voting power and block production.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Drive Network Performance levels of the validator set by Incentivizing validators in the lower bounds of staking hierarchy via shared stake awards.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Specification</strong></p>\n<p>Newly staked MATIC/POL tokens will be staked to the designated validator as chosen by the delegator with %20 of the amount being shared and staked within the validator set in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Half of the %20 split will be shared evenly amongst all other validators and applied toward their overall stake.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Half of the %20 split will be shared evenly amongst the bottom 50 validators (by total stake at the current checkpoint) and applied to their overall stake.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>The proposed partial distribution model will be applicable <strong>ONLY</strong> to newly staked MATIC/POL tokens and to tokens being UNSTAKED and RESTAKED to a different validator within the network.</strong></em></p>\n<p>All Validators will retain all of their current stake at the time of implementation.</p>\n<p>To incentivize performance from all validators, only those in top standing will receive shared stake.  Even validators within grace periods will not qualify for the shared stake awards.</p>\n<p>Once validators return to top performing levels above the benchmark, they may receive their portion of the shared stake.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>Gradual increase of the total staked amounts of the lower half of the validator set, without changing the current overall stakes of the validators, offers several advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Does not affect validators current rewards expectations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Raises the floor of overall stake for the bottom half of the validator set over time and constantly pushes those validators in the lower half toward the median.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gradually evens out voting power amongst the middle of the validator set.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Backwards Compatibility</strong></p>\n<p>The shared staking model will not need to be backwards compatible as it is intended to be applicable for newly staked or unstaked and restaked MATIC/POL. Existing validators and network operations should not be affected by the implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Cases</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure the success of the shared staking model implementation, the following test cases will be conducted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Performance Testing: Evaluate the development of smart contracts required to affect the shared staking model and monitor the network’s ability to handle same, focusing on transaction processing times, block generation, and overall output.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stability Testing: Monitor the network for any signs of instability or degradation in performance following the implementation of the shared staking model.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Security Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Security remains a top priority during the execution of smart contracts or the staking UI.  Security measures will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Enhanced monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to any abnormal activity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Suggested implementation of best practices for validator operations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“The best outcome will come from the individuals doing what’s best for themselves and for the group.”</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pos-shared-staking-model-polygon-2-0-feedback-requested/17900\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pos-shared-staking-model-polygon-2-0-feedback-requested/17900","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 18:04:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-17900"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pos-shared-staking-model-polygon-2-0-feedback-requested/17900.rss","#text":"PoS Shared Staking Model, Polygon 2.0 (Feedback Requested)"}},{"title":"Hello everyone please welcome me","dc:creator":"pepefanatic","category":"Introduce Yourself","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8523e7cbf66adc77983157acac043f7a80d4245c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/8523e7cbf66adc77983157acac043f7a80d4245c\" title=\"dV22vtuYfO8Muhd4YTgY--1--vvu36\"><img src=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8523e7cbf66adc77983157acac043f7a80d4245c.jpeg\" alt=\"dV22vtuYfO8Muhd4YTgY--1--vvu36\" data-base62-sha1=\"iZOqHqZwaRVFl4ttGbVT3O5f4D2\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-dominant-color=\"8F7E72\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Hello everyone this is Erfu, a big fan of PEPE!

We propose a refactoring that will upgrade such dependency to target version <code>v0.50.x</code> .</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The primary motivation for such an upgrade is to solve a tech debt that anchors Heimdall to a <code>cosmos-sdk</code> version released around four years ago, at the time of the launch of the Polygon PoS network. Despite the continuous upgrades made throughout these years, the upgrade to <code>cosmos-sdk</code> will be beneficial for the PoS network for many technical factors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>The new <code>cosmos-sdk</code> version will come with a set of new features that Heimdall can leverage. Amongst them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A new application layer with a brand new set of functionalities, which can be leveraged by the Polygon PoS network.</li>\n<li>New modules —considered the core of the <code>cosmos-sdk</code> applications— that will enhance the user experience of PoS users.</li>\n<li>The architecture is very simplified and more robust, and the composition of modules has been enhanced to provide different services (e.g. <code>protobuf</code> services, <code>gRPC</code> query services, <code>autocli</code>, new REST routes).</li>\n<li>The new <code>cosmos-sdk</code> fully leverages the capabilities of <code>cometBFT</code>’s ABCI++, enhancing transactions and blocks executions.</li>\n<li>The upgrade to a more recent version will allow more frequent upstream merges, which means more functionalities to leverage and a higher level of security.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The upgrade process will be possible via a <code>cosmos-sdk</code> based hard fork. This is not a synonym of a PoS HF (or, generally speaking, a EVM-based HF). Specifically, the whole network (validators, non-validating full nodes, seed nodes, light nodes, etc) is stopped in a coordinated fashion at a particular height that has previously been agreed upon.</p>\n<p>Since the whole network stops at the same height, the application’s database has the same content across all nodes. Once the network has halted on the predetermined height, the application’s database (an IAVL tree) is exported into a file in JSON format. The resulting JSON file, which should be exactly the same at all nodes in the network (the file’s checksum can be used to verify this), is used as the initial application’s state in a new genesis file. This genesis file is then used to spawn the generation of a new chain (different chain ID). Before the new chain is started, the JSON file has to undergo some sanity checks and needs to be adapted to be compatible with the new version of the <code>cosmos-sdk</code>.</p>\n<p>The advantages of a hard fork (compared to a mere DB migration) are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less complex and error-prone, since there’s no need to:\n<ul>\n<li>migrate DBs (except for the adaptations that may need to be done on the exported JSON file).</li>\n<li>translate blocks, or solve block format compatibility.</li>\n<li>deal with any database at <code>CometBFT</code> level: the new chain starts with a “clean slate” <code>CometBFT</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Not going off the beaten path:\n<ul>\n<li>not a purely theoretical approach, but one that has been proven to work on the field, as this has been executed by <code>cosmos-sdk</code> chains several times, going from cosmos hub version 1 (used at time of PoS creation) to version 4 (current version).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Less effort to adapt the data, since:\n<ul>\n<li>only the application’s database may need to be adapted</li>\n<li><code>CometBFT</code> databases are not migrated</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are drawbacks of a hard fork which are summarised below and discussed in more detail under security considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The system needs to halt for several hours.\n<ul>\n<li>From the moment the old chain is halted until the new one starts, the Heimdall application is effectively down.</li>\n<li>The duration of the downtime depends on the actions that need to be performed before the new chain can be started.</li>\n<li>Such duration heavily depends on the size of the application’s database, and the sanity checks to run (e.g. in case of the <code>cosmos-sdk</code> Stargate upgrade, the outage lasted around 6 hours)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Other applications (and possibly smart contracts) that depend on the old chain (e.g. bor) need to make provisions\n<ul>\n<li>To support or absorb the downtime, and</li>\n<li>To change to the new chain when the new chain is up.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If the application needs to access data both before and after the migration, it will be more complex.\n<ul>\n<li>Both chains need to be up; the old one halted, acting as archive.</li>\n<li>The application needs to use the migration height to route queries to the right chain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The history previous to the migration point is lost.\n<ul>\n<li>Block data, validators’ data, old versions of key-value pairs stored in the application’s DB.</li>\n<li>Inability to query a node (<code>CometBFT</code> RPC, or <code>cosmos-sdk</code> gRPC) for data prior to the hard fork.\n<ul>\n<li>As a workaround, the community may agree to keep a few nodes, called Heimdall-archive-nodes, serving RPC requests for the old chain’s data.</li>\n<li>These are full nodes running the old software, using the old databases, but no validator is started, so the (old) chain stays halted.</li>\n<li>Notice that those archive nodes represent a distinct chain (using a different chain ID) and therefore don’t communicate with nodes of the new chain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed solution - which relies on other upgrades, involves several steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Completion of migration from <code>peppermint</code> to <code>cometBFT</code></li>\n<li>Embedding <code>cometBFT</code> into the new Heimdall application</li>\n<li>Rewriting of Heimdall modules based on <code>cosmos-sdk v0.50.x</code></li>\n<li>Test the standalone application locally</li>\n<li>Audit the code</li>\n<li>Adapt Bor to work with the new Heimdall</li>\n<li>Modify the PoS testing tools</li>\n<li>Release of a <code>beta</code> version</li>\n<li>Simulate the migration on devnets</li>\n<li>Execute the coordinated upgrade on testnets (Mumbai and Amoy)</li>\n<li>Execute a coordinated upgrade for mainnet</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"backward-compatibility-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#backward-compatibility-5\"></a>Backward Compatibility</h3>\n<p>The upgrade is incompatible with the current Heimdall chain. This means that launching a newer version of <code>cosmos-sdk</code> within Polygon PoS will only be possible by migrating Heimdall to a brand new chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"security-considerations-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#security-considerations-6\"></a>Security Considerations</h3>\n<p>The upgrade involves a complete refactoring of the Heimdall codebase. Hence, Heimdall will undergo a meticulous phase of tests, audits, and performance reviews. Despite the many new functionalities offered by the new library, this migration will be—at first—a 1:1 migration, keeping intact the Heimdall capabilities and utilities.</p>\n<p>During the migration process, the generation of the new genesis file is a delicate moment. The file is an unencrypted JSON file, so considerations are to be made to mitigate any risks, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create migration-time estimates on a backup of the live data</li>\n<li>Rehearse in advance the whole process in a testnet to ensure validators and operators are prepared</li>\n<li>Publish in advance and audit all the tools (scripts, steps to follow, commands to run, etc.) that node operators need to use in order to generate the genesis file by themselves</li>\n<li>Encourage all node operators to generate the genesis file on their own</li>\n<li>Publish a “ceremonial” checksum of the genesis file so that those operators that produce the genesis file by themselves can check whether their file contents match the “official” hash</li>\n<li>In case of a large number of operators obtaining conflicting hashes, a mechanism should be in place to investigate what is causing the hash mismatch (whether a tampering attempt or just a bug in the tools for generating the genesis file)</li>\n<li>These last two points are crucial, as all <code>CometBFT</code> full nodes (validators included) must start a new chain from an exact same copy of the genesis file. Otherwise, the first block of the chain will run into an <code>app_hash</code> mismatch at proposal time.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-upgrade-cosmos-sdk-in-heimdall/17732\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-upgrade-cosmos-sdk-in-heimdall/17732","pubDate":"Thu, 27 Jun 2024 13:14:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-17732"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-upgrade-cosmos-sdk-in-heimdall/17732.rss","#text":"PIP:-44: Upgrade cosmos-sdk in Heimdall"}},{"title":"PIP-43: Replace tendermint with cometBFT in Heimdall","dc:creator":"marcell033","category":"Canonical PIPs","description":"<p>Authors: <a href=\"https://github.com/marcello33\">Marcello Ardizzone </a></p>\n<p>Type: Core</p>\n<h2><a name=\"table-of-contents-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#table-of-contents-1\"></a>Table of Contents:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract</li>\n<li>Motivation</li>\n<li>Rationale</li>\n<li>Specification</li>\n<li>Backward Compatibility</li>\n<li>Security considerations</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h3>\n<p>Currently, Heimdall uses a fork of <code>tendermint</code> (called <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint\"><code>peppermint</code></a>). The fork, which has been modified to support Polygon PoS specific needs, is based off version <code>v0.32.7</code>.<br>\nThe refactoring required replaces <code>peppermint</code> with the newer library called <code>cometBFT</code>, which will target version <code>v0.38.x</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The primary motivation for this proposed upgrade is to remove tech debt that anchors <code>Heimdall</code> to a <code>Tendermint</code> version that was released around four years ago and is outdated. Despite the continuous upgrades made throughout these years to <code>Peppermint</code>, the upgrade to <code>CometBFT</code> will be beneficial for the PoS network for many technical factors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p><code>cometBFT</code> will come with several new features. The main amongst them include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A new application blockchain interface, called ABCI++, that introduces new methods and types, more flexibility in transactions execution, and a two-phase commit process. Moreover, the blocks execution process is more flexible compared to the linear process of ABCI. Amongst the others, it also introduces advanced functionalities in term of state sync capabilities, allowing for faster and more efficient synchronization.</li>\n<li>ABCI++ also comes with a brand new feature, called Vote Extensions. Such functionality will replace the concept of Side Transactions in Heimdall, which was the main driver for forking <code>tendermint</code>. Side transactions are Heimdall transactions whose data comes from external sources (eg: <code>checkpoint</code> txs contain root hash of Bor chain blocks, <code>stateSync</code> txs contain event data from L1 Ethereum). Hence, the data in side transactions needs to be verified by the validators on Heimdall. A <code>VoteExtension</code> is just an arbitrary sequence of bytes that gets added to the block precommit.

The authors recommend this by upgrading the PoS Stake Manager Contract (0x5e3Ef299fDDf15eAa0432E6e66473ace8c13D908) to a new implementation at (address to be determined) that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Converts all the MATIC in the Stake Manager to POL</li>\n<li>Uses POL for all new staking and unstaking requests</li>\n<li>Has legacy functions that allow for staking and unstaking using MATIC by leveraging the POL Migration Contract (0x29e7DF7b6A1B2b07b731457f499E1696c60E2C4e) to preserve maximum backward compatibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposed upgrade will not change any contracts on the Polygon PoS Network.

Now that POL (0x455e53CBB86018Ac2B8092FdCd39d8444aFFC3F6) is live, the authors propose setting it as the staking token of the network via an upgrade of the Stake Manager in a maximally backward compatible manner.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-7\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>Upgrade the Stake Manager contract to a new implementation at &lt; address to be determined &gt;.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"backward-compatibility-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#backward-compatibility-8\"></a>Backward Compatibility</h3>\n<p>Systems that expect to stake and unstake MATIC from the PoS Staking system will be affected unless they move to using the new legacy functions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"security-considerations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#security-considerations-9\"></a>Security Considerations</h3>\n<p>This upgrade adjusts a core contract of the Polygon PoS network.
