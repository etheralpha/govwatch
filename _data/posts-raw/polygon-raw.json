Note that this is different from state pruning, which prunes unused/inactive state from the db. The aim is to remove historical block data (headers, body, and receipts) from the freezer database as they are no longer used for chain verification. This also means that your node will no longer be able to serve RPC queries for those blocks (RPC operators shouldn’t ideally use this).</p>\n<p>It is available as a sub-command <code>bor snapshot prune-block [options...]</code> and the number of blocks to keep (post pruning) is configurable via <code>block-amount-reserved</code> flag. More details and usage info can be found in the PR itself (<a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/pull/1216\">https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/pull/1216</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Important points to note</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This version is backwards in-compatible if pruning is performed (at least once) on the node.</li>\n<li>This feature is only enabled in <code>hash</code> based storage scheme for now and won’t work for <code>path</code> based scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Huge shout-out to <a href=\"https://github.com/jsvisa\">@jsvisa</a> who initiated the efforts and did

path of Validator Admissions into the network. This proposal outlines an admissions framework that includes a set of objective parameters to determine a prospective validator’s eligibility to validate the PoS network.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>A healthy network requires healthy validators/operators. The aim of a validator admission process is to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>ensure a competent set of validators on PoS with greater transparency and community input on validator admissions, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ensure network security, reliability and uptime.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having a quantitative, objective process in place will ensure that those who are becoming part of the network are experienced and able to participate at a high rate of adherence to on-chain operations.</p>\n<p>A large, mature and widely used network like the PoS chain, requires quality validators who uphold reliability and performance to meet the demands of the industry in which they operate.</p>\n<p>The proposed admissions process assists in providing the network with a framework to evaluate potential validators who request to join the PoS network. This process scores and ranks applicants based on the evaluation criteria described in the specification.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-6\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>In accordance with PIP-4, a scoring system that will rank validator applicants is proposed, allowing only the highest-scoring candidates to be selected for onboarding to the network.</p>\n<p>To define the scoring system, identified below are characteristics of validators that correlate with high performance; utilizing a number of heuristics based on the correlation matrix.</p>\n<p>The scoring is composed of the three following factors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>MATIC stake to provide enhanced network security.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Experience</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Number of years operating a validating node on a PoS network.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Expertise</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Validator operators score on an assessment test.</p>\n<p>The correlation matrix below shows a moderately positive correlation between PoS validator experience and performance. In other words, validators with more experience tend to perform better.</p>\n<p>Based on these findings, adjustments were made to the scoring logic used to evaluate the prospective validators. These adjustments ensured a fair and accurate performance assessment, considering their experience and expertise.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that while experience was found to have a high correlation with performance, stake and expertise also played significant roles in determining a validator’s effectiveness. Therefore, a holistic approach was taken to consider multiple factors in the scoring logic adjustments.</p>\n<p>Using the insights gained from this survey, the evaluation process was improved, and informed decisions regarding the validators’ contributions and rewards can continue to be made.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b3113b6d00331fbbd15cf84293c4a1721fc7f186.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/b3113b6d00331fbbd15cf84293c4a1721fc7f186\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b3113b6d00331fbbd15cf84293c4a1721fc7f186.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"py6nZb12XjXp15qJmUwKxcsqQoS\" width=\"624\" height=\"221\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"2C2148\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to quantify the relationship between performance and experience for Polygon PoS’s current validators, which measures the linear association between two variables. It has a value between -1 and 1 where:</p>\n<p>-1 indicates a perfectly negative linear correlation between two variables</p>\n<p>0 indicates no linear correlation between the two variables</p>\n<p>1 indicates a perfectly positive linear correlation between two variables</p>\n<p>The further away the correlation coefficient is from zero, the stronger the relationship between the two variables.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"results-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#results-7\"></a>Results:</h4>\n<p>Thus far, 12 entities have been recently onboarded to the network through the new admissions process, with zero breakages or bugs in the test phase.</p>\n<p>To illustrate the effectiveness of this process, below is data referring to the amount of times these validators fell into Grace Period 1 in their first 2100 checkpoints after joining the network.</p>\n<p>*<em>The <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-04.md\">PIP4 performance management process</a> outlines that if a validator falls below a 95% performance in signing checkpoints, they move into Grace Period 1. This Grace Period is a 700 checkpoint window in which they have to regain 95% adherence. If they once again fail to meet the 95% adherence requirement, they fall into Grace Period 2, another 700 checkpoint period. If they then again fail to meet this 95% requirement they then receive Final Notice and are removed from the network.</em></p>\n<p>Regaining adherence moves them straight back into healthy status.</p>\n<p>The following table shows the validators who were recently onboarded through this Admissions Process and the corresponding times they fell into Grace Period 1 in their first 2100 checkpoints in the network. Only 3 of these 12 validators have entered the grace period, reflecting a healthy admission process.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Validator ID</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"># of times in GP1</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Currently in active set</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">170</td>\n<td>Sensei Node</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">156</td>\n<td>Nexon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">163</td>\n<td>Upbit</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">161</td>\n<td>Northstake</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">152</td>\n<td>Zee Prime</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">162</td>\n<td>P2P Network</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">164</td>\n<td>Validatrium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">165</td>\n<td>Simply Staking</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">159</td>\n<td>Mantra DAO</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">160</td>\n<td>NEOPIN</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">167</td>\n<td>Ryabina</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Notes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/update-pos-validator-admissions/12344\">1.

For more on the collaboration between Polygon Labs and Succinct Labs, see here: <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/blog/succincts-sp1-built-with-polygon-plonky3-will-help-enable-performant-cross-chain-interoperability-for-the-agglayer\">Built on Plonky3, SP1 Will Help Secure Unified Liquidity</a></p>\n<p>This upgrade would introduce two major direct benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Greater network effects for users and devs, resulting from aggregating liquidity, users, and state via the AggLayer</li>\n<li>An upgraded bridge experience, including permissionless token transfers</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#background-2\"></a>Background</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187\">A year ago</a>, the community began discussing a proposal that would see Polygon PoS become a zkEVM Validium, thereby upgrading the network to a ZK-powered Layer 2 (L2). This remains the long term goal for the endstate of Polygon PoS. The challenge of achieving this is largely a function of the commitment to preserve Polygon PoS’ low-fees, Ethereum-for-all ethos.</p>\n<p>The Type 1 zkEVM prover that would be used to upgrade Polygon PoS to a ZK L2 is already able to prove existing Ethereum blocks at low-cost. For the application of Polygon PoS, it’s now a question of doing so at scale.</p>\n<p>For the time being, if this discussion is favorable and the subsequent PIP is accepted by the community, the upgrade would act as an intermediate step to becoming a full ZK L2. Connecting Polygon PoS to the AggLayer would provide the benefits of the Unified Bridge, while still being able to rely on the hardened security guarantees that the validator set provides.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"technical-details-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#technical-details-3\"></a>Technical Details</h1>\n<p>If community discussion aligns around this proposal, a future PIP or PIPs would provide the proper technical specification. However, at a high level, this upgrade would require at least the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proof of consensus: A new consensus verification contract would be deployed on Ethereum. This contract would be able to verify that Polygon PoS reached consensus, and, in parallel, that any withdrawals meet the criteria imposed by the logic of the pessimistic proof. A proposal would be created to add this to the <a href=\"https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/architecture/protocol/lxly-bridge/\">Unified Bridge</a> list of available verification contracts. (For additional considerations on this point, see Practical Concerns below.)</li>\n<li>Bridge implementation: The Unified Bridge contracts would be deployed on Polygon PoS.</li>\n<li>PoS Portal: The existing tokens in the PoS Portal Bridge would be upgraded to use the Unified Bridge and ownership would be burned, thereby removing multisig control over these tokens.</li>\n<li>Network role: Settling to the AggLayer using a proof of consensus design would require some entity to submit the required information. (For additional considerations on this point, see Practical Concerns below.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"changes-to-the-client-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#changes-to-the-client-4\"></a>Changes to the Client</h3>\n<p>Completing this upgrade would not require any significant client changes to Bor or Heimdall. While a future optimization may be possible with an upgrade to Heimdall v2, this is not required for initial deployment.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"changes-to-the-bridge-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#changes-to-the-bridge-5\"></a>Changes to the Bridge</h3>\n<p>Completing this upgrade would not require changes to the StateSync mechanism that powers FxPortal or the Plasma Bridge. Additionally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Unified Bridge would be deployed as a stand alone new bridge.</li>\n<li>Tokens mapped using PoS Portal would be upgraded to use the Unified Bridge instead of FxPortal, and PoS Portal would be deprecated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#timeline-6\"></a>Timeline</h1>\n<p>If this discussion is favorable, a formal PIP will follow. The primary dependency is completion of a production-ready implementation of the pessimistic proof, expected in mid-Summer. Once this is complete, the formal PIP would follow, most likely in the Fall. On this timeline, assuming community acceptance, connecting Polygon PoS to the AggLayer could occur before the end of 2024.</p>\n<p>Parallel to these efforts, the core engineers for Polygon PoS are expecting the forthcoming Ahmadabad hardfork to be deployed in July, with the rollout of Heimdall v2 expected sometime after. Currently, neither of these upgrades are dependencies for connecting Polygon PoS to the AggLayer. However, there is an alternative implementation of the proof of consensus that would require deeper changes to Heimdall.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"practical-concerns-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#practical-concerns-7\"></a>Practical Concerns</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"signature-based-proof-of-consensus-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#signature-based-proof-of-consensus-8\"></a>Signature-based Proof of Consensus</h3>\n<p>This proposal outlines using Polygon Plonky3 to represent the consensus of Polygon PoS, with the SP1 zkVM providing the maintainability and developer velocity advantages of Rust. Broadly, the goal of the proof of consensus is to represent the local chain state. This could also be accomplished by modifying Heimdall to use a different signature method.</p>\n<p>For instance, if a BLS or ICE-FROST threshold signature was used during consensus, that single signature could represent consensus to the AggLayer. One benefit of this approach is simplicity: communication between Polygon PoS and the AggLayer could be added as a task to Heimdall in the same process which currently submits checkpoints to the L1.</p>\n<p>One potential drawback is that this approach would require deeper changes to the network’s consensus mechanism, which may extend the development time. This design would obviate the need for a new network role.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"network-role-of-communicating-with-agglayer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#network-role-of-communicating-with-agglayer-9\"></a>Network Role of Communicating with AggLayer</h3>\n<p>For Polygon PoS to connect to the AggLayer using a proof of consensus, a new role would be needed. This role would be responsible for submitting the following information to the AggLayer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The network’s local bridge state</li>\n<li>The proof of consensus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How and by whom this function is performed is an area of active investigation. At a high-level, protocol researchers are considering one of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An allowlisted address performs this role at first, with the goal of making it permissionless once the AggLayer stack has had a chance to harden</li>\n<li>The role is permissionless immediately, in which case a network participant would perform this function in exchange for some as-yet unquantifiable reward. Should this be the preferred option and there are no additional security concerns, it would require determining by what mechanism this network participant is selected; one potential option would be using the existing leadership selection that occurs in Heimdall.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>With 400M+ unique addresses, $2B+ assets bridged from Ethereum, and tens of thousands of apps, Polygon PoS remains one of the most used blockchains in the world. Users and developers prefer it because of its strong community, network effects, and Ethereum-for-all low fees, oftentimes orders of magnitude lower than prominent Ethereum L2s.</p>\n<p>Core developers at Polygon Labs have spent years focused on research in and development of Ethereum scaling technology; it started with Polygon PoS. The years since have led to two conclusions: ZK technology is the only practical way to achieve verifiable off chain computation, and aggregation is the only way to achieve multichain interoperability without sacrificing chain sovereignty.</p>\n<p>The joint effort of Succinct Labs and Polygon Labs is based on the shared belief that collaboration with open source technology builds the best possible public good. The outcome of this discussion on the future of Polygon PoS is, ultimately, in the hands of the community. We once again invite you to analyze, discuss, and hopefully reach consensus for implementing the proposal.</p>\n            <p><small>8 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-zkpos-phase-1-connecting-to-the-agglayer/14250\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-zkpos-phase-1-connecting-to-the-agglayer/14250","pubDate":"Wed, 12 Jun 2024 16:42:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"Yes","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-14250"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-zkpos-phase-1-connecting-to-the-agglayer/14250.rss","#text":"Pre-PIP Discussion: zkPoS Phase 1, Connecting to the AggLayer"}},{"title":"Call for Feature Requests - Polygon PoS: Pilani Upgrade","dc:creator":"H_Rook","category":"Proposal Ideas","description":"<h1><a name=\"polygon-pos-pilani-upgrade-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#polygon-pos-pilani-upgrade-1\"></a><strong>Polygon PoS: Pilani Upgrade</strong></h1>\n<h2><a name=\"call-for-technical-feature-requests-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#call-for-technical-feature-requests-2\"></a><strong>Call for Technical Feature Requests</strong></h2>\n<p>Polygon PoS developers have decided on a name for the upgrade following Ahmedabad.

By increasing the number of validators, validation responsibilities are distributed more widely, which reduces the risk of centralization and strengthens the network’s security and resilience. This proposal outlines the considerations for expanding the number of validator slots to ensure robust network performance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The primary motivation for increasing the number of validator slots within the Polygon PoS network is to improve decentralization which can be observed via the following metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Geographical Distribution of Nodes</strong>: Expanding the number of validator slots allows for a wider geographical distribution of nodes. By having validators in diverse locations globally, the risk of localized disruptions is reduced, and the network’s health is enhanced to prevent regional failures.</li>\n<li><strong>Decrease Stake Centralisation</strong>: More validator slots means that voting power and block production can be more evenly distributed across a larger number of validators.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve Nakamoto Coefficient</strong>: The Nakamoto Coefficient, which measures the minimum number of validators required to compromise a network, should improve with an increase in validator nodes. A higher coefficient indicates a more secure and decentralized network, as it becomes harder for any group to disrupt the network’s consensus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>The proposed expansion involves a phased increase in the number of validator slots, starting from the current 105 slots to 110, then to 115, further to 120 and finally to 125. This incremental approach, with ongoing community review and feedback, allows for careful monitoring and management of each expansion stage. The specific steps include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Assessing the current infrastructure and ensuring it can support the additional validators.</li>\n<li>Implementing the first phase by adding 5 validator slots and monitoring the network’s performance and stability.</li>\n<li>Gradually increasing the slots in subsequent phases (as noted above) based on performance metrics and network impact.</li>\n<li>Conducting thorough monitoring at each stage to ensure seamless integration and functionality.</li>\n<li>In the event that the expansion from 105 to 110 validators negatively impacts the network’s health, the community may consider taking corrective action to offboard the last 5 validators who were onboarded.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-7\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>Increasing the number of validator slots in phases offers several advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It helps the network grow gradually, lowering the risks that come with adding many new validators all at once.</li>\n<li>Each phase can be evaluated for performance, ensuring that any issues are identified and addressed promptly.</li>\n<li>It ensures that the network infrastructure and support mechanisms are adequately scaled to handle the increased load, thereby maintaining overall network health and performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"backwards-compatibility-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#backwards-compatibility-8\"></a>Backwards Compatibility</h3>\n<p>The expansion of validator slots is designed to be fully backwards compatible. Existing validators and network operations should not be affected by the increase in slots. The system architecture should ensure that the integration of new validators occurs smoothly, without disrupting ongoing operations or diminishing the performance of current validators.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"test-cases-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#test-cases-9\"></a>Test Cases</h3>\n<p>To ensure the success of the validator slot expansion, the following test cases will be conducted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Performance Testing</em>: Evaluate the network’s ability to handle the increased number of validators, focusing on transaction processing times, block generation, and overall output.</li>\n<li><em>Stability Testing</em>: Monitor the network for any signs of instability or degradation in performance following the addition of new validators.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"security-considerations-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#security-considerations-10\"></a>Security Considerations</h3>\n<p>Security remains a top priority during the expansion process. Security measures will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to any abnormal activity.</li>\n<li>Suggested implementation of best practices for validator operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"copyright-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#copyright-11\"></a>Copyright</h3>\n<p>All copyrights and related rights in this work are waived under CC0 1.0 Universal.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-38-phased-expansion-of-validator-slots-on-polygon-pos/14200\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-38-phased-expansion-of-validator-slots-on-polygon-pos/14200","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Jun 2024 14:37:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-14200"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-38-phased-expansion-of-validator-slots-on-polygon-pos/14200.rss","#text":"PIP 38 - Phased expansion of Validator Slots on Polygon PoS"}},{"title":"Polygon Staking Report.

Under specific conditions being met, the bug could have potentially allowed a malicious validator to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Heimdall network, causing the PoS network to halt.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"root-cause-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#root-cause-2\"></a><strong>Root Cause</strong></h2>\n<p>In the milestones workflow, when a validator proposes a milestone, a stream of bytes is generated, and then signed by all the validators. Given that the structure of this bytes stream is very similar to the one that gets created for the checkpoints, a single malicious validator could manipulate the data, get the signatures from all validators, and then submit it as a valid checkpoint to the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract on Ethereum. Specifically, we refer to the <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> struct in <strong><code>heimdall/checkpoint/types/msg_milestone.go</code>,</strong> where the <strong><code>GetSignSideBytes()</code></strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/blob/ae5a160feaf278b0127c3e2b45bb1338b1de9d7a/checkpoint/types/msg_milestone.go#L86-L98\">function</a> returns the side sign bytes that validators are supposed to sign during the voting process of a side block.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"go\"><code class=\"lang-go\">func (msg MsgMilestone) GetSideSignBytes() []byte {\n    // keccak256(abi.encoded(proposer, startBlock, endBlock, rootHash, accountRootHash, bor chain id))\n    borChainID, _ := strconv.ParseUint(msg.BorChainID, 10, 64)\n\n    return appendBytes32(\n            msg.Proposer.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.StartBlock).Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.EndBlock).Bytes(),\n            msg.Hash.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(borChainID).Bytes(),\n            []byte(msg.MilestoneID),\n    )\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Similarly, the <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong> is what gets eventually committed by the proposer to the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract. The <strong><code>GetSideSignBytes()</code></strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/blob/ae5a160feaf278b0127c3e2b45bb1338b1de9d7a/checkpoint/types/msg.go#L163-L175\">function</a> for this message looks like the following.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"go\"><code class=\"lang-go\">func (msg MsgCheckpoint) GetSideSignBytes() []byte {\n    // keccak256(abi.encoded(proposer, startBlock, endBlock, rootHash, accountRootHash, bor chain id))\n    borChainID, _ := strconv.ParseUint(msg.BorChainID, 10, 64)\n\n    return appendBytes32(\n            msg.Proposer.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.StartBlock).Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.EndBlock).Bytes(),\n            msg.RootHash.Bytes(),\n            msg.AccountRootHash.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(borChainID).Bytes(),\n    )\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>By looking at the <strong><code>submitCheckpoint()</code></strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/eef53596046eda70a53653a8e5ff79b1cbf0a4f9/contracts/root/RootChain.sol#L27-L53\">function</a> in <strong><code>contracts/root/RootChain.sol</code></strong> , we can see that the ABI decoding accepts as parameter the side sign bytes of the <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong>.</p>\n<p>The bug here is that both <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> and <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong> are signed by the same validators to reach consensus, hence a signed <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> can be used in place of a <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong>.</p>\n<p>In the case of the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract, a <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> could be submitted and this would be interpreted as a valid checkpoint because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The malicious validator could make sure that <code>proposer</code>, <code>startBlock</code> and <code>endBlock</code> align</li>\n<li>The milestone <code>hash</code> would be committed in place of a checkpoint <code>rootHash</code></li>\n<li>The <code>borChainID</code> would be interpreted as the <code>AccountRootHash</code></li>\n<li>The <code>MilestoneID</code> would have to be equal to the <code>borChainID</code> in bytes, which can happen since the <code>MilestoneID</code> can be arbitrarily chosen by the validator each time</li>\n</ul>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">function submitCheckpoint(bytes calldata data, uint[3][] calldata sigs) external {\n    (address proposer, uint256 start, uint256 end, bytes32 rootHash, bytes32 accountHash, uint256 _borChainID) = abi\n        .decode(data, (address, uint256, uint256, bytes32, bytes32, uint256));\n    require(CHAINID == _borChainID, \"Invalid bor chain id\");\n\n    require(_buildHeaderBlock(proposer, start, end, rootHash), \"INCORRECT_HEADER_DATA\");\n\n    // check if it is better to keep it in local storage instead\n    IStakeManager stakeManager = IStakeManager(registry.getStakeManagerAddress());\n    uint256 _reward = stakeManager.checkSignatures(\n        end.sub(start).add(1),\n        /**\n            prefix 01 to data\n            01 represents positive vote on data and 00 is negative vote\n            malicious validator can try to send 2/3 on negative vote so 01 is appended\n            */\n        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytes(hex\"01\"), data)),\n        accountHash,\n        proposer,\n        sigs\n    );\n\n    require(_reward != 0, \"Invalid checkpoint\");\n    emit NewHeaderBlock(proposer, _nextHeaderBlock, _reward, start, end, rootHash);\n    _nextHeaderBlock = _nextHeaderBlock.add(MAX_DEPOSITS);\n    _blockDepositId = 1;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>With these premises, if a malicious validator is able to modify the data in a way that matches the previous points, it can submit a valid signed milestone instead of a checkpoint on the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract on Ethereum. This would lead to chain failure of Polygon PoS.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"resolution-and-recovery-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#resolution-and-recovery-3\"></a><strong>Resolution and Recovery</strong></h2>\n<p>A patch was successfully released on May 23rd 2024, with Heimdall tag <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v1.0.6\">v1.0.6</a>.</p>\n<p>It consists of <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/pull/1163\">one main PR</a>, where the <strong><code>GetSideSignBytes</code></strong> function for milestones workflow has been modified to return <strong><code>nil</code></strong>. This is basically what happens for every kind of <strong><code>sideTx</code></strong> in Heimdall, exception made for checkpoints, which is the only case that requires the data to be broadcasted to all validators, signed, and then submitted to the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract, which has the ultimate task of checking the validity of the bytes stream, and reverting the execution in case the arguments do not match with the expected ones.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to increase the security around milestones submission, the <strong><code>ValidateMilestone</code></strong> function - which is invoked by the milestones side handler at time of voting on correct data - has been enriched with an additional check. Since the <strong><code>milestoneID</code></strong> is of format <strong><code>UUID - HexAddress</code></strong>, the validation now ensures that the first part of such string is a valid UUID and the second part is a valid hex-based address.

The main focus was on PIP 22, PIP 36, PIP 30, and increasing the minimum gas price.</p>\n<p>With the inclusion list finalized, Polygon will target shipping these changes at the end of May or early June depending on testnet deployment timelines. The next PPGC meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 30 but may shift a week or two to align with the rollout.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 22 (EIP 3074)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/manav24_\">Manav Darji</a> from the Bor client team provided an update on their progress in implementing EIP 3074 style account abstraction. The Bor team has a PR open that implements the AUTH and AUTH_CALL opcodes. Over the past two weeks, they have been adding more tests and accommodating changes to match the latest spec of EIP 3074. Bor is currently testing their implementation internally on a devnet. There are patches for Solidity and Foundry available to test these new opcodes. The next step is to do as much adversarial testing as possible before deploying to Polygon’s testnet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Harry__Rook\">Harry Rook</a>, Polygon Governance PM, noted recent <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-5003-auth-usurp-publishing-code-at-an-eoa-address/8979\">discussions</a> about potentially including EIP 5003 in the fork after Pectra on Ethereum to mitigate some concerns with EIP 3074. This will likely be a topic in the next PPGC meeting.</p>\n<p>Note: EIP 3074 introduces AUTH (sets a context variable authorized based on an ECDSA signature) and AUTHCALL (sends a call as the authorized account). Through EIP 3074, control of the externally owned account (EOA) is delegated to a smart contract.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 36 (Replay Failed State Syncs)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/imderl\">Dhairya Sethi</a>, the author of PIP 36, explained that the purpose is to add the ability to replay failed state syncs until the full migration to the LXLY bridge is complete. It also patches a bug in the Matic token contract related to the gas cost increase of SLOAD in Ethereum’s Berlin hard fork which broke contracts using TRANSFER to send ETH to contracts with code in the RECEIVE or FALLBACK functions.</p>\n<p>PIP 36 aims to fix failed state syncs in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Replace TRANSFER with CALL in the Matic token contract to provide sufficient gas and prevent failed deposits when the receiver is a contract with code. This requires a hard fork since the contract is not upgradeable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the ability to replay failed state syncs, both past and future. For past failed state syncs between the Shanghai fork and, a Merkle tree will be constructed of the failed state IDs so users can prove and replay their failed state sync. For future failed state syncs, the contract will store the receiver and calldata so it can be replayed externally. Security considerations are taken to prevent reentrancy and ensure immutability of the replayed transaction.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The failed state syncs that occurred from block 38,457,210 (around Nov 30, 2023) up to the fork will be replayable.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 30 (Increase Max Code Size Limit)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidesilverman\">David Silverman</a> explained PIP 30 which proposes increasing the max code size and max initcode size by 33% to allow deploying more complex contracts. The current limits were set arbitrarily in the Spurious Dragon hard fork and developers are now frequently hitting these limits. Analysis shows this increase would not negatively impact the ZK migration plans. The intent is to slowly raise this limit, potentially moving to even higher values later in conjunction with the rollup coordination group.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Gas Price Increase</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcell033\">Marcelo Ardizzone</a> presented a new PIP to increase the default minimum gas price to 30 gwei to reduce spam transactions. Currently this is just a node client setting, not a network level parameter. Having different minimum gas prices across validators leads to transactions getting stuck if they are priced for a validator with a lower minimum.</p>\n<p>The PIP enforces the 30 gwei minimum at the network level in three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the default minimum gas price for validators to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the default gas price limit for accepting txs into the transaction pool to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the threshold below which the gas price oracle ignores transactions to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is implemented via code changes in the Bor and Erigon clients. Validators can still set custom gas parameters if desired by modifying the client code and running a custom version.</p>\n<p>With no major concerns expressed, developers seemed ready to move forward with this inclusion list for the upgrade. The Bor and Erigon teams confirmed they are okay with the proposed changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Coordination with Ethereum</strong></p>\n<p>When asked about coordination with Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade that also plans to include EIP 3074, David Silverman said the intention is for Polygon to move ahead of Ethereum on this as they have done with previous upgrades like EIP 7212. Protocol developers are working closely with rollup teams who are also implementing 3074 to maintain compatibility. The hope is that Ethereum does not intentionally try to break this compatibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>With the inclusion list finalized, protocol developers will target shipping these changes at the end of May or early June depending on testnet deployment timelines.

To address this issue, we propose patching the bug &amp; introducing the ability to replay failed state syncs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-2\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLDR: Plasma MATIC deposits revert with out of gas when the receiver is a GnosisSafe contract because it uses <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/main/contracts/child/MRC20.sol#L44\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">transfer instead of call</a> when sending MATIC (native on child) and the fallback required more than 2300 gas (and more recently <a href=\"https://help.safe.global/en/articles/40813-why-can-t-i-transfer-eth-from-a-contract-into-a-safe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2600</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>MATIC deposits occur via the plasma bridge, wherein a user holding MATIC on L1 calls <strong><code>depositERC20()</code></strong> on the Plasma bridge <strong><code>DepositManager</code></strong>. This action emits a State Sync, which is picked up by validators and executed on L2. This state sync triggers the <strong><code>StateReceiver</code></strong> on L2, which, after the necessary validations, calls the <strong><code>deposit</code></strong> method on the childToken (MATIC(0x00…1010) in this instance).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">    function deposit(address user, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {\n\t... // perform necessary checks and log effects\n\n        // interaction: transfer amount to user\n        _user.transfer(amount); // &lt;-- the bug\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t...\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This contract utilizes the built-in Solidity transfer method, which limits the available transferred gas to 2300. Before the Berlin Hardfork, this amount was generally sufficient for most contracts. However, post-Berlin Hardfork, accessing a contract for the first time (which occurs when MATIC is moved to an account that is a contract) incurs gas costs of 2600, resulting in a failure with an <code>out of gas</code> revert.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Gas costs before Berlin hardfork</p>\n<p>Access account: 700 gas</p>\n<p>Read storage slot: 800 gas</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gas costs after Berlin hardfork</p>\n<p>Access account:</p>\n<p>First time per address in tx: 2600 gas</p>\n<p>Any additional time in tx: 100 gas</p>\n<p>Read storage slot:</p>\n<p>First time per storage slot in tx: 2100 gas</p>\n<p>Any additional time in tx: 100 gas</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This issue also exists in Ethereum, leading to the inclusion of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-2390.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-2930</a> alongside <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2929.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-2929</a> to mitigate such occurrences. EIP-2930 introduces an access list, prepaying gas for any address or storage slot on the list, thus reducing runtime costs to 100 gas. This solution addresses the problem of insufficient gas availability when transferring ETH from one contract to another using default Solidity methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that this is a special case for the MATIC token only and not any other <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-20.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20</a> token as this token has the unique property of being a native token on L2.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>This PIP proposes to patch the transfer vs send bug mentioned above by updating the bytecode of MRC-20 MATIC token on L2 through a hardfork. We specify a <strong><code>txGasLimit</code></strong> while doing the call such that the receiver doesn’t consume all available gas in the state sync block limit to prevent DoS (state sync’s are batched together in one txn).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">      (bool success, ) = _user.call(value: amount, gas: txGasLimit);\n      require(success, \"!transfer\");\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Replay Failed State Syncs</strong></p>\n<p>Along with the above, this PIP proposes two more additions for the replayability of failed state syncs.</p>\n<p>The State Receiver currently emits <code>StateCommitted(uint stateId, bool success)</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">  function commitState(uint256 syncTime, bytes calldata recordBytes) external onlySystem returns(bool success) {\n    ...\n\n    if (isContract(receiver)) { // notify state receiver contract, in a non-revert manner\n      uint256 txGas = 5000000;\n      bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature(\"onStateReceive(uint256,bytes)\", stateId, stateData);\n      assembly {\n        success := call(txGas, receiver, 0, add(data, 0x20), mload(data), 0, 0)\n      }\n      emit StateCommitted(stateId, success);\n    }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>We propose the StateReceiver also stores the failed state syncs.</p>\n<p>mapping failedStateSyncs (uint stateId ⇒ bytes encodedData (abi.encode(receiver, data)).</p>\n<p>which can be re-executed once by anyone through an external method <code>replayFailedStateSync(uint stateId)</code></p>\n<p>This would delete the entry in failedStateSyncs mapping only on a successful call.</p>\n<p>This enabled users with failed state syncs to replay their transaction with</p>\n<ul>\n<li>higher gas, and</li>\n<li>at a different time (where the state has changed &amp; possibly the control flow if receiver succeeds).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Replay Failed State Syncs</strong></p>\n<p>The State Receiver currently emits <code>StateCommitted(uint stateId, bool success)</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLDR: make a merkle tree of previous failed state syncs, post immutable root on StateReceiver, such that anyone can prove their failed state sync and replay them on chain trustlessly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A merkle tree of previous failed state syncs from the Shanghai Hardfork (50563600) until the present (an ever-expanding list) is created.</p>\n<p>A package to fetch and filter historic events will be made public such that this tree can be built, and root cross-checked by anyone. This will be small merkle tree of depth 16, where the leaf’s will be the keccak(abi.encode(stateId, receiver, calldata)) [stateId provides sufficient collision resistance].</p>\n<p>An external method on StateReceiver will be exposed: <code>replayHistoricFailedStateSync(bytes32[16] calldata proof, uint256 leafIndex, uint256 stateId, address receiver, bytes calldata data) </code> which nullifies the leaf on successful state syncs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"observability-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#observability-4\"></a>Observability</h3>\n<p>The overall observability of the plasma bridge would increase with this update.<br>\nThe main improvement is that failed state syncs would be recorded.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"backward-compatibility-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#backward-compatibility-5\"></a>Backward Compatibility</h3>\n<p>As the contract impacted by this PIP is not upgradeable, the changes would require a hardfork.</p>\n<p>The L2 contracts being upgraded would be the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>StateReceiver: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001</li>\n<li>MRC-20(Matic Token): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"security-considerations-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#security-considerations-6\"></a>Security Considerations</h3>\n<p>Internal as well as external security reviews will have to be done to ensure maximum safety.

Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved decision making</strong> - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Retaining top performers</strong> - Some ideas and teams won’t produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher self awareness &amp; accountability</strong> - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowers individual contributors</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.</li>\n<li><strong>Removed intermediaries</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone’s compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible information usage</strong> - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source contribution data</strong> - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Self sovereign identity adoption</strong> - Individual contribution logs can be tied to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust based networks</strong> - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they’ve built and the common connections they share.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Read our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution verification and contribution logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/approaches/contribution-verification-approaches\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification approaches</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Experimentation in Polygon</strong></p>\n<p>Individual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants process or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to start building up their own reputation.

Seeking Insights and Connections"}},{"title":"Heimdall Security Bug Fix","dc:creator":"Parvez03","category":"General","description":"<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>A Security bug on Heimdall was previously reported and confirmed via the Bug Bounty Program. Under highly specific – and very unlikely – conditions being met, the bug could have potentially allowed a malicious actor to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Heimdall network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"root-cause-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#root-cause-2\"></a>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>Heimdall needs to acquire specific public keys, which are contained in two messages (ValidatorJoin, SignerUpdate). These keys are crucial for the validator to sign PoS commitments and votes. The validity of these public keys is confirmed against the corresponding Ethereum log in the StakeInfo contract. This process is meant to ensure that the public key aligns with the one selected by the validator.</p>\n<p>However, a complication arises due to an implementation nuance in the secp256k1 library utilized in Heimdall/Peppermint. Public keys must include an additional prefix byte, making them a total of 65 bytes long. Unfortunately, Heimdall does not verify the first byte of the public key in any message. This contrasts with the secp256k1 signature validation, which requires the prefix to be 0x04, 0x06, or 0x07; otherwise, validation fails.</p>\n<p>The sole validation performed on the public key bytes is to ensure that the slice pubkey[1:] matches the 64-byte public key from the Ethereum log. The initial byte provided in the message is merely copied and stored without validation. Additionally, attempting to verify the address generated by hashing the public key proves futile, as the address is derived from the truncated hash of the 64-byte public key, once again disregarding the prefix byte.</p>\n<p>As a result of this lack of validation, whenever a new validator joins the network or an existing validator updates their signing key, a malicious actor can exploit the situation by submitting a message containing a corrupted version of the public key for that validator, such as setting the first byte to 0xff.</p>\n<p>This corrupted message will be readily accepted and verified by all validators, including the victim validator. Consequently, each validator will store the corrupted public key. Subsequently, when the victim validator attempts to send a commitment or proposal, all other validators will attempt to verify the signature using the corrupted key, leading to constant verification failures.</p>\n<p>This situation renders the victim validator incapable of participating in the PoS protocol until the signing key is updated again, a process that takes 100 epochs. Moreover, even after updating the signing key, the attacker can simply repeat the attack.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"resolution-and-recovery-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#resolution-and-recovery-3\"></a>Resolution and Recovery</h2>\n<p>A patch was successfully released on March 14th 2024, with Heimdall <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v1.0.5\">tag v1.0.5</a>. It consists of one <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/pull/1149\">main PR</a>, where a new method has been introduced. The function, called <code>IsPubKeyFirstByteValid</code> checks the first byte of the validator’s public key every time a <code>SignerUpdate</code> or a <code>ValidatorJoin</code> event is invoked. It basically validates that the first byte of the public key is <code>0x04</code>, which stands for “uncompressed public key”, the format used by Polygon PoS nodes. The unit tests confirmed the validity of this new method.</p>\n<p>The patch was first tested on a devnet, then tested and rolled out on Mumbai and Mainnet nodes. A release announcement was shared, allowing all the validators to upgrade.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 14:50:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13780"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780.rss","#text":"Heimdall Security Bug Fix"}},{"title":"Recent Downtime on Astar zkEVM","dc:creator":"J_Nicolas","category":"Announcements","description":"<p>Earlier this week, an outage on Astar zkEVM required an emergency upgrade of the network.
