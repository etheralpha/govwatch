Resolution required recomputation of the network’s state. A new version of the sequencer (v0.6.5-RC6), released shortly after, included an additional protection to prevent this issue from recurring in the short term. An additional, independent protection was added on April 09.</p>\n<p>In resolving the issue, the network was down for twenty minutes. Polygon PoS, chains built with Polygon CDK, and chains connected to the AggLayer were unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>For dApps on zkEVM: Transactions made on April 08, between approximately 3:00 UTC and 7:30 UTC, had to be re-executed. These transactions may have been processed in a different block or may not have been processed—please get in touch below, if this is the case. Approximately 1,000 transactions may have been affected.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"description-of-the-incident-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#description-of-the-incident-1\"></a>Description of the Incident</h2>\n<p>On April 08, the sequencer for Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta detected a reorg on the underlying L1, at block 19608115.</p>\n<p>Because of the network’s recent state sync issue, a protection was already included in the sequencer. This protection worked as expected, but the network’s synchronizer did not handle the reorg properly. Instead of just updating a record, in this case it inserted a new record. The sequencer then inserted a new Global Exit Root at batch 2005906. While this Global Exit Root was correct, it took an index that it was one greater than what it should be.</p>\n<p>When this batch was inserted in L1, the selected index still didn’t exist, causing it to be interpreted as invalid.</p>\n<p>In summary, the network’s trusted state included this batch as valid while the virtual state considered it invalid. Resolving this required re-execution of the trusted state with this block as invalid in order to build the proof. Consequently, some transactions were not executed and some transactions were re-executed with different results.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"future-mitigation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#future-mitigation-2\"></a>Future Mitigation</h2>\n<p>This is the second state synchronization issue for Polygon zkEVM. The core engineers for zkEVM have since released two independent protections, each of them robust enough to prevent L1 reorgs from causing this state synchronization issue to recur.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sequencer v0.6.5-RC6, released April 08, includes a mechanism for detecting when an L1 reorg occurs; once a reorg is detected, the network will continue operating normally, but the sequencer will temporarily stop accepting new Global Exit Roots until confirmation that the network’s state is synchronized.</li>\n<li>An additional protection was added to the synchronizer on April 09. It allows the network to synchronize from older blocks, where older blocks are a config parameter that act as a safe checkpoint.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-of-events-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#timeline-of-events-3\"></a>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p><strong>April 08, 2024</strong><br>\n<strong>02:56 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe sequencer for Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta detected a reorg at block <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/19608115\">19608115</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reorg: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/19608115/f\">https://etherscan.io/block/19608115/f</a></li>\n<li>The synchronizer failed to properly handle this reorg, inserting a new record instead of updating the existing record.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Approximately 03:00 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe sequencer inserted a new Global Exit Root at batch 2005906.

The Polygon zkEVM team was unable to reproduce these errors. On March 23, the team attempted to resolve the issue by resyncing the network using L1 sequenced data, which led to detection of two different correct Global Exit Roots.</p>\n<p>In the process of resolving this issue, the network was down for a total of 14 hours. Polygon PoS, chains built with Polygon CDK, and chains connected to the AggLayer were unaffected.</p>\n<p>Resolving the outage resulted in an emergency upgrade to the Verifier, as well as a reindexing on Etherscan and resynchronization of permissionless nodes. For dApps on Polygon zkEVM: Some transactions made on March 22 and March 23 were affected by a network reorg and may have been processed in a different block or may not have been processed—please get in touch below, if this is the case. Approximately 4,000 transactions may have been affected.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"description-of-incident-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#description-of-incident-1\"></a>Description of Incident</h2>\n<p>The network outage was caused by a reorg on the underlying L1, a relatively common situation, usually involving a depth of 1 or 2 blocks. The original version of the reorged block included a deposit transaction from Polygon zkEVM that generated an update on the Global Exit Root, which is the root of the bridge’s global exit Merkle Tree. The reorged block that followed did not include this deposit transaction.</p>\n<p>The synchronizer for Polygon zkEVM did not correctly detect this reorg and the record was not deleted or updated from the State Database for over two epochs, approximately 12 minutes. As a result, the sequencer included the incorrect Global Exit Root in the next L2 block. The actual state of the network was different from the one that was published.</p>\n<p>As a result of the reorg, many transactions following this block returned an invalid nonce. Valid proofs for these transactions were generated, but the result of these transactions were no-operation, as if they were not there. The analysis of the incident, development of the fixes, and synchronization of these no-op transactions delayed recovery of the network.</p>\n<p>Resolving these issues ultimately required putting the network into an Emergency State, a security mechanism that allows the network to be upgraded without a timelock, conditional on the approval of the Security Council. The Security Council is a 6/8 multisig, with two members from Polygon Labs. On March 24, at 23:00 UTC, the network was halted and upgraded. This is the first time that the Emergency State mechanism has been used. For more on the network’s security mechanisms, see zkEVM’s governance model: <a href=\"https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/architecture/protocol/security-council/\">Security Council</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solution-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#solution-2\"></a>Solution</h2>\n<p>Due to the invalid management of the L1 reorgs from synchronization, updated versions of the Node and Prover were released.

This suggested funding process could become a highly effective and scalable approach for Web3 ecosystems to more consistently generate impact.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to experiment with a contributor funding approach is better highlighted by understanding some of the problems that exist with idea based funding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For contributors, the proposal submission process can require a large amount of effort and time upfront for contributors to participate and then also handle the ongoing burden of proposal writing and budgeting complexities to get involved in an ecosystem. The structure and incentives of this funding process result in a reduced amount of contribution flexibility and income stability that can deter contributors from participating or limit their ability to easily generate high impact.</li>\n<li>For voters, it is often highly complex to compare and select ideas effectively. Many voters lack the sufficient context, skills and experience required to be well informed and effectively participate in these decisions. The selection process can be highly time consuming and complex for the voters. Voters can rarely express their exact preferences with their voting decisions and also do not have enough accountability or incentives to be expected to spend a meaningful amount of time on voting to make more optimal and well informed decisions.</li>\n<li>For Web3 ecosystems, ideas are often treated as ephemeral yes or no funding decisions rather than being a collaborative process that looks to discuss and explore different solution approaches. In larger funding processes it can also become easier for innovative ideas to be ignored due to being less well understood or known. The allocation of assets can also be more inefficient in situations where the allocated funds are not actively being used to generate contribution outcomes, this can increase the percentage of deadweight assets that are not being fully utilised at a given point in time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To understand these problems in more detail you can review our analysis on the current funding landscape - <a href=\"https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/current-funding-landscape\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/current-funding-landscape</a></p>\n<p>The good news is that most of these problems can be either greatly reduced or fully resolved! An open source contributor funding process can help with resolving these problems and also could become a highly reliable and effective process for maintaining and improving Web3 ecosystems over the long term.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996\" title=\"web3-open-source-contributor-funding\"><img src=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996.jpeg\" alt=\"web3-open-source-contributor-funding\" data-base62-sha1=\"dfVGL3faJmTg9b9msENXyJpbhnE\" width=\"690\" height=\"365\" data-dominant-color=\"D1DEE6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Our proposal outlines the suggestion of experimenting with directly funding a small number of open source developers that would help with developing any open source initiatives - this could include improving any existing pieces of software used in the ecosystem or creating entirely new tools and libraries.</p>\n<p>The advantages and long term opportunities for adopting a contributor funding approach are numerous. We’ve covered the advantages and opportunities of this suggested funding process in more detail in our proposal - <a href=\"https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/open-source-contributor-funding\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/open-source-contributor-funding</a></p>\n<p>You can alternatively watch our videos that cover the same content from our proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZWo9qNm3mvs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/ZWo9qNm3mvs</a> - Current Web3 funding landscape</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/f3fP2bjf6rY\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/f3fP2bjf6rY</a> - Tech company comparison with Web3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/mQHqwHIDKMo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/mQHqwHIDKMo</a> - Open source contributor funding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The background analysis that helps to support this proposal can be found here - <a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://disbursement.treasuries.co</a></p>\n<br> \n<h1><a name=\"experimentation-in-polygon-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#experimentation-in-polygon-1\"></a>Experimentation in Polygon</h1>\n<p>Polygon has an idea funding grants process called <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/village\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Polygon Village</a>. This is an open process however is currently fairly targeted towards zero knowledge DeFi solutions. Arguably this makes it closer towards a request for proposals type of structure.</p>\n<p>Experimenting with an open source contributor funding process could simply mean adding in an extra form process to enable software developers to indicate their interest in contributing to the Polygon ecosystem as a contributor. These individuals could then help with existing open source solutions being built or new ones that the Polygon Foundation suggest to them.</p>\n<p>The immediate opportunity with experimenting with a contributor focused funding approach would be that it would make it easier for software developers to indicate their interest in working in the Polygon ecosystem. The Polygon Foundation could then identify if there are any promising candidates that could be suitable for contributing towards any relevant initiative in the ecosystem. Contributor funding proposals could end up bringing in impactful talent that otherwise might not have got involved due to the more time consuming upfront idea proposal process. The idea process can make it more difficult for these individuals to just express their interest in working in the ecosystem. A contributor focussed process could provide a more collaborative path for identifying promising talent and matching them with ongoing work that could create impact in the ecosystem.</p>\n<br> \n<h1><a name=\"experiment-facilitation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#experiment-facilitation-2\"></a>Experiment facilitation</h1>\n<p>If any ecosystem was interested in experimenting with this suggested funding process but doesn’t want to handle the process fully themselves I am eager to collaborate with them and help wherever I can with setting up and running any of these experiments that are focussed on contributor funding.</p>\n<p>In either event, contributor funding experiments across many ecosystems could be highly beneficial for the wider industry. The outcomes from these experiments can be analysed to better compare the strengths and weaknesses of this suggested approach against the widely adopted idea based funding approach that we see being more widely used across Web3 ecosystems today. Analysing and documenting these experiment outcomes is something that we intend to work on at the <a href=\"https://web3association.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Web3 Association</a>!</p>\n<br> \n<h1><a name=\"community-discussion-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#community-discussion-3\"></a>Community discussion</h1>\n<p><strong>General thoughts &amp; feedback</strong><br>\nThere’s likely going to be many opportunities and problems that could be better explored and addressed.

Because the implementation is quite complex. To hedge the bugs in ZK verifier, a hardware solution, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), can be used as an 2-factor verifier to offer double security to zk-rollups.</p>\n<p>In this proposal, we are going to talk about a design of TEE-based multi-proof system for Polygon zkEVM.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#problem-2\"></a>Problem</h2>\n<p>The problem is well framed in the original post <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/2fa-zk-rollups-using-sgx/14462\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2FA zk-rollups using SGX</a>. Here we just summarize the key points below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single-proof zk-rollups is error prone in engineering implementation</li>\n<li>There are bugs in rollup verifiers (circuits and ZK verifiers):\n<ul>\n<li>Research: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15293\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">What don’t we know? Understanding Security Vulnerabilities in SNARKs</a></li>\n<li>It’s hard to detect bugs in verifier</li>\n<li>A vulnerability may put all the assets in the L2 in risk</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>So we should introduce multi-proof to remove the single-point-of-failure in ZK verifier</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"solution-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#solution-3\"></a>Solution</h2>\n<p>Ideally, we can have diversified ZK provers and verifiers to generate multi-proof. However, it takes time to build such system, and increase the costs to operate the system. We propose a pragmatic solution, a TEE-based multi-prover for Polygon zkEVM.</p>\n<p>The solution is based on the original post <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/2fa-zk-rollups-using-sgx/14462\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2FA zk-rollups using SGX</a>. Again, here we just summarize the key points below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)\n<ul>\n<li>A back-box built in some special CPUs. It can execute some code inside, and ensure the memory and the states are temper-proof and confidentiality-preserving. It acts as a blackbox, so that nobody including the hardware owner, can manipulate the execution or steal data from it.</li>\n<li>Intel SGX is the most popular TEE implementation. It can generate “remote attestation”, a report signed by the hardware, to prove that a certain program is running inside a genuine TEE.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We can build a proving system using TEE\n<ul>\n<li>First, the prover generates a key pair <code>(pk, sk)</code> inside the TEE</li>\n<li>Then register the TEE prover with a proper remote attestation and store the public key <code>pk</code> on L1</li>\n<li>The prover produces the state transition proof\n<ul>\n<li>Prover to commit to <code>(pre_state_root, post_state_root, block_root)</code></li>\n<li>Prover to sign the commitment with the key pair</li>\n<li>Verifier contract to check the ecdsa signature of the commitment with the <code>pk</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nice properties:\n<ul>\n<li>Safe\n<ul>\n<li>The TEE prover is purely an addition to ZKP</li>\n<li>In the worse case, it fallbacks to the zk-rollup security.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Unstoppable\n<ul>\n<li>We can run N provers and require 1-of-N approval on L1</li>\n<li>This can be achieved by giving some incentive to TEE provers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Low cost\n<ul>\n<li>Very little gas consumption: just an ECDSA verification</li>\n<li>Minimal change to L1 contracts</li>\n<li>Prover is simple: just a EVM simulation in TEE</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To implement it, we will need to implement: (1) prover registration, (2) redundancy of the provers, and (3) the prover logic.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"register-prover-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#register-prover-4\"></a>Register Prover</h3>\n<p>Provers should be registered on L1 before they can verify TEE proofs. Once the prover is deployed to Intel SGX, it can produce a Remote Attestation Report. The report can be verified to ensure: (1) the prover is running the correct code inside Intel SGX, and (2) a key pair <code>(pk, sk)</code> was generated by the correct code.</p>\n<p>It’s tricky to verify the report in EVM. Because the report is large (around 20kb), and the verification involves JSON parsing and unsupported cryptographic (secp256r1, sha256, etc). To solve that problem, we propose to build the report verifier in ZK.</p>\n<p>Our reference implementation in Risc0:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jasl/zk_dcap_verifier_poc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/jasl/zk_dcap_verifier_poc</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"high-availability-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#high-availability-5\"></a>High Availability</h3>\n<p>As suggested, the multi-proof system should allow many (e.g. 100+) TEE provers to be registered. Assuming no vulnerability in TEE provers, we just need 1-of-N approval to accept the TEE block proof.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In case there’s a TEE vulnerability, the system automatically fallbacks to the zk-rollup security. And in such case, it’s suggested to stop the TEE verifier by on-chain governance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We need enough TEE provers to ensure high availability. So the L2 should give some basic incentive to the TEE provers. The provers can have multiple implementations and run on decentralized TEE networks (e.g. Phala Network, currently there are ~35k SGX workers available on <a href=\"https://phala.network\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Phala Network</a>).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"prover-implementation-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#prover-implementation-6\"></a>Prover Implementation</h3>\n<p>Since the prover doesn’t need to generate the real ZK proof. We can run the Polygon zkEVM prover in the mock mode inside TEE. It will sync the blockchain from L1 (or DA), rebuild the L2 database, and reproduce the state root for each L2 block. We can easily produce block proofs by signing the every newly calculated state root with <code>sk</code>. It’s proven by Flashbots team that running a Ethereum node in Intel SGX is possible.</p>\n<p>It’s also possible to move the L2 database out from SGX to minimize the memory footprint of the prover.

Discussions emerged within the community around safety and account abstraction alternatives. This dissection discusses the most prominent AA proposals and evaluates their advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>The overall goal is to enhance the user experience when interacting with the Polygon network through batching (e.g., approve + swap in one transaction), transaction sponsoring and more advanced account abstraction applications.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#overview-2\"></a>Overview</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"eip-3074-auth-authcallhttpseipsethereumorgeipseip-3074what-to-sign-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#eip-3074-auth-authcallhttpseipsethereumorgeipseip-3074what-to-sign-3\"></a><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074#what-to-sign\">EIP-3074: AUTH &amp; AUTHCALL</a></h2>\n<p>EIP-3074 introduces two new EVM instructions: <code>AUTH</code> and <code>AUTHCALL</code>. Using a ECDSA signatures, an EOA can delegate control over itself to a smart contract. The smart contract can then execute arbitrary code on behalf of the EOA.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"eip-5806-delegate-transaction-typehttpseipsethereumorgeipseip-5806-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#eip-5806-delegate-transaction-typehttpseipsethereumorgeipseip-5806-4\"></a><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5806\">EIP-5806: Delegate transaction type</a></h2>\n<p>EIP-5806 introduces a new transaction type that operates similarly to <code>DELEGATECALL</code> within a smart contract. This allows an EOA to delegatecall a smart contract which can execute arbitrary code on behalf of an EOA.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rip-7560-native-account-abstractionhttpsgithubcomethereumripsblobmasterripsrip-7560md-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rip-7560-native-account-abstractionhttpsgithubcomethereumripsblobmasterripsrip-7560md-5\"></a><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7560.md\">RIP-7560: Native Account Abstraction</a></h2>\n<p>RIP-7560 proposes to enshrine account abstraction while remaining backwards compatible with <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337\">ERC-4337</a> and allowing existing smart contract wallets implementing this standard to upgrade to native account abstraction.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pros-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#pros-6\"></a>Pros</h1>\n<p>All three proposals enable UX improvements for users in one way or another such as batching capabilities or gas sponsoring.</p>\n<p>EIP-5806, through the delegatecall transaction type allows a user to execute arbitrary code using a smart contract. This allows for batching capabilities for example where a smart contract could accept multiple transactions from an EOA and execute them back to back, like an approval transaction and a swap on a DEX, without the need for multiple transactions. Most functionalities that can be achieved by a smart contract (except for data storage and deployment of new smart contracts) can be achieved by EOAs too with EIP-5806.</p>\n<p>EIP-3074 expands upon the functionality of EIP-5806 by supporting gas sponsoring, meaning under EIP-3074, an EOA no longer needs to hold the native gas token in order to pay for transactions. Instead of delegating control over itself to a smart contract using a transaction, this proposal uses a signature. This allows for far more advanced use cases such as signing over control of an EOA to a video game for the duration of 30 minutes while only allowing the executing smart contract to manage in game assets of the account. EIP-3074 is also built in a future-proof way to enable more advanced functionalities like alternative signature schemes, smart contract accounts and the ability to send native gas tokens in the future.</p>\n<p>RIP-7560 builds on top of ERC-4337 so advanced account abstraction features like key rotation or social recovery are already available using ERC-4337 today. RIP-7560 acts as an intermediary step to full account abstraction and adds two main functionalities, gas sponsoring for EOAs and a decentralised mempool for account abstraction transactions.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"cons-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#cons-7\"></a>Cons</h1>\n<p>For both, EIP-5806 and EIP-3074, allowing a smart contract to execute arbitrary code on behalf of the EOA comes with their own set of risks. Wallet drainers have become the primary choice of scammers and phishers because they rely on the user to blindly hand over assets by signing a transaction or message. Usually, a single signature is required to steal one specific asset. With arbitrary code execution, all assets held in a single account could be compromised with a single signature of a transaction or message.</p>\n<p>When it comes to functionality, EIP-5806 does not allow for gas sponsoring, so EOAs still always need to own the native gas token in order to be able to pay for transactions. While RIP-7560 offers advanced functionality to EOAs like gas sponsoring and validity time ranges, it’s missing a lot of additional functionality like batching.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"mitigations-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#mitigations-8\"></a>Mitigations</h3>\n<p>Mitigation of drainer risk is being tackled by wallets already today. Many wallets already alert users of phishing sites and simulate transactions in advance to display users the in and outflows of funds as a result of the transaction. Additionally wallets display reputation scores and associate risks with smart contracts a user wants to interact with. The capabilities of wallet applications will only get better over time, mitigating a lot of the risks for EIP-5806 and EIP-3074.</p>\n<p>Blind signing is already prohibited by most wallets due to security concerns, so special support for EIP-3074 would be required. As detailed in the EIP choosing invoker contracts that execute transactions on behalf of the EOA should be treated like choosing smart contract wallet implementations. They should be thoroughly reviewed, tested and accepted by the community. Wallet applications can leverage their existing infrastructure to warn or block users from interacting with untrusted smart contracts.</p>\n<p>As for the limited functionality of account abstraction transactions in RIP-7560, EOAs can migrate their assets to an ERC-4337 wallet that enables the full account abstraction functionality. However, this is something that can already be done today and does not require RIP-7560.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"implementation-challenges-maintenance-devx-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#implementation-challenges-maintenance-devx-9\"></a>Implementation challenges, maintenance &amp; DevX</h1>\n<p>Each account abstraction proposal comes with their own set of changes to the EVM that need to be implemented, maintained as well as might affect developers building non AA use cases on top of Polygon. These changes can also affect infrastructure providers like block explorers and wallet applications.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"client-modifications-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#client-modifications-10\"></a>Client modifications</h3>\n<p>EIP-3074 only requires changes to the EVM execution environment to handle the new opcodes <code>AUTH</code> and <code>AUTHCALL</code>.</p>\n<p>EIP-5806 requires changes to the client to support the new delegatecall transaction type. An alternative mempool is not required most likely, due to the similarity of delegatecall transactions to type 2 transactions.</p>\n<p>RIP-7560 requires the biggest changes to the client by far. A new decentralised mempool is required for the introduced <code>AA_TX_TYPE</code> transaction type. Additionally, RPC endpoints need to be modified to support the new transaction type and new RPC endpoints need to be added.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"devtooling-and-wallet-interaction-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#devtooling-and-wallet-interaction-11\"></a>Devtooling and Wallet interaction.</h3>\n<p>EIP-3074 should not affect the majority of developers, as the standard Solidity compiler should still work for all applications. For developers building on top of EIP-3074 a Solidity version needs to be patched that implements both new opcodes. With every new release of Solidity it is recommended to release new patched versions supporting EIP-3074. When it comes to testing smart contracts, the local nodes used by Hardhat and Foundry do not support EIP-3074 yet. A patched version could be offered to developers as well or efforts could be made to work with Foundry and the Nomic Foundation to enable this functionality. When it comes to wallet interactions, ECDSA signatures are already supported by all wallets. As previously mentioned additional safeguards should be added to protect users.</p>\n<p>EIP-5806 and RIP-7560 introduce new transaction types that are not supported by common libraries to interact with EVM networks such as web3.js and ethers.js. To support the new transaction types, developers would need to call RPC methods manually to submit transactions until the libraries support the implemented proposal natively.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"infrastructure-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#infrastructure-12\"></a>Infrastructure</h3>\n<p>Infrastructure like block explorers and indexers would most likely not support the proposals out of the box and would need custom implementations to support them.</p>\n<p>Transactions utilising EIP-3074 should not really affect existing infrastructure, as there are no major changes to the execution of transactions. Emitted events and calls which are mainly used to index data on chain would remain the same. Block explorers would need to add support for patched Solidity versions in order to be able to verify smart contracts using the new introduced opcodes.</p>\n<p>The new transaction types introduces in EIP-5086 and RIP-7560 would require custom implementations by block explorers in order to display these transactions properly to the user.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"potential-future-conflicts-with-ethereum-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#potential-future-conflicts-with-ethereum-13\"></a>Potential future conflicts with Ethereum</h1>\n<p>The addition of new transaction types and opcodes could conflict with future EIPs implemented on Ethereum. If there is an overlap, this could create issues with infrastructure providers like wallets, that need to implement special edge cases for the Polygon network. This section analyses changes made to the execution environment of each proposal, their potential conflicts and mitigation plans.</p>\n<p>If Polygon implements EIP-3074 there is a risk that Ethereum implements another EIP before EIP-3074 that uses the same opcodes as <code>AUTH (0xf6)</code> and <code>AUTHCALL (0xf7)</code>. This would mean that compiling a smart contract targeted at Ethereum would behave differently on Polygon. Fortunately,  new opcodes are rarely introduced in EIPs, only two EIPs (2997 &amp; 5478) use the same opcode slot and both are stagnant, so the risk of this happening is low.</p>\n<p>There are multiple EIPs proposing new transaction types with the ID ≥ 0x04. If Polygon were to implement EIP-5806 with transaction type 4 for example, but RIP-7560 would be accepted first on Ethereum, this would likely break many different integrations for Polygon. Similarly, if Polygon tried to avoid such a scenario by assigning a different transaction type identifier but EIP-5806 would be implemented on Ethereum using transaction type 4, the same transaction type would use two different identifiers on different networks likely causing similar problems.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"rollback-the-upgrade-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rollback-the-upgrade-14\"></a>Rollback the upgrade</h1>\n<p>Regardless of what proposal will be implemented on Polygon, a scenario where a different proposal becomes the standard across the EVM ecosystems might become reality. In such a scenario the selected proposal might see little to no usage on Polygon and add overhead over time. In this case it might make sense to remove the support for the proposal again to align with the wider Ethereum ecosystem and reduce complexity for future upgrades. This section explores potential issues that could arise from such a rollback of functionality.</p>\n<p>Should EIP-3074 become obsolete, the implementation of <code>AUTH</code> and <code>AUTHCALL</code> could likely be deleted from the EVM implementation without a larger impact. Smart contracts using EIP-3074 would no longer work and revert, but because EOAs delegate execution to these smart contracts only, no funds would be at risk.</p>\n<p>If EIP-5806 functionality is removed, smart contracts used for transaction delegation would still be functional and could be called normally. Depending on the implementation of the contracts, regular transactions to these contracts might still succeed but result in stuck funds, because the call is no longer delegated.</p>\n<p>Due to the complexity of RIP-7560 as well as the ability of smart contracts to send <code>AA_TX_TYPE</code> transactions, it is likely not feasible to roll back the upgrade and might result in stuck funds.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"functional-evaluation-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#functional-evaluation-15\"></a>Functional evaluation</h1>\n<p>In the quest to seamlessly integrate the next billion users into the crypto ecosystem, the interface and interaction layer must evolve to become so intuitive and user-friendly that users may not even realise they are using a wallet. While EIP-5806 and RIP-7560 offer significant improvements for current users, they seem to primarily cater to this existing audience, improving their experiences rather than revolutionising access for new entrants. EIP-5806’s lack of gas sponsoring capabilities requires applications to continuously ensure their users’ wallets are sufficiently funded with gas tokens. For RIP-7560 to unleash its full capabilities, it requires applications to deploy ERC-4337 smart contract wallets on behalf of their users to leverage the advanced features offered by RIP-7560.</p>\n<p>EIP-3074 stands out by enabling straightforward transaction sponsorship, effectively removing a significant barrier for end-users. It provides flexibility in execution, which is important for the development of non-custodial applications across various domains, such as investment platforms or gaming, that might employ MPC wallets integrated with social logins. In such scenarios, the conventional concerns regarding blind signing diminish, as the application assumes complete oversight of the user’s assets during their active session.</p>\n<p>In summary, while EIP-5806 and RIP-7560 enhance the experience for current blockchain users by addressing specific limitations, EIP-3074 presents a more holistic solution aimed at broadening crypto’s appeal and accessibility.</p>\n            <p><small>19 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/account-abstraction-proposals-comparison/13595\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/account-abstraction-proposals-comparison/13595","pubDate":"Wed, 28 Feb 2024 13:35:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13595"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/account-abstraction-proposals-comparison/13595.rss","#text":"Account Abstraction Proposals Comparison"}},{"title":"zkEVM: The Elderberry upgrade is on testnet","dc:creator":"J_Nicolas","category":"Announcements","description":"<p>Following the post from last week, the 10-day timelock for upgrading Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta was initiated at 1PM CET.

If you have questions, though, post them below and we’ll get the gigabrains on the Polygon zkEVM team to reply.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s in Elderberry?</strong> Important optimizations to the ROM that will reduce certain out of counter errors on the network and some additional fixes to last month’s <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-zkevm-the-etrog-upgrade-is-live-on-mainnet\">Etrog upgrade</a>. The ROM interprets the execution logic of all transactions and all opcodes for Polygon zkEVM—it is to Polygon zkEVM what the EVM Interpreter is to Ethereum. (For more on the ROM, see <a href=\"https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/architecture/zkprover/main-state-machine/?h=rom\">the Polygon Knowledge Layer</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>How can you independently verify the upgrade?</strong> Instructions can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts/blob/develop/verifyMainnetDeployment/verifyMainnetProofVerifier.md\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Elderberry upgrade is available on the Cardona (Sepolia) testnet.</strong> Here’s how to connect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Network Name: Polygon zkEVM Cardona Testnet</li>\n<li>Bridge UI: <a href=\"https://bridge-ui.cardona.zkevm-rpc.com\">https://bridge-ui.cardona.zkevm-rpc.com</a></li>\n<li>RPC URL: <a href=\"https://rpc.cardona.zkevm-rpc.com\">https://rpc.cardona.zkevm-rpc.com</a></li>\n<li>Chain ID: 2442</li>\n<li>Currency symbol: ETH</li>\n<li>Block Explorer: <a href=\"https://cardona-zkevm.polygonscan.com/\">https://cardona-zkevm.polygonscan.com/</a></li>\n<li>Faucet: <a href=\"https://faucet.polygon.technology/\">https://faucet.polygon.technology/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>When will Elderberry go live on mainnet?</strong> Assuming the network is stable, Elderberry will likely go live on mainnet around March 07.</p>\n<p><strong>Do I need to do anything once it’s live?</strong> It depends. If you’re an infra dev that helps maintain network infrastructure, you’ll need to update to the latest versions of the node, prover, and bridge service. We’ll update this post with those links, once they’re available. If you’re a dApp dev or end user, you won’t need to take any action. Everything from your perspective will be the same.</p>\n<p>We’ll update this post once the Elderberry upgrade is live on mainnet.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/zkevm-the-elderberry-upgrade-is-on-testnet/13588\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/zkevm-the-elderberry-upgrade-is-on-testnet/13588","pubDate":"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 17:30:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13588"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/zkevm-the-elderberry-upgrade-is-on-testnet/13588.rss","#text":"zkEVM: The Elderberry upgrade is on testnet"}}]}}}
