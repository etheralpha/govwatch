To address this issue, we propose patching the bug &amp; introducing the ability to replay failed state syncs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-2\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLDR: Plasma MATIC deposits revert with out of gas when the receiver is a GnosisSafe contract because it uses <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/main/contracts/child/MRC20.sol#L44\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">transfer instead of call</a> when sending MATIC (native on child) and the fallback required more than 2300 gas (and more recently <a href=\"https://help.safe.global/en/articles/40813-why-can-t-i-transfer-eth-from-a-contract-into-a-safe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2600</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>MATIC deposits occur via the plasma bridge, wherein a user holding MATIC on L1 calls <strong><code>depositERC20()</code></strong> on the Plasma bridge <strong><code>DepositManager</code></strong>. This action emits a State Sync, which is picked up by validators and executed on L2. This state sync triggers the <strong><code>StateReceiver</code></strong> on L2, which, after the necessary validations, calls the <strong><code>deposit</code></strong> method on the childToken (MATIC(0x00…1010) in this instance).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">    function deposit(address user, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {\n\t... // perform necessary checks and log effects\n\n        // interaction: transfer amount to user\n        _user.transfer(amount); // &lt;-- the bug\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t...\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This contract utilizes the built-in Solidity transfer method, which limits the available transferred gas to 2300. Before the Berlin Hardfork, this amount was generally sufficient for most contracts. However, post-Berlin Hardfork, accessing a contract for the first time (which occurs when MATIC is moved to an account that is a contract) incurs gas costs of 2600, resulting in a failure with an <code>out of gas</code> revert.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Gas costs before Berlin hardfork</p>\n<p>Access account: 700 gas</p>\n<p>Read storage slot: 800 gas</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gas costs after Berlin hardfork</p>\n<p>Access account:</p>\n<p>First time per address in tx: 2600 gas</p>\n<p>Any additional time in tx: 100 gas</p>\n<p>Read storage slot:</p>\n<p>First time per storage slot in tx: 2100 gas</p>\n<p>Any additional time in tx: 100 gas</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This issue also exists in Ethereum, leading to the inclusion of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-2390.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-2930</a> alongside <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2929.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-2929</a> to mitigate such occurrences. EIP-2930 introduces an access list, prepaying gas for any address or storage slot on the list, thus reducing runtime costs to 100 gas. This solution addresses the problem of insufficient gas availability when transferring ETH from one contract to another using default Solidity methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that this is a special case for the MATIC token only and not any other <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-20.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20</a> token as this token has the unique property of being a native token on L2.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>This PIP proposes to patch the transfer vs send bug mentioned above by updating the bytecode of MRC-20 MATIC token on L2 through a hardfork.

This will be a very small merkle tree of depth 5, where the leaf’s will be the keccak(abi.encode(stateId, receiver, calldata)) [stateId provides sufficient collision resistance].</p>\n<p>An external method on StateReceiver will be exposed: <code>retryStateSync(uint stateId, bytes calldata stateSyncData, bytes32[5] calldata merkeProof)</code> which nullifies the leaf on successful state syncs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"observability-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#observability-4\"></a>Observability</h3>\n<p>The overall observability of the plasma bridge would increase with this update.<br>\nThe main improvement is that failed state syncs would be recorded.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"backward-compatibility-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#backward-compatibility-5\"></a>Backward Compatibility</h3>\n<p>As the contract impacted by this PIP is not upgradeable, the changes would require a hardfork.</p>\n<p>The L2 contracts being upgraded would be the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>StateReceiver: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001</li>\n<li>MRC-20(Matic Token): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"security-considerations-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#security-considerations-6\"></a>Security Considerations</h3>\n<p>Internal as well as external security reviews will have to be done to ensure maximum safety.

As well as verifying contribution efforts the individual contribution log approach also had a number of other use cases that could be highly valuable for contributors and Web3 ecosystems.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/7/76ed022328b930e61765d24be2a8ac395e74ea6b.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/76ed022328b930e61765d24be2a8ac395e74ea6b\" title=\"individual-monthly-contribution-logs\"><img src=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/7/76ed022328b930e61765d24be2a8ac395e74ea6b.png\" alt=\"individual-monthly-contribution-logs\" data-base62-sha1=\"gY4821uhRsbWSOa1jigv6UUlOZ5\" width=\"498\" height=\"375\" data-dominant-color=\"DDDAE3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Advantages of individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved contribution verification</strong> - It is more difficult to hide poor contribution performance if efforts are recorded individually and at the end of every month. Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved decision making</strong> - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Retaining top performers</strong> - Some ideas and teams won’t produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher self awareness &amp; accountability</strong> - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowers individual contributors</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.</li>\n<li><strong>Removed intermediaries</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone’s compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible information usage</strong> - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source contribution data</strong> - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Self sovereign identity adoption</strong> - Individual contribution logs can be tied to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust based networks</strong> - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they’ve built and the common connections they share.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Read our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution verification and contribution logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/approaches/contribution-verification-approaches\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification approaches</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Experimentation in Polygon</strong></p>\n<p>Individual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants process or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to start building up their own reputation. Idea funding and contributor funding could both experiment with individual contribution logs.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Further investigation</strong></p>\n<p>These is an opportunity to create more tooling that could enable individual contributors to easily record and present their contribution efforts. Contribution logs could become increasingly useful and reliable for contributors to build their reputation in the ecosystem and for voters when making funding decisions.</p>\n<p>In the comings months the Web3 Association is going to look at what tooling already exists that could be used and then explore what new tools could be created to make it easier to record and present contribution efforts. We’re especially interested in improving the exposure and presentation of code contributions, this is an area of high relevance to our <a href=\"https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">open source contributor proposal</a> that has been recently shared.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Community discussion</strong></p>\n<p>Share any feedback and thoughts you have around the topic of contribution verification and the different approaches we’ve explored in our analysis.

These keys are crucial for the validator to sign PoS commitments and votes. The validity of these public keys is confirmed against the corresponding Ethereum log in the StakeInfo contract. This process is meant to ensure that the public key aligns with the one selected by the validator.</p>\n<p>However, a complication arises due to an implementation nuance in the secp256k1 library utilized in Heimdall/Peppermint. Public keys must include an additional prefix byte, making them a total of 65 bytes long. Unfortunately, Heimdall does not verify the first byte of the public key in any message. This contrasts with the secp256k1 signature validation, which requires the prefix to be 0x04, 0x06, or 0x07; otherwise, validation fails.</p>\n<p>The sole validation performed on the public key bytes is to ensure that the slice pubkey[1:] matches the 64-byte public key from the Ethereum log. The initial byte provided in the message is merely copied and stored without validation. Additionally, attempting to verify the address generated by hashing the public key proves futile, as the address is derived from the truncated hash of the 64-byte public key, once again disregarding the prefix byte.</p>\n<p>As a result of this lack of validation, whenever a new validator joins the network or an existing validator updates their signing key, a malicious actor can exploit the situation by submitting a message containing a corrupted version of the public key for that validator, such as setting the first byte to 0xff.</p>\n<p>This corrupted message will be readily accepted and verified by all validators, including the victim validator. Consequently, each validator will store the corrupted public key. Subsequently, when the victim validator attempts to send a commitment or proposal, all other validators will attempt to verify the signature using the corrupted key, leading to constant verification failures.</p>\n<p>This situation renders the victim validator incapable of participating in the PoS protocol until the signing key is updated again, a process that takes 100 epochs. Moreover, even after updating the signing key, the attacker can simply repeat the attack.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"resolution-and-recovery-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#resolution-and-recovery-3\"></a>Resolution and Recovery</h2>\n<p>A patch was successfully released on March 14th 2024, with Heimdall <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v1.0.5\">tag v1.0.5</a>. It consists of one <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/pull/1149\">main PR</a>, where a new method has been introduced. The function, called <code>IsPubKeyFirstByteValid</code> checks the first byte of the validator’s public key every time a <code>SignerUpdate</code> or a <code>ValidatorJoin</code> event is invoked. It basically validates that the first byte of the public key is <code>0x04</code>, which stands for “uncompressed public key”, the format used by Polygon PoS nodes. The unit tests confirmed the validity of this new method.</p>\n<p>The patch was first tested on a devnet, then tested and rolled out on Mumbai and Mainnet nodes. A release announcement was shared, allowing all the validators to upgrade.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 14:50:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13780"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780.rss","#text":"Heimdall Security Bug Fix"}},{"title":"Recent Downtime on Astar zkEVM","dc:creator":"J_Nicolas","category":"Announcements","description":"<p>Earlier this week, an outage on Astar zkEVM required an emergency upgrade of the network.
