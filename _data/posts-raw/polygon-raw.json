The miner gas price is the minimum tip given to miners to validate transactions, while the transaction pool price limit is the lower bound to accept a tx in the pool.</p>\n<p>These parameters also prevent spam transactions from overburdening the mempool, which could create DDOS attack vectors. Moreover, a third parameter allows the network to define a gas price threshold, below which the gas price oracle will ignore transactions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>Currently, heterogeneous implementations for such parameters mean that when a validator with a lower gas price is the primary block producer, the required priority fee starts decreasing, as reflected in gas trackers.</p>\n<p>Users can submit txs with a lower gas price and such txs could get stuck in the txpool for a long time (if these txs are not immediately executed by the current validator), as the next validator/primary producer might require a much higher gas price.</p>\n<p>This feature will help improve the UX and make it more uniform by eliminating client-level config for such parameters and instead adding them as part of the protocol hardcoded params, with a default value of <code>30gwei</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p><code>txpool</code>, <code>eth</code> and <code>miner</code> modules are affected:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>txpool.pricelimit</code>: Minimum gas price limit to enforce the acceptance of txs into the pool (default: <code>30000000000</code>).</li>\n<li><code>miner.gasprice</code>: Minimum gas price for mining a transaction (default: <code>30000000000</code>).</li>\n<li><code>gpo.ignoreprice</code>: Gas price below which gpo will ignore transactions (default: <code>30000000000</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a new backend is initialized at startup in he client, some utility functions will check for such values, and enforce them to be <code>30gwei</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"backward-compatibility-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#backward-compatibility-5\"></a>Backward Compatibility</h3>\n<p>This change causes no backward incompatibilities.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-35-mingas-increase/13856\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-35-mingas-increase/13856","pubDate":"Tue, 30 Apr 2024 11:33:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13856"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-35-mingas-increase/13856.rss","#text":"PIP-35 MinGas Increase"}},{"title":"Polygon Village | Introduce Yourself","dc:creator":"pablot","category":"Introduce Yourself","description":"<p><strong>Basic Introduction:</strong><br>\nWhat’s your name (or username), and where are you from? pablot<br>\nWhat drew you to the world of blockchain and Web3? crypto</p>\n<p><strong>Professional Background:</strong><br>\nPlease share a bit about your professional background and current occupation.<br>\nHow do you see your skills and experiences contributing to your Web3 journey?<br>\nim skilled</p>\n<p><strong>Interests in Web3:</strong><br>\nWhat specific areas of Web3 are you most passionate about (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Gaming)?<br>\nnft<br>\nAre there any projects or technologies in Web3 that you find particularly exciting or innovative?<br>\nlayer3</p>\n<p><strong>Current Projects:</strong><br>\nAre you currently working on any Web3 projects?

Alternatively contribution efforts could also be recorded by each individual in monthly time intervals.</p>\n<p>After looking at the problems and opportunities for making group based contribution logs as well as individual contribution logs, we identified that individual contribution logs were the most promising approach worth considering. As well as verifying contribution efforts the individual contribution log approach also had a number of other use cases that could be highly valuable for contributors and Web3 ecosystems.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/7/76ed022328b930e61765d24be2a8ac395e74ea6b.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/76ed022328b930e61765d24be2a8ac395e74ea6b\" title=\"individual-monthly-contribution-logs\"><img src=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/7/76ed022328b930e61765d24be2a8ac395e74ea6b.png\" alt=\"individual-monthly-contribution-logs\" data-base62-sha1=\"gY4821uhRsbWSOa1jigv6UUlOZ5\" width=\"498\" height=\"375\" data-dominant-color=\"DDDAE3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Advantages of individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved contribution verification</strong> - It is more difficult to hide poor contribution performance if efforts are recorded individually and at the end of every month. Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved decision making</strong> - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Retaining top performers</strong> - Some ideas and teams won’t produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher self awareness &amp; accountability</strong> - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowers individual contributors</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.</li>\n<li><strong>Removed intermediaries</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone’s compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible information usage</strong> - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source contribution data</strong> - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Self sovereign identity adoption</strong> - Individual contribution logs can be tied to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust based networks</strong> - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they’ve built and the common connections they share.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Read our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution verification and contribution logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/approaches/contribution-verification-approaches\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification approaches</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Experimentation in Polygon</strong></p>\n<p>Individual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants process or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to start building up their own reputation. Idea funding and contributor funding could both experiment with individual contribution logs.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Further investigation</strong></p>\n<p>These is an opportunity to create more tooling that could enable individual contributors to easily record and present their contribution efforts. Contribution logs could become increasingly useful and reliable for contributors to build their reputation in the ecosystem and for voters when making funding decisions.</p>\n<p>In the comings months the Web3 Association is going to look at what tooling already exists that could be used and then explore what new tools could be created to make it easier to record and present contribution efforts.

Seeking Insights and Connections"}},{"title":"Heimdall Security Bug Fix","dc:creator":"Parvez03","category":"General","description":"<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>A Security bug on Heimdall was previously reported and confirmed via the Bug Bounty Program. Under highly specific – and very unlikely – conditions being met, the bug could have potentially allowed a malicious actor to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Heimdall network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"root-cause-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#root-cause-2\"></a>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>Heimdall needs to acquire specific public keys, which are contained in two messages (ValidatorJoin, SignerUpdate). These keys are crucial for the validator to sign PoS commitments and votes. The validity of these public keys is confirmed against the corresponding Ethereum log in the StakeInfo contract. This process is meant to ensure that the public key aligns with the one selected by the validator.</p>\n<p>However, a complication arises due to an implementation nuance in the secp256k1 library utilized in Heimdall/Peppermint. Public keys must include an additional prefix byte, making them a total of 65 bytes long. Unfortunately, Heimdall does not verify the first byte of the public key in any message. This contrasts with the secp256k1 signature validation, which requires the prefix to be 0x04, 0x06, or 0x07; otherwise, validation fails.</p>\n<p>The sole validation performed on the public key bytes is to ensure that the slice pubkey[1:] matches the 64-byte public key from the Ethereum log. The initial byte provided in the message is merely copied and stored without validation. Additionally, attempting to verify the address generated by hashing the public key proves futile, as the address is derived from the truncated hash of the 64-byte public key, once again disregarding the prefix byte.</p>\n<p>As a result of this lack of validation, whenever a new validator joins the network or an existing validator updates their signing key, a malicious actor can exploit the situation by submitting a message containing a corrupted version of the public key for that validator, such as setting the first byte to 0xff.</p>\n<p>This corrupted message will be readily accepted and verified by all validators, including the victim validator. Consequently, each validator will store the corrupted public key. Subsequently, when the victim validator attempts to send a commitment or proposal, all other validators will attempt to verify the signature using the corrupted key, leading to constant verification failures.</p>\n<p>This situation renders the victim validator incapable of participating in the PoS protocol until the signing key is updated again, a process that takes 100 epochs. Moreover, even after updating the signing key, the attacker can simply repeat the attack.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"resolution-and-recovery-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#resolution-and-recovery-3\"></a>Resolution and Recovery</h2>\n<p>A patch was successfully released on March 14th 2024, with Heimdall <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v1.0.5\">tag v1.0.5</a>. It consists of one <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/pull/1149\">main PR</a>, where a new method has been introduced. The function, called <code>IsPubKeyFirstByteValid</code> checks the first byte of the validator’s public key every time a <code>SignerUpdate</code> or a <code>ValidatorJoin</code> event is invoked. It basically validates that the first byte of the public key is <code>0x04</code>, which stands for “uncompressed public key”, the format used by Polygon PoS nodes. The unit tests confirmed the validity of this new method.</p>\n<p>The patch was first tested on a devnet, then tested and rolled out on Mumbai and Mainnet nodes. A release announcement was shared, allowing all the validators to upgrade.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 14:50:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13780"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780.rss","#text":"Heimdall Security Bug Fix"}},{"title":"Recent Downtime on Astar zkEVM","dc:creator":"J_Nicolas","category":"Announcements","description":"<p>Earlier this week, an outage on Astar zkEVM required an emergency upgrade of the network.

This includes but isn’t limited to, creating a Community Treasury strategy and post-season impact reports, approving grants and expenses, and managing a budget.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>The CTB is an independent body responsible for shepherding the Polygon Community Treasury. It should comprise thought leaders and experts in ecosystem growth and grant operations. Members must be familiar with ecosystem trends and opportunities and able to formulate a compelling thesis to support their strategic decisions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ctb-qualifications-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#ctb-qualifications-4\"></a>CTB Qualifications</h3>\n<p>Among others, the following qualifications are needed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Value Alignment with the Polygon vision and Wider Ethereum and Web3 Values— CTB members should be aligned with Polygon, follow Ethereum’s ethos, and be aligned with general Web3 values, such as decentralization, self-sovereignty, and unconstrained access to the Internet of Value.</li>\n<li>Ecosystem Growth Expertise— CTB will be critical in guiding both early seasons to success via strategy-setting and working on the framework’s evolution towards more efficient and decentralized growth strategies.</li>\n<li>Specific Field Expertise—CTB members will ultimately assess the value of individual projects and allocators to the development of the Polygon ecosystem. As such, they need to possess the skills necessary to assess these efforts well or delegate them to other collaborators they deem qualified.</li>\n<li>Community Expertise—The Polygon ecosystem is at a pivotal moment as it builds a strong community ready to advance it even further. Prospective CTB members need to be able to leverage this effort as an opportunity for long-term ecosystem growth.</li>\n<li>Operational Expertise—Operating the CT is a significant undertaking that requires CTB members to have operational expertise to spin up large programs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"ctb-responsibilities-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#ctb-responsibilities-5\"></a>CTB Responsibilities</h3>\n<p>The Community Treasury Board will be able to determine its procedures to address the following responsibilities.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"strategy-setting-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#strategy-setting-6\"></a>Strategy Setting</h4>\n<p>Before a funding cycle starts, CTB prepares and publishes a strategy document. The document sets out a framework for project funding categories, subcategories, and the eligibility of each funding track in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>Pre-cycle preparation is accomplished when the CTB produces a final strategy delineating the above-described allocations. This strategy is published transparently.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"track-selection-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#track-selection-7\"></a>Track Selection</h4>\n<p>This proposal distinguishes two tracks, which the CTB may employ as needed on a per-season basis by including in the strategy document.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct Funding Track</strong></p>\n<p>The direct funding track facilitates submissions from individual projects to the CTB. All prospective grantees will require CTB approval to receive funding from the CT, following a process laid out by the CTB.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Allocator track</strong></p>\n<p>The Grant Allocator track relies on specialized entities facilitating the distribution of allocated funds to grantees. Similarly to individual projects, prospective Grant Allocators will follow a process laid out by the Community Treasury Board.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"expenditure-approval-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#expenditure-approval-8\"></a>Expenditure Approval</h4>\n<p>At all times, the CTB is responsible for reviewing applications from all tracks and approving all expenditures from the Community Treasury, assisted by the Polygon Village Grants team as needed. The Village Grants team may propose funding proposals, but CTB approval is always final and necessary.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"post-cycle-reporting-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#post-cycle-reporting-9\"></a>Post-Cycle Reporting</h4>\n<p>Post-cycle, the CTB is responsible for producing a transparency report capturing the decisions, expenses, and the total impact across all participating Grant Allocators. The transparency report may summarize the decisions around individual projects funded within the season, and any learnings from the season.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"allocation-technical-flow-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#allocation-technical-flow-10\"></a>Allocation - Technical Flow</h3>\n<p>In the current phase, the Polygon Village Grants team will assist with Community Treasury operations, aggregating approved applications and the preparation of corresponding on-chain transactions. A set of on-chain mechanisms is proposed to facilitate the flow of funds.</p>\n<p>The address of the current interim SAFE contract, introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-17.md\">PIP-17</a> and to which Community Treasury emissions stream to, is <code>0x2ff25495d77f380d5F65B95F103181aE8b1cf898</code>.</p>\n<p>A new governance contract (Governor Bravo) is proposed that will govern the Community Treasury. At the core is a timelock controller, which holds funds and executes transactions. The timelock also allows for upgrades to the governance structure itself.</p>\n<p>Governor Bravo contracts will be used with voting ERC-721 SBTs held by two SAFE contracts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>PROPOSER</code> ERC-721 SBT held by [address to be added] multisig wallet operated by Polygon Labs</li>\n<li><code>EXECUTOR</code> ERC-721 SBT held by [address to be added] ⅗ consensus multisig wallet operated by the Community Treasury Board</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any transaction execution, both of the above SBTs will be necessary - <code>PROPOSER</code> SBT responsible for putting forward an on-chain transaction, and <code>EXECUTOR</code> SBT responsible for voting in favor, consequently executing the transaction (or rejecting in case of an <code>against</code> vote).</p>\n<p>The above setup ensures that while Polygon Labs may assist the Community Treasury Board with day-to-day administrative and other non-managerial operations, it may not execute any transactions, including the distribution of funds, without the CTB’s on-chain approval.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"compensation-to-initial-ctb-members-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#compensation-to-initial-ctb-members-11\"></a>Compensation to Initial CTB Members</h3>\n<p>Each of the initial CTB members will receive a monthly payment equal to $5,000 USD, payable in POL, from the Community Treasury, calculated using the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon-ecosystem-token/historical_data\">Coingecko Historical POL Close Price</a> as of the last day of each month (or a pro-rata portion thereof for any partial month service).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"copyright-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#copyright-12\"></a>Copyright</h2>\n<p>All copyrights and related rights in this work are waived under CC0 1.0 Universal.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-2-community-treasury-board/13760\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-2-community-treasury-board/13760","pubDate":"Thu, 11 Apr 2024 13:00:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13760"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-2-community-treasury-board/13760.rss","#text":"PFP-2: Community Treasury Board"}},{"title":"PFP-1: Polygon Funding Proposal Framework","dc:creator":"0xJustice","category":"Polygon Funding Proposals","description":"<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>PFP</th>\n<th>Title</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Author</th>\n<th>Discussion</th>\n<th>Status</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Date</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-01.md\">1</a></td>\n<td>PFP Purpose and Guidelines</td>\n<td>Describes PFP processes for the Polygon Community Treasury</td>\n<td>Mateusz Rzeszowski, Justice Conder, Bojana Tomic, Mihailo Bjelic</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/\">Forum</a></td>\n<td>Continuous</td>\n<td>Informational</td>\n<td>2024-04-11</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><hr>\n<h1><a name=\"pfp-1-polygon-funding-proposal-frameworkhttpsgithubcom0xpolygonpolygon-funding-proposalsblobmainpfpspfp-01md-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#pfp-1-polygon-funding-proposal-frameworkhttpsgithubcom0xpolygonpolygon-funding-proposalsblobmainpfpspfp-01md-1\"></a><a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-01.md\">PFP-1: Polygon Funding Proposal Framework</a></h1>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Community Treasury is an in-protocol fund independent from Polygon Labs (and other Polygon entities), governed via a framework that aims to enable community participation. It is designed and introduced to provide ongoing economic support for further development and growth of the Polygon ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Funded via a dedicated POL token emission stream, the Treasury provides strong ecosystem support during the period of early adoption, which is critical for the development, growth, and positioning of the Polygon ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Polygon Funding Proposals (PFPs), in turn, help govern the Community Treasury openly and transparently, describing processes and templates.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>In a self-sustainable and decentralized ecosystem, a framework is necessary to help gradually direct the value created by the network in a community-centered fashion.

This protection worked as expected, but the network’s synchronizer did not handle the reorg properly. Instead of just updating a record, in this case it inserted a new record. The sequencer then inserted a new Global Exit Root at batch 2005906. While this Global Exit Root was correct, it took an index that it was one greater than what it should be.</p>\n<p>When this batch was inserted in L1, the selected index still didn’t exist, causing it to be interpreted as invalid.</p>\n<p>In summary, the network’s trusted state included this batch as valid while the virtual state considered it invalid. Resolving this required re-execution of the trusted state with this block as invalid in order to build the proof. Consequently, some transactions were not executed and some transactions were re-executed with different results.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"future-mitigation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#future-mitigation-2\"></a>Future Mitigation</h2>\n<p>This is the second state synchronization issue for Polygon zkEVM. The core engineers for zkEVM have since released two independent protections, each of them robust enough to prevent L1 reorgs from causing this state synchronization issue to recur.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sequencer v0.6.5-RC6, released April 08, includes a mechanism for detecting when an L1 reorg occurs; once a reorg is detected, the network will continue operating normally, but the sequencer will temporarily stop accepting new Global Exit Roots until confirmation that the network’s state is synchronized.</li>\n<li>An additional protection was added to the synchronizer on April 09. It allows the network to synchronize from older blocks, where older blocks are a config parameter that act as a safe checkpoint.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-of-events-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#timeline-of-events-3\"></a>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p><strong>April 08, 2024</strong><br>\n<strong>02:56 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe sequencer for Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta detected a reorg at block <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/19608115\">19608115</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reorg: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/19608115/f\">https://etherscan.io/block/19608115/f</a></li>\n<li>The synchronizer failed to properly handle this reorg, inserting a new record instead of updating the existing record.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Approximately 03:00 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe sequencer inserted a new Global Exit Root at batch 2005906.

The Polygon zkEVM team was unable to reproduce these errors. On March 23, the team attempted to resolve the issue by resyncing the network using L1 sequenced data, which led to detection of two different correct Global Exit Roots.</p>\n<p>In the process of resolving this issue, the network was down for a total of 14 hours. Polygon PoS, chains built with Polygon CDK, and chains connected to the AggLayer were unaffected.</p>\n<p>Resolving the outage resulted in an emergency upgrade to the Verifier, as well as a reindexing on Etherscan and resynchronization of permissionless nodes. For dApps on Polygon zkEVM: Some transactions made on March 22 and March 23 were affected by a network reorg and may have been processed in a different block or may not have been processed—please get in touch below, if this is the case. Approximately 4,000 transactions may have been affected.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"description-of-incident-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#description-of-incident-1\"></a>Description of Incident</h2>\n<p>The network outage was caused by a reorg on the underlying L1, a relatively common situation, usually involving a depth of 1 or 2 blocks. The original version of the reorged block included a deposit transaction from Polygon zkEVM that generated an update on the Global Exit Root, which is the root of the bridge’s global exit Merkle Tree. The reorged block that followed did not include this deposit transaction.</p>\n<p>The synchronizer for Polygon zkEVM did not correctly detect this reorg and the record was not deleted or updated from the State Database for over two epochs, approximately 12 minutes. As a result, the sequencer included the incorrect Global Exit Root in the next L2 block. The actual state of the network was different from the one that was published.</p>\n<p>As a result of the reorg, many transactions following this block returned an invalid nonce. Valid proofs for these transactions were generated, but the result of these transactions were no-operation, as if they were not there. The analysis of the incident, development of the fixes, and synchronization of these no-op transactions delayed recovery of the network.</p>\n<p>Resolving these issues ultimately required putting the network into an Emergency State, a security mechanism that allows the network to be upgraded without a timelock, conditional on the approval of the Security Council. The Security Council is a 6/8 multisig, with two members from Polygon Labs. On March 24, at 23:00 UTC, the network was halted and upgraded. This is the first time that the Emergency State mechanism has been used. For more on the network’s security mechanisms, see zkEVM’s governance model: <a href=\"https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/architecture/protocol/security-council/\">Security Council</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solution-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#solution-2\"></a>Solution</h2>\n<p>Due to the invalid management of the L1 reorgs from synchronization, updated versions of the Node and Prover were released.

mainnet beta: cdk-erigon beta release</strong></p>\n<p>Happy to announce that <a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/cdk-erigon/releases/tag/v1.0.3\">1.0.3 beta release</a> of <em><strong>cdk-erigon,</strong></em> compatible with the zkEVM mainnet beta is available for partners and anyone who want to start testing it on their infrastructure.The instructions on how to run it are in the <a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/cdk-erigon/releases/tag/v1.0.3\">readme of the repository</a>, feel free to ask any questions you may have. A docker image is also <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/layers/hermeznetwork/cdk-erigon/v1.0.3/images/sha256-e98e9661e9eb0ea440104a79913107f6ff8625af5248a726e6845c0ce84b0f6b?context=explore\">available</a>. From now it is optional to use it for Cardona testnet and zkEVM mainnet, zkevm-node is still been used as RPC on our infra, cdk-erigon will soon be used as the official RPC endpoint for all networks.
