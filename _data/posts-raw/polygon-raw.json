The main focus was on PIP 22, PIP 36, PIP 30, and increasing the minimum gas price.</p>\n<p>With the inclusion list finalized, Polygon will target shipping these changes at the end of May or early June depending on testnet deployment timelines. The next PPGC meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 30 but may shift a week or two to align with the rollout.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 22 (EIP 3074)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/manav24_\">Manav Darji</a> from the Bor client team provided an update on their progress in implementing EIP 3074 style account abstraction. The Bor team has a PR open that implements the AUTH and AUTH_CALL opcodes. Over the past two weeks, they have been adding more tests and accommodating changes to match the latest spec of EIP 3074. Bor is currently testing their implementation internally on a devnet. There are patches for Solidity and Foundry available to test these new opcodes. The next step is to do as much adversarial testing as possible before deploying to Polygon’s testnet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Harry__Rook\">Harry Rook</a>, Polygon Governance PM, noted recent <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-5003-auth-usurp-publishing-code-at-an-eoa-address/8979\">discussions</a> about potentially including EIP 5003 in the fork after Pectra on Ethereum to mitigate some concerns with EIP 3074. This will likely be a topic in the next PPGC meeting.</p>\n<p>Note: EIP 3074 introduces AUTH (sets a context variable authorized based on an ECDSA signature) and AUTHCALL (sends a call as the authorized account). Through EIP 3074, control of the externally owned account (EOA) is delegated to a smart contract.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 36 (Replay Failed State Syncs)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/imderl\">Dhairya Sethi</a>, the author of PIP 36, explained that the purpose is to add the ability to replay failed state syncs until the full migration to the LXLY bridge is complete. It also patches a bug in the Matic token contract related to the gas cost increase of SLOAD in Ethereum’s Berlin hard fork which broke contracts using TRANSFER to send ETH to contracts with code in the RECEIVE or FALLBACK functions.</p>\n<p>PIP 36 aims to fix failed state syncs in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Replace TRANSFER with CALL in the Matic token contract to provide sufficient gas and prevent failed deposits when the receiver is a contract with code. This requires a hard fork since the contract is not upgradeable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the ability to replay failed state syncs, both past and future. For past failed state syncs between the Shanghai fork and, a Merkle tree will be constructed of the failed state IDs so users can prove and replay their failed state sync. For future failed state syncs, the contract will store the receiver and calldata so it can be replayed externally. Security considerations are taken to prevent reentrancy and ensure immutability of the replayed transaction.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The failed state syncs that occurred from block 38,457,210 (around Nov 30, 2023) up to the fork will be replayable.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 30 (Increase Max Code Size Limit)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidesilverman\">David Silverman</a> explained PIP 30 which proposes increasing the max code size and max initcode size by 33% to allow deploying more complex contracts. The current limits were set arbitrarily in the Spurious Dragon hard fork and developers are now frequently hitting these limits. Analysis shows this increase would not negatively impact the ZK migration plans. The intent is to slowly raise this limit, potentially moving to even higher values later in conjunction with the rollup coordination group.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Gas Price Increase</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcell033\">Marcelo Ardizzone</a> presented a new PIP to increase the default minimum gas price to 30 gwei to reduce spam transactions. Currently this is just a node client setting, not a network level parameter. Having different minimum gas prices across validators leads to transactions getting stuck if they are priced for a validator with a lower minimum.</p>\n<p>The PIP enforces the 30 gwei minimum at the network level in three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the default minimum gas price for validators to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the default gas price limit for accepting txs into the transaction pool to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the threshold below which the gas price oracle ignores transactions to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is implemented via code changes in the Bor and Erigon clients. Validators can still set custom gas parameters if desired by modifying the client code and running a custom version.</p>\n<p>With no major concerns expressed, developers seemed ready to move forward with this inclusion list for the upgrade. The Bor and Erigon teams confirmed they are okay with the proposed changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Coordination with Ethereum</strong></p>\n<p>When asked about coordination with Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade that also plans to include EIP 3074, David Silverman said the intention is for Polygon to move ahead of Ethereum on this as they have done with previous upgrades like EIP 7212. Protocol developers are working closely with rollup teams who are also implementing 3074 to maintain compatibility. The hope is that Ethereum does not intentionally try to break this compatibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>With the inclusion list finalized, protocol developers will target shipping these changes at the end of May or early June depending on testnet deployment timelines. The next PPGC meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 30 but may shift a week or two to align with the rollout.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-protocol-governance-call-ppgc-19/13946\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-protocol-governance-call-ppgc-19/13946","pubDate":"Tue, 07 May 2024 21:07:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13946"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-protocol-governance-call-ppgc-19/13946.rss","#text":"Polygon Protocol Governance Call (PPGC) #19"}},{"title":"Scheduled zkEVM Mainnet beta Update","dc:creator":"obinna","category":"Announcements","description":"<p><strong>Scheduled zkEVM Mainnet beta Update</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Date</strong></em>: Thursday, 9th, May 2024<br>\n<em><strong>Time</strong></em>: 12:00 PM CET /10:00 AM UTC<br>\n<em><strong>Duration</strong></em>: ~ 15 minutes</p>\n<p>There would be a scheduled zkEVM mainnet beta update, this update includes enhancements to the Sequencer.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Details</strong><br>\n<em>Node version</em> : <a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node/releases/tag/v0.6.7\">v0.6.7</a><br>\n<em>Prover/executor version</em>: <a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-prover/releases/tag/v6.0.2\">v6.0.2</a></p>\n<p><strong>Scheduled Downtime Alert</strong><br>\nThe network will experience a brief downtime during this update</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/scheduled-zkevm-mainnet-beta-update/13944\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/scheduled-zkevm-mainnet-beta-update/13944","pubDate":"Tue, 07 May 2024 15:23:08 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13944"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/scheduled-zkevm-mainnet-beta-update/13944.rss","#text":"Scheduled zkEVM Mainnet beta Update"}},{"title":"Polygon Staking Report.

My interest in blockchain and Web3 stemmed from my background in finance and technology. I saw the potential for these decentralized systems to revolutionize how we handle transactions and data.</p>\n<p><strong>Professional Background:</strong><br>\nI have a degree in computer science and previously worked as a software engineer for a fintech company. Currently, I’m a blockchain developer at a startup focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi). My experience in software development and finance provides a strong foundation for navigating the complexities of Web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Interests in Web3:</strong><br>\nI’m particularly passionate about DeFi and the potential it has to democratize access to financial services. Projects like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols fascinate me. I’m also interested in NFTs and their applications beyond just digital art, such as in gaming and collectibles.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Projects:</strong><br>\nI’m currently working on building a decentralized lending platform on Ethereum. We’re aiming to provide users with transparent and accessible borrowing and lending opportunities. Any support from the community in terms of feedback or partnerships would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning and Development:</strong><br>\nOne challenge I’ve faced in the Web3 space is keeping up with the rapid pace of innovation. However, I’ve found that staying engaged with the community through forums, online courses, and attending conferences has been invaluable in staying up to date.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong><br>\nI’m excited to contribute to the Polygon Labs community by sharing insights from my experiences and participating in discussions on DeFi and blockchain development. I look forward to attending events and collaborating with fellow enthusiasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Aspirations:</strong><br>\nMy long-term goal is to continue innovating in the Web3 space and contribute to the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. I believe that decentralized finance will play a significant role in shaping the future of global finance, and I hope to be at the forefront of that movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong><br>\nOutside of Web3, I’m an avid traveler and have a goal of visiting every continent.

To address this issue, we propose patching the bug &amp; introducing the ability to replay failed state syncs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-2\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLDR: Plasma MATIC deposits revert with out of gas when the receiver is a GnosisSafe contract because it uses <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/main/contracts/child/MRC20.sol#L44\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">transfer instead of call</a> when sending MATIC (native on child) and the fallback required more than 2300 gas (and more recently <a href=\"https://help.safe.global/en/articles/40813-why-can-t-i-transfer-eth-from-a-contract-into-a-safe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2600</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>MATIC deposits occur via the plasma bridge, wherein a user holding MATIC on L1 calls <strong><code>depositERC20()</code></strong> on the Plasma bridge <strong><code>DepositManager</code></strong>. This action emits a State Sync, which is picked up by validators and executed on L2. This state sync triggers the <strong><code>StateReceiver</code></strong> on L2, which, after the necessary validations, calls the <strong><code>deposit</code></strong> method on the childToken (MATIC(0x00…1010) in this instance).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">    function deposit(address user, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {\n\t... // perform necessary checks and log effects\n\n        // interaction: transfer amount to user\n        _user.transfer(amount); // &lt;-- the bug\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t...\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This contract utilizes the built-in Solidity transfer method, which limits the available transferred gas to 2300. Before the Berlin Hardfork, this amount was generally sufficient for most contracts. However, post-Berlin Hardfork, accessing a contract for the first time (which occurs when MATIC is moved to an account that is a contract) incurs gas costs of 2600, resulting in a failure with an <code>out of gas</code> revert.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Gas costs before Berlin hardfork</p>\n<p>Access account: 700 gas</p>\n<p>Read storage slot: 800 gas</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gas costs after Berlin hardfork</p>\n<p>Access account:</p>\n<p>First time per address in tx: 2600 gas</p>\n<p>Any additional time in tx: 100 gas</p>\n<p>Read storage slot:</p>\n<p>First time per storage slot in tx: 2100 gas</p>\n<p>Any additional time in tx: 100 gas</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This issue also exists in Ethereum, leading to the inclusion of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-2390.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-2930</a> alongside <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2929.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-2929</a> to mitigate such occurrences. EIP-2930 introduces an access list, prepaying gas for any address or storage slot on the list, thus reducing runtime costs to 100 gas. This solution addresses the problem of insufficient gas availability when transferring ETH from one contract to another using default Solidity methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that this is a special case for the MATIC token only and not any other <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-20.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20</a> token as this token has the unique property of being a native token on L2.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>This PIP proposes to patch the transfer vs send bug mentioned above by updating the bytecode of MRC-20 MATIC token on L2 through a hardfork. We specify a <strong><code>txGasLimit</code></strong> while doing the call such that the receiver doesn’t consume all available gas in the state sync block limit to prevent DoS (state sync’s are batched together in one txn).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">      (bool success, ) = _user.call(value: amount, gas: txGasLimit);\n      require(success, \"!transfer\");\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Replay Failed State Syncs</strong></p>\n<p>Along with the above, this PIP proposes two more additions for the replayability of failed state syncs.</p>\n<p>The State Receiver currently emits <code>StateCommitted(uint stateId, bool success)</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">  function commitState(uint256 syncTime, bytes calldata recordBytes) external onlySystem returns(bool success) {\n    ...\n\n    if (isContract(receiver)) { // notify state receiver contract, in a non-revert manner\n      uint256 txGas = 5000000;\n      bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature(\"onStateReceive(uint256,bytes)\", stateId, stateData);\n      assembly {\n        success := call(txGas, receiver, 0, add(data, 0x20), mload(data), 0, 0)\n      }\n      emit StateCommitted(stateId, success);\n    }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>We propose the StateReceiver also stores the failed state syncs.</p>\n<p>mapping failedStateSyncs (uint stateId ⇒ bytes encodedData (abi.encode(receiver, data)).</p>\n<p>which can be re-executed once by anyone through an external method <code>retryStateSync(uint stateId)</code></p>\n<p>This would delete the entry in failedStateSyncs mapping only on a successful call.</p>\n<p>This enabled users with failed state syncs to replay their transaction with</p>\n<ul>\n<li>higher gas, and</li>\n<li>at a different time (where the state has changed &amp; possibly the control flow if receiver succeeds).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Replay Failed State Syncs</strong></p>\n<p>The State Receiver currently emits <code>StateCommitted(uint stateId, bool success)</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLDR: make a merkle tree of previous failed state syncs, post immutable root on StateReceiver, such that anyone can prove their failed state sync and replay them on chain trustlessly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A merkle tree of previous failed state syncs from the Shanghai Hardfork (50563600) until the present (an ever-expanding list) is created.</p>\n<p>A package to fetch and filter historic events will be made public such that this tree can be built, and root cross-checked by anyone. This will be a very small merkle tree of depth 5, where the leaf’s will be the keccak(abi.encode(stateId, receiver, calldata)) [stateId provides sufficient collision resistance].</p>\n<p>An external method on StateReceiver will be exposed: <code>retryStateSync(uint stateId, bytes calldata stateSyncData, bytes32[5] calldata merkeProof)</code> which nullifies the leaf on successful state syncs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"observability-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#observability-4\"></a>Observability</h3>\n<p>The overall observability of the plasma bridge would increase with this update.<br>\nThe main improvement is that failed state syncs would be recorded.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"backward-compatibility-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#backward-compatibility-5\"></a>Backward Compatibility</h3>\n<p>As the contract impacted by this PIP is not upgradeable, the changes would require a hardfork.</p>\n<p>The L2 contracts being upgraded would be the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>StateReceiver: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001</li>\n<li>MRC-20(Matic Token): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"security-considerations-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#security-considerations-6\"></a>Security Considerations</h3>\n<p>Internal as well as external security reviews will have to be done to ensure maximum safety. Limited gas will be provided during the MATIC token internal call while depositing native tokens, and <code>Check Effects</code> pattern must be followed during on <code>replayStateSync</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"copyright-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#copyright-7\"></a>Copyright</h3>\n<p>All copyrights and related rights in this work are waived under CC0 1.0 Universal.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-36-replay-failed-state-syncs/13864\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-36-replay-failed-state-syncs/13864","pubDate":"Wed, 01 May 2024 07:46:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13864"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-36-replay-failed-state-syncs/13864.rss","#text":"PIP-36: Replay Failed State Syncs"}},{"title":"PIP-35 MinGas Increase","dc:creator":"marcell033","category":"Canonical PIPs","description":"<p>Authors: <a href=\"https://github.com/marcello33\">Marcello Ardizzone </a></p>\n<p>Type: Core</p>\n<h2><a name=\"table-of-contents-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#table-of-contents-1\"></a>Table of Contents:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract</li>\n<li>Motivation</li>\n<li>Specification</li>\n<li>Backward Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h3>\n<p>A minimum fee for transaction gas price is required in both the p2p and execution layers of the network.
