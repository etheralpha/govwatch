The protocol’s TVL and net profit growth have largely outpaced market conditions thanks to the coordinated efforts of service providers appointed by DAO governance.<br>\nThe Aave protocol is also the clear leader on every network Aave has deployed to, and when given a choice, DeFi users leverage Aave over alternatives.<br>\nThis has allowed the Aave DAO not only to “cover its own bills” but also has built <a href=\"https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/treasury\">a large treasury of ETH and stablecoins</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/8f4d2faa15dc3dc74721783a429086da369be95a.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"krHEesb6HSZdwOLayfyjIHyoiU2\" width=\"2000\" height=\"690\"></p>\n<p>Additionally, during the past couple of quarters, the DAO explored revenue sharing with the Merit program, which is essentially a redistribution of the protocol’s net stablecoin excess revenue to the GHO minters and stakers to support aligned behaviors and the growth of GHO. Alongside Merit, the Ahab program, which is funded by protocol net ETH &amp; ETH-correlated assets, is mobilized to attract strategic liquidity in Aave markets, supporting protocol growth in the main &amp; new markets.</p>\n<p>With the ACI, we consider the DAO now ready to explore a further step in the protocol’s maturity and would like to submit for governance consideration a clear path for protocol net excess revenue redistribution to the key actors of the Aave ecosystem, creating new positive dynamics and novel synergies within the industry.</p>\n<p>This journey is designed in several incremental steps. This proposal seeks feedback on the journey as a whole as a “TEMP CHECK” and approval to begin the first step via a potential “ARFC”.</p>\n<p>To ensure the DAO’s long-term sustainability, new steps will be escalated when the protocol reaches specific growth and net excess revenue milestones.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"umbrella-a-proposed-safety-module-paradigm-shift-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#umbrella-a-proposed-safety-module-paradigm-shift-8\"></a>Umbrella: A Proposed Safety Module Paradigm Shift</h2>\n<p>The Safety Module is a crucial line of defense for the Aave protocol. In case of a shortfall event, and if liquidators do not complete their tasks, the Safety Module is designed to assume the excess debt on behalf of users to avoid or at least mitigate bad debt events.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the Safety Module has never been needed for the Aave protocol. The few excess debt events in Aave protocol history have been addressed by governance through the mobilization of “cash” DAO treasury funds.</p>\n<p>However, the current model is inefficient as it relies on secondary liquidity to liquidate Safety Module assets to obtain excess debt assets and clear debt.</p>\n<p>With both GHO and StkAAVE, the primary issue with the Safety Module is that the current $424M hosted in the Safety Module cannot effectively clear $424M of excess debt. This is because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The value of AAVE would be negatively impacted due to slippage.</li>\n<li>The GHO peg is unlikely to withstand the mobilization of almost two-thirds of its current supply.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While it is highly improbable to encounter an excess debt event of this magnitude (precedent was less than 1% of this amount), the entire model has room for optimization.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Umbrella proposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Segregation of coverage</li>\n<li>Elimination of reliance on secondary liquidity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From now on, the Safety Module activation should focus on slippage-free debt burn coverage.</p>\n<p>Umbrella allows the deployment of aTokens Safety Modules that are more cost efficient and provides better protection to Aave users; This proposal seeks approval on a multi-step journey toward Umbrella Activation and redefines the Role &amp; benefits of the AAVE assets &amp; tokenomics in the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"umbrella-coverage-adoption-journey-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#umbrella-coverage-adoption-journey-9\"></a>Umbrella Coverage Adoption Journey</h2>\n<p>As an initial and immediate step:</p>\n<p>We propose segregating StkGHO and StkAAVE Safety Module coverages to distinguish protections and improve StkGHO Safety Module efficiency, which would protect the GHO stablecoin.</p>\n<p>With this upgrade, the StkGHO Safety Module is meant to only protect users from GHO debt and is mobilized to clear GHO excess debt only.</p>\n<p>GHO is a young stablecoin with limited secondary liquidity. In the current stage of GHO maturity, mobilizing GHO to protect other assets’ debt will mean the death of the GHO peg and trust in GHO for limited resources gained.</p>\n<p>However, in the context of GHO debt protection only, StkGHO is a perfect tool. In case of a shortfall event, GHO can be seized in the Safety Module and used to clear excess debt by burning GHO. This action is absolutely slippage-free and will not impact the GHO peg.</p>\n<p>Safety Module users will suffer a below 1 StkGHO &lt;&gt; GHO exchange rate, but it’s a risk they willingly accepted by staking.</p>\n<p>Example: If there’s 100M GHO in the Safety Module and the protocol suffers a $3M excess debt GHO shortfall event, via an AIP, 3M GHO will be seized from the Safety Module to clear the debt. As a result, the StkGHO/GHO exchange rate will drop to 0.97, leading to a socialized net haircut of 3% for all Safety Module stakers (around 6 weeks of the current reward rate).</p>\n<p>This paradigm shift will make GHO the safest and most trustworthy stablecoin in the ecosystem with currently both an average overcollateralization ratio of 2.5 and ~65% of the supply that can be mobilized to clear any form of excess debt without impacting the GHO peg.</p>\n<p>This will de facto make Ethereum StkGHO the first Safety Module adopting the Umbrella standard.</p>\n<p>These changes come at the cost of temporarily reduced overall V3 protection, but as discussed earlier, GHO is not mature enough to be a suitable asset to protect other debts than GHO at this moment. The reduced protection will be covered by the introduction of new Safety Modules in further steps.</p>\n<p>We propose adopting the following:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"umbrella-coverage-adoption-journey-doctrine-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#umbrella-coverage-adoption-journey-doctrine-10\"></a>Umbrella coverage adoption Journey doctrine:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Legacy Safety Module coverage is set to all live networks Aave V3 debt until replaced.</li>\n<li>The Legacy StkGHO SM protects GHO debt exclusively. This safety module becomes the prime candidate for becoming the first Umbrella safety module instance via upgrade.</li>\n<li>The Umbrella Ethereum Safety Modules will not automatically cover Aave V3 deployments; coverage must be opt-in by governance vote.</li>\n<li>Mid-term: segregate risk further by deploying network-specific Umbrella Safety Modules financed by protocol “local” net excess revenue.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"stkgho-migration-and-upgrade-journey-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#stkgho-migration-and-upgrade-journey-11\"></a>StkGHO Migration and upgrade Journey</h3>\n<p>GHO is growing and is meant to be a profitable product of the Aave protocol. At ~150/175M GHO, GHO is expected to be net profitable for the protocol, with revenue outpacing system subsidies.</p>\n<p>Currently, GHO has a dual reward system with rewards in AAVE sourced from the ecosystem reserve and Merit airdrops sourced from protocol net profits.</p>\n<p>We propose, in resonance with previous governance decisions, to slowly cut rewards of the StkGHO safety module in favor of a potential Umbrella StkGHO safety module.</p>\n<p>The Merit programs yielded great results in terms of growth, peg preservation, and user behavior optimization. We propose to maintain the Merit program in its current form.</p>\n<p>This will keep a dual reward system for StkGHO: a “base yield” paid continuously in GHO to stakers and an “Airdrop” yield via Merit that can be optimized to reward more users with net positive behavior for the protocol, maintaining “boosts” of most wanted behavior but ensuring a sustainable “base yield” for this part of the Safety Module. Both of these rewards are financed by Aave protocol net revenue.</p>\n<p>In practical terms, The Legacy GHO safety module has whitelisted AAVE emissions until Oct 2024 and benefit from Merit, we propose to slowly incentivize user migration to the Umbrella stkGHO by letting the AAVE distribution slowly expire and changing the Merit reward focus on Umbrella on the next Merit round post-publication.</p>\n<p>This will slightly increase cost and efficiency by having a few weeks off incentives on both StkGHO safety module but gains on users experience allowing them to migrate at their own pace justifies it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"a-new-role-for-aave-beyond-the-legacy-safety-module-aavenomics-update-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#a-new-role-for-aave-beyond-the-legacy-safety-module-aavenomics-update-12\"></a>A new role for Aave beyond the Legacy Safety module, AAVENomics update.</h2>\n<p>AAVE is the center of gravity of the Aave protocol. It is the governance asset of the DAO, allowing true control and ownership of the Aave protocol to a degree not achieved in any other protocol in our industry. But as a Safety Module asset, it’s simply not efficient enough. AAVE is not a debt token in the Aave protocol and is not as liquid as ETH and major stablecoins.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"end-the-seize-and-sell-doctrine-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#end-the-seize-and-sell-doctrine-13\"></a>End the “Seize and Sell” Doctrine</h3>\n<p>The “seize and sell” doctrine is dangerous as it’s inefficient due to slippage, creates the need to subsidize strong secondary liquidity (StkBPT Safety Module), and causes great price pressure on the asset in case of mobilizing the Safety Module. This reduces the cost of acquiring a large amount of AAVE and taking effective control and ownership of the protocol. With historically 15-30% of the Aave supply in the Safety Module and considering the average governance participation, this risk must be seriously considered.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the relatively low maximum slashing of 30% of the AAVE Safety Module means the protocol is allocating funds that are mostly not even mobilizable to protect the protocol.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the AAVE Safety Module is not sustainable as it is subsidized by the ecosystem reserve that will eventually run out of funds.</p>\n<p>We propose the AAVE Safety Module to not be included in the Umbrella update, StkAAVE will evolve into a staking role acting as a liquidity sink and a way to collect rewards generated from the protocol revenue and other protocol benefits.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"stkbpt-redefinition-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#stkbpt-redefinition-14\"></a>StkBPT Redefinition</h3>\n<p>The Aave DAO has spent large amounts of resources incentivizing AAVE’s secondary liquidity to maintain the current Safety Module paradigm.</p>\n<p>While the secondary liquidity of AAVE is important, it should not be a focus of the Safety Module.</p>\n<p>The DAO earned experience with secondary liquidity management with the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) program, yielding great results on GHO peg and growth.</p>\n<p>We propose not including StkBPT from the Umbrella Safety Modules and appoint the ALC to manage AAVE secondary liquidity. We also propose the introduction of a “Buy &amp; Distribute” program funded by the protocol’s excess revenue, With a budget defined by Aave Finance service providers and management by the ALC.</p>\n<p>The ALC and Aave Finance service providers will continue their journey of decentralization and automatization of these processes, contributing to a future with the human element as removed as possible from these actions.</p>\n<p>This will increase the Safety Module’s budget efficiency, make the subsidy of secondary liquidity sustainable, and allow more granular liquidity management. It is expected to optimize the funds needed to maintain the expected outcome.</p>\n<p>In this new system, Liquidity will still be incentivized, but we expect a large optimization in the cost and management of this secondary liquidity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"introduction-of-anti-gho-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#introduction-of-anti-gho-15\"></a>Introduction of Anti-GHO</h3>\n<p>Creating a GHO borrow rate discount was a good idea to align AAVE holders and GHO minters, but the discount mechanism is not efficient in terms of protocol accounting and can be optimized.</p>\n<p>We propose, based on discussions with several service providers, particularly Bgd Labs, the removal of the GHO borrow rate discount and the introduction of a new “anti-GHO” token generated by StkAAVE holders minting GHO.</p>\n<p>The users linearly accumulate anti-GHO, which is claimable at the user’s will. Anti-GHO generation is proportionate to the interest accumulated by all GHO borrowers.</p>\n<p>Anti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC-20 linked to a couple of special-purpose GHO facilitators that can be used in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Burn Anti-gho to mint GHO used to repay their own GHO debt “for free.”<br>\n<img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/db53baaf49ee743e858e5a5ad0a461d9c423795e.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"vifXdn5QS8MqMgfdscISRiYSN6m\" width=\"405\" height=\"367\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mint GHO to be deposited on the user’s behalf in the GHO Safety Module and distribute StkGHO to the user.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/37855633f514bd16fce686bdb3c400f6002f3c37.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"7V9VSnDiHCCpgVk6KASalGCYoqb\" width=\"1380\" height=\"338\"></p>\n<p>Both special-purpose facilitators’ “debt” will be regularly “cleared” by mobilizing GHO from the Aave Collector via Aave treasury regular AIPs to repay, ensuring no long-term unbacked GHO in the protocol.</p>\n<p>This new system is more efficient, increases the alignment of AAVE stakers with GHO borrowers, and officially introduces revenue sharing of part of the Aave protocol revenue to some AAVE stakers, acting as the initial step of a more ambitious excess revenue-sharing strategy.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"closing-the-lend-chapter-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#closing-the-lend-chapter-16\"></a>Closing the LEND chapter</h3>\n<p>Nearly 4 Years ago, After the launch of Aave V1, the Aave protocol proposed the initial AAVEnomics migrating the legacy asset LEND into the current AAVE token.<br>\nAfter a significant amount of time passed and witnessing the lack of activity of the legacy asset, we take this proposal as an opportunity to close the LEND chapter.</p>\n<p>We consider that 4 years and the amount of time that will pass for these proposals, publications, approvals, implementations, and execution to offer ample and fair notice to legacy users to migrate to AAVE, we propose to deactivate the legacy migrator contract and transfer the remaining balance to the Ecosystem reserve to be mobilized for Aave Stakers and protocol growth.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"activate-umbrella-atokens-safety-module-initiate-buy-and-distribute-aavenomics-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#activate-umbrella-atokens-safety-module-initiate-buy-and-distribute-aavenomics-17\"></a>Activate Umbrella Atokens Safety Module, initiate “Buy and Distribute” AAVENomics</h2>\n<p>The Aave protocol is seen as the industry standard in terms of resilience and safety, making Safety Modules of Aave a popular option for protecting protocol users despite the risks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, ~80% of the Aave protocol users deposit in the protocol but do not have Aave debt. Their use case of the protocol is to seek yield on liquidity provided. These users consider the Aave protocol safe enough to keep their assets inside the protocol contracts for the long term.</p>\n<p>The paradigm shift to “seize and burn” instead of the current “seize and sell” increases the Safety Module efficiency significantly. The natural progression of this strategy is to mobilize users who consider the Aave protocol safe enough to hold their assets and do not seek to create debt to consider renouncing their Safety Module protection, their borrowing power and short-term aToken liquidity (cooldown period) in exchange for extra yield.</p>\n<p>This is done by adding a Atoken category to the Umbrella Safety Module. In case of a shortfall event, these tokens are seized and used to burn debt, just as the StkGHO Umbrella Safety Module will function.</p>\n<p>Most of the Aave protocol debt is in wETH and stablecoins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we are gathering feedback on the initiation of Umbrella Atoken Safety Modules with awETH and aUSDC.</p>\n<p>This allows for covering most of the debt in the protocol if these assets need to be mobilized.<br>\nBecause debt can be repaid in aTokens in Aave V3, the available secondary liquidity of these aTokens is not relevant in excess debt clearing.</p>\n<p>To cover debt labeled in other assets, USDC and ETH are the most liquid assets in the ecosystem, making slippage considerations a low issue, especially with a focused scope of Safety Module coverage introduced earlier.</p>\n<p>aTokens Safety Modules are proposed to be primarily rewarded in their respective aTokens, financed by their respective Reserve Factor collection on their assets and correlated assets.</p>\n<p>Umbrella multi-reward support allows for more mid-term synergies for “Re-Staking”, which will be explored further in this TEMP CHECK.</p>\n<p>Details and budgets of these Umbrella Atokens Safety modules should be discussed at the ARFC stage with feedback from both Risk &amp; Finance teams.</p>\n<p>We’re confident this will allow a factually superior coverage of the Aave V3 protocol at a fraction of the current costs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"activate-a-buy-distribute-program-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#activate-a-buy-distribute-program-18\"></a>Activate a “Buy &amp; Distribute” Program</h3>\n<p>With the new efficient Umbrella safety modules, it is expected that the protocol revenue surplus will increase. With sustainability reached milestones, this net excess revenue should be mobilized and redirected to token stakers currently funded via the ecosystem rewards contract.</p>\n<p>In terms of rewards, the ecosystem rewards will eventually run out of funds. That being said, we propose that StkAAVE remains compensated in AAVE tokens as stakers are already aligned with the asset. To achieve this, a “Buy &amp; Distribute” program is introduced to acquire AAVE assets on secondary markets from protocol revenue and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve. This upgrades the current AAVE safety module in a new “Staking Module”, not part of Umbrella.</p>\n<p>There’s little to no difference in user experience from the current situation, but in terms of protocol sustainability, it’s a paradigm shift. This new system also introduces a constant demand side for the AAVE asset on secondary markets.</p>\n<p>It is proposed that this program be funded with the net excess revenue of the protocol.</p>\n<p>Rewards rates will be defined according to protocol net excess revenue and will reflect the actual financial results of the protocols, with periods of higher rewards to potential periods with zero yield.</p>\n<p>We propose that the Aave Finance service providers manage the “Buy &amp; Distribute” program via treasury AIPs to increase efficiency in the short term. We believe this process also needs to be part of the Journey of decentralization, and we expect the Aave Finance service providers to contribute to a future with the human element as removed as possible from this program</p>\n<p>For an easier understanding of the new AAVEnomics vision, please consider the following visual representation:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/36d2649226645be10cb082d549f3bb335692f19b.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"7OYxYzShBKXHRIoMQ4lEj9tYoQj\" width=\"1420\" height=\"1186\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"re-staking-umbrella-beyond-aave-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#re-staking-umbrella-beyond-aave-19\"></a>“Re-Staking” Umbrella Beyond Aave</h2>\n<p>Aave’s Safety track record speaks for itself; while Aave had several excess debt events, the DAO never had to mobilize the legacy Safety module.

It leverages Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) for secure cross-chain transactions, ensuring trustless and decentralized asset management. dlcBTC uses a federated set of merchants who lock BTC with themselves to mint dlcBTC, similar to USDC’s model.</p>\n<p>Unlike other bridges, dlcBTC merchants “self-wrap” Bitcoin, meaning funds are never sent to an external address, reducing the risk of theft or loss. dlcBTC has a Chainlink proof of reserve feed: <a href=\"https://data.chain.link/feeds/arbitrum/mainnet/dlcbtc-por\" class=\"inline-onebox\">dlcBTC PoR | Chainlink</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of listing that token:</strong></p>\n<p>Listing dlcBTC will enable Bitcoin holders to use their assets as collateral within Aave, increasing liquidity and user engagement on the platform. It will attract a broader user base from the Bitcoin community and enhance the diversity of collateral options within Aave. Additionally, it supports DeFi platforms such as Nektar and Swaap, which can generate yield using dlcBTC.</p>\n<p><strong>Market Impact:</strong></p>\n<p>Including dlcBTC will positively impact Aave’s liquidity and user adoption, as Bitcoin is the largest digital asset by market cap. dlcBTC’s secure and decentralized nature will contribute to the platform’s growth and stability, providing additional security for users and increasing the overall market size of Aave. wBTC has been a huge success, but its use of a single custodian is a known source of counterparty risk. By decentralizing the merchant set, dlcBTC makes it less likely for an adverse event to happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Chain to be deployed/listed:</strong></p>\n<p>Ethereum.</p>\n<p><strong>Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:</strong></p>\n<p>To incentivize the use of dlcBTC within the Aave ecosystem, we propose to include a points-based rewards program tied to a future $DLC token . The program includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Holding dlcBTC:</strong> Earn 1X points for simply holding dlcBTC.</li>\n<li><strong>Using dlcBTC as Collateral:</strong> Receive 5X points for using dlcBTC as collateral across DeFi platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>Special Aave Incentives:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Earn 6X points when dlcBTC is used as collateral within Aave.</li>\n<li>Earn 8X points when dlcBTC is used to borrow GHO on Aave.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This rewards program is already established for our Curve pool, demonstrating its effectiveness in boosting engagement and liquidity.</p>\n<p>Additionally, onboarding large merchants, some with over 10,000 BTC, which will significantly boost the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"risk-parameters-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#risk-parameters-6\"></a>Risk Parameters:</h3>\n<p>Risk Parameters will be provided by Service Risk Providers and those will be updated in the current ARFC accordingly.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"useful-links-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#useful-links-7\"></a><strong>Useful Links:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/building-better-wrapped-bitcoin-for-defi\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Building a better wrapped bitcoin for DeFi - Blockworks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/how-dlcs-can-enable-defi-deposits-and-fulfill-bitcoins-promise/\" class=\"inline-onebox\">How DLCs Can Enable Defi Deposits and Fulfill Bitcoin’s Promise – Op-Ed Bitcoin News</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/okx-ventures-announces-investment-in-dlclink-the-first-native-bitcoin-defi-protocol-302088934.html\" class=\"inline-onebox\">OKX Ventures Announces Investment in DLC.Link, the First Native Bitcoin DeFi Protocol</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Technical Docs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.dlc.link/lightpaper\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Lightpaper &amp; Audit Reports | DLC.Link Docs</a> (dlcBTC Whitepaper)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adiabat.github.io/dlc.pdf\">https://adiabat.github.io/dlc.pdf</a> (Original DLC Whitepaper, 2018)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.dlc.link/\">https://docs.dlc.link/</a> (Developer Docs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Socials:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dlc_link\" class=\"inline-onebox\">x.com</a></li>\n<li>Telegram community: <a href=\"https://t.me/dlclink\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Telegram: Contact @dlclink</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"disclaimer-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#disclaimer-8\"></a><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal is powered by Skywards.

Context. The current Safety Module</h1>\n<p>In 2020, Aave introduced its Safety Module, a system for $AAVE (and $AAVE/WETH Balancer LP) holders to stake their tokens and gets rewards, but assuming slashing risk to cover any potential bad debt in Aave liquidity pools. This was a quite important innovation and movement to strengthen the resilience of the protocol with $AAVE tokenomics, adding more than $100m available to slash and cover bad debt if required.</p>\n<p>However, like with almost any other system, the current Aave Safety Module has shortcomings and room to improvement. More precisely, the following limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bad debt on Aave will always manifest in borrowed assets. With AAVE being a pure collateral (governance token, not borrowable), if any stkAAVE slashing happens, the AAVE would need to be sold to the asset on which the debt is denominated; so capital is not efficient.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consequence of the previous, slashing events could create bad dynamics on the coverage asset ($AAVE), as the sell pressure of the slashing itself will circularly reduce the coverage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Slashing rules are very subjective. At the moment, any slashing is decided via a governance proposals. Even if this has some positive implication (e.g. governance can decide to slash or to use treasury funds), this create very important uncertainty about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>in which situations slashing should happen.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>will $AAVE/stkAAVE holders vote for slashing.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>exactly which networks/pools are really covered by the Safety Module.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the previous have been addressed via governance frameworks (e.g. which pools/networks are covered), but subjectivity in this context is not really positive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Even if mandatory, auction mechanisms for slashed funds are not well defined, as the Safety Module doesn’t have a native auction module.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The system is relatively rigid on incentives, as each staked asset like stkAAVE can only have one type of rewards (currently AAVE), which is not really aligned with the community direction of for example having AAVE, GHO, or any other.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Staking and slashing is fully Ethereum based, which adds limitations on both capital acquisition for staking or even operational complexity to move slashed funds to any network to cover bad debt.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Umbrella, the new Safety Module, tries to address all the previous limitations of the system.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-umbrella-the-new-safety-module-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-3-umbrella-the-new-safety-module-3\"></a>3.

Their replacement will be objectively the most effective assets to cover Aave debt: Aave aTokens.</p>\n<p>All suppliers of aTokens on any Aave pool with no borrowings, will have the opportunity to enable the STK mode. By doing this this, 3 things happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their aToken balance (or any percentage of their balance they define) becomes slashable, to cover Shortfall Events in <em>specifically the aToken they hold</em>. E.g. if an user of aUSDC enables STK on their position and a loss happens affecting aUSDC suppliers, he will lose partially or totally his aUSDC balance.</li>\n<li>The user will start earning incentives, to compensate the utility they are bringing to the Aave protocol (risk of slashing). This could be in the same denomination of his aToken, $GHO, $AAVE or any other (or combination of them).</li>\n<li>In the meantime, the user will keep accruing yield on his aToken position, as factually he is just another supplier to Aave; just with extra risk, and of course extra reward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To highlight why aTokens are the best possible staking/slashable asset, it is important to understand what bad debt technically is. Bad debt accrual in an Aave pool means that one or multiple positions have less collateral than liabilities, which leads to a situation on which the user has no incentive to repay and consequently, if all depositors of the borrowed asset would try to withdraw, there would be a deficit.</p>\n<p>Whenever any amount of aTokens get slashed on Umbrella, <em>no selling is needed to cover the deficit, only burning is required</em>. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A total of 1’000 USDC is supplied to Aave v3 Ethereum, reflecting in 1’000 aUSDC total supply.</li>\n<li>Due to a collateral failure, 100 USDC bad debt is created. That means that only the ~900 USDC (interest aside) out of the 1’000 USDC supplied can be withdrawn.</li>\n<li>However, 200 aUSDC are staked in Umbrella. When the 100 USDC Shortfall Event happens, 100 aUSDC are slashed, and afterwards, burnt.</li>\n<li>After the aUSDC burn, aUSDC supply is 900, same as the 900 USDC liquidity withdrawable; so the system is whole.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"per-network-atoken-staking-slashing-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#per-network-atoken-staking-slashing-5\"></a>Per-network aToken staking &amp; slashing</h2>\n<p>On the previous Safety Module, using Ethereum as staking &amp; slashing network had quite strong rationale: Ethereum was the most secure blockchain network; the Aave ecosystem was quite Ethereum-focused, with only a limited number of other instances appearing (e.g. Polygon and Avalanche on Aave v2); or the Safety Module infrastructure would be quite complex if having staking &amp; slashing in non-Ethereum venues.</p>\n<p>With Umbrella this approach changes radically: bad debt potentially accrues on each Aave instance in isolation, and having aTokens <em>of an specific Aave v3 instance</em> as staked assets only makes natural that users of Aave on network X will opt-in to stake for that Aave instance.</p>\n<p>For example, it is very simple for a supplier of WETH on Aave v3 Arbitrum to decide if he wants to stake his aWETH for rewards and slashing risk, if bad debt accrues on his own supplied asset. However it becomes way more complicated for the same user to decide if he wants to stake for a different asset in a different network.</p>\n<p>We see the system evolving with more heterogeneous assets and coverage strategies, but as basic building block we believe it is better to start simple: <strong>each Aave pool on each network will have its own Umbrella, where all aTokens users will be able to stake to cover the asset associated with their aTokens</strong>.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"automated-no-governance-and-precise-slashing-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#automated-no-governance-and-precise-slashing-6\"></a>Automated (no governance) and precise slashing</h2>\n<p>Umbrella will not depend on Aave governance proposals for slashing, this will be done automatically and in a decentralised way, with rules clearly defined on the smart contracts. This is achieved with the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Aave pools will be updated to account for accrued bad debt on each asset. This will allow to precisely understand on-chain how much potentially needs to be covered by Umbrella.</li>\n<li>Once the bad debt in an asset crosses certain configurable minimum threshold (to protect for example against bad debt “dust” organically accruing), the system will allow anybody to initiate an slashing action. The Aave Robot automation system will be plugged to this.</li>\n<li>Each asset to cover will have associated its stk aToken to slash from. Once the slashing event happens, slash will be immediately processed, and funds sent externally to another contract controlled by the DAO.</li>\n<li>Once the aTokens are burnt, Umbrella will account for them, to discount the amount from any future slashing needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Introducing automatic and fast slashing has major implications simplifying the current Safety Module, more precisely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cooldown technically can be slightly reduced.</li>\n<li>No mechanism to return funds post slashing is really needed, as the required amount will be exact. This is very important security-wise, reducing any vector of so-called donations.</li>\n<li>No post-slashing window is needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"new-incentives-engine-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#new-incentives-engine-7\"></a>New incentives engine</h2>\n<p>With the Aave community lately doing an exceptional job on incentives management (e.g. Merit from ACI), we thought that Umbrella should have a powerful incentives management system, trying to cover as best as possible the needs of the Safety Module. The new system has the following characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multi-rewards</strong>. Following the approach of Aave v3 pools, Umbrella allows for any staked asset to have one or multiple rewards at the same time. For example, stk aUSDT could be receiving simultaneously $AAVE and $USDT rewards, the first from the Ecosystem Reserve, and the second from the protocol revenue (e.g Reserve Factor).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Coverage target</strong>. When defining an amount of rewards for the Safety Module, implicitly the approach is doing it by asking the question “how many rewards should we configure in order to have X amount of assets available to slash and cover bad debt?”.</p>\n<p>Umbrella will introduce a more dynamic rewards curve (stk Utilisation Curve), automatically optimising rewards to try to be close to the coverage amount targeted (stk Safety Target), but without over spending. This means that if the staked amount is lower than the target configured, rewards will be proportionally higher but without spiking to thousands of APR percent. If staked amount is too high, the system will adjust rewards proportionally lower.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"stkgho-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#stkgho-8\"></a>stkGHO</h2>\n<p>Back in the days, we recommended other contributors to introduce stkGHO in the Safety Module. The rationale is that stkGHO is factually an aToken for all Safety Module purposes, and consequently, the best possible asset to cover GHO bad debt.</p>\n<p>stkGHO will keep existing on Umbrella as main coverage asset of GHO, only adapting its smart contracts to be fully compatible with the new system.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"more-flexibility-on-staked-assets-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#more-flexibility-on-staked-assets-9\"></a>More flexibility on staked assets</h2>\n<p>Even with aTokens being the corner stone of the system, we have taken into account the appetite of the community for other types of assets (like GHO LPs), and the system will enable each Aave asset covered by multiple stk.</p>\n<p>In this case, whenever an slashing happens, all staked assets for the one to cover will be slashed proportionally (or following more complex strategies, like tranching), and those in different denomination (e.g. GHO/USDC to cover GHO) will need to be auctioned.</p>\n<p>To start with though, we propose the following limitations, to not overcomplicate the system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given its role in the Aave ecosystem, only GHO should have more than one staked asset associated.</li>\n<li>Only staked assets heavily correlated to the one to cover should be added to the coverage set to start. For example, a GHO/USDT LP token can be enabled to cover GHO, but to avoid complexity, better to avoid others like GHO/WETH.</li>\n<li>Incentives definition should be carefully evaluated when having multiple assets to stake for the same, as the management of them is substantially more complicated than with just aTokens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once again, in the future we envision a system with more complex coverage strategies, but we think it is more reasonable to start simpler on the first version of Umbrella.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"misc-features-of-umbrella-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#misc-features-of-umbrella-10\"></a>Misc features of Umbrella</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar as with all other BGD projects on Aave, Umbrella has been designed to be flexible enough to adapt to future needs of the community. For that reason, the implementation should be compatible with new Aave sub-systems, including Aave v4, by doing only minor adjustments.</li>\n<li>Umbrella will have emergency mechanisms similar to EMERGENCY_ADMIN functions on Aave.</li>\n<li>During the design of Umbrella, we analysed the introduction of a mechanism like the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-introducing-fastpass-a-safety-module-update/17376\">Fast Pass proposed</a>. However, the practical constraints that should include (e.g. it would only shorten the “standard” cooldown, but always leaving 7-10 days) led us to not propose it as part of Umbrella.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"h-4-stkaave-and-stkabpt-future-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-4-stkaave-and-stkabpt-future-11\"></a>4. stkAAVE and stkABPT future</h1>\n<p>As previously mentioned, both stkAAVE and stkABPT are not good coverage assets on the Safety Module, due to their lack of correlation with the assets potentially accruing bad debt on the Aave pools. Consequently, Umbrella will not have them as stk Assets; they will be replaced by stk aTokens.</p>\n<p>However, it is very clear that there is an appetite for usage of both stkAAVE and stkABPT into staking venues of the Aave tokenomics, with $400m supplied. For that reason, even if not including any strategy on this post to avoid confusion, we are collaborating with ACI for a new proposal to add extra AAVE utility, involving both stkAAVE and stkABPT, but in a different role compared with staked assets on Umbrella.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"h-5-glossary-and-faq-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-5-glossary-and-faq-12\"></a>5.

Given how this specifically targets users of an Aave  instance/network, it is just natural and simpler that for example aUSDC v3 Arbitrum holders will have the possibility to cover bad debt of aUSDC v3 Arbitrum and not others, at least in the initial version of the system.</p>\n<p>Additional arguments for this decision are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having an aggregated layer of staked assets between networks would make very complicated to define incentives, and it is our duty on the development side to not off-board complexity to additional contributors (and cost for the DAO).</li>\n<li>Revenue for the DAO is accrued on each specific asset, on each specific pool, on each specific network. An organic and sustainable strategy would be using part of that revenue (e.g. a percentage of the Reserve Factor) to incentivise its associated stk Safety Pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"why-atokens-as-main-underlying-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#why-atokens-as-main-underlying-22\"></a>→ Why aTokens as main underlying?</h3>\n<p>Bad debt accrual on a system like Aave means that part of the aToken holders will not be able to withdraw from Aave. By having aToken as underlying of the Safety Module, aToken holders participating factually opt-out to withdraw their funds if bad debt is realised.</p>\n<p>In addition, they still keep earning yield plus rewards on top in compensation of the additional slashing risk.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"why-non-atokens-as-secondary-underlying-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#why-non-atokens-as-secondary-underlying-23\"></a>→ Why non-aTokens as secondary underlying?</h3>\n<p>The Aave community has shown support to include on the previous Safety Module more heterogeneous assets, like LP tokens including GHO.</p>\n<p>The new Safety Module will accommodate to those needs, allowing any type of underlying, with the only limitation of having a solid pricing mechanism associated (e.g. secure way of pricing a GHO/USDC LP token).</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"how-many-rewards-an-stk-asset-can-have-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#how-many-rewards-an-stk-asset-can-have-24\"></a>→ How many rewards an stk asset can have?</h3>\n<p>Similar as with the incentives system on Aave v3, an stk instance can have multiple rewards, mainly limited by the gas implications of it. Realistically, we don’t expect more than 3 rewards for a single stk simultaneously.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"how-rewards-should-be-configured-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#how-rewards-should-be-configured-25\"></a>→ How rewards should be configured?</h3>\n<p>Rewards are configured based on having a competitive yield premium versus risk on the stk Safety Target. For example, if the Safety Target for USDC on v3 Ethereum is 50m USDC and the market seeks for an extra 3% to participate on the Safety Module, rewards would be in the order of $1’500’000 per year.</p>\n<p>In practise, the entity controlling rewards configuration will configure a rewards per second at the Safety Target, and the Stk Utilisation Curve will provide to the protocol the exact rewards depending on how far the staked liquidity is from the Safety Target.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"apart-from-atokens-which-other-assets-can-be-part-of-the-safety-module-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#apart-from-atokens-which-other-assets-can-be-part-of-the-safety-module-26\"></a>→ Apart from aTokens, which other assets can be part of the Safety Module?</h3>\n<p>The design of the Safety Module is pretty agnostic to the underlying: whenever bad debt needs to be covered, Umbrella will slash from the appropriate Safety Pool X amount of assets. How the Safety Pool sources the the funds can be as custom as necessary.</p>\n<p>Example WETH:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Umbrella asks for 10 WETH to cover bad debt to the WETH Ethereum Safety Pool.</li>\n<li>The WETH Ethereum Safety Pool has as underlying only stkAWETH (aToken of WETH v3 Ethereum), so will slash the full amount from it.</li>\n<li>Umbrella will burn the 10 aWETH and account for the bad debt cleanup.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example GHO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Umbrella asks for 20’000 GHO to cover bad debt to the GHO Ethereum Safety Pool.</li>\n<li>The GHO Ethereum Safety Pool has 2 different underlyings: stkGHO and stkECLP-GHO-USDC (Gyroscope LP). Following the smart contract logic, the Safety Pool will slash partially from stkGHO and partially from stkECLP-GHO-USDC, sending directly GHO from the first to burn, and via the custom auction module, selling E-CLP GHO-USDC to GHO.</li>\n<li>Umbrella will burn the 20’000 GHO and account for the bad debt cleanup.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"what-aave-instances-will-be-covered-by-the-safety-module-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#what-aave-instances-will-be-covered-by-the-safety-module-27\"></a>→ What Aave instances will be covered by the Safety Module?</h3>\n<p>The new Safety Module is prepared to cover any Aave instance on any network where Aave lives. In practise it is a matter of deploying the infrastructure, and activate it via a governance proposal that will define the covered assets, stk Safety Pools and rewards.</p>\n<p>Our only recommendation is to not seek an activation of the Safety Module on new Aave pools until they reach certain size (in the order of millions), as the cost of activation could not be worth it.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"is-not-a-problem-the-rebasing-nature-of-atokens-for-the-stk-safety-pools-28\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#is-not-a-problem-the-rebasing-nature-of-atokens-for-the-stk-safety-pools-28\"></a>→ Is not a problem the rebasing nature of aTokens for the stk Safety Pools?</h3>\n<p>aTokens listed on stk Safety Pools will use <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-statatoken-v3/11894\">stataTokens</a>, “wrapped” versions of Aave v3 aTokens we developed in the past, this way not rebasing in balance.</p>\n<p>For the user, this process will be transparent, as we will build all the required smart contracts infrastructure to make the process very simple, allowing to participate in the Safety Module from underlying (e.g. USDC), aToken (e.g. aUSDC) or even stataToken (e.g. stataUSDC)</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"why-removing-stkaave-and-stkabpt-from-the-main-safety-module-29\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#why-removing-stkaave-and-stkabpt-from-the-main-safety-module-29\"></a>→ Why removing stkAAVE and stkABPT from the main Safety Module?</h3>\n<p>stkAAVE and stkABPT are not efficient coverage assets for Aave pools, as the price of their underlying is not correlated with the one of the asset where bad debt generally accrues (borrowed assets on Aave like WETH or stablecoins). So they should not be part of the main Safety Module dynamics.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"doesnt-this-design-resemble-the-existing-stkgho-30\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#doesnt-this-design-resemble-the-existing-stkgho-30\"></a>→ Doesn’t this design resemble the existing stkGHO?</h3>\n<p>Yes, the usage of stkGHO as underlying of the existing Safety Module was our proposal to other service providers, as technically GHO is very similar to an Aave aToken, and the most effective coverage asset for GHO.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"how-is-the-theoretical-sustainability-of-the-system-eg-incentives-31\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#how-is-the-theoretical-sustainability-of-the-system-eg-incentives-31\"></a>→ How is the theoretical sustainability of the system (e.g. incentives)?</h3>\n<p>With stk aTokens as underlying, Umbrella provides superior capital efficiency to cover potential bad debt. Consequently, the amount of rewards required to incentivise the system is substantially lower in value compared with the current Safety Module.</p>\n<p>For example, with an Umbrella aggregated size of $100m for assets on Aave v3 Ethereum, $5m/year would provide 5% rewards, which would mean more than 10% yield on stablecoins aTokens (calculation based on 5-6% yearly average stablecoins aToken rates).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the required coverage per asset per pool will be a percentage of the outstanding borrowings, which is same concept as the Reserve Factor. Part of the proceeds of the Reserve Factor could be allocated as rewards to stk Assets on Umbrella.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"h-6-next-steps-32\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-6-next-steps-32\"></a>6.

The proposed contributions extend over the three themes detailed below: Treasury Management, GHO adoption and the Aave Stack.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership has created significant value for the Aave DAO across all three focus areas detailed <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/phase-i-summary-karpatkey-tokenlogic/17962\">here</a>. GHO’s peg, liquidity, and growth prospects have each improved dramatically over the last 6 months. The DAO’s finances are more transparent than ever before and the DAO is firmly positioned for growth.</p>\n<p>Building on the success of Phase I, we seek to extend our collaboration with the Aave Community for another 6 months. Phase II of our engagement is to focus on enabling GHO and Aave to grow market share through prudent financial management and contributing to numerous growth initiatives. Our three primary focus areas are summarized below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Treasury Management</li>\n<li>GHO Adoption</li>\n<li>Aave Stack</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"what-to-expect-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#what-to-expect-4\"></a>What to Expect</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"treasury-management-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#treasury-management-5\"></a>Treasury Management</h3>\n<p><strong>Asset Management</strong></p>\n<p>The Aave DAO receives revenue in the form of revenue-generating aTokens for each deployed lending market. Whilst that reduces the need to deploy assets beyond the protocol itself, this creates a need for continual rebalancing of asset holdings.</p>\n<p>To facilitate streamlining routine operational tasks, the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-finance-steward/17570\">Finance Steward</a> role, which has been already introduced to the Aave community, will be developed. Given the ability to create allowances, streams, perform transfers, assets bridging, and swaps within pre-approved guidelines and without AIPs, we expect the governance overhead around treasury management to decrease significantly.</p>\n<p>The GHO Finance Steward’s capacity to perform swaps will also be improved by the implementation of the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-swap-upgrade/15311\">Aave Swap</a> contract. With this tool, the DAO will be able to acquire assets in a timely and targeted manner, and to support GHO’s peg during turbulent market conditions with the ability to create limit orders.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Security</strong></p>\n<p>A key objective is to define the DAO’s annual budget and secure sufficient funds to ensure DAO operations under stressfull market conditions. As the DAO’s revenues have exceeded the burn-rate and currently holds more assets (about $145M at <a href=\"https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=9&amp;month=6&amp;year=2024&amp;currency=USD\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">end of June</a>) than planned expenses, this proposal will target to cover a <a href=\"https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/runway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">six months’ runway</a> matching holdings with expense tokens or token class as deemed appropriate for capital efficiency. This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO.</p>\n<p>Key components of this objective will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploying bridging contracts (as required);</li>\n<li>Bridging Aave funds between networks;</li>\n<li>Alocating assets for capital efficiency. In particular, migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and</li>\n<li>Swapping assets to align expenses and holdings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Aave Analytics</strong></p>\n<p>Reporting and analytics functions will be expanded to provide the utmost transparency into the DAO’s financial status and overall performance of the protocol, and to support informed decision-making and analysis of the Aave ecosystem. This includes the <a href=\"https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aave Portal</a> and the <a href=\"https://reports.karpatkey.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aave Treasury Report</a>, which shows detailed information on DAO holdings and treasury performance.</p>\n<p>The Aave Portal will continue to evolve to showcase the performance of the Aave Protocol and GHO’s adoption. Over the next 6 months, the portal will expand to include all revenue sources (incl. Accrued), assets holdings and expenses (incl. budgets) in granular detail, whilst also beginning to include high-level performance tracking across existing covered deployments.<br>\nSeveral legacy community Dune Dashboards will be integrated into the Aave Portal, where they will be maintained and expanded upon over time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"gho-adoption-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gho-adoption-6\"></a>GHO Adoption</h3>\n<p><strong>Oversight</strong></p>\n<p>During Phase II, GHO’s growth is expected to accelerate and expand to several networks. To nurture and maximize the growth potential of GHO, its success hinges on the ability to hold its peg and scale simultaneously.</p>\n<p>As a GHO Steward, we will continue to manage key GHO and GSM configurations, including Borrow Rate, GSM Caps, and GSM fees. As the Treasury Managers, we will ensure the GSM is adequately funded, targetting a collateralization in the range of 5% to 10% of total supply, and that GHO swaps are performed in a manner supportive of retaining a tight peg.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>We will continue to lead the operations of the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), overseeing the liquidity growth across different protocols. This includes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusting liquidity incentives to maintain sufficient market depth;</li>\n<li>Defining and executing direct liquidity incentives;</li>\n<li>Leading initiatives that create utility for GHO;</li>\n<li>Optimizing the utilization of the DAO’s strategic voting assets;</li>\n<li>Supporting GSM Integrations with aggregators;</li>\n<li>Ensuring GSM are adequately funded;</li>\n<li>Supporting future D3M, Facilitator, and Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) initiatives; and</li>\n<li>Support efforts to integrate GHO to Centralized Exchanges, and fund managers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Growth</strong></p>\n<p>As GHO continues to grow beyond Ethereum, our efforts will expand to support those new deployments to ensure adequate liquidity and peg stability is maintained. We will continue to work with teams that build with GHO and advocate for the adoption of GHO wherever practical.</p>\n<p>When GHO is mature enough to support deploying Protocol Owned Liquidity, we will actively contribute to the creation of sGHO and balancing the needs for sGHO and stkGHO within the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"aave-stack-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-stack-7\"></a>Aave Stack</h3>\n<p><strong>Safety Module Management and Optimisation</strong></p>\n<p>The Safety Module (SM) currently presents exposure risks due to its reliance on the DAO’s native token and its deployment solely on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>With multiple instances of the SM being deployed, we will continue to perform the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transition from AAVE emissions;</li>\n<li>Introduce new categories;</li>\n<li>Amend emission schedules; and,</li>\n<li>Progressively align protocol exposure with SM holdings;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Aave Liquidity Network</strong></p>\n<p>With upcoming changes in the Aave product stack, including the Liquidity Network and the stablecoin’s multichain deployment, new challenges will arise in integrating these aspects with other products. We will actively participate in coordination and consulting to support the streamlined and successful deployment of these features.</p>\n<p>Where practical, sunsetting of legacy v2 markets will be supported through continual parameter adjustments to encourage users to migrate to the latest instance of Aave Protocol.</p>\n<p>By addressing these challenges, our team aims to support the DAO in achieving sustainable growth and resilience in a rapidly changing environment.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-8\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>The createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController will be called to create two streams with a start time block 1718673864:</p>\n<p><strong>karpatkey</strong><br>\nStream: 250k GHO over 180 days<br>\nAddress: <code>0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c</code></p>\n<p><strong>TokenLogic</strong><br>\nStream: 250k GHO over 180 days<br>\nAddress: <code>0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40</code></p>\n<p>TokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses deployment and testings costs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"disclaimer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#disclaimer-9\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>TokenLogic and karpatkey receive no compensation beyond the Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

These initiatives are aimed at helping to continue the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem by showcasing Aave Protocol’s core values. Thank you for reviewing this proposal and for your earlier questions and positive vote in the snapshot.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Although the Aave Protocol has emerged as a leader within DeFi, the sector at large is still in its nascent stages, and Aave should work hard to retain its spot as a leader. For the events proposal from the DAO for 2024, Aave Labs wants to concentrate on proposing fewer but higher-quality events to maximize impact.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>Aave Labs is requesting a budget allocation for 650,000 GHO for events for the remainder of 2024 for EthCC Brussels (45%) and Devcon Bangkok (55%). These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Hackathons &amp; Bounties: We want to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, and to remain visible and competitive in a growing industry, but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem. We propose to sponsor one ETHGlobal hackathon in Q4 in Bangkok.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open Finance Day: We are hosting Open Finance Day in partnership with key players in DeFi for high quality talks, networking, and light bites. Talks will include members of the DeFi community, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members and service providers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences is an opportunity to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge, and industry insights. Typically featuring panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts, side events are designed to strengthen awareness of Aave and GHO technology among strategic audiences, reach new target audiences, and ensure Aave and GHO remain top-of-mind within and outside the community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Merch: Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the new visual identity and the beloved Ronnie ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merchandise people actually wear, use, and love.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>rAAVE: To celebrate the Aave community’s welcoming culture, we aim to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Brussels and Devcon in Bangkok. To mitigate some costs for rAAVE, we are planning to potentially obtain co-sponsorship with current or potentially new partners for the Aave ecosystem. Due to the event’s high visibility, it is crucial that if co-sponsorship is obtained, the selected partners are aligned with the Aave Community and this is conducted in a balanced manner.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"activations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#activations-4\"></a>Activations</h1>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>rAAVE</td>\n<td>July &amp; Nov TBD</td>\n<td>During the weeks of EthCC &amp; Devcon. rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem.

As part of our ongoing monitoring of broader markets, we note that MakerDAO is in the process of reducing the DAI Savings Rate, which could impact stablecoin rates throughout DeFi.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/015d5960e8fd3de391c1d6ffcaf7d97c4f351dbe.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-07-14T180026.868\" data-base62-sha1=\"c4tzR5241BHn96VevnsoY5UkCG\" width=\"647\" height=\"198\"><br>\n<em>Ethereum USDC</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/c/cff89f60113c1df71053b2c2692a1013e9177f7e.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-07-14T180029.002\" data-base62-sha1=\"tFNvtPuCAszTuMdaaVzfDGnQGt0\" width=\"649\" height=\"200\"><br>\n<em>Ethereum USDT</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/2c447afe79dfc406c6537015613093ed902d6046.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-07-14T180031.066\" data-base62-sha1=\"6jBJ62rslH3H9jfbKIzg4SSmAEm\" width=\"649\" height=\"200\"><br>\n<em>Ethereum DAI</em></p>\n<p>Following our methodology laid out in previous <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stablecoin-ir-curve-amendment-on-aave-v2-and-v3/16864/2\">recommendations</a>, we recommend closely aligning Slope1 with the DSR to reduce the opportunity of rate arbitrage and ensure that Aave remains competitive.
