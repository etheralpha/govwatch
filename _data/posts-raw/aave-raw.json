The current plan as we understand it is to offboard DAI as a collateral asset. As such this temp check gauges the DAOs appetite to keep DAI on as an eMode asset on the V3 Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon markets, or to remove it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>Remove DAI from stablecoin eMode across all markets where it is active.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Market</th>\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Current eMode Category</th>\n<th>Proposed eMode Category</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>1 (stablecoins)</td>\n<td>0 (no eMode)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avalanche</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>1 (stablecoins)</td>\n<td>0 (no eMode)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimism</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>1 (stablecoins)</td>\n<td>0 (no eMode)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>1 (stablecoins)</td>\n<td>0 (no eMode)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"analysis-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#analysis-4\"></a>Analysis</h3>\n<p>Currently DAI is listed as a stablecoin eMode asset on all V3 markets which have stablecoin eMode enabled - Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche. Its use is moderate as both an eMode collateral asset and as eMode debt, representing less than 1% of value supplied and borrowed on V3 Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Optimism and less than 2% on Polygon V3 Markets.</p>\n<p>Despite this relatively small scale, stablecoin eMode poses a significant risk vector for the protocol. Historical events, such as the sharp, non-correlated price volatility witnessed during the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) <a href=\"https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-usdc-depeg-summary\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">collapse</a> in March 2023, have led to insolvencies within the protocol. Infact, the majority of the <a href=\"https://bad-debt.riskdao.org/markets?platform=aave%20v3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bad debt</a> on V3, amounting to approximately $360,000, arose from the USDC depegging event, primarily from eMode positions.</p>\n<p>While currently, the risk of insolvencies is low, keeping DAI as an eMode asset will continue to allow high leverage DAI positions on the protocol. As there is concern with high LT/LTVs on non-eMode positions, we believe it is most consistent to remove DAI from eMode to control risk.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Market</th>\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Supplied</th>\n<th>Borrowed</th>\n<th>eMode Collateral*</th>\n<th>eMode Borrowed*</th>\n<th>Annualized revenue est from DAI eMode debt*</th>\n<th>Collateral available for liquidated</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>10.9m</td>\n<td>9.0m</td>\n<td>20k</td>\n<td>272k</td>\n<td>$7.0k</td>\n<td>9k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avalanche</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>4.4m</td>\n<td>3.6m</td>\n<td>121k</td>\n<td>173k</td>\n<td>$4.5k</td>\n<td>57k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimism</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>4.3m</td>\n<td>3.5m</td>\n<td>100k</td>\n<td>40k</td>\n<td>$1.3k</td>\n<td>60k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>18.0m</td>\n<td>14.0m</td>\n<td>807k</td>\n<td>2.0m</td>\n<td>$56.0k</td>\n<td>205k</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>*eMode usage numbers here are found by looking at positions that have eMode enabled, are supplying an eMode asset, and have an active eMode borrow.

As of May 9th.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact of DAI eMode removal</strong></p>\n<p>Removing DAI from eMode will materially impact the health factor of many eMode accounts due to the relatively large discrepancy between the eMode LT and non-eMode LT (95% to 77%). In the above table, we see estimated liquidations may reach $330k if implemented today. However, in the past, active borrowers (as many eMode stablecoin users are) have responded to governance changes that may impact their position, and we anticipate many would close or change their positions in anticipation of any eMode governance changes.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Market</th>\n<th>DAI eMode LT</th>\n<th>DAI LT (post V3 AIP 87)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum</td>\n<td>95%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avalanche</td>\n<td>95%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimism</td>\n<td>95%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon</td>\n<td>95%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Notable impacted accounts:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>User</th>\n<th>DAI as eMode Collateral</th>\n<th>Market</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0x624437ac1fc115561ef93bb41261ccce9bd21e72\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x6244</a></td>\n<td>270k</td>\n<td>Polygon V3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0x5b8effbdae5941b938c1a79616d185cc3c79d4ff\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x5b8e</a></td>\n<td>122k</td>\n<td>Polygon V3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0x0fe2f16c0d833f7d9feb90318a91d4afbeb57624\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x0fe2</a></td>\n<td>92k</td>\n<td>Polygon V3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Alternative</strong>:</p>\n<p>Alternatively to removing DAI from eMode the DAO can consider decreasing the stablecoin eMode category LT/LTV. While this would mitigate some of the risk of a DAI depeg, this would remove the competitiveness of Aave V3’s eMode category as a whole. We do not recommend this.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>\n<p>At this time, we recommend removing DAI from eMode despite it only representing a modest portion of total DAI borrowed from and used as collateral in the protocol. We suggest pausing any further DAI LT reductions on markets with stablecoin eMode since this further increases potential liquidations from such an eMode change. Since this process cannot be done in phases like previous large LT reductions, we recommend communicating through relevant channels the impact such a change will have, and monitoring potential liquidations, while only proposing an AIP for this change once the value liquidated is deemed minimized.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"disclaimers-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#disclaimers-5\"></a>Disclaimers</h3>\n<p>None</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#next-steps-6\"></a>Next Steps</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gather community feedback</li>\n<li>Snapshot</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Copyright</strong>: Copyright and related rights waived via CC0.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-offboard-dai-from-v3-emode/17653\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-offboard-dai-from-v3-emode/17653","pubDate":"Fri, 10 May 2024 17:51:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-17653"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-offboard-dai-from-v3-emode/17653.rss","#text":"[ARFC] Offboard DAI from V3 eMode"}},{"title":"[ARFC] Aave Deployment on Celo","dc:creator":"PennBlockchain","category":"New Market","description":"<h2><a name=\"title-arfc-aave-deployment-on-celo-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#title-arfc-aave-deployment-on-celo-1\"></a>Title: [ARFC] Aave Deployment on Celo</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"author-pennblockchain-ishahttpsgovernanceaavecomuisha-isha-varshney-celo-foundation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#author-pennblockchain-ishahttpsgovernanceaavecomuisha-isha-varshney-celo-foundation-2\"></a>Author: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/pennblockchain\">@pennblockchain</a>, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/isha\">@Isha</a> - Isha Varshney (Celo Foundation)</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"date-2024-05-09-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#date-2024-05-09-3\"></a>Date: 2024-05-09</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#summary-4\"></a>Summary:</h2>\n<p>This ARFC proposes the deployment of Aave on Celo to expand Aave real-world lending and green asset collateral to users around the world, with the provision of rewards to bootstrap liquidity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#abstract-5\"></a>Abstract:</h2>\n<p>Upon approval by the Aave community, Aave will be deployed on Celo with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including CELO, USDC, USDT, cUSD and cEUR.

Reental stands as a global leader with extensive experience in real estate asset tokenization, having tokenized over $25 million across four countries on three continents. It uniquely combines these security tokens with its own utility token ($RNT), delivering significant benefits to its community of over 16,000 investors.</p>\n<p><strong>About Reental (<a href=\"http://www.reental.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://www.reental.co/</a>))</strong></p>\n<p>Reental is a key player in the global tokenization of RWAs, specifically in the real estate market. It offers investment opportunities in real estate assets to users worldwide. Currently, Reental has tokenized over 65 properties across four countries (USA, Spain, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic), totaling $25 million, with a community of 16,000 users from over 80 countries. With this track record, Reental stands as the only company worldwide with tokenized properties across four countries on three continents, aspiring to become a global entity with properties tokenized worldwide and partnerships with some of the sector’s most prominent corporations: Civitas, Grupo ClerHP, Grupo BEC, M2Capital, Sibarys Capital, and others. In addition to its demonstrated traction as a leader in the Spanish-speaking RWA market over the past three years, Reental recently launched its utility token: $RNT.

This expansion will utilize Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). After extensive discussions concerning the cross-chain token model, the bridge, and potential networks, we are presenting a detailed post that encapsulates all pertinent information regarding this strategy.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The current accessibility of GHO, primarily through minting on the Ethereum mainnet or via secondary markets, significantly limits its potential reach and utility within the DeFi landscape. Transitioning to a cross-chain model will enhance GHO’s accessibility and liquidity, appealing to a broader user base. Additionally, integrating with alternative chains could greatly improve the overall user experience by offering faster transactions and reduced costs, thus making GHO a more attractive financial tool. This shift also presents new opportunities within the ecosystem of each network, allowing access to a wide array of integrations with other protocols and tools, further enriching GHO’s utility and appeal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"cross-chain-token-model-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#cross-chain-token-model-4\"></a>Cross-Chain Token Model</h2>\n<p>The minting of newly issued GHO is exclusively governed on the Ethereum blockchain, with all liquidity of GHO on other chains originating from Ethereum. This design choice is strategically influenced by the DAO’s goal to minimize security risks and reduce the attack surface. This approach leverages Ethereum’s strong security features to ensure GHO remains secure and reliable across different platforms.</p>\n<p>Using the lock-and-mint model, GHO tokens are managed via a locking and releasing mechanism on Ethereum, while a corresponding mint-and-burn process occurs on other chains. Specifically, when a user wishes to transfer GHO tokens from Ethereum to XYZ chain, the tokens are locked on the Ethereum blockchain. Simultaneously, an equivalent number of tokens are minted on the XYZ chain at a 1:1 ratio and then transferred to the user. Conversely, transferring GHO tokens from the XYZ chain back to Ethereum involves burning the tokens on the XYZ chain, followed by the release of an equal number of tokens on the Ethereum chain. Bridging GHO tokens between non-Ethereum chains is conducted through mint-and-burn operations on both ends, with no effect on the amount of GHO locked on Ethereum chain.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a1b60a7c58701b247961b37ed8c24743defe0e9d.png\" alt=\"Cross-Chain Token Model\" data-base62-sha1=\"n4yTpnK73EXgeFURWrwBuhGc1yZ\" width=\"1155\" height=\"650\"></p>\n<div align=\"center\">Figure 1. Cross-Chain Token Model</div>\n<p>Each network hosting GHO will have a canonical version of the stablecoin, governed by Aave Governance. GHO Facilitator entities enable the onboarding of GHO liquidity from Ethereum to the respective chain. Bridges, acting as facilitators, get assigned a credit limit (e.g. bucket capacity) which limits the amount of liquidity to onboard. This structure allows a correlation between the issuance and removal of GHO liquidity on each chain directly with the reserves maintained on Ethereum. By linking the issuance mechanics directly to Ethereum’s backing, this setup ensures that all GHO tokens across the different networks are fully backed by reserves. This maintains GHO’s integrity and stability as a trusted multichain stablecoin.</p>\n<p>Building on the outlined architecture, specifically the decision to mint newly issued GHO exclusively on Ethereum, does not constrain GHO functionality. If the need arises to initiate native minting of GHO on another chain, the process can be accommodated by transferring an equivalent amount of GHO tokens from Ethereum. These tokens would match the corresponding bucket capacity of the new Facilitator designated for that chain. This method ensures that the minting on the new chain is supported by sufficient liquidity and operates seamlessly, maintaining the integrity and balance of GHO distribution across networks.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"chainlink-ccip-as-the-first-bridge-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#chainlink-ccip-as-the-first-bridge-5\"></a>Chainlink CCIP as The First Bridge</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"chainlink-cross-chain-interoperability-protocol-ccip-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#chainlink-cross-chain-interoperability-protocol-ccip-6\"></a>Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)</h3>\n<p>Chainlink’s CCIP is a standard for cross-chain communication that enables different blockchain networks to interact securely and efficiently. This design allows smart contracts on one blockchain to send messages and execute actions on another blockchain. CCIP stands out for its high-speed and cost-effective token bridging, extensible compatibility to both EVM and non-EVM networks, ease of integration, and robust risk mechanisms.</p>\n<p>CCIP is highly regarded for its adherence to stringent risk mitigation, security, and user experience standards, which are in alignment with the principles and values of the DAO. Here are some of the most relevant characteristics and features of CCIP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Programmable Token Transfers</strong>: CCIP token transfers can carry additional instructions for the receiving smart contract on a different blockchain for their intended use, allowing actions such as swapping or staking GHO upon arrival at the destination chain. The transfer of tokens and data take place in one atomic cross-chain transaction, meaning the tokens can always be assumed available when the instructions passed are executed at the destination.</li>\n<li><strong>No Vendor Lock-in</strong>: CCIP does not restrict GHO to adopt additional bridge solutions as needed in the future, preserving its autonomy and ability to adapt and integrate within the evolving landscape of blockchain interoperability.</li>\n<li><strong>Rate Limits</strong>: configurable restrictions on both the quantity of tokens and the value transferred per lane over a period of time, ensuring that the bridge remains protected, as well as allowing for the modulation of bridging activity that can be managed by the DAO.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible Billing Mechanism</strong>: the costs CCIP incurs for a transaction to be executed on the destination chain are covered by users when they make a transaction on the source chain. CCIP reduces friction for users by supporting various tokens to pay this fee, including the native currency of the source chain (e.g. gas tokens) and in LINK.</li>\n<li><strong>Highly-Audited Codebase:</strong> Both the CCIP onchain and offchain code, including the token pools, have been extensively audited by 14 leading security firms.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Relayers</strong>: CCIP’s decentralized Executing DONs improve the user experience by automatically relaying transactions to destination chains and attempting to re-execute transactions under extreme network conditions (such as spikes in gas prices). Additionally, Chainlink offers a <a href=\"https://ccip.chain.link\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">portal</a> through which users can permissionlessly execute the transaction again (overriding the gas limit) on the destination chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Management Network</strong>: There is a separate, independent network that continuously monitors and validates the behavior of the primary CCIP network, providing an additional layer of security by independently verifying cross-chain operations. For token transfers specifically, the network has access to additional transaction information (e.g. token, amount) that enables it to perform additional risk management policies that cannot be implemented for arbitrary messaging.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"gho-integration-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gho-integration-7\"></a>GHO Integration</h3>\n<p>Contracts provided by CCIP encompass all the technical necessities for GHO token transfers. The TokenPool contract, integral to this infrastructure, supports the lock-and-release functionality required for Ethereum and the mint-and-burn mechanism for remote networks.</p>\n<p>For networks requiring mint and burn capabilities, the CCIP TokenPool contract functions as a GHO Facilitator with a designated bucket capacity that regulates the amount of GHO tokens transferable from other networks. Conversely, on the Ethereum network, the TokenPool contract acts as a reserve, locking or releasing GHO based on user transactions to ensure a constant and secure token supply across networks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1040c05bb5505acf420c40989f532f25e8787ea9.png\" alt=\"GHO CCIP Integration\" data-base62-sha1=\"2jMmRvWYoBDjRtU4yaiV4SY1fJf\" width=\"1155\" height=\"1309\"></p>\n<div align=\"center\">Figure 2.

It is defined by the maximum amount of tokens that can be transferred per transaction (capacity) and the rate at which the available capacity gets replenished (refill rate).</p>\n<p>For example, a Token Pool Rate Limit with a capacity of 1M GHO and a refill rate of 10 GHO per second for the Ethereum-Arbitrum lane implies that after a user transfers 1M GHO to Arbitrum, the next user must wait at least 1 second to transfer 10 GHO.</p>\n<p>Adjustments to this limit can be made as needed via the Aave DAO’s standard governance processes or through more agile mechanisms like RiskStewards. It is also possible not to set a specific limit and rely on other restrictions, such as the Facilitator bucket capacity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aggregate Rate Limit</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This controls the overall USD value that can be transferred on a lane across all supported tokens in a specific direction. Similar to the TokenPool Rate Limit, it involves a capacity and a refill rate, but calculated in USD terms.</p>\n<p>For instance, an aggregate rate limit with a capacity of 1M USD and a refill rate of 10 USD per second for the Ethereum-Arbitrum lane where GHO and USDC are supported would mean that a combined transfer of 500 USDC and 500 GHO (assuming each is valued at 1 USD) would deplete the capacity, requiring users to wait at least 1 second to transfer an additional 10 USD worth of tokens.</p>\n<p>This limit is governed by the CCIP governance, which can adjust this parameter in collaboration with the Aave DAO based on the activity of GHO. It is possible to exempt GHO from the aggregate rate limit of a lane, thus avoiding any limitation based on the overall USD value transferred.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that changes to the TokenPool Rate Limit can also affect the Aggregate Rate Limit. Any increase in the Token Rate Limit should correspondingly lead to an increase in the Aggregate Rate Limit to ensure that it adequately supports the higher volume of transactions.</p>\n<p>Proper configuration of these parameters is essential not only for maintaining the security of the bridge but also for ensuring a positive user experience. Incorrectly set limits can hinder transactions, impacting the bridge’s usability by potentially causing delays when limits are reached. We encourage Risk providers to contribute with their expertise and provide insights on setting appropriate parameters that balance security needs with optimal user experience. This collaboration will help ensure that the bridging functions smoothly and efficiently, while still adhering to necessary risk controls.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"billing-mechanism-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#billing-mechanism-9\"></a>Billing Mechanism</h4>\n<p>Using the CCIP involves two types of costs: gas costs and CCIP fees. Gas costs are paid in the native token of the originating chain (e.g. ETH on the Ethereum chain). CCIP fees, on the other hand, are paid in a specified fee token that is indicated in the bridging message. Notably, all fees are paid on the source chain, and the CCIP fee is designed to cover any gas costs associated with the transaction on the destination chain, safeguarding against fluctuations such as gas spikes.</p>\n<p>Chainlink CCIP operates on a flat-fee billing model, where the fee charged is determined by the specific token model and use case. Currently, only LINK and the respective gas token of each chain are accepted as fee tokens within the CCIP system (e.g., LINK and WETH on Ethereum).</p>\n<p>For the GHO use case, the fee structure is as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>To Non-Ethereum</th>\n<th>To Ethereum</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>From Non-Ethereum</td>\n<td>0.25 USD in Gas Token<br>0.225 USD in LINK</td>\n<td>5.00 USD in Gas Token<br>4.50 USD in LINK</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>From Ethereum</td>\n<td>0.50 USD in Gas Token<br>0.45 USD in LINK</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"arbitrum-as-first-network-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#arbitrum-as-first-network-10\"></a>Arbitrum as First Network</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/af10dd0294c8c5ce8ca58c890c4b15337fa922fc.png\" alt=\"Arbitrum GHO\" data-base62-sha1=\"oYHGA9XWlHZ5FjX9erDGL7upVO4\" width=\"1155\" height=\"650\"></p>\n<div align=\"center\">Figure 5. GHO on Arbitrum</div>\n<p>As described in earlier posts, the optimal approach for implementing CCIP, is a phased rollout plan, initially launching support on a single network, rigorously evaluating the process, and progressively extending to additional networks over time. Reflecting the preferences expressed in community discussions and recent snapshot votes, the DAO has selected Arbitrum as the inaugural network for implementing the cross-chain strategy for GHO.</p>\n<p>To facilitate the launch of GHO on Arbitrum, the Aave DAO has been allocated a total of 750,000 ARB through the Long-Term Incentives Pilot Program (LTIPP). The Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), in collaboration with DAO service provider ACI, will plan the strategic introduction of GHO to the Arbitrum chain. This effort aims to optimize the potential of GHO, making it an attractive asset on the network and stimulating broader activity. This initiative will focus on leveraging Arbitrum’s ecosystem to enhance GHO’s utility and appeal, thereby fostering increased usage and engagement.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"gho-on-arbitrum-aave-pool-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gho-on-arbitrum-aave-pool-11\"></a>GHO on Arbitrum Aave Pool</h3>\n<p>The integration of GHO into the Arbitrum Aave pool as a borrowable asset marks a significant initial step for GHO on this network. For the Aave DAO, adding GHO as a new stablecoin option in the Arbitrum pool aligns naturally with its goals, establishing the first practical use case for the native stablecoin on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Introducing GHO as a borrowable asset in the Arbitrum Aave pool provides a dual benefit: it allows users to supply GHO in exchange for yield, fostering initial demand, and it gives all Arbitrum users access to a new stablecoin option for borrowing. This not only aids in diversifying the risk across different assets but also lays the groundwork for the development of additional products and features.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage Risk providers to participate actively by providing their expertise and strategic advice for the integration of GHO in the Arbitrum Aave Pool. While simply listing GHO as a borrowable asset carries minimal risk and requires less effort, conducting a comprehensive analysis of the risk parameters and exploring other listing options are crucial for its successful integration. This thorough approach will ensure that GHO is introduced in a manner that maximizes its potential benefits while maintaining the overall integrity and stability of the pool.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"implementation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#implementation-12\"></a>Implementation</h1>\n<p>Aave Labs has been working in close collaboration with the Chainlink CCIP team to ensure the smooth launch of GHO across multiple chains, meticulously preparing all the required technical documentation and artifacts for deployment.</p>\n<p>In terms of smart contracts, while the original CCIP contracts were fully compatible with GHO, slight modifications have been introduced to enhance the Aave DAO’s control over the contract logic and enable future upgrades. This strategic adjustment empowers the DAO with more robust risk mitigation and security levers, allowing for swift, independent responses to any risks associated with the bridge’s operation. These changes are currently undergoing a security review by the DAO’s security service providers, <span class=\"mention\">@Certora</span>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Aave Labs has integrated GHO token bridging functionality directly into the Aave UI, facilitating a seamless user experience by enabling users to bridge GHO without leaving the web application. The bridging feature for GHO tokens is already operational on testnets, and efforts are ongoing to launch this feature in the production environment as soon as it goes live.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-next-steps-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#conclusion-next-steps-13\"></a>Conclusion &amp; Next Steps</h1>\n<p>Aave Labs initiated the discussion for a cross-chain GHO strategy early this year, receiving positive feedback from the DAO. After extensive deliberations regarding the choice of bridge and the network for initial expansion, the DAO has expressed a preference for using Chainlink’s CCIP as the first bridge and Arbitrum as the initial network.</p>\n<p>In this final phase, the community is invited to engage in the discussion, offering feedback before the snapshot vote and the AIP. This phase also acts as a call to action for Risk providers (<span class=\"mention\">@Chaos</span> Labs) to offer their risk assessment recommendations for the deployment of GHO on Arbitrum. Upon receiving risk parameters, we will proceed to submit a GHO Facilitator Application for CCIP on Arbitrum and then initiate the snapshot vote.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"references-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#references-14\"></a>References</h1>\n<p>[1] Chainlink CCIP Documentation - <a href=\"https://docs.chain.link/ccip\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chainlink CCIP | Chainlink Documentation</a><br>\n[2] [TEMP CHECK] GHO Cross-Chain Strategy - <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-cross-chain-strategy/16291\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[TEMP CHECK] GHO Cross-Chain Strategy</a><br>\n[3] [TEMP CHECK] Rollout plan for Cross-Chain GHO - <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[TEMP CHECK] Rollout plan for Cross-Chain GHO</a><br>\n[4] [Aave] LTIPP Application - Long Term Incentives Pilot Program - Arbitrum - <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[Aave] LTIPP Application - FINAL - Long Term Incentives Pilot Program - Arbitrum</a><br>\n[5] Aave UI Testnet for GHO CCIP Bridge - <a href=\"https://bridge-testnet.aave.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://bridge-testnet.aave.com/</a></p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>We are excited about the prospects of GHO-ing cross-chain and look forward to its successful implementation.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-cross-chain-launch/17616\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-cross-chain-launch/17616","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 16:00:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-17616"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-cross-chain-launch/17616.rss","#text":"[ARFC] GHO Cross-Chain Launch"}},{"title":"Notional <> Aave Collaboration Retrospective: Increasing GHO liquidity","dc:creator":"Twoodward","category":"Aave Grants DAO","description":"<h1><a name=\"intro-to-notional-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#intro-to-notional-1\"></a>Intro to Notional</h1>\n<p>Notional is a lending protocol on Ethereum and Arbitrum that specializes in fixed rates and leveraged yield strategies. We’ve been live on Mainnet since 2021 but only recently launched Notional V3 in March of this year. Since launch, Notional V3 has attracted ~$12M in TVL across our Mainnet and Arbitrum deployments.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"notionals-aave-grant-the-ghousdcusdt-leveraged-vault-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#notionals-aave-grant-the-ghousdcusdt-leveraged-vault-2\"></a>Notional’s Aave grant - the GHO/USDC/USDT leveraged vault</h1>\n<p>Notional received a grant from the Aave grants DAO to launch a leveraged vault that would help contribute to GHO liquidity and adoption. This product has been a significant success. Notional’s leveraged vault has contributed $1.3M in TVL to the Balancer pool (~23% of total pool TVL) and averaged ~43% of the total non-GHO liquidity in the pool since launch.</p>\n<p>But first, let’s start with the basics.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-is-a-leveraged-vault-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#what-is-a-leveraged-vault-3\"></a>What is a leveraged vault?</h1>\n<p>A leveraged vault is a unique Notional product that allows a user to borrow from Notional at a fixed or variable rate and deploy directly into a DeFi yield strategy that is auto-executed via smart contracts. These products give users the ability to earn very high yields if the return on the strategy exceeds the rate they pay to borrow from Notional.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Notional launched a leverage vault that enables users to borrow USDC from Notional and deposit into a smart contract that deposits into the GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer pool. The smart contract then stakes the Balancer LP tokens on Aura to earn incentives. Periodically, the contract harvests and reinvests those incentives back into the Balancer pool to earn more incentives.</p>\n<p>Here’s a flow diagram taken from the Notional UI:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/5d3dca8446ffbd6822a6271d2b61ec8a12b37aa9.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"diQN4EeXAEEGN8jJnmqqxtOOglz\" width=\"618\" height=\"674\"></p>\n<h1><a name=\"launching-the-vault-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#launching-the-vault-4\"></a>Launching the vault</h1>\n<p>Notional launched the GHO/USDC/USDT leveraged vault on Mainnet on April 2nd 2024. At the time, the Balancer pool held only $1.6M in TVL. Over the past month, the TVL in the Balancer pool increased from $1.6M to $5.6M and the TVL in Notional’s leveraged vault increased to $1.3M.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/af174c270b33e350a0c5dfc4fffc3bf098e20600.png\" alt=\"Balancer Pool TVL and Notional Vault TVL\" data-base62-sha1=\"oYVtg60Dz2S6pB5EKGbmOSXlfB6\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\"></p>\n<p>Notional’s leveraged vault has consistently contributed 20% - 25% of the Balancer Pool’s TVL over the past month and has grown to be the single largest holder of staked GHO/USDC/USDT BPTs on Aura:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/79aa463c09c2372cbbfd734c018daf903abeaf70.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"hmiAgUtowIa1Ml5fXSdVxYqs9Gw\" width=\"1366\" height=\"381\"></p>\n<p>This shows that the product has worked and provided a real boost to the growth of GHO liquidity on Ethereum.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"usdc-liquidity-for-gho-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#usdc-liquidity-for-gho-5\"></a>USDC liquidity for GHO</h1>\n<p>Another important aspect of Notional’s leveraged vault is that all deposits it makes into the Balancer pool come in the form of 100% USDC. This means that for every 100 USDC the Notional vault deposits into the pool, it buys 33+ GHO.</p>\n<p>This is important because the GHO/USDC/USDT pool has been consistently overweight GHO and has struggled to attract non-GHO deposits. Notional’s leveraged vault helps solve this by contributing USDC TVL.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to judge the exact impact that this has had. We don’t know for sure to what extent this contributed to a stronger GHO peg. But we do know how the Notional vault impacted the stablecoin balances in the Balancer pool.</p>\n<p>This graph shows the total stablecoin balance (USDC + USDT) in the Balancer pool alongside the Notional vault TVL:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/df88fc8b7ff2467e239f436417c8e8eba6b05a44.png\" alt=\"Balancer Pool Non-GHO TVL and Notional Vault TVL\" data-base62-sha1=\"vTtY1wZHuDZXkg3jmh7IwgPZI1e\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\"></p>\n<p>Since launch, the vault has held, on average, 43% of the non-GHO TVL in the pool. This further underscores the contribution that the vault has made to total liquidity for GHO in this pool.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"benefits-to-notional-users-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#benefits-to-notional-users-6\"></a>Benefits to Notional users</h1>\n<p>This leveraged vault has been mutually beneficial for both Aave and Notional. In exchange for contributing USDC liquidity to GHO, Notional users have been rewarded with a consistently attractive source of yield.</p>\n<p>The exact yield that depositors into this vault earned varies depending on their leverage ratio and whether they borrowed at a fixed or variable rate. As an illustration, here is the historical APY for a Notional user who used 3.5x leverage and fixed his borrow rate at 15%:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/254c1da1ab4dd8a89b78e10d91ed57b67c3d6d2f.png\" alt=\"Leveraged Vault APY vs. Date\" data-base62-sha1=\"5jWK6zosAdxoKYCFHxtS8sgNsfB\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\"></p>\n<p>Returns for this user have come down over time, but they still sit at 60% APY. And on average, this user has earned 126.7% APY since the vault was launched. Not bad!</p>\n<h1><a name=\"looking-ahead-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#looking-ahead-7\"></a>Looking ahead</h1>\n<p>We see a lot more opportunity to collaborate with Aave and advance the adoption of GHO in DeFi. Here are a few of the things we’ve got planned:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Listing GHO on Notional. GHO holders will be able to lend and borrow GHO at variable or fixed rates on Notional. They will also be able to use GHO as collateral to borrow other tokens on Notional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Listing GHO leveraged yield strategies. These strategies will give GHO holders the opportunity to borrow GHO and deploy into yield strategies to earn high yields, just like Notional users can borrow USDC to deploy into the GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer pool today. Some early vault prospects we’re looking at:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>a. Borrow GHO and deploy into the GHO/crvUSD pool on Curve. Stake the Curve LP tokens on Convex. Harvest and reinvest the CRV and CVX incentives.</p>\n<p>b. Borrow GHO and deploy into the GHO/USDe pool on Curve. Earn 20x Sats with leverage!</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Listing GHO on Arbitrum and other L2s. As GHO expands cross-chain, Notional will support GHO cross-chain. Today, Notional V3 is live on Ethereum and Arbitrum with more L2 deployments on the way. We want to grow alongside GHO on new L2s through listing the token alongside attractive GHO leveraged vault strategies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are excited to work with the Aave community to help push forward their vision for GHO. The best is yet to come!</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/notional-aave-collaboration-retrospective-increasing-gho-liquidity/17615\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/notional-aave-collaboration-retrospective-increasing-gho-liquidity/17615","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 15:35:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-17615"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/notional-aave-collaboration-retrospective-increasing-gho-liquidity/17615.rss","#text":"Notional <> Aave Collaboration Retrospective: Increasing GHO liquidity"}},{"title":"[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Stewards - Increase Supply and Borrow Cap for weETH on V3 Ethereum and Arbitrum - 05.07.2024","dc:creator":"ChaosLabs","category":"Governance","description":"<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>A proposal to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increase weETH’s supply cap on Aave V3’s Ethereum deployment</li>\n<li>increase weETH’s supply and borrow caps on Aave V3’s Arbitrum deployment</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"weeth-ethereum-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#weeth-ethereum-2\"></a>weETH (Ethereum)</h2>\n<p>Following the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-updating-weeth-risk-parameters/17402/4\">community decision</a> signaling a positive sentiment towards more aggressive exposure to weETH, we are prepared to facilitate additional cap increases via the caps steward.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>weETH has reached its supply cap on Ethereum, while its borrow cap stands at 17% utilization.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a2aa712b4e75e3aaad36b65f69bc06f833edd085.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nd0whpcELdlW55Jf1nbFcuc1h7n.png?dl=1\" title=\"Untitled - 2024-05-07T141854.562\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a2aa712b4e75e3aaad36b65f69bc06f833edd085.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-05-07T141854.562\" data-base62-sha1=\"nd0whpcELdlW55Jf1nbFcuc1h7n\" width=\"2000\" height=\"240\" data-dominant-color=\"282C31\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/6057d8e6cfffd408202802397b5ba8eb7f5473b2.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-05-07T141856.090\" data-base62-sha1=\"dKi32DZegEJKzm6upKkzqM4epuW\" width=\"1950\" height=\"598\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"supply-distribution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#supply-distribution-4\"></a>Supply Distribution</h3>\n<p>All but one of the top 10 suppliers is looping weETH, either with WETH or with itself.

We are looking for feedback on the proposal below to contribute to their defense fund. We believe that Roman and Alexey’s cases are existential for the crypto industry and will set important precedent for protocols, developers, and users worldwide. They are facing significant legal costs on a monthly basis and are running out of resources to defend themselves. We hope that the Aave community will consider helping Roman &amp; Alexey defend our rights to privacy and to publish open-source code.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"context-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#context-3\"></a>Context</h3>\n<p>Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm, two developers who contributed to Tornado Cash, were arrested in different jurisdictions following OFAC’s sanctions in 2022. Their 2024 trials are setting important precedents for developers, privacy protocols, and the crypto industry more broadly. Alexey’s first trial took place on March 26 of this year (with verdict and further potential legal action scheduled for mid-May), and Roman’s trial is scheduled for late September.</p>\n<p>The government’s attempt to criminalize Roman and Alexey for a third party’s misuse of open-source software is unjust and unlawful. But while <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/286828/three-crypto-advocacy-groups-file-amicus-briefs-in-tornado-cash-developer-roman-storms-case\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">legal advocates are spending enormous effort and money</a> to defend Storm and Pertsev, the developers are faced with two governments using all of their resources to prosecute them and treat them like terrorists.</p>\n<p>Roman and Alexey need your help to build a strong legal defense not just for their sake, but for crypto users and developers worldwide. Justice DAO is advocating on their behalf and helping to raise funds for their legal defense. However, time and money are running out and we need support from influential protocols and organizations within the Ethereum ecosystem. This donation will not only help to fund ongoing legal defense work but also send a message of solidarity to Roman and Alexey while they fight against government overreach and abuse of power.</p>\n<p><strong>View Roman Storm’s statement here:</strong></p><aside class=\"onebox twitterstatus\" data-onebox-src=\"https://twitter.com/rstormsf/status/1749490246000238942\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rstormsf/status/1749490246000238942\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">twitter.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1730464940283375616/7vX3chI5_normal.jpg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n<h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rstormsf/status/1749490246000238942\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Roman S</a></h4>\n<div class=\"twitter-screen-name\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rstormsf/status/1749490246000238942\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@rstormsf</a></div>\n\n<div class=\"tweet\">\n  <span class=\"tweet-description\">2024 is the year that will define the rest of my life.\nHonestly, I’m scared.

Justice DAO is operated for charitable purposes by sympathizers of Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev.</li>\n<li>Donations are processed in compliance with US laws.

It is about defeating the government’s narrative that crypto is only used by criminals and others who have wrongful motives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Donating to a defense fund is legal in the United States. So is discussing and supporting donation efforts publicly on platforms (as in the case with governance forums and voting portals, for example).</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no legal or ethical prohibition against defense funds. And in the US, donors arguably have First Amendment rights to contribute to causes like this one, free from government interference or retaliation.</li>\n<li>Both Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm are represented by reputable counsel based in the Netherlands and the state of California, respectively. There is an obvious, legitimate need for defense funding because they are in the middle of defending themselves against two different governments that have vast resources to use against them.</li>\n<li>Several advocacy groups including <a href=\"https://x.com/valkenburgh/status/1776327351657181293\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coin Center</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1776345227717951600\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockchain Association</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/amandatums/status/1776293907929714757\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi Education Fund</a>, have already recognized the need here and have filed public amicus briefs in support of the defense efforts.

The DAO has full ownership of the contract which grants it the ability to delegate permissions and budget specific actions to a Guardian, the Finance team.</p>\n<p>The Finance Steward will enable the DAO to define a core set of financial capabilities to be carried out within strict role-based guardrails. As the role matures or new use cases arise, we plan to bring forward additional capabilities for the DAO to discuss.</p>\n<p>Efforts not included in the Finance Steward or being developed will still be covered through the normal governance process. This may include the recommendation to introduce purpose-specific safe multisigs with the intent to minimise governance burden (e.g. ALC, APE, etc…).  This design will map frequent key finance operations to a role-based governance-controlled solution, frequent but long-tail use cases to trust-minimised and efficient multisigs; and important, infrequent or strategic discussions to the full governance process.</p>\n<p>It is relatively simple for the Aave DAO to grant granular control over the management of various parameters to Finance Stewards, but the complexity comes in term of decentralisation and self-protection of the protocol.</p>\n<p>The initial introduction of the Finance Steward role will enable the tasks detailed in the Specifications to be performed.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"finance-steward-v10-mainnet-only-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#finance-steward-v10-mainnet-only-4\"></a>Finance Steward v1.0 (Mainnet Only)</h2>\n<p>The initial Finance Steward implementation will work the following way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>FinanceSteward</code> smart contract will be created with an Owner and a Guardian.

I started my automation journey in 2009 at SRL – an open-source machine-vision automation platform. After quickly climbing the ranks and serving as an <a href=\"https://villavu.com/forum/member.php?u=58402\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">official developer</a>, I founded my own automation platform in 2010, <a href=\"https://tribot.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">TRiBot</a>, that leveraged reverse engineering and AI.</p>\n<p>I incorporated my company, TRILEZ SOFTWARE INC., in 2013 to grow the TRiBot business when its adoption exploded three years into the project. I continued to operate TRiBot for an additional eight years, serving nearly 500,000 total users, nearly 100,000 paying customers, and a high of 14,000 MAU through a team of about 30.</p>\n<p>I decided to sell the TRiBot business in 2021 to chase bigger goals. Naturally, I transitioned to crypto – coincidentally, I learned about Bitcoin in 2010 through SRL. While mining with my Pentium D processor didn’t produce any Bitcoin, I was fortunate enough to begin buying it in 2011 and later using it to collect payments and pay my international team.</p>\n<p>I founded Adrastia after doing work for Compound in 2021, where I noticed deficiencies in the oracle and automation space. Notable work at Compound included <a href=\"https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-market-link/1516\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">listing markets such as Chainlink</a>, providing guidance with their Chainlink-powered hybrid oracle system, and <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@TylerEther/SJBSku8-5\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">developing a market listing framework</a> that <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/compound-assets-listing/blob/master/Checklist.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenZeppelin later adopted</a> and expanded.  I’ve since branched from Compound, and after nearly three years of full-time commitment to Adrastia, we have a full suite of products.</p>\n<p>To date, Adrastia has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oracles\n<ul>\n<li>Price oracles</li>\n<li>Liquidity oracles</li>\n<li>Interest rate oracles</li>\n<li>Volatility oracles</li>\n<li>Total supply and borrow oracles</li>\n<li>Utilization (and error) oracles</li>\n<li>Aggregation oracles (supports Chainlink, Pyth, Redstone, DIA, and many others)</li>\n<li>Time-weighted average oracles (arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic)</li>\n<li>Median-filtering oracles</li>\n<li>Min/max oracles</li>\n<li>Credit extension (loan issuance) oracles</li>\n<li>Correlated asset price oracles</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Risk controllers\n<ul>\n<li>Supply and borrow cap controllers</li>\n<li>Interest rate controllers\n<ul>\n<li>PID controllers</li>\n<li>Linear kink controllers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Since introducing Risk Stewards in late April 2023, there have been <a href=\"https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=eth:0x47c71dFEB55Ebaa431Ae3fbF99Ea50e0D3d30fA8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">35 proposals</a> to update Aave’s supply and borrow caps. With onchain activity picking up and Aave continuing to expand, one can expect the volume of proposals to grow. Rivus Guard aims to reduce governance overhead, improving the Aave protocol’s ability to scale safely and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the automation of supply and borrow caps allows for greater responsiveness and daily updates that would otherwise be impractical. This allows for tighter controls of the flow of capital – the second goal of Rivus Guard.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that Rivus Guard is designed to work with two different caps, rather than just one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hard cap</strong>: These can be thought of as debt ceilings. I.e. the maximum total supply or borrow for a market.</li>\n<li><strong>Soft cap</strong>: These effectively work as rate limiters. I.e. the maximum amount that the totals can change in a period of time. They restrict net asset inflows and outflows. They’re also referred to as daily caps when measuring and implementing day-to-day changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal focuses on automating soft caps, leaving the calculations of hard caps to Aave’s risk managers. Soft caps, or rate limiters, provide the same protection as traditional banking’s daily limits; they <strong>protect against sudden changes</strong>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"scenario-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#scenario-4\"></a>Scenario</h3>\n<p>Imagine a scenario where a risk manager increases a token’s [hard] supply cap by 20%. Suppose a black swan event occurs – let’s say a market manipulation-based attack where the value of the token skyrockets momentarily. An attacker can now take full advantage of the increased cap by supplying all their newly acquired tokens up to the capped amount and borrowing the maximum amount of stablecoins against it. The position could lead to bad debt as the value of the token rapidly returns to baseline.</p>\n<p>Soft caps can greatly limit the impact of such black swan events. Let’s say the hard supply cap was increased by 20%, and a soft cap of 1% daily increases was used. The soft cap would reduce the negative impact up to twenty-fold.</p>\n<p>This is just one example, but the principle is that <strong>rate-limiting inflows and outflows through soft caps can protect the protocol against sudden, unforeseen changes</strong>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-5\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>Rivus Guard introduces daily adjusting supply and borrow cap automation through both soft and hard caps. While hard caps are still manually set by risk managers, the introduction of soft caps gives risk managers more flexibility while also increasing the economic security of the protocol.</p>\n<p>Rivus Guard’s caps will automatically adjust depending on criteria and parameters agreed upon by governance and risk stewards. Two main components handle these updates:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Controllers</li>\n<li>Computers</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"components-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#components-6\"></a>Components</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"controllers-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#controllers-7\"></a>Controllers</h3>\n<p>Controllers are top-level contracts that are configured to write to the Aave Config Engine. They’re designed on a per-market basis to source data (from computers) and then apply clamping before pushing the new cap. Clamping is based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Absolute min/max</li>\n<li>Relative change (increases and decreases are defined separately)</li>\n<li>Absolute change (increases and decreases are defined separately)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In essence, controllers guard the protocol against excessive cap fluctuations and delegate the responsibility of cap computations to computers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"computers-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#computers-8\"></a>Computers</h3>\n<p>Computers are where the magic happens – they form the algorithms that calculate new values for the caps. With a simple open-source (MIT-licensed) interface, anyone can build these to create a wide variety of algorithms. The following are the pre-built computers that exist today.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"manual-computers-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#manual-computers-9\"></a>Manual computers</h4>\n<p>Utilizing these computers in Rivus Guard would make it function like the Risk Stwards contracts today – Aave’s risk managers manually adjust the caps. Unlike the current system, the benefit of this approach is that the overarching controller can smoothen out changes across multiple updates over time.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"mutation-computers-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#mutation-computers-10\"></a>Mutation computers</h4>\n<p>These computers introduce automation by sourcing data from the chain and applying mutations – mathematical transformations to adjust the data.</p>\n<p>The existing mutation computers support scalars and offsets. Offsets are useful when spinning up new markets where scalar adjustments would be slow.</p>\n<p>There are two existing mutation computers that differ by their source of data, described below.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"mutation-computers-straight-from-the-source-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#mutation-computers-straight-from-the-source-11\"></a>Mutation computers – straight from the source</h5>\n<p>With this approach, current supply and borrow amounts are fed into the computer before being mutated. The current totals can be scaled and offset by configurable amounts. Aave’s risk managers would determine the mutation parameters and set hard caps.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"mutation-computers-sourced-from-oracles-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#mutation-computers-sourced-from-oracles-12\"></a>Mutation computers – sourced from oracles</h5>\n<p>Reading the current total supply and borrow amounts directly from the Aave protocol not only opens up the possibility of just-in-time attacks, but such an algorithm may be too noisy. Various approaches can be applied to strengthen the data. Delays of a few blocks, time-weighted averaging, and median filtering can all be used to enhance the data.</p>\n<p>One caveat of using such a computer is that Adrastia is the only oracle solution to provide such data feeds, requiring additional trust in Adrastia Oracles, unlike with the other computers.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://adrastia.io/app/oracles/polygon/0xc0514a2A4eD8bA8cf3f9Bb71cC8d6e0cA0E5A4a7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Adrastia’s Aave v3 Total Supply &amp; Borrow Oracle on Polygon</a> to analyze the performance of our 24-hour geo-mean time-weighted averages.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"updation-process-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#updation-process-13\"></a>Updation Process</h2>\n<p>Utilizing any automation platform such as Adrastia, Chainlink, or Gelato, here’s a flow chart of the process of how new supply and borrow caps are computed and pushed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HXheuhyHnMS6SFCB6RxSOwUtsexRdeySp0AYpQ2aRaR2spfC8dszhaZneWIXGt8TUFKQJ_DFMUDZnUDX_p5pm3I13tzcDOr8OyIUHfGxKLthF_e42fDvf2vFRTym_VjJR73JS0e4shJWacN8YQOi4sI\" alt=\"\" width=\"716\" height=\"830\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p>Automation infrastructure will continually monitor Rivus Guard, checking for needed updates.

This new system creates a unified look that propels Aave into the future, standing out as DeFi goes mainstream. The Aave identity should not only stand out among crypto brands, but increasingly alongside blue chip financial brands. At the same time, this new visual aesthetic embraces Aave’s heritage as a reliable, resilient and innovative protocol that is accessible, transparent and community governed. The friendly ghost takes new heights.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Today, the Aave logomark gets applied inconsistently across various Aave-supported initiatives, diluting recognition power and potentially causing confusion.</p>\n<p>The aim of this proposal is to present a new, strong and distinctive visual identity  that stands out and supports Aave ecosystem’s continued growth into new frontiers. Our idea is that the logomark should be appropriately flexible for multiple usages and across multiple platforms. As well, Aave’s visual identity should be distinctive within the broader DeFi community and financial industry.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"preserving-aaves-brand-heritage-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#preserving-aaves-brand-heritage-3\"></a>Preserving Aave’s Brand Heritage</h2>\n<p>The Aave ghost is known and beloved within the DeFi community. Several months of research, positioning and design work – led by Avara’s design team and headed by Benji Taylor – went into developing the new proposed logomark to ensure that it retains its core elements while becoming distinctive and instantly recognizable.</p>\n<p>This visual identity honors Aave’s legacy while streamlining and modernizing its look. The process involved collaboration across the Aave ecosystem, targeting a final design that resonates with the community and reflects the Aave DAO’s standing as an industry leader and innovator.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRMpa2oT51A\">Aave | Say Hello</a></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-changes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#proposed-changes-4\"></a>Proposed Changes</h2>\n<p>In the proposal, Aave’s visual identity has undergone a distinctive refresh.

Some may not like it or feel it is necessary. It’s natural for there to be a spectrum of reactions, and we welcome discussion. But it’s crucial to remember that Aave has been through successful brand evolutions in the past, namely the transition from ETHLend to Aave, and that at the time, it was considered unsettling too. Although this was a significant change, it was accomplished successfully and today, few would question this decision.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"built-for-the-community-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#built-for-the-community-8\"></a>Built for the Community</h2>\n<p>This visual identity belongs to the entire Aave Community.

Building on the success of V3, Aave V4 is proposed to be built together with the community with a new architecture that enhances modularity, reduces governance overhead, optimizes capital efficiency, and integrates innovations such as the Aave-native stablecoin GHO more seamlessly. The proposal also introduces ideas for innovative risk management tools and a more efficient liquidation engine, all designed to enhance user experience and security.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs proposes to develop V4 as part of a wider <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-2030/17539\">Aave 2030 grant proposal</a> in a transparent manner, involving the community in feedback and testing phases, with a timeline stretching from initial development in Q2 2024 to a full release by mid-2025.

The launch of V3 in 2022 set the stage for growth by providing a variety of essential new features based on the community’s feedback. As the most significant upgrade to the protocol to date, V3 included an improved user experience, reduced gas costs, increased capital efficiency, new risk management tools, and targeted a seamless flow between V3 markets and different networks. At the time of this writing, Aave has a Market Size of $17B and is available on over twelve networks, with Ethereum being the largest market. V3 has operated successfully through multiple downward cycles thanks to its reliable liquidation engine and consistent risk management.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/fbb0244d091d92783345bbcd201c72442b2124ea.png\" alt=\"growth\" data-base62-sha1=\"zUxe5a93B0H9Gwxq49L2GctJllo\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>Our experience in designing and developing V3 and previous versions of the protocol gives us substantial insight and deep technological understanding. We are proud of our contributions to the Aave DAO and our successful track record supporting the community and its interests.</p>\n<p>The following plan introduces the results of our research for Aave V4 to position the protocol for continued success. We hope the community will consider, discuss and ultimately embrace our ideas in this proposal, which we believe will keep Aave at the forefront of innovation in this space.</p>\n<p>Over the past three years, since the inception of V3, Aave Labs has been analyzing on-chain user behavior and market tendencies to innovate around solutions to improve efficiency and security. The research on V4 builds on V3’s successful features such as eMode, Isolation Mode and granular risk management, while further increasing its integration with the Aave-native stablecoin GHO and introducing a number of other key capital efficiency features, substantially lower gas fees, enhanced UX and risk management innovations. Our ideas below propose a new, efficient architecture and modular design that has the goal of minimizing governance overhead, reducing risk, further optimizing capital efficiency and finally, with immutability in mind – creating a true, immutable and permissionless financial layer over the long run.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-features-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#proposed-features-4\"></a>Proposed Features</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"v4-new-efficient-architecture-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#v4-new-efficient-architecture-5\"></a>V4: New Efficient Architecture</h3>\n<p>One of the key aspects of previous versions of Aave is the evolutionary nature of the three iterations of the protocol. All three versions stem from the same design principles and can be considered as a progressive evolution of the same architecture. By keeping a consistent architecture across different versions, integrators who build on Aave can continue their work without needing to adapt to major changes, which helps to prevent disruptions in their work. While beneficial, this limits innovation. Aave V4 would be built with a completely new architecture with an efficient and modular design, while minimizing the impact on third-party integrators.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"unified-liquidity-layer-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#unified-liquidity-layer-6\"></a>Unified Liquidity Layer</h3>\n<p>The most important architectural change is the proposed introduction of a Unified Liquidity Layer. The liquidity layer generalizes the concept of Portals introduced by Aave V3 and enables a fully agnostic, independent and abstracted infrastructure for liquidity provisioning. The liquidity layer is proposed to manage supply/draw (borrow) caps, interest rates, assets, and incentives, allowing other modules to draw liquidity from it. In contrast to previous versions, the new liquidity layer abstraction is proposed to allow in the future for the Aave DAO to onboard new borrow modules and offboard old ones without needing to migrate liquidity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b102663f5e0683eebab4de10ecaed851baf16e25.png\" alt=\"unified-liquidity-layer\" data-base62-sha1=\"pfTEu0XWWrQsSJ2JwbYeEcduJBr\" width=\"1540\" height=\"1358\"></p>\n<p>This architecture allows adding or improving borrowing features (such as isolation pools, RWA modules, and CDPs) without changing the entire system or the liquidation module. It also avoids the problem of fragmented liquidity that older versions of the protocol had.</p>\n<p>The liquidity layer is capable of natively supporting both supplied and natively minted assets, therefore providing better integration with GHO and other collateralized, Aave native, assets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"fuzzy-controlled-interest-rates-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#fuzzy-controlled-interest-rates-7\"></a>Fuzzy-controlled Interest Rates</h3>\n<p>Based on the same innovative concept currently in development for the interest rate management of GHO, Aave V4 is proposed to feature fully automated interest rates with the ability to adjust both slopes and kink points. Currently this is a governance controlled configuration that introduces governance overhead and sub-optimal capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Fuzzy rules are to be defined to actively control the kink point, moving it according to dynamic market conditions. Base interest rates are to increase or decrease depending on market demand, thus optimizing rates for both suppliers and borrowers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/882d279169a09dfac4250ef0467481ffa85ec229.png\" alt=\"fuzzy-rates\" data-base62-sha1=\"jqFG6MQLE11E8NGnoYjAKi2JwE1\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>The biggest advantage of using fuzzy logic to control the IR curves is the ability to extend the controller indefinitely, feeding as much input data as possible to optimize its behavior. We are actively researching with Chainlink to define a clear set of data feeds needed to implement the most capital efficient interest rate models ever designed on-chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"liquidity-premiums-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#liquidity-premiums-8\"></a>Liquidity Premiums</h3>\n<p>Another novel feature of the liquidity layer is the proposed introduction of the Liquidity Premiums.</p>\n<p>One glaring aspect that was observed in previous versions of Aave is the inability to price borrowing cost appropriately depending on the collateral composition. Riskier collaterals (either because of centralization dependencies or market risk) should be priced accordingly, while with the current iteration of Aave V3 this is not possible. Once an asset gets collateral status, it accesses a wide array of borrowable assets at the same pricing as all other collaterals. This is the case even when the collateral profile may not reflect its current risk profile.</p>\n<p>Liquidity Premiums are proposed to introduce adjusted borrowing costs for borrowers based on their collateral composition. In this model, each asset will be assigned a risk factor that ranges from 0 to 1, and risk factors will be adjusted accordingly depending on dynamic risk conditions and other external risk factors. This will also introduce a Base Rate for borrowers using the strongest, lowest risk collateral (in the case of the Ethereum market, for example, ETH).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b60d5055a614c52748d766b814c8f0f276dfb3ae.png\" alt=\"risk-premiums\" data-base62-sha1=\"pYvqj5GibY4hRUDBbITGbqfCRzw\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>With fine-tuned risk management tools, Liquidity Premiums are capable of further increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol, bringing more yield to suppliers and lower fees to borrowers who use the strongest collaterals. With this capability, the protocol can provide borrowers with less risky collateral a better rate, attracting stronger collaterals to the protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"aave-v4-borrow-module-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-v4-borrow-module-9\"></a>Aave V4 Borrow Module</h2>\n<p>With the new Unified Liquidity Layer, a new Borrow Module is proposed that builds on the strong fundamentals of Aave V3, further improving UX, risk management and safety. The V4 borrow module proposes a set of innovative features that will make the protocol even more safe and easy to use.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"vaults-and-smart-accounts-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#vaults-and-smart-accounts-10\"></a>Vaults and Smart Accounts</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/53701383a45e3b522a2aeabfb89246a3afa44ef6.png\" alt=\"smart-account-vault\" data-base62-sha1=\"bU7KDFWnnhZ8ga1nrvnwJCTvS4K\" width=\"1540\" height=\"1260\"></p>\n<p>V4 marks the introduction of the concept of Smart Accounts, which seek to solve one major UX problem with Aave V3 - the need to use separate wallets to manage positions in cases where a user is borrowing using eMode or isolated assets. The idea is that users will be able to create as many smart accounts as needed using only one wallet, greatly simplifying interactions with the protocol.</p>\n<p>Smart accounts will also enable another major feature that fulfills a need often expressed in the Aave governance forum - Aave Vaults. Vaults are used to allow borrowing without requiring them to supply collateral to the liquidity layer. The collateral is instead deposited in the smart account, non borrowable and locked as long as the borrow position is active, or becomes subject to a liquidation event. This will allow users to further segregate risk, which will consequently reflect on yields for users who instead supply collateral to the liquidity layer. Smart accounts will be built completely on top of Aave V4, further showcasing the composability and flexibility of this new iteration of Aave.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"dynamic-risk-configuration-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#dynamic-risk-configuration-11\"></a>Dynamic Risk Configuration</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/f497462ded62b0677d2afc419729b7822be15e73.png\" alt=\"dynamic-risk-config\" data-base62-sha1=\"yTKBzZcVl214adxRarfGnIYXkJl\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>One of the main challenges with V3 risk management is that risk parameters (mainly what is identified as liquidation threshold) cannot be changed when market conditions change. The reason is that there is only one configuration instance per asset, and every change to the configuration affects both existing and future borrowers. Lowering the liquidation threshold is an action that can cause great discomfort (in the form of unwanted liquidations) and is currently handled very carefully. At the same time, it is a key parameter that should be updated frequently to reduce risk exposure, introducing governance overload.</p>\n<p>Aave V4 proposes a dynamic configuration mechanism per asset, where users are “hooked” to the current configuration of an asset when a borrow takes place. If a new asset configuration is required, a new configuration instance is created. Existing users remain hooked to the previous configuration.</p>\n<p>If the need arises, governance is designed to retain the ability to change previous risk configurations but with added dynamic configuration coupled with automated asset offboarding (see below), however, in the proposed framework the need for making such changes should be drastically reduced.</p>\n<p>The ability to create independent risk configurations is proposed not only to improve risk management and reduce liquidity risk for suppliers, but also to allow offloading risk management functions to external entities without changing the trust assumptions; something that is not possible with the current version of the protocol. We are also researching with Chainlink to explore solutions for full automation of risk management. The idea is to involve utilizing ad-hoc, on-chain feeds to assess asset risk and dynamically adjust risk parameters through control theory or AI.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"automated-assets-offboarding-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#automated-assets-offboarding-12\"></a>Automated Assets Offboarding</h3>\n<p>Together with Dynamic Risk Configuration, V4 proposes a new procedure to automate asset offboarding. Currently, offboarding assets is a long and governance-intensive procedure, where multiple proposals are needed to reduce the asset LTV to 0, progressively reducing the asset liquidation threshold to avoid massive liquidations, ultimately reducing its borrowing power to zero. With Aave V4, when governance triggers an automated offboarding operation, a new configuration is introduced which automatically reduces the liquidation threshold of the asset for new users to zero. Every action on the asset will trigger a progressive reduction of the historical liquidation thresholds, starting from the highest ones, until the liquidation threshold reaches zero for everyone and assets are officially offboarded as collateral. This will offer users a predictable offboarding plan that does not require governance proposals, drastically reducing governance workload.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"automated-treasury-management-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#automated-treasury-management-13\"></a>Automated Treasury Management</h3>\n<p>Aave V3 currently collects Reserve Factor in a variety of assets, that require governance to reallocate to stablecoins or ETH periodically. Aave V4 will propose a reverse auction mechanism where every token collected through reserve factor can automatically be sold to any pre configured asset once a certain threshold is reached, reducing governance overload.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"actions-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#actions-14\"></a>Actions</h3>\n<p>Aave V4 lets users set up custom automatic actions (Actions) in response to decisions made by governance.</p>\n<p>For instance, if governance lowers the risk limit for borrowing on a certain asset (liquidation threshold), users can set up automatic actions to increase collateral for that asset or repay some of the asset to avoid liquidation. Actions limit the need for users to constantly check the governance forum for updates, as they can set custom actions that automatically adjust their position.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidation-engine-v4-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#liquidation-engine-v4-15\"></a>Liquidation Engine V4</h2>\n<p>While the liquidation engine in the current version of the protocol has proven reliability, a few key improvements are planned for Aave V4:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A variable Liquidation Factor:</strong> enough to bring the position back to safety, to reduce the impact on borrowers compared to V3 where up to 50% of the collateral can be liquidated on liquidation event.</li>\n<li><strong>A variable Liquidation Bonus</strong>: factually introducing reverse dutch auctions, linearly increasing the liquidation bonus (and decreasing the protocol fee) as the health factor of the position decreases.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidation Strategies</strong>: different assets can use different liquidation engines to maximize efficiency.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple Parallel Liquidations</strong>: one key aspect that has been identified is that often multiple liquidations happen within the same block. The Aave V4 liquidation engine will allow batch liquidations targeting the same debt/collateral pair together to maximize efficiency for liquidators.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>GHO soft liquidations</strong>: more on this later below.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"excess-debt-protection-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#excess-debt-protection-16\"></a>Excess Debt Protection</h3>\n<p>One of the drawbacks of the shared liquidity model is the risk of contagion in case one asset accumulates excess debt. Excess debt can manifest in a variety of ways, mainly due to custody or liquidity risk. While custody risk can be mitigated through monitoring services, for example the Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve, already having been used in V3 on multiple occasions. However, there is currently no method for clearing excess debt resulting from liquidations.</p>\n<p>Aave V4 proposes a novel mechanism to track insolvent positions and automatically account for the accumulated excess debt. A threshold for the excess debt can be set so that once the threshold is crossed, the asset automatically loses its borrowing power, preventing it from being used to spread the bad debt to other assets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"new-oracle-design-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#new-oracle-design-17\"></a>New Oracle Design</h3>\n<p>Together with Chainlink, we are conducting advanced research for an oracle design aimed at further reducing trust assumptions, detecting outliers and reacting accordingly. We will share more details on this research with the community once the design is ready.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"stronger-gho-integration-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#stronger-gho-integration-18\"></a>Stronger GHO integration</h2>\n<p>Several new features are proposed to integrate GHO with Aave V4 more natively, improving UX and yield for stablecoin suppliers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"native-gho-minting-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#native-gho-minting-19\"></a>Native GHO minting</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the liquidity layer will be proposed to allow natively mint GHO more efficiently than with the current implementation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"gho-soft-liquidations-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gho-soft-liquidations-20\"></a>GHO “soft” Liquidations</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/dae6c12ac30d046e9d8ca7aa126f5d702641bb61.png\" alt=\"soft-liquidations\" data-base62-sha1=\"veutD7H6zpCofeLjFITXopvXaw1\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>This mechanism is similar in concept as the liquidation model first pioneered by crvUSD. A Lending-Liquidating AMM (LLAMM) is proposed to ease liquidations. Liquidity is subdivided in ranges that can be chosen to address the conversion to GHO in market downturns and when buying back collateral in upturns. Compared to the crvUSD, Aave V4 design comes with three main advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can choose which collateral to liquidate to GHO within their basket of collaterals.</li>\n<li>Users can choose which collateral to buy back <strong>within all the assets available on the Aave Protocol (even assets not initially supplied).</strong></li>\n<li>GHO will automatically earn interest (in markets where it can be supplied).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"stablecoin-interest-paid-in-gho-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#stablecoin-interest-paid-in-gho-21\"></a>Stablecoin Interest Paid in GHO</h3>\n<p>V4 proposes a feature that allows suppliers to opt-in to receive interest payments in GHO, rather than the stablecoin they originally supplied. When suppliers choose this option, the interest payments from borrowers are converted into V4 Protocol Controlled Value (PCV), which directly backs the issued GHO.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this feature for the protocol is that, by converting these payments into PCV, the protocol can enhance its capital efficiency. The capital acquired from borrows can be strategically utilized to bolster the stability of GHO, allocated to the GSM, reinvested within Aave itself, or used in other protocols to generate additional yield for the Aave DAO. Users can benefit from receiving GHO interest thanks to reduced reserve factors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"emergency-redemption-mechanism-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#emergency-redemption-mechanism-22\"></a>Emergency Redemption Mechanism</h3>\n<p>V4 proposes an Emergency Redemption Mechanism to handle situations of prolonged and heavy depegging of GHO. When the emergency redemption mechanism is triggered, collaterals of positions with the lowest health factor are gradually redeemed to GHO and their debt is repaid. This, in addition to automated interest rates, soft liquidations and GHO interest repayments, will help scale GHO while ensuring stability and reliability.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"deprecated-features-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#deprecated-features-23\"></a>Deprecated Features</h2>\n<p>V4 proposes to streamline some older features from previous versions that were not used and were kept mostly for compatibility reasons. Their depreciation is expected to make the system simpler and more efficient. The affected features would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Credit Delegation</strong>: Moved to the V4 Smart Accounts.</li>\n<li><strong>Stable Rate:</strong> Deprecated. Borrow modules provide flexibility to define new variable rate strategies, and dynamic parameters enable better user experience and risk mitigation compared to stable rate re-balancing.</li>\n<li><strong>Tokenization</strong>: Positions not natively tokenized. Tokenization is to remain optional and built using ERC 4626 vaults. Internal accounting modified to reflect this, with the removal of any exchange rate or scaled balance. This will reduce the risk of rounding errors and further improve the overall reliability of the protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>LTV Configuration:</strong> With Dynamic Configuration (as there will be no need for a separate LTV parameter).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"gas-optimizations-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gas-optimizations-24\"></a>Gas Optimizations</h2>\n<p>Subject to the new proposed architecture and the removal of deprecated features, initial estimates show a reduction between 30 and 50% in gas fees with V4 technical innovations.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-25\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"development-plan-and-course-of-action-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#development-plan-and-course-of-action-26\"></a>Development Plan and Course of Action</h2>\n<p>Aave Protocol V4 is currently in an advanced research phase. If community approval on the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-2030/17539\">Aave 2030 proposal</a>  is received, the development for Aave V4 is planned as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research phase completion: Q2 2024</li>\n<li>Development starts: end of Q2 2024</li>\n<li>First prototype expected: Q4 2024</li>\n<li>Code completion, auditing and release: Q1-Q2 2025</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s important to highlight a few aspects of this timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave V3 has proven to be a robust protocol that has achieved remarkable growth — for instance, V3 Ethereum’s TVL grew from zero to $7 billion in less than a year. We see that V3 still has capacity to scale, serving as a solid foundation until V4 is ready for production.</li>\n<li>While certain innovations such as fuzzy-controlled interest rates and the new oracle design were researched with Aave V4 in mind, these solutions can be developed independently to be released in advance to function with Aave V3, which is looking to have a new version (3.1) developed by BGD Labs to be released in production soon.</li>\n<li>With V4 and the community required approach to funding, Aave Labs plans to build in public. The idea is to release an initial prototype and finalize its implementation, conduct audits and security assessments with the code accessible to everyone. This will allow community engagement and gathering of feedback, which will result in producing safer and more reliable code.</li>\n<li>While V4 is already in an advanced stage of research, some of the features described above might become subject to changes, be reworked or removed if unexpected development challenges arise.</li>\n<li>Aave Labs maintains an unwavering commitment to security and responsible development. We aim to adhere to the outlined timeline, bearing in mind that prior versions of the Aave Protocol have undergone extensive battle-testing over time. Our plans undergo comprehensive audits, including formal verification, to ensure the highest security standards. While we endeavor to meet the deadlines outlined above, our priority remains the safety and reliability of the protocol, allowing for flexibility to accommodate thorough review, auditing processes and unexpected findings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/fc48dff8cab2a7d6551a948b1cd8064c51079646.png\" alt=\"plus-plus\" data-base62-sha1=\"zZOshXtqTdfngv7QYcRPv4eAeTY\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#next-steps-27\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>This Temp Check is closely tied to the Aave 2030 Vision grant proposal and its purpose is to collect community feedback on the feature improvements of Aave V4.

Building upon the market-leading technologies of Aave V3 and GHO, these ideas, as a conceptual framework, aim to significantly boost the adoption of the Aave ecosystem and scale DeFi to reach the next billion users. Aave Labs suggests a scope for a technical contributor grant to cover the next three years, with an annual review and renewal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"introduction-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#introduction-3\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Aave Protocol has evolved into a leader in decentralized finance recognized for its wide array of assets, conservative liquidation and collateral system, and decentralized governance. Aave has reached this position by continuously implementing risk management and other feature improvements. As a non-custodial liquidity protocol governed by the Aave DAO, Aave has 450k+ token holders who can participate in governance, deciding on all proposed changes to the protocol.</p>\n<p>The Aave Protocol has reached an average of <a href=\"https://x.com/tokenterminal/status/1759210742035746890\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">50% market share</a>, thanks to Aave’s continued innovation, increased brand awareness and the committed participation of its community.</p>\n<p>To remain leaders in DeFi, we welcome the community to discuss, ratify and build together a plan based on a vision for 2030 and beyond.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"aave-to-2030-and-beyond-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-to-2030-and-beyond-4\"></a>Aave to 2030 and Beyond</h2>\n<p>The crypto ecosystem is ever-evolving and growing to attract new users and financial institutions. While currently Aave is the leading Non-LST DeFi protocol in TVL, it cannot be understated how important innovation and brand awareness are for Aave ecosystem’s continued success in the future. It’s exciting to see how in the past two years many contributors have participated in the growth of the Aave DAO, introducing new technologies that have drastically improved the experience for Aave users and community members. A few notable examples include a.DI and Aave Governance V3 by BGD Labs, Skyward and Merit by ACI risk management by Chaos Labs, security contributors including Certora and treasury management contributors TokenLogic and karpatkey.</p>\n<p>In line with the steady advancement of new technologies such as ZK networks, Superchains, and non EVM L1s, Aave Labs is proposing a few key solutions to enhance the Aave Protocol. Given the competitive DeFi landscape, we believe the key to staying ahead is through continued innovation, building and shipping excellent solutions that address the ongoing requirements of the Aave community. The suggested ideas are looking to position Aave at the forefront of DeFi in 2030 and beyond. In the spirit of decentralization, this Temp Check proposes a path and relies considerably on feedback from the community and the participation of contributors for its execution.</p>\n<p>We aim to implement this plan together with the community over the next three years. The structured approach that includes regular community check-ins and renewals is designed to ensure that every step aligns with Aave DAO’s objectives and receives community feedback and support.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs involvement is confined to a three-year grant, wherein our role is that of a technical contributor to the DAO, providing expertise and solutions in alignment with the goals as approved by the DAO for the grant. Any extended vision beyond this period serves only as a conceptual framework, helping the Aave governance visualize the broader trajectory of progress beyond our specific contribution. Aave Labs does not guarantee any involvement beyond the scope of any approved governance proposal, and to prevent reliance on Aave Labs by the DAO, we will seek to reduce our technical contribution progressively throughout the grant period, empowering the community members to continue owning the future of the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solutions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#solutions-5\"></a>Solutions</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"aave-protocol-v4-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-protocol-v4-6\"></a>Aave Protocol V4</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/5ce54ac68c2e3785d833a840f32365a19fa7bb6b.jpeg\" alt=\"v4-feature-overview\" data-base62-sha1=\"dfNbmGZW8qscSYCp6CQHWB4wZwn\" width=\"1540\" height=\"1048\"></p>\n<p>The cornerstone of the 2030 vision is the introduction of Aave V4 – the next iteration of the protocol. We are proud of what the previous versions have accomplished and cannot wait for Aave V4 to showcase the massive step forward the technology will be for the community and the DeFi space.</p>\n<p>Given the number of innovations built into V4, the full explanation is presented in a separate Temp Check <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-protocol-v4-development-proposal/17541\">here</a>. We are excited to unveil the innovations behind the V4 proposal, and we look forward to discussion and feedback from the community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cross-chain-liquidity-layer-ccll-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#cross-chain-liquidity-layer-ccll-7\"></a>Cross-Chain Liquidity Layer (CCLL)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/93ac00ff66d00c9d1d6045b3abcda158e6f0cfc0.png\" alt=\"ccll\" data-base62-sha1=\"l4mHHh0osEywRDEFSr4TYi0onwA\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>When Aave Protocol V3 was initially introduced, one of the main features was <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/developers/whats-new/portal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Portals</a> - the concept of Aave becoming a chain-agnostic, borderless liquidity protocol. Although the idea was ahead of its time, it initially required significant trust assumptions to function effectively. However, technology has evolved rapidly. With the adoption of CCIP, the concept of superchains, and V4’s Unified Liquidity Layer feature, Aave can soon scale to become a fully cross-chain liquidity protocol. This will allow borrowers to access instant liquidity across all supported networks. These improvements have the potential to evolve Portals into the de facto fast lane bridge, leveraging this new infrastructure as a potential revenue source for the protocol.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"gho-and-rwas-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gho-and-rwas-8\"></a>GHO and RWAs</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b641e37cfaca862ce1f83849fa17fefe3726ab03.png\" alt=\"gho-rwa\" data-base62-sha1=\"q0k43d4G5ecVtdGUKW1OrQ4blar\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>Another important development is the emergence and adoption of Real World Assets (RWAs). We believe GHO is the perfect candidate to accommodate the introduction of RWAs within the Aave ecosystem. After the release of Aave Protocol V4, Aave Labs (together with other Aave DAO contributors) would like to focus on innovating solutions around adoption of RWA-based products built around GHO, which will help to scale GHO further as an infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Research on this topic is already underway, and we will be working closely with Chainlink to build the necessary technologies.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"aave-network-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-network-9\"></a>Aave Network</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/01b0490871a60b37229a8aa16f5ba3d606d73415.png\" alt=\"aave-network\" data-base62-sha1=\"eWalLj39Laq9dlaxaVXuspw0ND\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>Aave Labs suggests the introduction of the Aave Network that can serve as the primary hub for Aave and GHO, while remaining multichain and network-agnostic. The network can serve a variety of uses that fulfill requests frequently expressed by Aave users, for example, democratizing access to the Safety Module by lowering cost. The Network can serve as the main voting network for Aave Governance V3 developed by BGD Labs. It can also serve as the primary hub for the Aave cross-chain strategy.</p>\n<p>While Ethereum would remain the home of the Aave DAO and the Aave governance, the network can bring unprecedented growth to Aave and GHO by opening up unexplored markets. We believe there are some key features that should be considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using GHO for fees: with the use of Validium on top of Aave Network, enables cost-effective and micro payments and improves the UX.</li>\n<li>Aave V4 integrated at the network level: Aave V4 will become the main network liquidity hub, with simple integration access for developers.</li>\n<li>AAVE as main staking asset for decentralized validators/sequencers</li>\n<li>Governance control of the Aave Network interfaces to Ethereum through the Aave Governance V3</li>\n<li>Extensive usage of Account Abstraction</li>\n<li>Inheriting the network security from Ethereum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aave Labs will be monitoring the evolution of both L1 and L2 networks with the goal of assisting the DAO in choosing the best technology for this fundamental piece of infrastructure and to make sure key features above are integrated.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"updated-aave-protocol-visual-identity-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#updated-aave-protocol-visual-identity-10\"></a>Updated Aave Protocol Visual Identity</h3>\n<p>To bring together our ideas for the future of the Aave Protocol, we recognize the need for a cohesive and updated visual identity to carry the Aave Protocol into this new chapter. We propose streamlining the Aave visual mark to make it more modern and distinctive within and outside the DeFi space. It is essential that Aave have a distinctive visual mark that reinforces awareness as well as builds brand loyalty. This update is pivotal in propelling the community towards the idea of Aave 2030, ensuring that the visual identity effectively represents the ambitions and supports the community’s strategic goals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/daff14b30853fbad80281a9cb95ad68a7d74adbb.png\" alt=\"aave-visual-id\" data-base62-sha1=\"vfkAZZKJOGHfqqxt1wPoXOm9FqP\" width=\"1556\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>This proposed change and its rationale have been described in a separate Temp Check <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-visual-identity/17542\">here</a>, where it can be evaluated, discussed, and if approved by the community, immediately implemented. We welcome feedback on this key element in the associated governance proposal.</p>\n<p>Note: The proposed new Aave Visual Identity will be irrevocably licensed to the Aave DAO. This license will grant the community the broad rights to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and communicate the visual identity for the benefit of the Aave Protocol, the Aave ecosystem, the Aave DAO, and related activities. The use of the visual identity will be strictly prohibited for malicious activities, including but not limited to phishing scams and impersonation. This identity will be separate from that of Aave Labs, which will have its own distinct identity. For the purposes of this proposal, we are using the newly proposed visual identity in an effort to showcase the vision for the brand.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"additional-ideas-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#additional-ideas-11\"></a>Additional Ideas</h3>\n<p>The following ideas are projects that Aave Labs will commit to exploring during the three-year-period, but will not form part of the compensation for this proposal.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"new-products-built-around-aave-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#new-products-built-around-aave-12\"></a>New Products Built Around Aave</h3>\n<p>Aave Labs is planning, in the same three year timeframe, to introduce entirely new DeFi products. While these will be new and independent products, Aave Labs is planning to provide the Aave DAO with significant exposure to these new products and their governance, because these technologies are capable of further propelling the growth of Aave and GHO. However, Aave Labs will work independently to determine the terms and technical implementations of these products until they are ready to be shared with the community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"expanding-aave-protocol-to-non-evm-chains-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#expanding-aave-protocol-to-non-evm-chains-13\"></a>Expanding Aave Protocol to non-EVM chains</h3>\n<p>2023 and 2024 have been amazing years of growth in the crypto space. While the EVM ecosystem leads the way, there have been a number of emergent, non-EVM networks that have gained considerable user traction. The Aave ecosystem’s homebase is (and should be on) Ethereum. However, given the Protocol’s network-agnostic position, we at Aave Labs believe the opportunity to expand to other networks cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p>This aligns with the internal research conducted by the Aave Labs. We are pleased to announce that we are prepared to submit a specific proposal to the DAO shortly. If the proposal is adopted by the DAO, we can move forward swiftly and aim for implementation of the proposal by the end of 2024.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-14\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>To effectively manage and implement the ideas outlined in this Aave 2030 Temp Check, we propose the following approach, broken down into specific goals and timelines.</p>\n<p><strong>First Year</strong></p>\n<p>Agreement Scope:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of a New Aave Visual Identity</li>\n<li>Aave V4 Prototype (Q4 2024)</li>\n<li>Aave V4 Code Completion (Q2 2025)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional Efforts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration with a minimum of one new, innovative GHO facilitator</li>\n<li>Support on the integration of one non-EVM chain</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Second and Third Year:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave Network</li>\n<li>CCLL (Cross Chain Liquidity Layer)</li>\n<li>Research and introduction of RWA product</li>\n<li>Integration with a minimum of one additional non-EVM chain</li>\n<li>A minimum of one Aave Labs product that is intended to propel growth of Aave/GHO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will assess priorities on an annual basis at renewal of this proposal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/bf2ec7fa93355bb673ad0bf732aaa2a49ba35f8c.png\" alt=\"timeline\" data-base62-sha1=\"rhhqlRXiFpaf631aPjwK2nvCUdC\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"funding-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#funding-15\"></a>Funding</h2>\n<p>Historically, Aave Labs sought retroactive funding from the DAO following the development of Aave Protocol V3. This method had its merits and allowed us to innovate and prove success before presenting the accomplishments to the community for compensation. However, the community requested a more proactive engagement model that states and seeks approval for costs in advance.</p>\n<p>We have thus shifted towards proposing a model where we outline the grant roadmap and associated budget in advance. This approach ensures mutual understanding in advance of the proposed work and agreement on the objectives and timeline with sharing and discussing with the community updates along the way.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"requested-budget-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#requested-budget-16\"></a>Requested Budget</h2>\n<p>For the execution of the first year of this three-year plan, Aave Labs requests a grant with a budget of 15M GHO and 25,000 stkAAVE to cover the following costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R&amp;D</li>\n<li>Technical Engineering Resources</li>\n<li>Non-Technical Resources</li>\n<li>Audits (excluding community’s existing agreements with security contributors)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"terms-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#terms-17\"></a>Terms</h2>\n<p>The roadmap to realize our ambitious ideas spans three years, underscoring Aave Labs’ long term commitment.

Periodically, the composition of this group undergoes renewals in which members may join, stay, or leave based on community votes. This process has occurred in the past, with the last renewal taking place in 2022. At present, it’s time for another round of renewals to ensure the Aave Guardians continue to embody the evolving interests and needs of the Aave community.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Aave Guardians play a vital role in protecting the Aave Protocol.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to start a renewal of the aave guardian, allowing for the removal of members who wish to step down &amp; the addition of new members more reflective of the Aave DAO’s current active contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces 2 different Guardians, with a majority of non-common members on each one, and different roles.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protocol-emergency-guardian-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#protocol-emergency-guardian-7\"></a>Protocol emergency Guardian</h3>\n<p>This Guardian is the holder of <code>EMERGENCY_ADMIN</code> role in Aave v3, together with similar role in v2 and surrounding systems.<br>\nGiven that speed is mandatory in an emergency situation, the members recommended are entities really active within the Aave DAO, for example service providers and delegates.</p>\n<p><em>Its multi-sig configuration will be a 5-of-9.</em></p>\n<p>Members proposed (1 representative of each):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chaos Labs (risk service provider).</li>\n<li>Llamarisk (risk service provider).</li>\n<li>Karpatkey (finance service provider).</li>\n<li>Certora (security service provider).</li>\n<li>Tokenlogic (finance service provider).</li>\n<li>BGD Labs (development service provider).</li>\n<li>ACI (growth and business development service provider).</li>\n<li>Ezr3al (Aave DAO delegate).</li>\n<li>Stable Labs (Aave DAO delegate).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"governance-emergency-guardian-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#governance-emergency-guardian-8\"></a>Governance emergency Guardian</h3>\n<p>This other Guardian has an even less frequent role: cancel governance proposal whenever detected as malicious or containing mistakes (detected on the on-chain verification stage by Certora).<br>\nThe rationale of being composed by different members than the Protocol emergency Guardian is that cancellation permissions whenever possible should be held by a different party than protocol-emergency ones. In addition, speed is not as critical as the Protocol emergency Guardian, given that Aave proposals happen during a period of 5 days, and problems can always be detected with enough time-margin.</p>\n<p><em>Its multi-sig configuration will be a 5-of-9.</em></p>\n<p>Members proposed (1 representative of each):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ACI (growth and business development service provider).

Created by stablecoin issuer platform STASIS, EURS mirrors the euro’s value on the blockchain and is supported by assurance mechanisms provided via an ecosystem of liquidity providers, custodians, exchanges, payment platforms, and others. Each token is backed 1:1 by euros held in the company’s reserve accounts (1).</p>\n<p>STASIS is a European Web3 fintech company that develops customer-friendly instruments to manage digital currencies and public blockchains for payments and settlements, e-commerce, and DeFi. This platform has a solid track record and vast expertise in technological, financial, and legal fields. Since all EURS are backed with fiat euro, there is no risk for investors and everyday users, who can always exchange their digital assets to fiat and vice versa thanks to the firm’s Sellback Service (2).</p>\n<p>EURS stablecoin combines experience, trust, technology, and financial infrastructure to enable business growth, narrowing the gap between the European financial and digital asset markets. EURS is the oldest, largest and legal stablecoin, accessible in 175 countries. Issued since 2018, STASIS EURO has zero conflict of interest and is audited by a top global firm — the BDO. All EURS assets are backed on a 1:1 basis with liquid euro balances or cash, and reserves are held at the Lithuanian Central Bank. With over 6B euros transferred on-chain, EURS supports 7 blockchains.</p>\n<p>Since USD-backed stablecoins are heavily dominating the market, Europeans/Asians are regularly forced into undesired dollar exposure with little on-chain hedging options. EURS stablecoin seeks to challenge the U.S. Dollar’s dominance in global financial markets. By 2024, it had become a popular tool for daily transactions, free of risks and volatility inherent in conventional cryptocurrencies. The potential of stablecoins use cases has been recognized in times of crisis, and the demand for EURS is growing steadily in the DeFi field.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Increase Borrowing Limit: Raising the borrowing limit for EURS will allow for larger positions, accommodating the needs of users who require higher liquidity for trading, yield farming, or hedging.</li>\n<li>Remove the Isolation Status: Currently, EURS is designated as an isolated asset, which means it can only be used as collateral for borrowing the same asset. Removing this restriction will enable EURS to be used as collateral for borrowing other assets, thereby enhancing its utility and integration into the broader AAVE ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Risk Assessment: Preliminary risk assessments indicate that EURS maintains robust backing and compliance with relevant financial regulations, suggesting that adjustments to its borrowing parameters are justified. Further analysis and community discussion are encouraged to validate these findings.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"benefits-for-aave-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#benefits-for-aave-4\"></a>Benefits for AAVE</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced liquidity: Increasing the borrowing limit and removing isolation status will enhance liquidity, making it easier for users to execute larger transactions and strategies.</li>\n<li>Increased adoption: EURS’s improved utility could lead to increased adoption, benefiting the AAVE ecosystem by attracting a larger and more diverse user base.</li>\n<li>Risk diversification: Allowing EURS to be used for a broader set of borrowing options helps diversify the risk profile of the assets on the AAVE platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#next-steps-5\"></a>Next Steps</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Receive the comprehensive feedback from the AAVE community on this proposal through discussions and Governance Forum.</li>\n<li>Conduct an on-chain voting of the proposed changes and ensure alignment with AAVE users expectation.</li>\n<li>Upon approval, coordinate with the AAVE development team for the technical implementation of the changes in the smart contracts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Community and Communication:</strong></p>\n<p>STASIS is active on Telegram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Discord server. The project team also maintains a YouTube account (3). STASIS and EURS are often mentioned in global press media (4). Gregory Klumov, the founder and CEO of the STASIS EURS project, is the project’s main spokesperson (5), often sharing his views on crypto. The STASIS website includes a mailing address in lsle of Man, and a contact e-mail (6).</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to adapt the EURS offerings on the AAVE platform to meet the evolving needs of the community while ensuring stability and security within the ecosystem. The proposed adjustments to the borrowing limits and isolation status of EURS on Polygon are designed to enhance its functionality and support broader financial activities on the platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open discussion in the forum for community feedback.</li>\n<li>Adjust the proposal based on community input and expert analysis.</li>\n<li>Proceed to a Snapshot vote if the discussion indicates general community support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Product videos</strong></p>\n<p>Team’s expertise video</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEGr3M2WZE0&amp;t=49s\">Helping decision-makers climb the learning curve in E-money 2.0</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Project Review</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWqRgi6gkPE\">STASIS / EURS - The Largest And Most Transparent Euro-backed Stablecoin In 2021 // STASIS Wallet</a></p>\n\n<p>STASIS Wallet Introduction</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJXKH6hG2-Q\">How to start using the STASIS stablecoin Wallet</a></p>\n\n<p>STASIS Wallet</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxViGuzITXM\">How to exchange cryptocurrencies in STASIS Stablecoin Wallet</a></p>\n\n<p>References</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://stasis.net/transparency\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Transparency and reserve verification</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://webapp.scb.io/service/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://webapp.scb.io/service/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Social media accounts</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog: <a href=\"https://medium.com/stasis-blog/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">STASIS Blog - Medium</a> <a href=\"https://stasis.net/blog\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">News, stories &amp;

This is equivalent to 36,500 units of AAVE emissions per year worth an estimated $3,394,500 at an AAVE price of $93.00/unit. The current annualised accrued GHO revenue, with 50M units of supply and Borrow Rate of <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3206348/5447167\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">12.26%</a> is 6.13M. The Aave DAO’s GHO revenue is sufficient to replace the AAVE emissions to stkGHO holders and meaningfully contribute to offsetting other DAO expenses like <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-is-forever-reward-system-program-extension/17336\">Merit</a>.</p>\n<p>With a bullish GHO revenue outlook, migrating stkGHO holders’ rewards from AAVE to GHO is a positive step forward for Aave DAO. As a direct result of this proposed change, the AAVE Emissions runway is extended by 13.89%. After a successful migration of stkGHO rewards to GHO, other Safety Modules can be evaluated for similar adjustments. In particular, stkBPT would make a good candidate once GHO supply is large enough to cover the corresponding $AAVE emissions.</p>\n<p>Given the recent price action in the AAVE price and the resulting lower yield on the stkGHO category, this publication propose a 20% yield on current GHO deposits.

For example, on Ethereum, there are 58 wallets that are both supplying and borrowing more than 10,000 USDC. This leads us to recommend two different options on which the community can decide: a more aggressive LT reduction, which will result in more liquidations but help reduce LT more quickly and a conservative LT reduction, which will prioritize limiting liquidations. For all options, we recommend decreasing LTV to the target of 75%.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ltltv-reduction-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#ltltv-reduction-3\"></a>LT/LTV Reduction</h2>\n<p>The overall goal of our stablecoin LT/LTV reduction is the same as on V3, ultimately achieving the following parameters:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Final LTV</th>\n<th>Final LT</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>75.00%</td>\n<td>78.00%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><em><strong>USDC (Ethereum)</strong></em></p>\n<p>Currently, reducing LT would require inducing a significant number of liquidations; a reduction of just 0.50% would create $137K in new liquidations, and a 2% reduction would create $200K in new liquidations. This is largely caused by two users (<a href=\"https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xb60bda0bab52839a3334bd849d2afb2aa566e631\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xf451d30a7ac2e56f52a36825b155b0ac1fb7a867\">2</a>), both of whom are looping USDC with itself.

More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"chain-to-be-deployedlisted-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#chain-to-be-deployedlisted-7\"></a>Chain to be deployed/listed</h3>\n<p>Aave V3 on Avalanche.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"technical-details-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#technical-details-8\"></a>Technical Details</h3>\n<p>With the recent implementation of <a href=\"https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=51\">Price Cap Adapters (CAPO)</a>, ggAVAX can be listed using an internal rate oracle without relying only on the AVAX/USD ChainLink price feed.

Previously, the community followed a two-phase process to deprecate stablecoins, with BUSD and TUSD as examples. Given the success of these, we propose a similar path forward. Notably, none of the below stablecoins are collateral assets, reducing the complication of the process.</p>\n<p>For USDP, GUSD, LUSD, FRAX, and sUSD we propose the following parameters:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Proposed Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Reserve Factor</td>\n<td>95%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Borrowing Enabled</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Base Rate</td>\n<td>3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slope1</td>\n<td>+3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slope2</td>\n<td>200%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UOptimal</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The goal of Phase I is to increase borrower APR to encourage borrowers to repay their loans; this is achieved through higher Base Rate, Slope1, Slope2, and lower UOptimal. Additionally, we recommend leaving them frozen to prevent new supplies and borrowings.
