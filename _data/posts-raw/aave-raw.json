Summary</h1>\n<p>Introducing Umbrella, a new version of the Aave Safety Module based on Aave v3 aTokens staking &amp; slashing.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"h-2-context-the-current-safety-module-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-2-context-the-current-safety-module-2\"></a>2. Context. The current Safety Module</h1>\n<p>In 2020, Aave introduced its Safety Module, a system for $AAVE (and $AAVE/WETH Balancer LP) holders to stake their tokens and gets rewards, but assuming slashing risk to cover any potential bad debt in Aave liquidity pools. This was a quite important innovation and movement to strengthen the resilience of the protocol with $AAVE tokenomics, adding more than $100m available to slash and cover bad debt if required.</p>\n<p>However, like with almost any other system, the current Aave Safety Module has shortcomings and room to improvement. More precisely, the following limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bad debt on Aave will always manifest in borrowed assets. With AAVE being a pure collateral (governance token, not borrowable), if any stkAAVE slashing happens, the AAVE would need to be sold to the asset on which the debt is denominated; so capital is not efficient.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consequence of the previous, slashing events could create bad dynamics on the coverage asset ($AAVE), as the sell pressure of the slashing itself will circularly reduce the coverage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Slashing rules are very subjective. At the moment, any slashing is decided via a governance proposals. Even if this has some positive implication (e.g. governance can decide to slash or to use treasury funds), this create very important uncertainty about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>in which situations slashing should happen.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>will $AAVE/stkAAVE holders vote for slashing.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>exactly which networks/pools are really covered by the Safety Module.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the previous have been addressed via governance frameworks (e.g. which pools/networks are covered), but subjectivity in this context is not really positive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Even if mandatory, auction mechanisms for slashed funds are not well defined, as the Safety Module doesn’t have a native auction module.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The system is relatively rigid on incentives, as each staked asset like stkAAVE can only have one type of rewards (currently AAVE), which is not really aligned with the community direction of for example having AAVE, GHO, or any other.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Staking and slashing is fully Ethereum based, which adds limitations on both capital acquisition for staking or even operational complexity to move slashed funds to any network to cover bad debt.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Umbrella, the new Safety Module, tries to address all the previous limitations of the system.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-umbrella-the-new-safety-module-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-3-umbrella-the-new-safety-module-3\"></a>3.

Their replacement will be objectively the most effective assets to cover Aave debt: Aave aTokens.</p>\n<p>All suppliers of aTokens on any Aave pool with no borrowings, will have the opportunity to enable the STK mode. By doing this this, 3 things happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their aToken balance (or any percentage of their balance they define) becomes slashable, to cover Shortfall Events in <em>specifically the aToken they hold</em>. E.g. if an user of aUSDC enables STK on their position and a loss happens affecting aUSDC suppliers, he will lose partially or totally his aUSDC balance.</li>\n<li>The user will start earning incentives, to compensate the utility they are bringing to the Aave protocol (risk of slashing). This could be in the same denomination of his aToken, $GHO, $AAVE or any other (or combination of them).</li>\n<li>In the meantime, the user will keep accruing yield on his aToken position, as factually he is just another supplier to Aave; just with extra risk, and of course extra reward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To highlight why aTokens are the best possible staking/slashable asset, it is important to understand what bad debt technically is. Bad debt accrual in an Aave pool means that one or multiple positions have less collateral than liabilities, which leads to a situation on which the user has no incentive to repay and consequently, if all depositors of the borrowed asset would try to withdraw, there would be a deficit.</p>\n<p>Whenever any amount of aTokens get slashed on Umbrella, <em>no selling is needed to cover the deficit, only burning is required</em>. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A total of 1’000 USDC is supplied to Aave v3 Ethereum, reflecting in 1’000 aUSDC total supply.</li>\n<li>Due to a collateral failure, 100 USDC bad debt is created. That means that only the ~900 USDC (interest aside) out of the 1’000 USDC supplied can be withdrawn.</li>\n<li>However, 200 aUSDC are staked in Umbrella. When the 100 USDC Shortfall Event happens, 100 aUSDC are slashed, and afterwards, burnt.</li>\n<li>After the aUSDC burn, aUSDC supply is 900, same as the 900 USDC liquidity withdrawable; so the system is whole.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"per-network-atoken-staking-slashing-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#per-network-atoken-staking-slashing-5\"></a>Per-network aToken staking &amp; slashing</h2>\n<p>On the previous Safety Module, using Ethereum as staking &amp; slashing network had quite strong rationale: Ethereum was the most secure blockchain network; the Aave ecosystem was quite Ethereum-focused, with only a limited number of other instances appearing (e.g. Polygon and Avalanche on Aave v2); or the Safety Module infrastructure would be quite complex if having staking &amp; slashing in non-Ethereum venues.</p>\n<p>With Umbrella this approach changes radically: bad debt potentially accrues on each Aave instance in isolation, and having aTokens <em>of an specific Aave v3 instance</em> as staked assets only makes natural that users of Aave on network X will opt-in to stake for that Aave instance.</p>\n<p>For example, it is very simple for a supplier of WETH on Aave v3 Arbitrum to decide if he wants to stake his aWETH for rewards and slashing risk, if bad debt accrues on his own supplied asset. However it becomes way more complicated for the same user to decide if he wants to stake for a different asset in a different network.</p>\n<p>We see the system evolving with more heterogeneous assets and coverage strategies, but as basic building block we believe it is better to start simple: <strong>each Aave pool on each network will have its own Umbrella, where all aTokens users will be able to stake to cover the asset associated with their aTokens</strong>.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"automated-no-governance-and-precise-slashing-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#automated-no-governance-and-precise-slashing-6\"></a>Automated (no governance) and precise slashing</h2>\n<p>Umbrella will not depend on Aave governance proposals for slashing, this will be done automatically and in a decentralised way, with rules clearly defined on the smart contracts. This is achieved with the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Aave pools will be updated to account for accrued bad debt on each asset. This will allow to precisely understand on-chain how much potentially needs to be covered by Umbrella.</li>\n<li>Once the bad debt in an asset crosses certain configurable minimum threshold (to protect for example against bad debt “dust” organically accruing), the system will allow anybody to initiate an slashing action. The Aave Robot automation system will be plugged to this.</li>\n<li>Each asset to cover will have associated its stk aToken to slash from. Once the slashing event happens, slash will be immediately processed, and funds sent externally to another contract controlled by the DAO.</li>\n<li>Once the aTokens are burnt, Umbrella will account for them, to discount the amount from any future slashing needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Introducing automatic and fast slashing has major implications simplifying the current Safety Module, more precisely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cooldown technically can be slightly reduced.</li>\n<li>No mechanism to return funds post slashing is really needed, as the required amount will be exact. This is very important security-wise, reducing any vector of so-called donations.</li>\n<li>No post-slashing window is needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"new-incentives-engine-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#new-incentives-engine-7\"></a>New incentives engine</h2>\n<p>With the Aave community lately doing an exceptional job on incentives management (e.g. Merit from ACI), we thought that Umbrella should have a powerful incentives management system, trying to cover as best as possible the needs of the Safety Module. The new system has the following characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multi-rewards</strong>. Following the approach of Aave v3 pools, Umbrella allows for any staked asset to have one or multiple rewards at the same time. For example, stk aUSDT could be receiving simultaneously $AAVE and $USDT rewards, the first from the Ecosystem Reserve, and the second from the protocol revenue (e.g Reserve Factor).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Coverage target</strong>. When defining an amount of rewards for the Safety Module, implicitly the approach is doing it by asking the question “how many rewards should we configure in order to have X amount of assets available to slash and cover bad debt?”.</p>\n<p>Umbrella will introduce a more dynamic rewards curve (stk Utilisation Curve), automatically optimising rewards to try to be close to the coverage amount targeted (stk Safety Target), but without over spending. This means that if the staked amount is lower than the target configured, rewards will be proportionally higher but without spiking to thousands of APR percent. If staked amount is too high, the system will adjust rewards proportionally lower.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"stkgho-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#stkgho-8\"></a>stkGHO</h2>\n<p>Back in the days, we recommended other contributors to introduce stkGHO in the Safety Module. The rationale is that stkGHO is factually an aToken for all Safety Module purposes, and consequently, the best possible asset to cover GHO bad debt.</p>\n<p>stkGHO will keep existing on Umbrella as main coverage asset of GHO, only adapting its smart contracts to be fully compatible with the new system.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"more-flexibility-on-staked-assets-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#more-flexibility-on-staked-assets-9\"></a>More flexibility on staked assets</h2>\n<p>Even with aTokens being the corner stone of the system, we have taken into account the appetite of the community for other types of assets (like GHO LPs), and the system will enable each Aave asset covered by multiple stk.</p>\n<p>In this case, whenever an slashing happens, all staked assets for the one to cover will be slashed proportionally (or following more complex strategies, like tranching), and those in different denomination (e.g. GHO/USDC to cover GHO) will need to be auctioned.</p>\n<p>To start with though, we propose the following limitations, to not overcomplicate the system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given its role in the Aave ecosystem, only GHO should have more than one staked asset associated.</li>\n<li>Only staked assets heavily correlated to the one to cover should be added to the coverage set to start. For example, a GHO/USDT LP token can be enabled to cover GHO, but to avoid complexity, better to avoid others like GHO/WETH.</li>\n<li>Incentives definition should be carefully evaluated when having multiple assets to stake for the same, as the management of them is substantially more complicated than with just aTokens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once again, in the future we envision a system with more complex coverage strategies, but we think it is more reasonable to start simpler on the first version of Umbrella.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"misc-features-of-umbrella-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#misc-features-of-umbrella-10\"></a>Misc features of Umbrella</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar as with all other BGD projects on Aave, Umbrella has been designed to be flexible enough to adapt to future needs of the community. For that reason, the implementation should be compatible with new Aave sub-systems, including Aave v4, by doing only minor adjustments.</li>\n<li>Umbrella will have emergency mechanisms similar to EMERGENCY_ADMIN functions on Aave.</li>\n<li>During the design of Umbrella, we analysed the introduction of a mechanism like the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-introducing-fastpass-a-safety-module-update/17376\">Fast Pass proposed</a>. However, the practical constraints that should include (e.g. it would only shorten the “standard” cooldown, but always leaving 7-10 days) led us to not propose it as part of Umbrella.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"h-4-stkaave-and-stkabpt-future-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-4-stkaave-and-stkabpt-future-11\"></a>4. stkAAVE and stkABPT future</h1>\n<p>As previously mentioned, both stkAAVE and stkABPT are not good coverage assets on the Safety Module, due to their lack of correlation with the assets potentially accruing bad debt on the Aave pools. Consequently, Umbrella will not have them as stk Assets; they will be replaced by stk aTokens.</p>\n<p>However, it is very clear that there is an appetite for usage of both stkAAVE and stkABPT into staking venues of the Aave tokenomics, with $400m supplied. For that reason, even if not including any strategy on this post to avoid confusion, we are collaborating with ACI for a new proposal to add extra AAVE utility, involving both stkAAVE and stkABPT, but in a different role compared with staked assets on Umbrella.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"h-5-glossary-and-faq-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-5-glossary-and-faq-12\"></a>5.

On the other hand, an LP token will require a Liquidation Mechanism slashing the stk and selling the LP to the required aToken underlying, to finally burn it.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"stk-safety-target-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#stk-safety-target-18\"></a>→ stk Safety Target</h3>\n<p>Optimal coverage size for an stk Asset, working as main reference for automatic adjustment of the stk Utilisation Curve.</p>\n<p>For example, a 50m USDC could be configured as stk Safety Target for stkUSDC, which would mean that rewards would be targeting a maximum of 50m aUSDC staked.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"stk-utilisation-curve-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#stk-utilisation-curve-19\"></a>→ stk Utilisation Curve</h3>\n<p>Function automatically regulating rewards, by using the stk Safety Target as reference:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whenever the total staked assets are below the Safety Target, rewards are proportionally higher in a controlled manner, as the system needs to incentivise the entry of new capital.</li>\n<li>Whenever the total staked assets are above the Safety Target, rewards are proportionally lower in a controller manner, as the system needs to incentivise the exit of part of the capital.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal of the Utilisation Curve is to automate as much as possible the configuration of any rewards distribution, limiting external oracles to define the yield that stk participants will get at Safety Target size.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"faq-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#faq-20\"></a>FAQ</h2>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"why-having-isolated-instances-of-the-safety-module-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#why-having-isolated-instances-of-the-safety-module-21\"></a>→ Why having isolated instances of the Safety Module?</h3>\n<p>One core idea of this new Safety Module is for users to earn a yield premium on top of their aTokens in exchange for additional slashing risk. Given how this specifically targets users of an Aave  instance/network, it is just natural and simpler that for example aUSDC v3 Arbitrum holders will have the possibility to cover bad debt of aUSDC v3 Arbitrum and not others, at least in the initial version of the system.</p>\n<p>Additional arguments for this decision are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having an aggregated layer of staked assets between networks would make very complicated to define incentives, and it is our duty on the development side to not off-board complexity to additional contributors (and cost for the DAO).</li>\n<li>Revenue for the DAO is accrued on each specific asset, on each specific pool, on each specific network. An organic and sustainable strategy would be using part of that revenue (e.g. a percentage of the Reserve Factor) to incentivise its associated stk Safety Pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"why-atokens-as-main-underlying-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#why-atokens-as-main-underlying-22\"></a>→ Why aTokens as main underlying?</h3>\n<p>Bad debt accrual on a system like Aave means that part of the aToken holders will not be able to withdraw from Aave. By having aToken as underlying of the Safety Module, aToken holders participating factually opt-out to withdraw their funds if bad debt is realised.</p>\n<p>In addition, they still keep earning yield plus rewards on top in compensation of the additional slashing risk.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"why-non-atokens-as-secondary-underlying-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#why-non-atokens-as-secondary-underlying-23\"></a>→ Why non-aTokens as secondary underlying?</h3>\n<p>The Aave community has shown support to include on the previous Safety Module more heterogeneous assets, like LP tokens including GHO.</p>\n<p>The new Safety Module will accommodate to those needs, allowing any type of underlying, with the only limitation of having a solid pricing mechanism associated (e.g. secure way of pricing a GHO/USDC LP token).</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"how-many-rewards-an-stk-asset-can-have-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#how-many-rewards-an-stk-asset-can-have-24\"></a>→ How many rewards an stk asset can have?</h3>\n<p>Similar as with the incentives system on Aave v3, an stk instance can have multiple rewards, mainly limited by the gas implications of it. Realistically, we don’t expect more than 3 rewards for a single stk simultaneously.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"how-rewards-should-be-configured-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#how-rewards-should-be-configured-25\"></a>→ How rewards should be configured?</h3>\n<p>Rewards are configured based on having a competitive yield premium versus risk on the stk Safety Target. For example, if the Safety Target for USDC on v3 Ethereum is 50m USDC and the market seeks for an extra 3% to participate on the Safety Module, rewards would be in the order of $1’500’000 per year.</p>\n<p>In practise, the entity controlling rewards configuration will configure a rewards per second at the Safety Target, and the Stk Utilisation Curve will provide to the protocol the exact rewards depending on how far the staked liquidity is from the Safety Target.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"apart-from-atokens-which-other-assets-can-be-part-of-the-safety-module-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#apart-from-atokens-which-other-assets-can-be-part-of-the-safety-module-26\"></a>→ Apart from aTokens, which other assets can be part of the Safety Module?</h3>\n<p>The design of the Safety Module is pretty agnostic to the underlying: whenever bad debt needs to be covered, Umbrella will slash from the appropriate Safety Pool X amount of assets. How the Safety Pool sources the the funds can be as custom as necessary.</p>\n<p>Example WETH:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Umbrella asks for 10 WETH to cover bad debt to the WETH Ethereum Safety Pool.</li>\n<li>The WETH Ethereum Safety Pool has as underlying only stkAWETH (aToken of WETH v3 Ethereum), so will slash the full amount from it.</li>\n<li>Umbrella will burn the 10 aWETH and account for the bad debt cleanup.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example GHO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Umbrella asks for 20’000 GHO to cover bad debt to the GHO Ethereum Safety Pool.</li>\n<li>The GHO Ethereum Safety Pool has 2 different underlyings: stkGHO and stkECLP-GHO-USDC (Gyroscope LP). Following the smart contract logic, the Safety Pool will slash partially from stkGHO and partially from stkECLP-GHO-USDC, sending directly GHO from the first to burn, and via the custom auction module, selling E-CLP GHO-USDC to GHO.</li>\n<li>Umbrella will burn the 20’000 GHO and account for the bad debt cleanup.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"what-aave-instances-will-be-covered-by-the-safety-module-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#what-aave-instances-will-be-covered-by-the-safety-module-27\"></a>→ What Aave instances will be covered by the Safety Module?</h3>\n<p>The new Safety Module is prepared to cover any Aave instance on any network where Aave lives.

Consequently, the amount of rewards required to incentivise the system is substantially lower in value compared with the current Safety Module.</p>\n<p>For example, with an Umbrella aggregated size of $100m for assets on Aave v3 Ethereum, $5m/year would provide 5% rewards, which would mean more than 10% yield on stablecoins aTokens (calculation based on 5-6% yearly average stablecoins aToken rates).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the required coverage per asset per pool will be a percentage of the outstanding borrowings, which is same concept as the Reserve Factor. Part of the proceeds of the Reserve Factor could be allocated as rewards to stk Assets on Umbrella.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"h-6-next-steps-32\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-6-next-steps-32\"></a>6.

The proposed contributions extend over the three themes detailed below: Treasury Management, GHO adoption and the Aave Stack.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership has created significant value for the Aave DAO across all three focus areas detailed <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/phase-i-summary-karpatkey-tokenlogic/17962\">here</a>. GHO’s peg, liquidity, and growth prospects have each improved dramatically over the last 6 months. The DAO’s finances are more transparent than ever before and the DAO is firmly positioned for growth.</p>\n<p>Building on the success of Phase I, we seek to extend our collaboration with the Aave Community for another 6 months. Phase II of our engagement is to focus on enabling GHO and Aave to grow market share through prudent financial management and contributing to numerous growth initiatives. Our three primary focus areas are summarized below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Treasury Management</li>\n<li>GHO Adoption</li>\n<li>Aave Stack</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"what-to-expect-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#what-to-expect-4\"></a>What to Expect</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"treasury-management-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#treasury-management-5\"></a>Treasury Management</h3>\n<p><strong>Asset Management</strong></p>\n<p>The Aave DAO receives revenue in the form of revenue-generating aTokens for each deployed lending market. Whilst that reduces the need to deploy assets beyond the protocol itself, this creates a need for continual rebalancing of asset holdings.</p>\n<p>To facilitate streamlining routine operational tasks, the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-finance-steward/17570\">Finance Steward</a> role, which has been already introduced to the Aave community, will be developed. Given the ability to create allowances, streams, perform transfers, assets bridging, and swaps within pre-approved guidelines and without AIPs, we expect the governance overhead around treasury management to decrease significantly.</p>\n<p>The GHO Finance Steward’s capacity to perform swaps will also be improved by the implementation of the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-swap-upgrade/15311\">Aave Swap</a> contract. With this tool, the DAO will be able to acquire assets in a timely and targeted manner, and to support GHO’s peg during turbulent market conditions with the ability to create limit orders.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Security</strong></p>\n<p>A key objective is to define the DAO’s annual budget and secure sufficient funds to ensure DAO operations under stressfull market conditions. As the DAO’s revenues have exceeded the burn-rate and currently holds more assets (about $145M at <a href=\"https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=9&amp;month=6&amp;year=2024&amp;currency=USD\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">end of June</a>) than planned expenses, this proposal will target to cover a <a href=\"https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/runway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">six months’ runway</a> matching holdings with expense tokens or token class as deemed appropriate for capital efficiency. This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO.</p>\n<p>Key components of this objective will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploying bridging contracts (as required);</li>\n<li>Bridging Aave funds between networks;</li>\n<li>Alocating assets for capital efficiency. In particular, migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and</li>\n<li>Swapping assets to align expenses and holdings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Aave Analytics</strong></p>\n<p>Reporting and analytics functions will be expanded to provide the utmost transparency into the DAO’s financial status and overall performance of the protocol, and to support informed decision-making and analysis of the Aave ecosystem. This includes the <a href=\"https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aave Portal</a> and the <a href=\"https://reports.karpatkey.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aave Treasury Report</a>, which shows detailed information on DAO holdings and treasury performance.</p>\n<p>The Aave Portal will continue to evolve to showcase the performance of the Aave Protocol and GHO’s adoption. Over the next 6 months, the portal will expand to include all revenue sources (incl. Accrued), assets holdings and expenses (incl. budgets) in granular detail, whilst also beginning to include high-level performance tracking across existing covered deployments.<br>\nSeveral legacy community Dune Dashboards will be integrated into the Aave Portal, where they will be maintained and expanded upon over time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"gho-adoption-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gho-adoption-6\"></a>GHO Adoption</h3>\n<p><strong>Oversight</strong></p>\n<p>During Phase II, GHO’s growth is expected to accelerate and expand to several networks. To nurture and maximize the growth potential of GHO, its success hinges on the ability to hold its peg and scale simultaneously.</p>\n<p>As a GHO Steward, we will continue to manage key GHO and GSM configurations, including Borrow Rate, GSM Caps, and GSM fees. As the Treasury Managers, we will ensure the GSM is adequately funded, targetting a collateralization in the range of 5% to 10% of total supply, and that GHO swaps are performed in a manner supportive of retaining a tight peg.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>We will continue to lead the operations of the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), overseeing the liquidity growth across different protocols. This includes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusting liquidity incentives to maintain sufficient market depth;</li>\n<li>Defining and executing direct liquidity incentives;</li>\n<li>Leading initiatives that create utility for GHO;</li>\n<li>Optimizing the utilization of the DAO’s strategic voting assets;</li>\n<li>Supporting GSM Integrations with aggregators;</li>\n<li>Ensuring GSM are adequately funded;</li>\n<li>Supporting future D3M, Facilitator, and Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) initiatives; and</li>\n<li>Support efforts to integrate GHO to Centralized Exchanges, and fund managers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Growth</strong></p>\n<p>As GHO continues to grow beyond Ethereum, our efforts will expand to support those new deployments to ensure adequate liquidity and peg stability is maintained. We will continue to work with teams that build with GHO and advocate for the adoption of GHO wherever practical.</p>\n<p>When GHO is mature enough to support deploying Protocol Owned Liquidity, we will actively contribute to the creation of sGHO and balancing the needs for sGHO and stkGHO within the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"aave-stack-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-stack-7\"></a>Aave Stack</h3>\n<p><strong>Safety Module Management and Optimisation</strong></p>\n<p>The Safety Module (SM) currently presents exposure risks due to its reliance on the DAO’s native token and its deployment solely on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>With multiple instances of the SM being deployed, we will continue to perform the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transition from AAVE emissions;</li>\n<li>Introduce new categories;</li>\n<li>Amend emission schedules; and,</li>\n<li>Progressively align protocol exposure with SM holdings;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Aave Liquidity Network</strong></p>\n<p>With upcoming changes in the Aave product stack, including the Liquidity Network and the stablecoin’s multichain deployment, new challenges will arise in integrating these aspects with other products.

Thank you for reviewing this proposal and for your earlier questions and positive vote in the snapshot.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Although the Aave Protocol has emerged as a leader within DeFi, the sector at large is still in its nascent stages, and Aave should work hard to retain its spot as a leader. For the events proposal from the DAO for 2024, Aave Labs wants to concentrate on proposing fewer but higher-quality events to maximize impact.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>Aave Labs is requesting a budget allocation for 650,000 GHO for events for the remainder of 2024 for EthCC Brussels (45%) and Devcon Bangkok (55%). These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Hackathons &amp; Bounties: We want to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, and to remain visible and competitive in a growing industry, but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem. We propose to sponsor one ETHGlobal hackathon in Q4 in Bangkok.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open Finance Day: We are hosting Open Finance Day in partnership with key players in DeFi for high quality talks, networking, and light bites. Talks will include members of the DeFi community, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members and service providers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences is an opportunity to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge, and industry insights. Typically featuring panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts, side events are designed to strengthen awareness of Aave and GHO technology among strategic audiences, reach new target audiences, and ensure Aave and GHO remain top-of-mind within and outside the community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Merch: Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the new visual identity and the beloved Ronnie ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merchandise people actually wear, use, and love.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>rAAVE: To celebrate the Aave community’s welcoming culture, we aim to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Brussels and Devcon in Bangkok. To mitigate some costs for rAAVE, we are planning to potentially obtain co-sponsorship with current or potentially new partners for the Aave ecosystem. Due to the event’s high visibility, it is crucial that if co-sponsorship is obtained, the selected partners are aligned with the Aave Community and this is conducted in a balanced manner.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"activations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#activations-4\"></a>Activations</h1>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>rAAVE</td>\n<td>July &amp; Nov TBD</td>\n<td>During the weeks of EthCC &amp; Devcon. rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem.

CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> platform.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every<br>\nwallet. As of June 2024, <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange<br>\nplatform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform.</p>\n<p>To enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> introduced a Liquid<br>\nStaking Token (LST) - <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).</p>\n<p>Currently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues.</p>\n<p>Other liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers.</p>\n<p>The liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> platform.</p>\n<p>Integrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand<br>\nfrom CDCETH users on the <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> platform to utilize the LST as collateral to<br>\nborrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as<br>\ncollateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded,</p>\n<p>Confidential banners/listings on the <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main<br>\nApp platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.<br>\nOnboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users<br>\nand <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve<br>\nCDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH &amp; Aave adoption<br>\n&amp; increased revenues for both parties.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proof-of-liquidity-pol-and-deposit-commitments-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#proof-of-liquidity-pol-and-deposit-commitments-6\"></a>Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.</p>\n<p>Integration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a>’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-7\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>Contract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e<br>\nRate Provider contract for current exchange rate:<br>\n0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)</p>\n<p>Risk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"audits-relevant-links-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#audits-relevant-links-8\"></a>Audits &amp; Relevant links</h3>\n<p>Audit: <a href=\"https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\">https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024</a><br>\nIssuer: <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a><br>\nWhitepaper: CDCETH<br>\nDeFillama: <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth\">https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth</a><br>\nCoingecko: <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth\">https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> Staking page: <a href=\"https://crypto.com/staking\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Crypto Staking — Crypto.com | Earn up to 16.64% per year by staking with us</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> Liquid Staking Q&amp;A page: <a href=\"https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Liquid Staking | Crypto.com Help Center</a></p>\n<p>Community:<br>\nTwitter/X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptocom\" class=\"inline-onebox\">x.com</a><br>\nTelegram: <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a><br>\nNews on Telegram: <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a><br>\nDiscord: <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"disclaimer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#disclaimer-9\"></a>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>The ACI is not directly affiliated with <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> and did not receive compensation for the creation of this proposal.
