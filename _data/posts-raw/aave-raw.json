Since ggAVAX generates consistently higher yields than other LSTs, borrowers can tolerate higher interest payments, leading to AVAX utilisation and revenue for the DAO.</p>\n<p>Currently, AVAX utilisation sits well below the Optimal Utilisation Rate. More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"chain-to-be-deployedlisted-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#chain-to-be-deployedlisted-7\"></a>Chain to be deployed/listed</h3>\n<p>Aave V3 on Avalanche.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proof-of-liquidity-pol-and-deposit-commitments-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#proof-of-liquidity-pol-and-deposit-commitments-8\"></a>Proof of Liquidity (POL)  and Deposit Commitments</h3>\n<p>GoGoPool has earmarked 10k GGP tokens (worth +100K USD at average 90-day prices) for incentivising ggAVAX deposits into AAVE over the first three months of the listing to help bootstrap the market adoption and attract leverage takers.</p>\n<p>After the listing is complete, we plan to work tightly with Avalanche ecosystem partners to integrate the market into their products. This can include autocompounding vaults, composite strategies and auto-leverage vaults.</p>\n<p>These and other integrations would help drive usage to the ggAVAX market specifically and AAVE in general.

To accommodate this demand and facilitate protocol growth, this proposal suggests increasing the supply cap of weETH on the Ethereum pool and the borrow cap at 25% of the new supply cap amount. This proposal also aims at changing the interestRate Strategy to place the optimal ratio at 25% of liquidity.</p>\n<p>Expanding borrow capacity will result in a higher collateral yield, which in turn creates a positive flywheel effect on supply and demand. By maintaining the borrow cap at an optimal ratio (25%) of the supply cap, we can balance risk, available liquidity, and LP yield effectively.</p>\n<p>We also propose to increase weETH RF to 20% to contribute to Aave DAO revenue.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Chain</th>\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Current Supply Cap</th>\n<th>Recommended New Supply Cap</th>\n<th>Current Borrow Cap</th>\n<th>Recommended New Borrow Cap</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum</td>\n<td>weETH</td>\n<td>16,000</td>\n<td>84,000</td>\n<td>800</td>\n<td>21,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Chain</th>\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Current Optimal ratio</th>\n<th>Recommended optimal ratio</th>\n<th>Current reserve factor</th>\n<th>Recommended New reserve factor</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum</td>\n<td>weETH</td>\n<td>45%</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n<td>15%</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"next-steps-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#next-steps-7\"></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Gather consensus from the community and risk service providers.</li>\n<li>Escalate to ARFC Snapshot vote stage.</li>\n<li>If the Snapshot vote outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage for formal implementation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"disclaimer-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#disclaimer-8\"></a>Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>This proposal has been created independently by the ACI without external compensation or incentives.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"copyright-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#copyright-9\"></a>Copyright</h2>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0</a></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-updating-weeth-risk-parameters/17402\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-updating-weeth-risk-parameters/17402","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Apr 2024 12:22:04 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-17402"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-updating-weeth-risk-parameters/17402.rss","#text":"[ARFC] Updating weETH Risk Parameters"}},{"title":"USDP Price Spike Impact - 04/16/2024","dc:creator":"ChaosLabs","category":"Governance","description":"<h1><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#summary-1\"></a><strong>Summary</strong></h1>\n<p>An overview of the recent USDP price spike and its effects on the Aave protocol.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"analysis-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#analysis-2\"></a>Analysis</h1>\n<p>On April 16, 2024, at 12 pm ET, following a temporary spike in the price of USDP on several exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance (shown below), the stablecoin’s price reported by the Chainlink Oracle reached a high of over $1.20.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/c/c2eff2bc161397ec5561cd4197a68fa007c5d7d0.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/rOuInPyKkUq8jl0d1Bj1SbiahS8.png?dl=1\" title=\"Untitled - 2024-04-17T161304.005\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/c/c2eff2bc161397ec5561cd4197a68fa007c5d7d0_2_2000x1476.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-17T161304.005\" data-base62-sha1=\"rOuInPyKkUq8jl0d1Bj1SbiahS8\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1476\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/c/c2eff2bc161397ec5561cd4197a68fa007c5d7d0_2_2000x1476.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/c/c2eff2bc161397ec5561cd4197a68fa007c5d7d0.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/c/c2eff2bc161397ec5561cd4197a68fa007c5d7d0.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"0E0F11\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Coinbase</em><p></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/f1b28faf9c1575183c1c7ee0380ccd44c68d5417.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-17T161305.376\" data-base62-sha1=\"yu9DrkrEUHy4KOfNeU9sxtSnZk3\" width=\"1482\" height=\"704\"><br>\n<em>Binance</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b0d7a94c9cc8cab078892ab935f0f8ff97ff2a13.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-17T161309.254\" data-base62-sha1=\"peq5oEe5FT4s0gp6JCqofZsDWv1\" width=\"797\" height=\"485\"></p>\n<p>As USDP cannot be used as collateral, the risk to the Aave protocol was limited.

There still exists $24m of USDP debt on AAVE V2, most of which could be liquidated by such an attacker for a cost of less than a million dollars, allowing the attacker to liquidate such positions themselves and steal the collateral supplied. This also risks leaving the AAVE V2 Ethereum pool with bad debt. In total, only a couple hundred thousand dollars of volume on Binance was enough to increase the price of USDP by 50%.<br>\nGiven this, it would be prudent for the protocol to switch to a more reliable oracle for this asset, or delist the asset entirely before any further losses to users and the protocol are incurred. I think it would also be reasonable to discuss potential compensation for myself and the other users that were liquidated due to this unsuitable oracle.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/usdp-oracle-manipulation-event-16th-april/17385\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/usdp-oracle-manipulation-event-16th-april/17385","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 15:13:12 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-17385"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/usdp-oracle-manipulation-event-16th-april/17385.rss","#text":"USDP Oracle Manipulation Event 16th April"}},{"title":"[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Stewards - Increase Supply Cap for wstETH on V3 Polygon - 04.16.2024","dc:creator":"ChaosLabs","category":"Governance","description":"<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>A proposal to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increase the wstETH supply cap on Aave V3’s Polygon deployment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"wsteth-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#wsteth-2\"></a>wstETH</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>wstETH has nearly reached its supply cap on Polygon following new deposits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/409f22912b911545e7f766dbb34e5f4c47332512.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-16T135151.728\" data-base62-sha1=\"9dFvcOlspIRMC5313o5gfCSusOm\" width=\"1360\" height=\"180\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/385cefd69cfb83cfdc9d90162f1802552a2ed042.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-16T135154.302\" data-base62-sha1=\"82BQZld8Sgs6khorxgyI891XEeC\" width=\"1284\" height=\"392\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"supply-distribution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#supply-distribution-4\"></a>Supply Distribution</h3>\n<p>Most of the top suppliers are looping WETH and wstETH, putting these positions at limited danger of liquidations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/60cb7ad624817eb2066712309d69bd8b1ec88822.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-16T135155.907\" data-base62-sha1=\"dOhN1pbBWXQRO5iyPepsvCh2Bvc\" width=\"1298\" height=\"582\"></p>\n<p>WETH is the most commonly borrowed asset against wstETH collateral, though some users have borrowed stablecoins.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/34f1bce0bd0c80cd3467ec763872dd3faae169ab.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-16T135157.936\" data-base62-sha1=\"7ymKso0zi76Znj712G97uTCXds7\" width=\"1294\" height=\"644\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"borrow-distribution-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#borrow-distribution-5\"></a>Borrow Distribution</h3>\n<p>wstETH borrows are limited; the largest is a user who is borrowing against MATIC collateral, putting this position at risk of liquidation should MATIC’s price drop or ETH’s price increase.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/e6e661cbaf7d03cdfd86128ad7f4848f06e628b1.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-16T135159.996\" data-base62-sha1=\"wWDpnHFokk3FQXchvtsTkvqdiHD\" width=\"1296\" height=\"584\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"recommendation-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#recommendation-6\"></a>Recommendation</h3>\n<p>As per community decision, the upper bound on LST supply caps is 75% of circulating supply on a given chain.

The Safety Module is crucial to Aave’s reputation as a trusted DeFi platform due to its extensive risk mitigation measures.</p>\n<p>However, extended cooldown periods (20 days) impose additional friction, making the opportunity cost of remaining in the safety module a significant concern for some users. In current market conditions, the perceived cost of this opportunity may outweigh the reward compensation, resulting in subpar attractiveness. Moreover, the illiquid nature of staked AAVE assets restricts opportunities for composability and integrations on top of the Safety Module.</p>\n<p>FastPass enables stakers to bypass mandatory cooldown windows, offering two exit options: the existing fee-free 20-day cooldown or FastPass. We anticipate that FastPass will cater to a specific user base while contributing to increased DAO revenue for an acceptable reduction in average Safety Module coverage.</p>\n<p>To mitigate the risk of the entire Safety Module adopting FastPass and nullifying its coverage during a shortfall event, FastPass imposes a daily churn rate determined by Aave Risk Service Providers and enforced by Risk Stewards. Additionally, FastPass can be disabled entirely by Risk Stewards during a shortfall event.</p>\n<p>We propose implementing FastPass on StkGHO first, evaluating its success before expanding it to other Safety Module components.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>FastPass is an update to the Aave Safety Module, introducing a cooldown window bypass feature.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>StkGHO</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>FastPass Fee</td>\n<td>100bps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FastPass Churn Rate</td>\n<td>2.5M GHO/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FastPass Fee Collector</td>\n<td>Aave DAO Collector</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Detailed implementation discussions will take place during the ARFC stage of this proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"next-steps-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#next-steps-7\"></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Gather feedback from the community.</li>\n<li>If consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.</li>\n<li>If Snapshot outcome is YAE, Escalate to ARFC stage.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"disclaimer-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#disclaimer-8\"></a>Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>The Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not acting on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this TEMP CHECK proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"copyright-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#copyright-9\"></a>Copyright</h2>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0</a></p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-introducing-fastpass-a-safety-module-update/17376\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-introducing-fastpass-a-safety-module-update/17376","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 12:26:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-17376"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-introducing-fastpass-a-safety-module-update/17376.rss","#text":"[TEMP CHECK] Introducing \"FastPass\" - A Safety Module Update"}},{"title":"[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Stewards - Increase Supply and Borrow Caps on V3 Base - 04.15.2024","dc:creator":"ChaosLabs","category":"Governance","description":"<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>A proposal to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increase the WETH supply and borrow caps.</li>\n<li>increase the USDC supply and borrow caps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"weth-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#weth-2\"></a>WETH</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>WETH’s supply and borrow caps stand at 96% and 69% utilization, respectively.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/64de81e8b60e5f864a0d8db40ea566c06e5c76ea.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-15T165030.011\" data-base62-sha1=\"eoksXqCPmv2rXnvgSl9f3ajeiZs\" width=\"1346\" height=\"176\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/25210320da4fc98dc07fb7653c9a3ba581b70816.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-15T165031.517\" data-base62-sha1=\"5isotsNVjsQAQtkevnQrU7HrnpQ\" width=\"1288\" height=\"388\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"supply-distribution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#supply-distribution-4\"></a>Supply Distribution</h3>\n<p>Most of the top suppliers are borrowing USDC against WETH collateral.

Merit Round 1 resulted in approximately 165k ETH leaving Morpho and growing Aave’s market share. The Morpho product is now imbalanced (limited to a 52k ETH capacity), ensuring it will not offer additional yield on top of Aave, thus achieving its primary goal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support the GHO stablecoin peg, fostering supply growth and revenue expansion while maintaining a stablecoin base for the safety module:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>StkGho supply increased by 45%.</li>\n<li>GHO supply grew by 40%.</li>\n<li>The GHO borrow rate was increased to 13.8%.</li>\n<li>GHO peg remained within target rate 97% of the time.</li>\n<li>GHO protocol revenue grew significantly, reaching approximately 6.5m$/year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Merit Round 2 involved 1367 eligible users, with Staker &amp; Strakoor being the largest booster (over 100 users), indicating a strong user trust in the Aave protocol and willingness to participate in the Safety module for yield and discounted GHO borrowings.</p>\n<p>Building on these positive outcomes from the first two Merit rounds, the ACI proposes extending the funding of Merit for an additional four periods (three merit rounds per period). This proposal would approve Merit’s continuation for the next 12 months.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"operational-aspects-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#operational-aspects-4\"></a>Operational aspects:</h3>\n<p>We propose Aave Finance incorporates Merit funding within their Treasury Management AIPs if this proposal is approved by a DAO snapshot vote. Our successful collaboration with Angle Protocol and their Merkl product will continue, with the ACI producing user-friendly applications for Merit beneficiaries and providing relevant data to the DAO.</p>\n<p>At present, we do not propose making any changes to boosters or diluters within Merit; however, ad-hoc ARFC snapshot votes can be used by the DAO to modify these aspects of Merit at any time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"budget-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#budget-considerations-5\"></a>Budget considerations:</h3>\n<p>The Aave DAO currently enjoys an excess annual net profit of 80m$. The ACI considers allocating 20m$/year to Merit a worthwhile investment, as it supports Aave protocol market shares and boosts DAO revenue. The expected returns, particularly with GHO, are anticipated to be noteworthy.</p>\n<p>Should the DAO decide to discontinue Merit due to unsatisfactory returns or lower profits stemming from market conditions in the future, an ad-hoc ARFC vote can terminate Merit funding and limit budget exposure.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"learnings-from-the-previous-rounds-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#learnings-from-the-previous-rounds-6\"></a>Learnings from the previous rounds:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The wETH “spray &amp; pray” approach has been underwhelming for most users due to the large scale of Ethereum borrowing on Aave (2B$).

This is an annual amount.  We made this request last <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/defisafety-quality-certificates/11593\">year</a> and it was granted via a grant. This year when we talked to the grant team they stated it would be better funded by the DAO as the grant team does not want to fund regular costs.</p>\n<p>The DeFiSafety Quality Certificate acts as a badge of quality for users who do not understand a list of smart contract audits.  We ask that the certificate logo is added to the security page of the AAVE documents and for context of liquidity providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation - Why should AAVE support DeFiSafety?</strong></p>\n<p>Our goal is to give users of DeFi a badge of quality they can understand, audit and trust. A list of audits means nothing to most users . In order for good protocols to gain the trust of a larger audience, a clear and understandable badge of quality is required.  We want an equivalent to ISO 27001 or SOC2 but for DeFi.</p>\n<p>The DeFiSafety Quality Certificate this request funds is that badge.  The certificate itself is the gold badge evident on the recent reports for AAVE V3 (<a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/597\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AAVE V3 - detailed report | DeFiSafety</a>) and AAVE V2 (<a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/598\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AAVE V2 - detailed report | DeFiSafety</a>) and our reviews page(<a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.defisafety.com/app</a>).  It indicates quality and refers to a human readable, auditable report with references.  We know that a high DeFiSafety score does not guarantee there will be no security events. But it does provide assurance that the protocol is following best practices and has auditable transparency.</p>\n<p>In addition to the financial funding requested here, there are other steps where the AAVE community could significantly help. The first is simple. Please support us by placing the DeFiSafety quality certificate logo on the security page of the AAVE Gitbook.  We understand this is an AVARA decision and we are working on that conversation. Any support representatives of the DAO can give would assist.</p>\n<p>Also, any connections with liquidity providers would be appreciated. If quality certificates are going to become popular, liquidity providers will drive acceptance. For many DeFi protocols will not fund a quality certificate without a clear financial incentive.  If a liquidity provider requires a DeFiSafety quality certificate before depositing funds in a DeFi protocol, then this is the incentive the DeFi protocol needs. It also greatly assists the liquidity provider by giving a minimum benchmark in quality and transparency of DeFi protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Specification</strong></p>\n<p>Inclusion of the DeFiSafety Quality Certificate logo [html avaiable upon request] on the AAVE docs Security and Audits page and/or on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>Duration &amp; Proposed Budget</strong></p>\n<p>15k  single milestone<br>\nDuration of certificate:  one year from payment of milestone</p>\n<p><strong>Useful Links</strong></p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">defisafety.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:192/44;\"><img src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/images/light/logo-desktop.svg\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"192\" height=\"44\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Process Quality Reviews | DeFiSafety</a></h3>\n\n  <p>DeFiSafety description</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/597\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">defisafety.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:192/44;\"><img src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/images/light/logo-desktop.svg\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"192\" height=\"44\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AAVE V3 - detailed report | DeFiSafety</a></h3>\n\n  <p>DeFiSafety description</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/598\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">defisafety.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:192/44;\"><img src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/images/light/logo-desktop.svg\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"192\" height=\"44\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AAVE V2 - detailed report | DeFiSafety</a></h3>\n\n  <p>DeFiSafety description</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Thank-you for your attention and I am available for any questions or comments.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-defisafety-quality-certificate/17327\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-defisafety-quality-certificate/17327","pubDate":"Wed, 10 Apr 2024 23:27:40 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-17327"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-defisafety-quality-certificate/17327.rss","#text":"[Temp Check] DeFiSafety Quality Certificate"}},{"title":"[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - OP on V3 Optimism","dc:creator":"ChaosLabs","category":"Governance","description":"<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>A proposal to increase OP’s liquidation threshold and LTV on Aave V3 Optimism.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>OP is currently configured with a liquidation threshold (LT) of 40% and max loan-to-value (LTV) of 30%.

This was aligned with the feedback from major Aave stakeholders and delegates. However, the expansion of Aave to multiple chains, in addition to the increased volatility and activity across DeFi and crypto, has significantly increased our scope and workload, necessitating additional resources to maintain the high level of service required.</p>\n<p>As dedicated risk contributors, Chaos Labs adopts a holistic approach to managing the spectrum of responsibilities within Aave’s ecosystem, including V3, GHO, and the continued offboarding of V2. Our commitment encompasses risk management, data science, analytics, and parameter recommendation, among other critical functions. An amendment to our compensation is essential to reflect better the resources committed, the depth of our engagement, and the substantial value we bring to the Aave community.</p>\n<p>Considering improved market conditions and Aave’s growth over the past several months, we believe the DAO is now in a position to revise our compensation to more accurately reflect the current scale and impact of our engagement and allocated resources.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"enhancing-aaves-risk-management-framework-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#enhancing-aaves-risk-management-framework-3\"></a>Enhancing Aave’s Risk Management Framework</h3>\n<p>The proposed compensation amendment is not merely a financial adjustment but a continued investment in our collaboration. With additional funding, Chaos Labs will be poised to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deploy Additional Resources:</strong> Enhance support for existing and future Aave markets, ensuring comprehensive risk management across all deployments.</li>\n<li><strong>Develop and Optimize Risk Oracles:</strong> Focus efforts on the continued development of the Chaos Risk Oracle specifically for Aave’s needs, enabling more efficient and dynamic risk parameter adjustments. This will further streamline the risk management process, reducing the need for manual interventions and significantly boosting the protocol’s operational efficiency and security.</li>\n<li><strong>Expansion of Risk Monitoring and Alerts:</strong> Our real-time monitoring and alert services are delivered via the <a href=\"https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview\">Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform</a>. We’re committed to enriching these services with more comprehensive analytics and alerts, enhancing visibility and enabling users to meticulously evaluate ecosystem risks and the health of the protocol through intuitive dashboards and data visualizations.

Sometimes, the improvements can be made in isolation in independent upgrades, for example, almost 1 year ago, we introduced a <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Aave-v3-1-ec65747a39cf41d7b984c841fd7468f7?pvs=21\">new 3.0.2 version</a>, including only relatively minor changes and bug fixes.</p>\n<p>However, since 3.0.2, we had multiple other ideas on the backlog heavily focused on security and optimisation, that over time got validated due to security incidents on similar protocols and by observing operational overhead for Aave contributors (e.g. governance proposals changing parameters). As some of this features in some cases were dependent between each other, end of 2023 we decided to batch them together in a new major-minor Aave v3 version we present here: Aave v3.1.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"aave-v31-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-v31-3\"></a>Aave v3.1</h1>\n<p>v3.1 is clearly focused in 2 fields: redundant security and optimisation of the logic to reduce operational overhead.<br>\nWith those principles in mind, the following is an detailed list of the changes/improvements included into this release.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"features-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#features-4\"></a>Features</h2>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-virtual-accounting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-1-virtual-accounting-5\"></a>1. Virtual accounting</h3>\n<p>Aave v3, is what we technically call a “dynamic” system in terms of underlying balances of ERC20 tokens. For example, to calculate utilisation and rates, the system checks how is the balance of underlying (e.g. USDC) on its aToken contract (aUSDC), and compares it with outstanding debt. Or to validate if there is enough funds for withdrawals, the system depends on not reverting on transfer() from the aToken to the user withdrawing; so also depending on ERC20 balances.</p>\n<p>This is generally perfectly fine, but from our experience, a system like Aave should be a bit more static, meaning being less sensible to operations that don’t follow explicit interaction paths. The most classic example of this is that a donation to the aToken address of underlying should not have any effect on the stored state of the system.</p>\n<p>The virtual accounting feature is very simple high-level: whenever there is an inflow of X capital to the protocol, that is accounted for in storage by adding X to the virtual balance variable of the specific asset; whenever there is an outflow, the opposite.</p>\n<p>As a consequence of this, Aave has an extra layer of protection (apart from other existent ones) for different type of attack vectors used in the past of other DeFi system, following a classic security approach of defense-in-depth.</p>\n<p>In terms of implementation, the proposal adds an optional <code>virtualUnderlyingBalance</code> field for assets listed on Aave (not always used, for example on GHO), which gets modified on every action causing an inflow or outflow of capital, like on <code>supply()</code>, <code>borrow()</code>, <code>withdraw()</code>, <code>liquidationCall()</code>, etc.</p>\n<p>The virtual balance is also now used in the interest rate strategy contract, in replacement of the aforementioned balanceOf() of underlying in the aToken. Now the formula of utilisation becomes high-level: <code>utilisation = total debt / (virtual balance + total debt)</code></p>\n<p>This new feature doesn’t create any incompatibility with Aave v3 integrations, being just additive: the asset data returned on <code>getReserveData()</code> is still the same as before without <code>virtualUnderlyingBalance</code>, but integrators can opt-in to use a new <code>getReserveDataExtended()</code> or directly <code>getVirtualUnderlyingBalance()</code> .</p>\n<p>Given its implications and criticality, virtual accounting can be considered the major feature of Aave 3.1.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-stateful-interest-rate-strategy-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-2-stateful-interest-rate-strategy-6\"></a>2. Stateful interest rate strategy</h3>\n<p>Having reviewed countless Aave governance rates updates, we noticed time ago that connecting new strategy contracts is a process prone to errors. To solve that, in the past we introduced an on-chain rate strategy factory, that completely removed that error-vector, deploying new rates automatically and efficiently.</p>\n<p>However, as the rate strategy for this 3.1 needed to be changed to support virtual accounting, we decided to go a step forward and move the parameters of the rate to an storage mapping, instead of having them as immutables on separate contracts for each asset.</p>\n<p>Implementation-wise, this feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defines a single default interest rate smart contract, to be connected to all assets listed, including those requiring a fixed rate like GHO. We kept the option to still use totally custom strategies for new listings with special dynamics on the underlying asset.</li>\n<li>Adds an <code>_interestRateData</code>  data field on the rate strategy contract, containing all the previous rate configurations for each asset (e.g. base variable borrow rate, slope1, slope2).</li>\n<li>Adds stricter upper limits for rates. The rationale is that on very high configured rates (e.g. hundred thousands %), predicting how the protocol reacts with specific assets’ configurations becomes very chaotic. This upper limit is defined as the maximum value that base variable borrow rate + slope 1 + slope 2 can reach, and currently is configured to 1000%, a value we think it should never be reached.</li>\n<li>All components of the protocol connected with or depending on the rate have been updated accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-freezing-by-emergency_guardian-on-poolconfigurator-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-3-freezing-by-emergency_guardian-on-poolconfigurator-7\"></a>3. <strong>Freezing by EMERGENCY_GUARDIAN on PoolConfigurator</strong></h3>\n<p>Due to legacy reasons, the <code>PoolConfigurator</code> didn’t allow the EMERGENCY_GUARDIAN role to freeze an asset, only to pause it.<br>\nWe introduced an additional contract on top (<a href=\"https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-address-book/blob/main/src/AaveV3Ethereum.sol#L60C1-L61C6\">FreezingSteward</a>) to allow this in the past, but the logic really belongs to the PoolConfigurator, so this is included into 3.1, and the FreezingSteward pattern can be deprecated.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-4-reserve-data-update-on-rate-strategy-and-rf-reserve-factor-changes-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-4-reserve-data-update-on-rate-strategy-and-rf-reserve-factor-changes-8\"></a>4. <strong>Reserve data update on rate strategy and RF (Reserve Factor) changes</strong></h3>\n<p>On Aave v3 (and v2), whenever an interest rate strategy address is replaced for an asset or the Reserve Factor changes, the reserve data is not updated (calculate liquidity/variable debt index until now and “cache” rates on the asset data).</p>\n<p>This was simply a design choice, and even if perfectly acceptable, we decided to change it as 1) is counter-intuitive, as we think indexes until now should be updated <em>with the old rate strategy/old RF</em> and 2) whenever an asset is frozen or in any state of partial functionality, the update of the rate will be factually delayed until an user makes an action.</p>\n<p>On 3.1 we introduce logic to update reserve data whenever the rate strategy or RF of an asset changes anyhow via the <code>PoolConfigurator</code>.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-5-minimum-decimals-for-listed-assets-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-5-minimum-decimals-for-listed-assets-9\"></a>5. <strong>Minimum decimals for listed assets</strong></h3>\n<p>Precision is a pretty delicate mechanism on Aave, and historically we have observed that assets with low decimals are prone to create edge case scenarios, for example, regarding inflation attacks.</p>\n<p>Given that currently it is a pretty rare case, and usually symptom of very bad practises by the team doing the ERC20 implementation, we have introduced a validation for any asset listed on Aave to have at least 6 decimals.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-6-liquidations-grace-sentinel-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-6-liquidations-grace-sentinel-10\"></a>6. Liquidations grace sentinel</h3>\n<p>During one security incident that required pausing the protocol we noticed that could be important to introduce a grace period for users to refill their positions or repay debt, just after the system is unpaused, for them to avoiding liquidation. This is a similar approach as with the L2 Sentinel, allowing for a grace period (in that case stopping borrowing too) whenever a downtime on a rollup network is detected.</p>\n<p>Initially we followed the same approach as with the FreezingSteward mentioned before, and introduced on Aave v2 (the system that was affected by the pause) a <code>LiquidationsGraceSentinel</code> registry/steward contract, allowing for the emergency admin to define a “delayed” pause for any asset.</p>\n<p>However, at that point in time the mechanism was not needed on Aave v3 and slightly more complex to implement. So we postponed it until now, to make it a fully native mechanism to Aave v3.</p>\n<p>Implementation-wise, this feature adds a  <code>gracePeriod</code> input parameter to pass whenever an asset is to be unpaused, which will act as a delay for liquidations.<br>\nApart from being totally optional (it is possible to just unpause without any delay), it is heavily limited to a maximum value of 4 hours and we will recommend risk provider to always use it with maximum caution, as even if for users affected will give a window to refill collateral, it will still allow to borrow.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-7-ltv0-on-freezing-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-7-ltv0-on-freezing-11\"></a>7. <strong>LTV0 on freezing</strong></h3>\n<p>On previous freezing incidents, we have also noticed that when freezing an asset on v3, the correct approach, apart from halting deposits and borrows, would be to “remove” the collateral power of the asset for opening or increasing borrow positions.<br>\nFor this reason, in this 3.1 we have added setting LTV to 0 atomically when freezing an asset, returning to the previous LTV value when unfreezing.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-8-permission-less-movement-of-stable-positions-to-variable-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-8-permission-less-movement-of-stable-positions-to-variable-12\"></a>8. <strong>Permission-less movement of stable positions to variable</strong></h3>\n<p>Consequence of a security vulnerability detected end of next year related with stable rate mode and affecting more on Aave v2, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-full-deprecation-of-stable-rate/16473\">we proposed to completely deprecate it</a>.</p>\n<p>After getting extra approval by the community on the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb58ef33b4b7f4c35b7a6834b24f11b282d713b5e9f527f29d782aef04886c189\">ARFC stage</a>, we have included on this 3.1 a function to allow permission-less movement of stable rate debt positions to variable, which factually will off-board all users borrowing at stable to variable.</p>\n<p>Implementation-wise, this adds a <code>swapToVariable()</code> function in the Aave pool, allowing any address to swap any stable rate user to variable, without changing anything else in the position.</p>\n<p>This will only affect those v3 instances where stable rate was active at some point, so for example will not be applicable to Aave v3 Ethereum.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-9-allow-setting-debt-ceiling-whenever-lt-is-0-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-9-allow-setting-debt-ceiling-whenever-lt-is-0-13\"></a>9.

Presently maintaining a Supply Cap set at 1,200 ETH units, Metis faces the imperative to adapt to escalating liquidity demands and ensure stable market dynamics. In response, a proposal is presented to elevate the Supply Cap to 2,050 ETH units. This strategic adjustment is deemed essential to accommodate the anticipated influx of assets and optimize utilization rates within the ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The rationale behind the proposed elevation of the Supply Cap for Metis is deeply rooted in observed liquidity trends and borrowing patterns within the ecosystem. With approximately $1,250,000 in available liquidity earmarked for stablecoin borrowing, it is projected that an infusion of $2,500,000 worth of ETH collateral is necessary to optimize utilization rates. Additionally, an extra $500,000 infusion is indispensable to forge a resilient market terrain capable of exceeding optimal utilization thresholds. Given that ETH remains the exclusive collateral option on Metis, the proposed expansion to 2,050 ETH units equates to integrating an additional 850 ETH. This strategic maneuver not only addresses immediate liquidity demands but also underscores Metis’ commitment to nurturing a thriving and adaptive DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>The following risk parameters have been proposed by 2TheMoon for the community to review and discuss in the comments section.</p>\n<p>Ticker: WETH</p>\n<p>Contract: <a href=\"https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x8acAe35059C9aE27709028fF6689386a44c09f3a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>Metis: 0x8acAe35059C9aE27709028fF6689386a44c09f3a</code> </a></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Current Value</th>\n<th>Proposed Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>SupplyCap</td>\n<td>1,200 units</td>\n<td>2,050 units</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/increase-weth-supply-cap-on-metis-v3/17293\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/increase-weth-supply-cap-on-metis-v3/17293","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 16:40:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-17293"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/increase-weth-supply-cap-on-metis-v3/17293.rss","#text":"Increase WETH Supply Cap on Metis v3"}},{"title":"[ARFC] GHO Stewards - Adjustments GHO Borrow Cap","dc:creator":"karpatkey_TokenLogic","category":"Governance","description":"<hr>\n<p>Title: [ARFC] GHO Stewards - Adjustments GHO Borrow Cap<br>\nAuthor: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/karpatkey_tokenlogic\">@karpatkey_TokenLogic</a> , <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/aci\">@ACI</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/chaoslabs\">@ChaosLabs</a><br>\nCreated: 2024-04-08</p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>A proposal to track adjustments to the GHO borrow cap.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>With the GHO Stewards permissions in place, this thread is to track adjustments to the GHO Borrow Cap and grant visibility to the Aave Community.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>As the first proposed adjustment, the GHO borrow cap is to be increased in 1M.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Current (%)</th>\n<th>Proposed (%)</th>\n<th>Delta</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Borrow cap</td>\n<td>46M</td>\n<td>47M</td>\n<td>1M</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h1><a name=\"next-steps-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#next-steps-4\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>We will move forward and implement these updates via the GHO Steward process.
