The proposal recommends a 50:50 split between BUIDL and USTB to help increase GHO’s stability with diverse reserves and maximized yield.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48168-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48168-motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>This proposal aims to introduce an additional industry-leading tokenized U.S. Treasury Bill product to support the stability and efficiency of GHO while maximizing protocol revenue. Superstate recommends expanding the proposed BUIDL GSM instance to include USTB to diversify GHO’s reserves, RWA yield sources, and foster a resilient and scalable GSM. Adding USTB to this instance will enhance the GSM’s capital efficiency, while also maximizing transparency, liquidity, and yield.</p>\n<p>USTB offers competitive benefits for the Aave ecosystem, bolstering GHO’s stability and generating surplus revenue for Aave. Currently, management fees are waived (0.00%) while USTB is under $200M AUM. Once this is surpassed, the management fee is 0.15% for any client balance up to $25M. Aave will benefit from a 67% discount on management fees (0.05%) for any assets above $25M. Furthermore, USTB provides transparent daily Net Asset Value via a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=chainlink+ustb&amp;oq=chainlink+ustb&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRigATIHCAUQIRigAdIBCDMxMTdqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chainlink oracle</a> with a separate Proof of Reserves Chainlink oracle coming soon. USTB’s website <a href=\"https://superstate.co/ustb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">publishes holdings weekly</a> with daily NAV, AUM, and yield available for anyone to see. You can visit <a href=\"https://superstate.co/ustb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://superstate.co/ustb</a>.</p>\n<p>USTB is deployed on the Ethereum network, providing onchain access to traditional financial assets sub-advised by Federated Hermes, with UMB Bank as custodian, and Ernst &amp; Young LLP as the Fund auditor. USTB’s investment mandate ensures at least 95% of the portfolio is invested in short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills. Up to 5% of the portfolio at any time can be held in cash to facilitate liquidity.</p>\n<p>Superstate Inc. has partnered with Circle, Fireblocks, and NAV Fund Services for USDC subscription/redemption, responsible key management, and third-party Net Asset Value (NAV) calculation. USTB is a Delaware Statutory Trust which means all assets are bankruptcy-remote from Superstate Inc. This means investors (e.g. GSM) are siloed from liabilities that may arise from Superstate Inc. and the other Funds part of Superstate Asset Trust.</p>\n<p>Each USTB token (ERC-20) is one share in the Fund, with the number of shares issued/USTB tokens minted equal to the Purchase Amount ($) divided by the Net Asset Value per share (NAV/S) on a given Market Day. Market Days are when both the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are open. NAV/S increases daily due to the Fund’s investments accruing interest.</p>\n<p>USTB works in a similar way to Lido’s wstETH. You are minted a static amount of tokens and your token balance stays the same unless you mint, burn, or transfer. The NAV/S increases over time, allowing you to redeem a share of USTB for an increasing amount of U.S. Dollars or USDC.</p>\n<p>The USTB fund currently holds over $125 million in AUM, with more than $150 million redeemed to clients in T+0 or T+1 time frames since inception. USTB is currently onboarded for Arbitrum’s Treasury and used in <a href=\"https://x.com/MountainUSDM/status/1825549301226917932\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mountain’s USDM Reserves</a>. It is being considered for <a href=\"https://gov.ethenafoundation.com/t/reserve-fund-superstate-ustb/66\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethena’s USDe Reserve Fund</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-tokenization-grand-prix-parameters-objectives/24825\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark’s Tokenization Grand Prix</a>.</p>\n<p>This GSM expansion would further diversify GHO’s yield sources from real-world assets (RWAs) which should maximize after-fee yield and transparency for the protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48168-specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48168-specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>Superstate will help Aave Labs expand the proposed BUIDL GSM instance to include a 50:50 allocation towards USTB and BUIDL. This will enable 1:1 fixed-ratio swaps between USDC and GHO, utilizing the USDC surplus to mint both BUIDL and USTB tokens. Thanks to the instant redeemability between USDC and BUIDL and the yield profile of USTB, the GSM can mint and reedem USTB and BUIDL in exchange for USDC. The first tranche of redemption will come from BUIDL. During the payout, the GSM can redeem USTB, receive USD, and subscribe to BUIDL to rebalance. If desired, Superstate could configure USTB redemptions from the GSM to automatically direct USD proceeds to BUIDL, enabling quicker and more automated rebalancing.</p>\n<p>This proposal ensures a more seamless experience similar to the existing GHO:USDC GSM, while maximizing capital efficiency, transparency, and yield. This structure (splitting between liquid and high-yield products) allows GHO extreme flexibility and USDC support.</p>\n<p>These graphics illustrate the Flow Of Funds for both minting and burning GHO with USDC.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXca5Y4oAhZ58W2EELuFd4jXXebSMw9jFZ6qiPC6YKb5bO6kuRq34BiIzdbg1bJJdF3R17Xp2oropwULoPwQ8mIVLc3BA8HjJUbA7x-_G8i2dZUwTcoHkzxBwKTV_8vkP8gRzA_1PtfuIqRCcEHUmz1F94PJ?key=qzgN8dtzi64yRF9m7fzGWA\" alt=\"|578.1011450381679x462\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1280\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcx9Bj_6mwtwPa0x-0yVNB27k7veeqm5UvdMX10eOvKM1qafHOqrgUWacc6phG0XGVERaaKK8tZNPUHxdo57WRMa0kYZ7WW1JPbdskVkxdSyCkYjwN5eZN99pFpFaRzBqpMi2IBCDnx-yXYUqHJJMub5NQy?key=qzgN8dtzi64yRF9m7fzGWA\" alt=\"|624x561.9754010695186\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1440\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48168-disclaimer-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48168-disclaimer-7\"></a>Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>The information provided is for informational purposes only and is not investment advice and should not be deemed as investment advice or a recommendation to purchase or sell any specific security.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48168-next-steps-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48168-next-steps-8\"></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Gather feedback from the community.</li>\n<li>Adopt changes and adjust Specifications if necessary.</li>\n<li>If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage and merge with BUIDL proposal if desired.</li>\n<li>If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the ARFC stage.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48168-copyright-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48168-copyright-9\"></a>Copyright</h2>\n<p>Copyright and related rights of this Temp Check waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ustb-buidl-gsm/19029\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ustb-buidl-gsm/19029","pubDate":"Thu, 12 Sep 2024 19:57:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-19029"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ustb-buidl-gsm/19029.rss","#text":"[Temp Check] USTB/BUIDL GSM"}},{"title":"[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Stewards - Increase Supply and Borrow Caps on Aave V3","dc:creator":"ChaosLabs","category":"Governance","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-48164-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48164-summary-1\"></a><strong>Summary</strong></h1>\n<p>A proposal to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase USDC supply and borrow caps on Aave’s V3 Avalanche deployment.</li>\n<li>Increase ARB supply cap on Aave’s V3 Arbitrum deployment.</li>\n<li>Increase weETH supply cap on Aave’s V3 Ethereum Main deployment.</li>\n<li>Increase wstETH supply cap on Aave’s V3 Polygon deployment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48164-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48164-motivation-2\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48164-usdc-avalanche-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48164-usdc-avalanche-3\"></a><strong>USDC (Avalanche)</strong></h2>\n<p>USDC has reached 81% supply cap utilization on Avalanche, and its borrow cap is at 85% capacity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/4ef749220298d646a0b61a378e99b7b64905e1be.png\" alt=\"image - 2024-09-12T215400.084\" data-base62-sha1=\"bgz35thIRLhiOelqUB4B3NKP6tU\" width=\"1340\" height=\"164\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/63a8dcdcdf434357832f3123eb866eeacdd2d648.png\" alt=\"image - 2024-09-12T215402.025\" data-base62-sha1=\"edD3uyPchi85R5NtCwBFxGgS3Pi\" width=\"1294\" height=\"393\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-48164-supply-distribution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48164-supply-distribution-4\"></a><strong>Supply Distribution</strong></h3>\n<p>Most top USDC suppliers maintain deposit-only positions or borrow USDT, with a few borrowing USDC.

After the previous community preference vote to increase soft supply cap limits to 90% of total supply, we believe further adjustments are needed and feasible within a clear risk framework.</p>\n<p>The current paradigm of limiting supply cap growth based on total supply doesn’t take into account specific nuances of networks and the fact that Aave serves as a demand driver for supply on a network as well as further liquidity.</p>\n<p>A good example is that Scroll borrow cost for WETH is currently 2.3%, which is lower than other networks and leaving money on the table for the DAO. There is over 10k wETH available liquidity with a utilization of 81%. Increasing the supply cap of weETH on that network and assuming 1.2 weETH per wETH borrowed means an expected inflow to Aave of 5k weETH collateral, which is a manageable adjustment.</p>\n<p>We suggest regularly reviewing the supply and borrowing rates.

Every AAVE holder does not visit the governance portal. However, something that every active holder does is that they check out their AAVE tokens in their wallet. What if all the information and actions for users are rendered right where the holders use the tokens the most?</p>\n<p>Through this grant, we will surface core functionalities of AAVE, staking and governance, as well as critical project information via an app like interface on the tokens themselves allowing holders to stay up to date and execute governance functions in the places they spend their time most (wallets, marketplaces, twitter, farcaster, telegram)</p>\n<p>By turning the AAVE token into a token app (tapp) holders can easily experience  and initiate the following functions directly through the AAVE in their wallet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View and vote on proposals</li>\n<li>View the status of delegation</li>\n<li>Update the delegation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>VALUE TO AAVE</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Increased accessibility</strong>: By allowing the tokens to be accessible in multiple environments for every holder of AAVE, the key functionalities for the token are exposed natively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Increased transparency:</strong> Through presenting the information to broader audience, and also providing a view on how the delegate performed, there is greater transparency to how the utility rights are used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Increased participation:</strong> Providing increased accessibility and transparency, will lead to increased participation from the broader community</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support next generation of application:</strong> Tapps and interactive tokens is an emerging concept, like xNFT and dynamic NFTs.

We view this as a first step to a deeper relationship with Aave to promote both protocols as the core of scalable DeFi.</p>\n<p>Aave protocol teams have agreed to split revenue from the sUSDS and USDS markets 50/50 with Spark.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47800-h-1-susds-incentives-program-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47800-h-1-susds-incentives-program-2\"></a>1. sUSDS Incentives Program</h3>\n<p>sUSDS is used as the asset in the main market to improve capital efficiency for lenders. The idle supply consistently earns the Sky Savings Rate (SSR), allowing the market to outperform the USDC/USDT counterparts. Furthermore, debt is denominated in the yield-bearing version, so the minimum borrow rate is the SSR.</p>\n<p>The following formula will be used to prevent USD stablecoin looping: <code>sUSDS Supplies - Sum_i(Stablecoin_i Borrow Amount (in USD) / Stablecoin_i Liquidation Threshold)</code></p>\n<p>This program will help Sky to boost adoption of USDS after launch, and the incentives program will boost Aave’s TVL and revenue by attracting new borrowers.</p>\n<p>The Aave team has agreed to place rewards on the sUSDS market and will update their UI to display the SPK rewards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47800-h-2-usds-d3m-to-lido-market-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47800-h-2-usds-d3m-to-lido-market-3\"></a>2.

A 100m initial debt ceiling is proposed with the expectation that it will be used until the rates align with the broader market.</p>\n<p>The collateral in the market will be highly liquid ETH and wstETH, so we expect this debt ceiling to be raised to match demand.

Currently, StakeStone is seeking support to onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll and is launching a series of initiatives to boost liquidity and Aave adoption.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-motivation-5\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>STONE is an ERC-20 rebalancing token that generates risk-free rewards for ETH based on blue-chip underlying assets like Lido, EigenLayer, and Symbiotic in a decentralized manner through our OPAP governance mechanism. StakeStone currently has $350 million worth of STONE deployed on Scroll. To ensure that STONE has robust liquidity, in addition to the STONE-ETH DEX liquidity on Scroll, STONE also has PMM powered cross-chain liquidity. Users can perform cross-chain redemption and receive ETH on the Ethereum mainnet within 40 seconds, with optimized pricing.</p>\n<p>STONE aims to become the liquid ETH, covering users’ opportunity costs while creating more use cases for STONE holders. Thanks to its architecture supporting multiple underlying assets, STONE can maintain market adaptability and stability over the long term, allowing users and the protocol to avoid the need to mint or integrate a new asset.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of listing STONE token:</strong></p>\n<p>STONE is collaborating with Scroll to build a DeFi ecosystem. STONE works closely with various protocols to support the ecosystem and facilitate their go-to-market strategies. Currently, STONE is the largest asset category on Scroll, accounting for over 30% of the total TVL across the chain, with a high utilization rate (close to 90%). The StakeStone team is dedicated to offering services to protocols that support STONE while fostering collaboration for shared prosperity, which is reflected in the high utilization of STONE across various DeFi use cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Market Impact:</strong></p>\n<p>As of today, over 180,000 ETH have been staked in StakeStone, with a historical high of 340,000 ETH. StakeStone has also successfully processed nearly 1 billion dollars in inflows and outflows. Meanwhile, STONE has a wide user base, and all users are very active on-chain. We hope that this active community can bring more liquidity and activity to AAVE.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-chain-to-be-deployedlisted-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-chain-to-be-deployedlisted-6\"></a><strong>Chain to be deployed/listed:</strong></h3>\n<p>Scroll chain.

Large liquidity providers are highly interested in using STONE in AAVE and further boosting DEX liquidity for STONE. StakeStone will also have its own liquidity mining incentive campaign for STONE in AAVE.</p>\n<p>To incentivize the use of STONE in AAVE, StakeStone will provide boosted STONE points for STONE suppliers and is planning a yield-boost campaign specifically designed to maximize engagement.</p>\n<p>Among our active liquidity providers, we have gathered strong interest in using STONE for lending and borrowing. The team will actively engage with liquidity providers to achieve a supply of at least 5,000 STONE, gradually increasing it over time as risk parameters are adjusted.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-specification-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-specification-8\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>ARFC will be updated with Risk Parameters provided by Risk Service Providers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-other-relevant-information-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-other-relevant-information-9\"></a>Other relevant information</h3>\n<p>STONE has undergone multiple rounds of audits conducted by firms such as Quantstamp, Slowmist, Veridise, and Secure3, and closely collaborates with security organizations like Cobo and Coincover.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-useful-links-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-useful-links-10\"></a><strong>Useful Links</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/HolyMoon/stakestone\">Dune Analytics for data about STONE</a></p>\n<p><a>Security audits</a></p>\n<p>[Governance votes about asset](<a href=\"https://app.stakestone.io/u/portfolio-allocation/vote/vote-list\">StakeStone - Staking, But More</a>)</p>\n<p><a>OPAP proposal example</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb00c9a77dcfec2d3804249b4c8da8d82a3b4d6efe85dbeb6bb6fa3954afa3615\">[TEMP CHECK] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll Snapshot Vote</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-stone-to-aave-v3-on-scroll/18705\">[TEMP CHECK] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll Forum Thread</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-disclaimer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-disclaimer-11\"></a><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal is powered by Skywards.

Consequently, a global pause of all assets was enacted by the Aave Guardian, delaying the activation of the new instance.</p>\n<p>The issue resulted to be not on Aave’s smart contracts, but consequence of a bug in one of the dependencies of the ZKSync Era compiler: LLVM, a widely used compiler library outside the blockchain industry. This affected very specifically one logic expression of Aave, reflecting in the aforementioned unexpected behaviour.</p>\n<p>After responsibly knowing that no production system on Era is affected, this report explains how the problem was detected, remediations executed without any funds at risk and next steps.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47661-before-the-aave-pool-pausing-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47661-before-the-aave-pool-pausing-2\"></a>Before the Aave pool pausing</h2>\n<p>Below is a rough timeline of events until the Aave v3 ZKSync pool was paused:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://app.aave.com\">app.aave.com</a> from Aave Labs is one of the user interfaces to interact with the Aave protocol and is usually the first to provide support on new network activations.<br>\nDuring the voting of pool activation governance proposals (5 days), it is routine for Aave Labs to perform integration testing of both basic actions on the pool (supply, borrow, etc) and more sophisticated flows combining different operations in a pseudo-random way manner.</p>\n<p>This procedure is complementary to the unit and integration tests of the smart contracts side performed pre-proposal stage by the proposal creator, and has two main objectives: detect any problem on the UI itself and its dependencies (e.g. helper periphery contracts aggregating data from Aave), and acting as yet another layer of redundancy of the protocol testing.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that this testing is conducted both before and immediately after the pool’s activation via governance, to eliminate any discrepancies between the fork environment and the actual production dependencies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At around 15.30 GMT on 21th August, Aave Labs was performing the testing process on the UI, and detected an issue when supplying assets. This was a problem on the user interface itself, and resolved soon after.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Later on, another issue was detected. This problem appeared after executing a more complex flow of operations involving supplying and borrowing multiple assets, and performing a full repayment of one of the positions. The Aave Labs team observed that part of the position was disappearing from the UI.<br>\nThe issue was initially narrowed down to a helper contract of the system, the UIPoolDataProvider. This contract is designed for interfaces to consume batched/processed data from the protocol. This finding was consistent with previous activations or pool upgrades, where helper contracts tended to have a larger surface area for integration issues, being non-core to the protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After further internal research by Aave Labs, and given that the smart contracts code of Aave v3 ZKSync was same as on other networks, the main hypothesis was that the fork environment might not be reliable, as the UIPoolDataProvider seemed correct. While this research was ongoing, the pool activated and went live</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In parallel, Aave Labs contacted BGD Labs to disclose the findings and seek deeper analysis of the potential problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upon involvement, BGD Labs sought to answer to two immediate questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is there really a bug?</li>\n<li>If there is a bug, can it affect other Aave instances?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Almost immediately it becomes evident that there is a bug, even if it was not clear what exactly was. Concurrently, Aave Labs tested the same flow on other production networks, revealing that no other instances seemed to be affected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Before conducting further research, BGD Labs decided to contact the Aave Protocol Guardian to pause the entire pool. The reasoning behind taking this step was, that with the pool being empty, there was no downside to taking the action, and theoretically, it would stop any potential attack surface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Aave Protocol Guardian demonstrated an outstanding reaction time, and the pool was paused almost immediately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Following the pause of the pool, it was determined that a thorough investigation should be conducted before public communications were made. This decision was informed by suspicions that the issue might be more complex than initially apparent, and not being even totally related with Aave’s contracts.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47661-the-bug-research-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47661-the-bug-research-3\"></a>The bug research</h2>\n<p>With the pool empty and paused and no other networks affected, our priority became understanding precisely the issue.</p>\n<p>The scenario was the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bug affected pretty deep dynamics of the pool.</li>\n<li>The behaviour was breaking very important high-level properties of the Aave protocol: an action on an asset (repaying) was affecting user flags related to another asset.</li>\n<li>Part of the pre-activation security procedures was to strictly check Solidity code differences between the Aave v3 (v3.1) contracts deployed on ZKSync and other networks’ instances. The code was the same, only different in totally unrelated components with the bug in question.</li>\n<li>As previously commented, the misbehaviour was not present in other Aave instances, technically sharing the same Solidity code.</li>\n<li>The bug was also not present in ZeroLend (tested there to understand if they could be affected), a fork of Aave v3 (non v3.1) in production for months in ZKSync.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>From the previous facts, our internal analysis on BGD was the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem must be on the pool data, not on tokenization or other components, as it seemed related with user positions involving multiple assets.</li>\n<li>Even if we know that a repayment on an asset should not affect others, is there any place where misbehaving logic could operate on the wrong data?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the previous analysis, we establish an initial hypothesis: <em>somehow, the bitmap on user data containing 256 bits of boolean pairs for if an asset is borrowed and/or used as collateral by the user is getting “corrupted” by the logic, with actions disabling an asset as borrowed affecting the usage as collateral of a different asset</em>.</p>\n<p>Immediately, we asked Aave Labs team members to reproduce alternative scenarios to the original that in the same environment. By our hypothesis, we thought they will show similar data corruption.</p>\n<p>Indeed, that was the case, and a clear pattern emerged: when having multiple assets enabled as collateral and borrowed, disabling the isBorrowing flag on the bitmap more to the “left”, would zeroed some of the isCollateral flags to the “right”. Moreover, we generalised testing the pattern to actually prove that all flags to the “right” of the one being disabled were getting zeroed.</p>\n<br>\n<p>To better understand the scenario, this is a practical example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User supplies and borrows multiple assets, wstETH, USDT, USDC, which by listing order have contiguous position on the user configuration bitmap. After this, the status of the bitmap is <code>000...111111</code> (256 bits) with the 1s representing <code>wstETH used as collateral | wstETH borrowed | USDT used as collateral | USDT borrowed | USDC used as collateral | USDC borrowed</code> .</li>\n<li>By repaying the whole debt of wstETH, the expected result would be <code>000...101111</code> , so just disabling the <code>wstETH borrowed</code> boolean bit. However the result observed was <code>0000...100000</code> . Consequently, the protocol enters in an inconsistent state, where it believes the user has no borrow position, and only wstETH collateral, which is not true.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the problem was clear, but the cause not completely. As aforementioned, the deployed contracts were exactly the same as in other networks where the issue didn’t exist, exactly the same in the case of the <code>UserConfiguration</code> contract dealing with bitmaps as an existing fork of Aave in ZKSync which also had no issue.</p>\n<p>So now another hypothesis we had from the moment we got involved by Aave Labs was becoming more clear: there is a bug somewhere on custom compilation layers of ZKSync, affecting specifically the version we compiled the contracts with, but not others.</p>\n<p>We reached out to the Matter Labs team and they started an investigation on the problem.</p>\n<br>\n<p>In parallel, we asked Certora to check deeper into the issue for detecting the root cause, while Matter Labs were performing their research . Later, by analysing the assembly output of compilation, Certora noticed the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On precisely the logic section of bitmaps manipulation of <code>UserConfiguration</code>, apparently some type of “magic value”/constant was introduced.</li>\n<li>This value was clearly not belonging to the basic bit manipulation instructions, so probably had to be a compiler optimisation: by detecting a pattern of multiple logic operations done together, it is quite common that optimisers “simplify” them with ad-hoc instructions, involving sometimes magic values/constants.</li>\n<li>This being a optimiser act was further proved by modifying the <code>UserConfiguration</code> logic in isolation with logic doing exactly the same, but with more convoluted (and unnecessary) bit instructions. Effectively, the output of the compilation was not including anymore the “magic value”, meaning that the optimiser was simply not detecting the pattern an consequently not acting.</li>\n<li>More important, the “magic” value had an strange property: it had 64 bits dimension, which initially looked pretty suspicious, given that the logic was operating in 256 bits data.<br>\nThis would definitely explain the bug, with a bit mask of non-expected dimension getting applied on the data, corrupting it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This finding by Certora was communicated to Matter Labs, which in parallel and independently had reached similar conclusions. At this stage it become pretty evident that effectively it was some type of compilation bug.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<p>The root cause of the issue detected by Matter Labs was the following.</p>\n<p>As described on the <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/compiler/toolchain\">ZKSync documentation</a>, one of the compilation layers uses LLVM, a well-known and broadly used compiler library, applying different optimisations on the intermediate state between EVM assembly code and the final ZKSync bytecode.</p>\n<p>The cause of the problem was actually a bug in the LLVM itself, not on the zksync side. The compiler was doing an optimisation for exactly the type of operation used on Aave, but there was a bug on the usage of signed vs unsigned constants, consequently affecting the magnitude in bits.</p>\n<p>Important to highlight than even if that logic was buggy, compilations not doing certain optimisations could not be affected; this is why forks of Aave running on ZKSync Era were not impacted.</p>\n<p>Considering that Aave was actually safe at all times post-pause, we have not published this report until now, after having confirmation from Matter Labs that <strong>the bug doesn’t impact any verified Era contract</strong>.</p>\n<p>All details on the ZKSync side can be read on <a href=\"https://x.com/zkSyncDevs/status/1829110498471621003\">https://x.com/zkSyncDevs/status/1829110498471621003</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47661-conclusion-and-next-steps-for-aave-on-zksync-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47661-conclusion-and-next-steps-for-aave-on-zksync-4\"></a>Conclusion, and next steps for Aave on ZKSync</h2>\n<p>For obvious reasons, the appearance of this type of bug required a re-evaluation of the ZKSync technology from our side, in order to proceed with a new activation vote of Aave.</p>\n<p>After internal discussion, the next steps are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Detecting an issue so deep in the tech stack is very complicated, requiring complex interaction flows that fairly frequently can only be reached by fuzzing of actions and property checking. At the same time, property checking is simply not possible at the moment, given that the tools available (e.g. Certora) are not covering custom VMs like ZKSync.</p>\n<p>Even if the codebase has some already tests in that direction, we are improving that coverage on fork scenarios. This has some technical obstacles like compilation time of zksolc and other infrastructure limitations, but until it is performed there will be no activation proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We are continuously discussing with Matter Labs of any other potential and realistic thread on compilation stage. Compiler bugs simply exist and happened in the past on for example the Vyper compiler or solc; so even if we know that we can’t have 100% assurance of the lack of them, we want to reduce to the minimum the probability of appearance.<br>\nIn line with that, we are studying reducing optimisations on middle stages to the minimum, and any other threat minimisation strategy. Exact measures are still being decided.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the previous aspects are addressed, and any other that gives us full confidence, we will proceed with a new activation proposal of Aave v3 ZKSync.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a positive note, we would like to highlight that highly frequently, bugs of this nature on the compiler layer are very difficult to detect and usually cause very high damage on anybody suffering them. However, the Aave procedures worked properly and there was pretty early detection, with absolutely zero impact.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We would like to explicitly acknowledge all the contributors involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave Labs (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/aavelabs\">@AaveLabs</a> ) for their work detecting the mis-behaviour on their user interface, and support testing our hypothesis in that environment.</li>\n<li>Certora (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/certora\">@Certora</a> ) for supporting on “low level” research once we formulated an hypothesis on BGD Labs.</li>\n<li>The Aave Protocol Guardian for the fast reaction on protective measures.</li>\n<li>The Matter Labs team for all research and remediation on the Era side, together with what we observed to be a strong security culture.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47661-links-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47661-links-5\"></a>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Logic on Aave being wrongly compiled <a href=\"https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/core/contracts/protocol/libraries/configuration/UserConfiguration.sol#L87\">https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/core/contracts/protocol/libraries/configuration/UserConfiguration.sol#L87</a></li>\n<li>Detailed explanation of the LLVM bug by ZKSync <a href=\"https://x.com/zkSyncDevs/status/1829110498471621003\">https://x.com/zkSyncDevs/status/1829110498471621003</a></li>\n<li>Aave v3 ZKsync activation proposal <a href=\"https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=153\">https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=153</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-zksync-activation-issue-report/18819\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-zksync-activation-issue-report/18819","pubDate":"Thu, 29 Aug 2024 11:15:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-18819"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-zksync-activation-issue-report/18819.rss","#text":"BGD.

The renaming of WMATIC aTokens should be done on both Aave V2 and Aave V3 Polygon instances.</li>\n<li><strong>LST’s (MATICx, stMATIC):</strong> Since the upgrade is backward compatible, there should be no major changes to the LST’s staking mechanism and no effect on the Matic LST’s listed on Aave.
