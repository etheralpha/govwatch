Previously, we <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stablecoin-ir-curve-amendment-on-aave-v2-and-v3-07-14-24/18252\">recommended</a> reducing rates concurrent with the last DSR decrease from 8% to 7% in July.</p>\n<p>The new parameters went into effect in mid-July and have continued to provide stable rates across Aave V3. We note that, following the announcement of the DSR decrease, there has been a notable drop in rates, converging around 5.5%.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/e54a1974e4624b5d57d9490b3bfc416fc29bf4e1.png\" alt=\"image (80)\" data-base62-sha1=\"wIo64UcBQzulN77dHnFMXdmndg5\" width=\"1274\" height=\"762\"></p>\n<p>Following our methodology laid out in previous <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stablecoin-ir-curve-amendment-on-aave-v2-and-v3/16864/2\">recommendations</a>, we recommend closely aligning Slope1 with the DSR to reduce the opportunity for rate arbitrage and ensure that Aave remains competitive. As a result, we propose decreasing Slope1 to 0.5% below the DSR, setting it at 5.5%.</p>\n<p>Caveats:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We do not recommend an update to lower-cap stablecoins on Ethereum V2, as they are currently being deprecated.</li>\n<li>Similar to the previous proposals, we do not recommend a change on bridged USDC (USDC.e/USDbC) on all deployments. This way, they will have a higher Slope1 to motivate the borrowing of native USDC.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47298-specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47298-specification-3\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Market</th>\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Current Slope1</th>\n<th>Recommended Slope1</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum V2</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum V2</td>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum V2</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum V3</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum V3</td>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum V3</td>\n<td>FRAX</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum V3</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum V3</td>\n<td>LUSD</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum V3</td>\n<td>pyUSD</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum V3</td>\n<td>crvUSD</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avalanche V2</td>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avalanche V2</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avalanche V3</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avalanche V3</td>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avalanche V3</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avalanche V3</td>\n<td>FRAX</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon V2</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon V2</td>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon V2</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon V3</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon V3</td>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon V3</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon V3</td>\n<td>EURA</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon V3</td>\n<td>EURS</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon V3</td>\n<td>jEUR</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimism V3</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimism V3</td>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimism V3</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimism V3</td>\n<td>sUSD</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimism V3</td>\n<td>LUSD</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimism V3</td>\n<td>MAI</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum V3</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum V3</td>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum V3</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum V3</td>\n<td>LUSD</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum V3</td>\n<td>FRAX</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum V3</td>\n<td>EURS</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Base V3</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metis V3</td>\n<td>m.USDC</td>\n<td>6%</td>\n<td>No Change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metis V3</td>\n<td>m.USDT</td>\n<td>6%</td>\n<td>No Change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metis V3</td>\n<td>m.DAI</td>\n<td>6%</td>\n<td>No Change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BNB Chain V3</td>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BNB Chain V3</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BNB Chain V3</td>\n<td>FDUSD</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scroll V3</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gnosis V3</td>\n<td>WXDAI</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gnosis V3</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gnosis V3</td>\n<td>EURe</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n<td>5.5%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h1><a name=\"p-47298-next-steps-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47298-next-steps-4\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Following community feedback, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.</li>\n<li>We believe this adjustment will align the protocol’s rates more closely with current market conditions and borrower behavior.

Previous discussions around supply cap methodologies resulted in the [TEMP CHECK] vote to limit the maximum supply cap of an LST to 75% of that LST’s circulating supply.</p>\n<p>In the year and a half since that vote, Aave has continued to grow and new liquid restaking tokens (LRT) like weETH have shown strong demand as collateral in the protocol. LRTs have also seen strong proliferation to various chains with varying levels of the total supply spread across multiple L2s.</p>\n<p>As a result, Aave is often the main location for storing LST and LRTs on any given chain and often represents an outsized share of the total supply on any given chain.</p>\n<p>In this new environment, Aave has becomes the main location for LRT supply on chains like Scroll and Base, while also driving LST/LRT demand on chains like Polygon PoS. Simply put, when Aave increases LST supply caps, new supply comes to fill it.</p>\n<p>LST and LRT have also had longer time in the market, with clear support for peg and asset profiles developing. Aave’s use of oracles based on the LST redemption rate and implementation of CAPO have allowed for reduced risk from the secondary market volatility.</p>\n<p>This calls for a new limit on a collateral’s supply limit as a percentage of the total supply. This proposal suggests raising the community preference supply cap limit to 90% of the total supply.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47162-specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47162-specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The community preference will update from 75% of total supply to 90% of total supply.</li>\n<li>Risk Parameters will be updated by Risk Service Providers based on the results of this ARFC as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47162-useful-links-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47162-useful-links-7\"></a>Useful Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba\">[Temp Check] - Community Preference for Supply Cap Limits for LSTs</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47162-disclaimer-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47162-disclaimer-8\"></a>Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>The ACI has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47162-next-steps-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47162-next-steps-9\"></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Publish a standard ARFC and collect community &amp; service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.</li>\n<li>If the ARFC snapshot passes, this community preference becomes canon and risk service providers incorporate this into current and future recommendations.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47162-copyright-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47162-copyright-10\"></a>Copyright</h2>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-community-preference-for-supply-cap-limits/18614\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-community-preference-for-supply-cap-limits/18614","pubDate":"Mon, 12 Aug 2024 09:22:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-18614"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-community-preference-for-supply-cap-limits/18614.rss","#text":"[ARFC] Increase Community Preference For Supply Cap Limits"}},{"title":"[ARFC] Onboard steakLRT to Aave v3 Lido Instance","dc:creator":"ACI","category":"New Asset","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-47160-arfc-onboard-steaklrt-to-aave-v3-lido-instance-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-arfc-onboard-steaklrt-to-aave-v3-lido-instance-1\"></a><strong>[ARFC] Onboard steakLRT to Aave v3 Lido Instance</strong></h2>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47160-author-aci-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-author-aci-2\"></a><strong>Author: ACI</strong></h2>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47160-date-2024-08-12-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-date-2024-08-12-3\"></a><strong>Date: 2024-08-12</strong></h2>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47160-summary-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-summary-4\"></a><strong>Summary</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal aims to onboard steakLRT, Steakhouse’s restaking token built on Mellow and Symbiotic, after TEMP CHECK &amp; TEMP CHECK Snapshot have passed.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47160-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-motivation-5\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>The Steakhouse Resteaking Vault, steakLRT, is a wstETH-based liquid restaking token powered by Mellow and the Symbiotic restaking middleware.

By including steakLRT, we can continue to attract user deposits from restaking narratives and support the further growth of a Lido instance.

The stages are as follows: temp check forum post, temp check snapshot, ARFC forum post, ARFC snapshot, AIP on-chain vote. A standard proposal will take a minimum of 19 days to pass through all of these stages, although it is uncommon that it progresses this quickly as time is needed for writing and reviewing payloads, and there are timelocks and other waiting periods relating to the various voting stages.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47048-proposal-types-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-proposal-types-4\"></a><strong>Proposal types</strong></h2>\n<p>There are generally three main types of proposals in Aave Governance; these three general proposal classifications strictly refer to the maturity of a proposal in the Aave Governance Process. In specific situations, in order to minimise governance burden and increase speed, there are streamlined versions of this process. These situations are described in a later section.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TEMP CHECK: These serve as “temperature checks” to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.</li>\n<li>TEMP CHECK Snapshot: This is an off-chain vote using the Snapshot platform, with voting starting after the TEMP CHECK discussion period has ended.</li>\n<li>ARFC: Aave Request for Comment (ARFCs) are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.</li>\n<li>ARFC Snapshot: This is an off-chain vote using the Snapshot platform, with voting starting after the ARFC discussion period has ended.</li>\n<li>AIP: Aave Improvement Proposal (AIPs) are a formal proposal to improve the Aave Protocol; before submitting an AIP, an ARFC should be submitted to the community to gather feedback. Once the AIP has been written and reviewed, the AIP will be submitted via GitHub to begin the process of putting the AIP on-chain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47048-general-proposal-process-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-general-proposal-process-5\"></a><strong>General proposal process</strong></h2>\n<p>As pictured below, the standard proposal process is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post a Temp Check for 5 days to allow discussion and gauge sentiment.</li>\n<li>Temp Check Snapshot vote for 3 days.</li>\n<li>Post an ARFC for 5 days to allow for closer scrutiny and discussion.</li>\n<li>Post an ARFC Snapshot vote for 3 days.</li>\n<li>Post an AIP vote for 3 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This process takes around 19 days at a minimum, but often takes longer due to backlogs and time taken for writing and reviewing payloads, there are also various timelocks and waiting periods relating to the voting stages which extend this minimum timeframe. It should also be noted that ACI Skyward can help tokenholders to ensure the governance process proceeds smoothly and efficiently.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1168cf645b773ba3b599e64ff1b8e423fabc2b04.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/2u0FDQbIU3H8rtWa2rgE9yC6QoQ.png?dl=1\" title=\"standard governance process\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1168cf645b773ba3b599e64ff1b8e423fabc2b04.png\" alt=\"standard governance process\" data-base62-sha1=\"2u0FDQbIU3H8rtWa2rgE9yC6QoQ\" width=\"1999\" height=\"363\" data-dominant-color=\"EAEAEA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Standard governance process</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Discussion</strong></p>\n<p>As part of the governance process, a discussion must be started on the Aave Governance Forum, as shown in the diagram above there are two rounds of discussion, firstly as a Temp Check, and then as an ARFC if the Temp Check Snapshot passes.</p>\n<p>Once the proposal has been posted on the forum, it must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be available for review and comment for a minimum of five days.</li>\n<li>Contain all relevant information that would be contained in the AIP</li>\n<li>Comply with any relevant templates that apply to the proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposal author may decide to modify the proposal based on feedback during the discussion phases.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47048-moving-to-vote-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-moving-to-vote-6\"></a><strong>Moving to Vote</strong></h3>\n<p>Once a proposal meets the required conditions, it can proceed to the voting stages, which include both off-chain and on-chain voting methods. Voting in the Aave DAO allows AAVE, stkAAVE, and aAAVE holders to participate directly or delegate their voting power to representatives.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Off-chain voting (<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth\">Snapshot</a>):</strong></em> Off-chain votes are used to gauge the sentiment for Temp Checks and ARFCs. The off-chain voting period lasts 3 days for both Temp Check and ARFC votes.</p>\n<p><em><strong>On-chain (<a href=\"https://app.aave.com/governance/\">Native</a>):</strong></em> On-chain voting is required on any Aave Improvement Proposal. Aave on-chain votes will occur on the Aave Governance Portal. The voting period must last for a minimum period of 3 days. With the launch of V3 governance, it is now possible to vote across multiple chains and carry out gasless voting, read more <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/governance/master/aave-governance-v3\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The on-chain voting process is composed of four stages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First of all, the proposal and payload are reviewed by Security Service Providers to ensure that it is not malicious and that it doesn’t contain errors which put the protocol at risk.</li>\n<li>The second stage is entered if no errors or malicious payload are identified, and the proposal is moved on-chain. Once the proposal is on-chain, a voting delay of 1 day must pass before the proposal becomes active.</li>\n<li>In the third stage, once the voting delay has elapsed the proposal becomes active and is available to be voted on.

By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-motivation-5\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>GNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<p>osGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.</p>\n<p>Creating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.</p>\n<p>osGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed <a href=\"https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism\">here</a>. If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.</p>\n<p>osETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\"></a><strong>Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments</strong></h3>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-specification-7\"></a><strong>Specification</strong></h3>\n<p>Contract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0</p>\n<p>Risk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-useful-links-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-useful-links-8\"></a><strong>Useful Links:</strong></h3>\n<p>osGNO announcement post: <a href=\"https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Announcing the Launch of StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain | by StakeWise | Jul, 2024 | Medium</a></p>\n<p>osGNO Vaults: <a href=\"https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\" class=\"inline-onebox\">StakeWise | Vaults</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-osgno-to-aave-v3-gnosis/18439\">TEMP CHECK Onboard osGNO to Aave V3 Gnosis</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-disclaimer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-disclaimer-9\"></a><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal is powered by Skywards.

Many of you will already know me, but a bit about myself for those who don’t.</p>\n<p>My name is Harry and I worked on Strategy and Governance at Aave Companies (now Aave Labs) for close to two years. In that role I spent a lot of time extremely close to Aave governance. Following that I spent a year working at LayerZero Labs on strategic initiatives. I am currently working @ Stargate Finance helping them rejuvenate their governance as well as @ Members Capital, an upcoming onchain insurance fund, where I’m effectively their in-house degen.</p>\n<p>My passion for the space has only grown throughout this time and my interest in Aave has always remained top of my mind. I am proud to have spent so much time working on Aave and I want to take the next step in my Aave journey and work with the community to help determine the future of one of the most exciting and important projects in the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Why You Should Delegate to Me</strong></p>\n<p>Like some others, such as the amazing <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/EzR3aL\">EzR3aL</a>, I am not some large institution or platform (for now at least). I am a user of Aave, a DAO participant and someone who truly cares about Aave and the DAOs success. By delegating to me you will be delegating to someone who is honest, determined to make Aave better and excited to vote on your behalf. Here are some more specific factors to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarity with the Aave DAO: I know many of the DAOs delegates and service providers personally. You can be assured that any vote I make will be well-informed by discussions with relevant parties.</li>\n<li>Ecosystem-wide connections: My time working in the space has helped me build strong connections throughout it. I intend to not only provide internal support for the DAO, but also help providers and delegates looking to support Aave’s expansions and integrations elsewhere. Having worked with many other protocols and chains very closely I am also a great point of contact for those looking to work with the DAO.</li>\n<li>I truly care about the Aave DAO: Working with the DAO was a labour of love for years. Anyone who knows me knows that I truly care about Aave and the DAO. Delegating to me you can be sure to see this in how I participate.</li>\n<li>Expertise: Not only do I have expertise in the DAO specifically, I also have spent a huge amount of time thinking about governance broadly. I intend to bring these expertise to the table and help to inform governance discussions. Furthermore, having worked at LayerZero and Stargate I now have a strong understanding of the interoperability world which is becoming increasingly important for Aave. Similarly, working with a deeply knowledgeable TradFi team at Members Cap will help me with understanding the role RWAs can play for the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Small sidenote: Some of you know I used to work on an Aave native newsletter that covered the space more broadly. I intend to bring this back. When I do, delegates will get early access and other perks as it develops)</p>\n<p><strong>What Voters Can Expect</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Honesty: I will always strive to be entirely honest in my opinions in the forum. This may seem like a no-brainer, but it is not always the case for delegates throughout the space.</li>\n<li>Consistency: I believe in the strong opinions loosely held mantra.Whilst I am willing to change my mind, I will always follow my values and you can be sure that I will consistently vote in what I view as the best interest of the DAO and users.</li>\n<li>Activity: I am terminally online and am obsessed with the space and more specifically Aave. You should have no concern about me missing a vote.</li>\n<li>Curiosity: I am not afraid to ask questions and I am willing to listen to any idea to understand its merits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Main Focus Points</strong></p>\n<p>Governance and decentralization: Given my experience this is where I believe I add most value. I am especially happy to help people with their proposals to the DAO and give feedback.

This is a logical extension of the work Steakhouse is doing as Lido DAO’s Finance Workstream, and is a work in progress proof of the crucial role that Lido stETH can play in helping restaking become more efficient, while preserving the decentralization of Ethereum.</p>\n<p>The onboarding of steakLRT to the Aave v3 Lido instance aims to enhance the diversity and robustness of the Aave ecosystem by integrating a novel restaking token.</p>\n<p>steakLRT, built on Mellow and Symbiotic, brings unique value propositions and additional yield opportunities through boosted points programs. By including steakLRT, we can continue to attract user deposits from restaking narratives and support the further growth of a Lido instance. Further, beacuse steakLRT accepts wstETH deposits, there are strategic programs that can be run to increase wstETH deposit yield through looping strategies and liquidity mining. These will continue to make the Aave v3 Lido Instance the best place to deposit wstETH as collateral.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46912-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\"></a><strong>Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments</strong></h3>\n<p>Mellow and Symbiotic deposits held as LRTs like steakLRT earn Symbiotic and Mellow points.</p>\n<p>Mellow will do an additional boosted points program for deposits into the Aave v3 Lido instance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46912-specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-specification-7\"></a><strong>Specification</strong></h3>\n<p>Contract address: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc\">0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc</a></p>\n<p>Risk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46912-useful-links-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-useful-links-8\"></a><strong>Useful Links:</strong></h3>\n<p>steakLRT announcement post: <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@SteakhouseFi/steakLRT\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Introducing steakLRT - HackMD</a></p>\n<p>steakLRT Mellow Vault: <a href=\"https://app.mellow.finance/restake/ethereum-steaklrt\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Mellow</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46912-disclaimer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-disclaimer-9\"></a><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal is powered by Skywards.

Custom behaviour (lack of) of the execution layer</h3>\n<p>Whenever a network has custom/extended behavior with respect to Ethereum, it is important to be aware of it and evaluate if it has any impact on the Aave protocol.</p>\n<p>Examples of this potential behavior are the presence of new pre-compiles (compared with Ethereum), EVM opcodes, native account abstraction/meta-transactions or chainId definition out of the norm.</p>\n<p>zkSync Era has <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/evm-instructions\">numerous differences to Ethereum and its various sidechains.</a> Some more relevant ones are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Contract deployments use a specific system contract, which has for consequence that using the CREATE and CREATE2 opcodes is only possible if the bytecode to be deployed is known at compile-time.</p>\n<p>This required some adaptation in the Aave v3 peripheral infrastructure (e.g. deployment orchestration), but doesn’t cause any blocker.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zkSync has their own implementation of account abstraction, which could be used to improve user experience on Aave. Certain functionality on Aave (e.g. <code>permit()</code> on aTokens or meta-transaction support on the Aave Pool) will only work for EOAs, but this is not a problem, as “smart accounts” can have the same functionality natively to zkSync.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Memory is handled differently, being allocated byte-per-byte, this could have an impact on inline assembly that expects memory to be allocated on a word (32 bytes)-by-word basis, but this should not have an impact on Aave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Historically, when fetching the block number or timestamp, the zkSync EVM was returning the L1 batch block number and timestamp rather than the L2’s. However this behaviour has changed since a <a href=\"https://github.com/zkSync-Community-Hub/zksync-developers/discussions/87\">previous upgrade</a> and now <code>block.number</code>, <code>block.timestamp</code> and <code>blockhash</code> work as expected, returning directly L2-related data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zkSync Era contracts handle immutables differently <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/evm-instructions#setimmutable-loadimmutable\">by using an immutable simulator contract</a>. This should not affect Aave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zkSync handles gas differently, including a fee for publishing data. This should not affect Aave, apart from having variations on gas cost compared with other networks where the protocol lives.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the previous, there are other technical differences between zkSync and Ethereum (e.g. lack of some precompiles, but addition of others), but from our analysis we don’t see any impact on Aave v3.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/953c2dd4b2ee708c1e7fde98a80a395c26f0de05.png\" alt=\"gold\" data-base62-sha1=\"lic4IoVKNchniTqtIYtnNYsy6sR\" width=\"104\" height=\"104\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46878-h-37-support-of-wallet-providers-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46878-h-37-support-of-wallet-providers-11\"></a>3.7.

Transactions simulation infrastructure (fork)</h3>\n<p>Lately, a really important development experience component is the ability to execute test transactions (simulations) on forked production networks.</p>\n<p>A good part of the tooling around Aave depends on simulations by using different libraries/frameworks like Hardhat, Foundry, or Tenderly.

Bridging infrastructure: assets, messages</h3>\n<p>Given the central role of Ethereum in the DeFi and Aave ecosystems, bridging infrastructure to/from is a must for any candidate network.</p>\n<p>The zkSync network has <a href=\"https://portal.zksync.io/bridge/\">proper bridge infrastructure for both transferring assets and generic messaging</a>.

Network security/technical model</h3>\n<p>At the core of any candidate network analysis are its morphology (which type of network it is) and security model (which parties are involved in the control over the network; decentralization degree).</p>\n<p>The zkSync Era network is a rollup based on validity proofs, inheriting the security of the Ethereum base layer. However, at the moment, there are the following considerations:</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.1. Sequencer and Proposer Downtime</strong></p>\n<p>Like all rollups, zkSync uses a sequencer, which is responsible for processing transactions on the L2 blockchain itself.</p>\n<p>The sequencer, can not skip transactions queued from L1, but can <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/zksync-era#risk-analysis\">stop processing them</a>. Furthermore, only the whitelisted proposer can publish state roots on L1, so withdrawals would be impossible should it go down.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.2. Custom virtual machine (zkSync VM)</strong></p>\n<p>The zkSync VM is quite different from the standard EVM at a low level, introducing another surface for problems. However, the zkSync VM has been worked on for multiple years, and the implementation high-level looks solid, surrounded by multiple different security procedures.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.3. Upgradeability and control model (decentralisation)</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, the zkSync Era network still has meaningful centralisation, with a <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e4943346848c4867F81dFb37c4cA9C5715A7828\">4-of-7 multi-sig</a> having super-admin control on a sophisticated system allowing different types of upgrades (e.g. transparent ones for standard software updates, or “shadow” ones for being able to perform bug fixes in a private manner, without compromising user funds).</p>\n<p>Given the early stage of the technology, this control is understandable, and relatively similar to other L2 networks.</p>\n<p>zkSync has been working on a decentralized governance system, removing some of the centralisation point, with the initial phase planned to be live in the following month.

Security audits</strong></p>\n<p>zkSync Era has been submitted to multiple audits and security procedures, on all layers (L1, L2, cryptography).</p>\n<p>All of them can be found <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/audit-bug-bounty\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.5. Transaction lifecycle</strong></p>\n<p>The zkSync documentation contains an extensive explanation of the transaction lifecycle on Era <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/transaction-lifecycle\">HERE</a>, but to summarise:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users submit their transactions to the L2 Sequencer. Additionally, they also have the possibility to submit them directly to L1 to force their inclusion.</li>\n<li>Sequencer executes the transactions on L2, and afterwards forwards them to the prover components, creating proofs to submit to the L1 verifier.</li>\n<li>The cryptographic proof is submitted to the verifier contract on L1, together with the state diff, updating the state of the rollup on Ethereum.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.6. Data availability</strong></p>\n<p>As previously commented, zkSync Era currently uses Ethereum as data availability layer. That means that all required data to recreate the state of the rollup is published to Ethereum, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>State diffs, representing state changes on the L2 blockchain.</li>\n<li>L2 → L1 logs/messages, for communications between the two layers.</li>\n<li>L2 smart contracts bytecodes, for full visibility on which code actually causes the state diffs and cross-chain communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>zkSync has made visible effort to facilitate the transparency of the network by providing tooling and documentation on how to reconstruct the L2 state <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/data-availability/recreate-l2-state-from-l1-state-diffs\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<p>In summary, the security model of zkSync looks pretty solid, with very important resources allocated on its design, execution and continuous improvement.</p>\n<p>All the technical documentation about zkSync Era can be found <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack\">HERE</a>.

From our interactions with the Matter Labs team, we have observed a very significant technical effort from their side to improve tooling, and more specifically the support of Aave’s, including pretty complex components like Foundry support on a de-facto pretty custom VM.</li>\n<li>We expect to have some technical maintenance overhead for Aave v3 zkSync during the initial months, given that the tooling surrounding it is continuously improving. However we believe this overhead should be acceptable in terms of resources consumption.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-zksync-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/18503\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-zksync-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/18503","pubDate":"Fri, 02 Aug 2024 15:18:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-18503"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-zksync-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/18503.rss","#text":"BGD.

This post is to recap what has been accomplished this past month, and outline what is coming next from Aave Labs as a contributor to the Aave DAO. Over the past 30 days, we have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Created Aave Protocol brand assets and the visual identity.

This includes creation of an Aave brand kit and asset <a href=\"https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-brand-kit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">repository</a> with brand elements designed, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Logo</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Aave brand features a new logo consisting of the Ghost Logomark and Aave Wordmark. The brand also includes new icons for tokens and profile pictures, as well as derivative logos for Community, Events, and DAO, each with distinct eye shapes and colors to suit different contexts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Colors</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aave’s new primary color palette is primarily gray and purple, and are used in key brand elements like the logo and token icon. An extended palette provides additional colors for illustrations and derivative logos.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Typeface</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Headlines for the new brand use the FT Regola Neue typeface, which matches the circular design elements of the brand. The single-storey ‘a’ is standard in all communications. Inter is used for body text and UI elements. Roboto Mono is used where monospaced type is required, such as code blocks, ethereum addresses or numeric data. It’s metrics are a close match to Inter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Illustrations</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new brand illustrations commonly feature semicircles. These serve as modular, rearrangeable design elements which visually echo the Ghost Logomark. Additionally, the brand features an updated Ronnie in various poses.</p>\n<p>We would like to thank our partners and Aave service providers for supporting the initiative and updating brand assets across the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-46831-v4-protocol-development-kickoff-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46831-v4-protocol-development-kickoff-2\"></a>V4 Protocol Development Kickoff</h2>\n<p>In our engagement with the Aave DAO we included the development of a new version of the Aave Protocol, V4.</p>\n<p>In this first month, we have commenced the development phase of the project. Our approach is to start simple and iterate progressively, making sure that we meet all requirements and specifications in each iteration. This strategy allows us to expedite the implementation process and facilitate building in public.</p>\n<p>Below are the key activities we’ve undertaken over the past month:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Implementation of the Liquidity Layer contract:</strong> We have developed functionality to support liquidity providers, enabling the supply and withdrawal of funds. This will evolve over time as more functionality is introduced.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Research on current RBAC systems:</strong> We’ve explored the existing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems used in the industry to design a rich, flexible, yet simplified permission system for the protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bootstrap of test suite:</strong> We initiated the development of a test suite, focusing on the system’s invariants and properties from the outset.
