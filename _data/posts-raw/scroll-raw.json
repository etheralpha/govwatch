This will include community discussion forums, proposal vetting by a technical committee, and final approval through community voting.</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards and Incentives:</strong> Implement a reward system that incentivizes participation, contribution, and good governance within the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"technology-and-implementation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://community.scroll.io#technology-and-implementation-5\"></a>Technology and Implementation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Smart Contracts on Layer 2:</strong> Deploy smart contracts on the selected Layer 2 solution to handle all aspects of the voting process, including proposal submissions, vote casting, and tallying.</li>\n<li><strong>Result Commitment:</strong> After each voting period concludes, the final results will be committed to the Ethereum mainnet. This step ensures the immutability and transparency of the voting outcomes.</li>\n<li><strong>Bridging Mechanisms:</strong> Use established bridging mechanisms to securely and efficiently transfer the voting results from Scroll to Ethereum.
