Milestone 2 will be a separate and subsequent proposal, created by the working group, that intends to create a more long-term solution. The decision to approach the subject in this manner was made on the working group call last week.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has experienced a significant decline in ETH revenue, primarily due to recent transaction fee parameter changes brought about in the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x813a366e287a872ada13d4f8348e771c7aa2d8c3cb00b2be31539ceab5627513\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbOS Atlas upgrade</a>. From January to March 2024, the DAO spent an average of 13.8M ARB per month, primarily on protocol/user incentives. Additionally, the number of ARB funded programs continues to grow, which ultimately poses risks to the long-term value of ARB and subsequently, the DAO’s treasury. Meanwhile the DAO’s largest source of revenue—derived from the sequencer margin—has undergone a drastic reduction. This margin, a crucial component in achieving eventual DAO sustainability, has been impacted by reductions in L1 surplus fee and the minimum L2 base fee, as implemented in the ArbOS Atlas upgrade. Although these adjustments have reduced transaction costs on Arbitrum One, they have inadvertently flattened the ETH inflow into the DAO’s treasury, as detailed in our recently <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-gas-fees-sequencer-revenue/24730\">published research</a>. We highly recommend reading this post prior to diving into the rest of this proposal.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to optimize the DAO’s primary revenue mechanism to support the eventual long-term economic sustainability of the Arbitrum ecosystem without hindering protocol usage or growth. The DAO has missed out on substantial revenue since Atlas and this proposal looks to address that oversight. Implementation is particularly crucial during periods of aggressive user incentives, as these are times when the DAO misses out on material ETH revenue in return for the ARB it is spending.</p>\n<p>While the DAO envisions diversifying its revenue streams through initiatives like the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/53472400873981607449547539050199074000442490831067826984987297151333310022877\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GCP</a> and other capital allocation activities, licensing fees on the Arbitrum tech stack (<a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/Arbitrum%20Expansion%20Program%20Jan182024-4f08b0c2cb476a55dc153380fa3e64b0.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">expansion program</a>), putting a portion of the treasury to work in <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWAs</a> and other yield-bearing strategies, the critical reliance on ETH revenue through sequencer margins remains paramount today and for the foreseeable future. This revenue is crucial not only for maintaining current operations but also for funding essential innovations that ensure Arbitrum retains its competitive edge such as the ETH denominated costs associated with BoLD. <strong>Building DAO revenue streams is of the utmost importance in order to secure the future of the ARB token and DAO.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-5\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, our goal is for the DAO to evolve into a sustainable entity, with robust and adaptable revenue mechanisms ensuring long-term stability and growth. For this to occur, adaptability is necessary. Dynamic adjustments to the minimum base fee variable will allow the DAO to swiftly respond to market conditions and protocol needs, ensuring that we can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks as they arise. A flexible approach will enable us to maintain a steady source of ETH denominated revenue, thus enhancing the DAO’s treasury diversification, reducing dependence on ARB, and bolstering overall risk management.</p>\n<p>While the need for flexibility in fee adjustments is evident given the dynamic nature of demand for Arbitrum’s block space, properly designing such a system raises many open questions. Below are two potential paths for the DAO to consider as a part of Milestone 2, followed by a few open questions:</p>\n<p>Option 1: Create a multisig through Hats protocol or a similar mechanism that has the ability to change the min base fee within a certain threshold, such as between 0.01 gwei and 0.1 gwei. Each signer would also have a legal agreement with the foundation that they are expected to change the min base fee variable based on a DAO snapshot vote that reaches a certain quorum (100M ARB). This mechanism maximizes community involvement in changes to the variable and reduces friction to adapt swiftly. However, we are not sure that the DAO is the best suited to make this granular level of decision in the context of the optimal minimum base fee.</p>\n<p>Option 2: Implementing an RFP process to select service providers with optimistic control over the fee adjustments within certain thresholds. This mechanism provides a more responsive approach, leveraging decentralized governance tools like a Gnosis Safe, Hats protocol, and a X-day time lock with DAO oversight. This way, we can vote in the most suited entities to the role while minimizing their power. It is our suggested option that leads to many open questions. We dub this solution the Transaction Fee Mechanism Committee, or TFM Com.</p>\n<p>Open Questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In addition to regular reporting and term limits, what are other accountability methods to ensure selected service providers answer to the DAO?</li>\n<li>Negotiations and research will have to be conducted to determine a proper budget.</li>\n<li>Should selected providers be given powers over more aspects, such as target gas per block, in addition to just the L2 minimum base gas fee? This would also give the Transaction Fee Mechanism Committee (TFM Com) the ability to conduct valuable research into the economic parameters of Arbitrum and potentially change them in future (with DAO approval)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since it is a long-term strategic necessity for Arbitrum DAO to be adaptable amid constantly evolving market conditions, these questions should begin to be addressed by the already stood up working group. However given its current missed revenue and expenditure, there still remains an immediate need for the DAO to consider increasing the minimum base fee. This proposal seeks to address both of aforementioned problems in two milestones detailed further below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1</strong></p>\n<p>Milestone 1 will proceed to Snapshot in the coming week(s) and is a constitutional proposal to increase the minimum base fee to 0.03 or 0.05 gwei. This represents a straightforward approach and addresses the immediate missed revenue of the DAO. These numbers have been chosen as they all fall substantially below the 0.10 gwei L2 minimum base fee that the protocol implemented prior, and still allow Arbitrum to be one of the cheapest Ethereum L2s. It is clear from the analysis of the competitive landscape that in general real users are not fee sensitive at these thresholds.</p>\n<p>Milestone 1 is a swift change, addressing the immediate and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-gas-fees-sequencer-revenue/24730\">urgent revenue challenges</a> while we fine-tune the operational details of the TFM Com. For further motivation and reasoning around Milestone 1, again, please refer to our research post. This approach ensures we stop the ongoing loss of revenue as soon as possible. Concurrently, Milestone 2 will introduce a long-term solution, establishing a sustainable framework for the future. This dual-phased strategy underscores our commitment to both immediate improvements and enduring success.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2</strong></p>\n<p>As Milestone 1 is working its way through the Constitutional AIP process, working group discussions will begin for Milestone 2. The purpose of these discussions is to determine the TFM Com’s mechanisms, expectations, budget, and methods of accountability. Post working group discussions, we believe the first stage of Milestone 2 will be hosting an RFP process, in which we seek three quantitative mechanism design firms to sit on the TFM Com.</p>\n<p>Assuming the working group is aligned with our thought process, after the three service providers have been decided, they will each be added as a signer to a ⅔ SAFE multi-sig they will create. We will then utilize a role-based access control mechanism, such as <a href=\"https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">hats protocol,</a> to give this multisig the ability to alter the minimum base fee between 0.01 and 0.1 gwei, or some other agreed upon range that is approved by the DAO. Each change must be reported to the DAO X (tbd) days before being made and go through an X (tbd) day timelock. The multisig will be created with upgradeexecutor as a module, allowing the DAO to replace members at anytime through an onchain vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"potential-tfm-com-expectations-tbd-in-milestone-2-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#potential-tfm-com-expectations-tbd-in-milestone-2-7\"></a>Potential TFM Com Expectations (TBD in Milestone 2)</h2>\n<p>We envision the TFM Com being tasked with the strategic oversight and dynamic management of Arbitrum’s min base fee variable. The committee’s primary goal is to enhance the DAO’s revenue adaptability and sustainability, ensuring that the platform remains competitive and financially healthy. While many details are still to be determined by the working group, below is how we anticipate some of the responsibilities and accountability measures.</p>\n<p>Fee Adjustment Oversight:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor and analyze market conditions, user activity, and network demand to inform fee adjustments.</li>\n<li>Manage the minimum base fee within a predetermined range (initially set between 0.01 to 0.1 gwei) to optimize network usage without compromising the DAO’s revenue streams or network stability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Research and Reporting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct ongoing research into various components of the fee mechanism, including but not limited to the target gas per block and the impact of fee changes on user behavior and network health.</li>\n<li>Prepare and present regular reports to the DAO on current fee structures, proposed changes, and the impact of implemented adjustments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Community Engagement and Feedback:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actively engage with the community to gather feedback on transaction fee policies and their impact on the user experience.</li>\n<li>Facilitate discussions and workshops to educate the community about the fee mechanism and the rationale behind proposed changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accountability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The TFM Com will be held accountable to the DAO through regular updates and a robust audit process. Community feedback will be actively sought to assess the committee’s performance and alignment with the DAO’s long-term goals.</li>\n<li>The TFM Com will serve a predefined term length, but members can be replaced or the program terminated by the DAO through an onchain proposal at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-8\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<p>June 17 - Forum Post</p>\n<p>June 24 - Milestone 1 Snapshot Vote, ranked choice, with options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do Not Change Min Base Fee</li>\n<li>Min base 0.03</li>\n<li>Min base 0.05</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"july-1-proceed-to-tally-for-constitutional-vote-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#july-1-proceed-to-tally-for-constitutional-vote-9\"></a>July 1 - Proceed to Tally for constitutional vote</h4>\n<h2><a name=\"budget-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#budget-10\"></a>Budget</h2>\n<p>Milestone 1 is free to implement for the DAO and the proposal process will be facilitated by Entropy Advisors.</p>\n<p>Milestone 2 will require an additional DAO vote and a yet to be determined amount of funding, but these details fall outside of the scope of this initial proposal.

The theory is that through iteration with voter discernment providing selection pressure, the ‘best possible’ grants programs will emerge.</p>\n<p>This platform is entirely onchain (excepting the lightweight UI to provide an interface).

Through a $350,000 grant of gas and governance coins from People Powered, to the Arbitrum DAO with which it can use our future ‘Impact’ tooling with, as a collective DAO. (Disclosure: this will come at $0 cost to the DAO)</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong> – The blockchain space – as a whole – lacks a tangible way to engage with communities in crisis globally in a way that 1. Connects them directly to communities experiencing a crisis whether it be a manmade, or natural disaster and 2. Transparently provides though 3 different means, thousands of ways to assist while quantifying the impact made through assisting those communities, during a crisis.</p>\n<p>In truth the blockchain space, disaster response / emergency management space, and humanitarian spaces collectively lack an avenue to create direct-to-community impact around natural and manmade disasters in a truly decentralized, transparent manner with any mechanism that rewards and encourages open, inclusive, merit-based leadership from all stakeholders, involved in a crisis, or in the response to it.</p>\n<p>We aim to solve that not only for Arbitrum, but, for the blockchain space through the utilization of Arbitrum Orbit and Arbitrum Impact (the proposed 501c3), and we aim to solve this problem for all industries mentioned above through the People Powered Blockchain, People Powered’s Impact Network, and its nascent tooling currently in development (Referenced in some depth (here) at <a href=\"http://peoplepowered.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">peoplepowered.io</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> – Insert the backbone of People Powered, its L3 Orbit blockchain. A mere feature, paired with its ‘Impact Network’ and tooling which brings the blockchain and wider disaster response, emergency management and humanitarian spaces collectively together with members of a community in crisis to solve a glaring issue in a powerful decentralized manner.</p>\n<p>The issue being the traditionally exclusive, non-transparent and unscalable nature of traditional centralized responses to crises at large. That often times don’t empower the community itself to lead, and take action. And in a time when the climate is indeed shifting, what’s needed is something only true decentralization, championed by the wider blockchain community, can solve.</p>\n<p>Blockchains operating initially via Proof of Work like Ethereum – where a network of everyday people, provided compute in a decentralized manner to power the network – must adapt the ways in which it continues to champion decentralization (where it makes sense to) as compute becomes a centralized function of blockchain transaction processing or it risks becoming a mere payment processing technology as a sole use-case.</p>\n<p>People Powered – in the original sprit of blockchain technology – and in the spirit of Arbitrum’s mission of decentralization, will further advance practical decentralization (through the use of blockchain) well beyond it’s practicality as seen in uses such as DAO’s. We will do this while showcasing the overwhelming effectiveness of truly decentralized organizations as we’ve indeed already done through past iterations of People Powered that did not incorporate blockchain technology (reference some of the stories in the news section at <a href=\"http://peoplepowered.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">peoplepowered.io</a>).</p>\n<p>We seek to include the Arbitrum community through ‘Arbitrum Impact’ in our mission (aligned with the DAO’s) in the launch, and governance of a fund provided by us, and in the launch and governance of People Powered and the Impact Network and its tooling.</p>\n<p>The technological advancements stemming from my teams’ 20 years of experience in concepting, upstarting &amp; managing the largest decentralized community responses to some of the worst natural disasters in US history are only made sustainable and scalable through an Orbit L3, as a backbone. This proposal is our way of giving back, and empowering Arbitrum to do the same through our tooling and the proposed Arbitrum Impact fund provided by us.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Terms:</strong> 501c3 – A 501c3 is the legal term used to represent a US-based (non-political) non-profit entity or corporation.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong> – If approved, People Powered will create and register the ‘Arbitrum Impact’ 501c3 with an initial board of 3 people and set of initial boilerplate bylaws. People Powered will fund ‘Arbitrum Impact’ with $350,000 worth of our Purpose &amp; Impact coins.</p>\n<p><strong>Board and Bylaws –</strong> I will chair the board initially upon its creation and then in August we will open the process up to elections and I will step down so that the DAO can elect a proper board and chair selected by the Arbitrum community as a collective whole. The responsibility of the board will be a mere 2 things written into it’s bylaws:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To distribute – via multisig approval – the funds we’ve provided, and more specifically to distribute as DAO members see fit through our tooling (See Financial Impact &amp; Tooling at <a href=\"http://peoplepowered.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">peoplepowered.io</a>) when our tooling becomes available for public use (See “Timeline” below).</li>\n<li>To execute – via multisig approval – the collective wishes of the DAO in a single vote, as they relate to the Impact Network’s governance features. (See Governance at <a href=\"http://peoplepowered.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">peoplepowered.io</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The Creation of a Simple’ Arbitrum Impact’ Interface:</strong> The Arbitrum DAO will need to create an interface, or add to it’s existing interfaces via snapshot and the forums, ‘Arbitrum Impact’, as a feature giving all Arbitrum DAO members the ability to do the following 2 things with the funds we’ve provided, and when our tooling is available for public use:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ability to add (and vote on) proposals that advocate for the use (on a per-crisis basis) of the funds we’ve donated to the DAO. Such use of funds must be only through our tooling, currently in development (See “Timeline” below).</li>\n<li>The ability for the DAO and its members to propose (and vote on) proposals that they would like to submit through People Powered’s proposal system currently in development. The DAO will then be able to (through its Purpose &amp; Impact coin holdings, granted by us) have voting power within our governance system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Specifications &amp; Timeline</strong> –</p>\n<p><strong>6/13-6/30:</strong> We’d like to collect feedback from the wider community until June 30th 2024, and revise and add any further details based on community feedback to our proposal as needed. During this time we seek a delegate (to bring this proposal to a vote) who has strong ties to communities both within and outside of Arbitrum who are engaged in lines of work that create Impact.</p>\n<p><strong>6/30-7/30:</strong> We’ll look to you, the DAO community to rally support, and present potential board members for ‘Arbitrum Impact’. We’d like to hold an initial snapshot vote on July 21st with delegate and community support followed by a final vote on July 30th to chose and induct a full board at which point we will transfer coins to a single wallet, and set up the board’s multisig to safekeep the coins.</p>\n<p><strong>8/20-10/20:</strong> Over a 2 month timeline from August 20th until October 20th People Powered will make use of existing tech to respond to crises. We will make our name during this period while showcasing the need for the tech.</p>\n<p><strong>10/30-12/30:</strong> We’ll begin to rollout our tech starting with our chain, network KYC and coin trading.</p>\n<p><strong>January 2025-December 2025:</strong> We’ll begin to rollout the impact network’s actual tooling, when the coins granted to the DAO can be used within our tooling, the DAO should alert the wider community to Arbitrum Impact’s existence and how to use and utilize it as a member of the DAO (through the interfaces that the DAO needs to create, mentioned in the previous section).</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong> – $0 aside from $2000 to cover legal filings for the creation of the 501c3 (which will be covered by People Powered) Board positions will be un-stipended initially with the exception being the cost to prepare and file quarterly financial disclosures as is standard for 501c3 organizations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"thanks-for-reading-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#thanks-for-reading-1\"></a>Thanks for reading,</h4>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to read,</p>\n<p>Danny McGlashing,</p>\n<p>Founder of People Powered - We’re building the world’s first community-based crisis response blockchain, toolkit &amp; global network for humanitarians and communities in crisis everywhere — Powered by You.</p>\n<p>Direct contact outside of the Forums:<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:general@peolepowered.io\">general@peolepowered.io</a></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-the-establishment-of-arbitrum-impact-a-501c3-funded-by-the-people-powered-blockchain-governed-by-the-arbitrum-dao/24945\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-the-establishment-of-arbitrum-impact-a-501c3-funded-by-the-people-powered-blockchain-governed-by-the-arbitrum-dao/24945","pubDate":"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 03:59:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24945"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-the-establishment-of-arbitrum-impact-a-501c3-funded-by-the-people-powered-blockchain-governed-by-the-arbitrum-dao/24945.rss","#text":"Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: The Establishment of ‘Arbitrum Impact’ a 501c3 Funded by the People Powered Blockchain, Governed by the Arbitrum DAO"}},{"title":"AIP BOLD Security Analysis","dc:creator":"openzeppelin","category":"Security Member","description":"<h2><a name=\"abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Authors: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/red-swan\">@red-swan</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/michael-oz\">@michael-oz</a></p>\n<p>BOLD is a new dispute mechanism for Arbitrum which is permissionless and mitigates delay attacks. OpenZeppelin was asked by the ARDC to review the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232\">AIP</a>.  We assume that readers have read the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232\">AIP</a> or at least the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/bold/gentle-introduction\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gentle introduction</a> to which the AIP refers.  Our analysis focuses on the parameters of BOLD involving the distribution of confiscated funds and their implications for the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impressions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#impressions-2\"></a>Impressions</h2>\n<p>Overall we were impressed with the amount of work that went into creating BOLD as well as the thoroughness of the analysis, and the quality of the documentation. The several documents linked in the AIP describe its intricacies well and do so effectively to the different target audiences. If they could be improved, we would suggest adopting a single nomenclature across the several documents (e.g. “<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232\">challenge bond</a>” vs. “<a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">mini-bond</a>”, “<a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">challenge period</a>” vs. ”<a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dispute period</a>”).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"confiscated-funds-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#confiscated-funds-3\"></a>Confiscated Funds</h2>\n<p>The current validation scheme allows anyone to propose the next state in a canonical state chain, and users stake funds on which state they believe to be the correct next state. This proposed next state could be wrong, so anyone is allowed to dispute a proposed state within a confirmation period.  Within the proposal, there were some questions about exactly what should be done with confiscated funds from parties that lose disputes. The research provided is extremely concerned about collusion between challengers, and we share this concern. Alternatives to hardcoding a reward distribution amount or schedule may mitigate collusion.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"reward-funds-based-on-actual-network-delay-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#reward-funds-based-on-actual-network-delay-4\"></a>Reward funds based on actual network delay</h3>\n<p>In the scenario where a malicious user wishes to delay state confirmation for as long as possible, they would start a dispute at the end of the challenge period to maximize delay. If they were disputing with themselves, they could take as long as possible and continue to do this in the future. They’d essentially be paying stakes over time to double the confirmation time of blocks. This is textbook griefing and should <em>not</em> be made cheaper by rewarding the confederate challenger. However, consider the case where such a user starts a dispute at the start of the challenge period. If they indeed finish the dispute within the challenge period, no delay to the network would actually have occurred, and therefore the protocol need not be so worried about potential collusion. In such a scenario, it seems reasonable to reward the honest party with some amount of the confiscated funds immediately (perhaps split at some percentage with the DAO Treasury). The key here is that the research argues that it should cost a dishonest party proportional to the opportunity cost of the delay. And the greater the delay, the more incentive the griefer has to collude. So if no delay has occurred, there is less incentive to collude and less worry about rewarding the dispute winner.</p>\n<p>Of course, the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Technical Deep Dive</a> recognizes this would incentivize honest parties to compete against each other to raise and finish disputes faster than each other (see <strong>Bonding in Challenges</strong>, pg 11). But we would love to hear more about what the paper describes as “needless competition between honest parties.” Honest parties that are able to stake together in the dispute game <em>and</em> have an incentive to resolve disputes seems like a win-win.</p>\n<p>Above we discussed the classic delay attack. Now consider the simple case where a dishonest party asserts a state, an honest party quickly disputes it, and the faster a dispute is resolved, the more of the slashed funds the honest party receives. Quickly identifying fraud is ideal behavior. And yes, a malicious user with censorship abilities would lessen the reward won by honest parties if they could make the dispute take longer; but, this would not remove the strong incentive to dispute the dishonest state just lessen it temporarily. An abundance of caution leads us to believe that the full slashed amount should never be rewarded to the honest parties but making the ratio of the slashed amount dependent on how quickly a dispute begins and how quickly the dispute ends seems worth exploring further.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"postpone-rewarding-funds-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#postpone-rewarding-funds-5\"></a>Postpone rewarding funds</h3>\n<p>Next, consider a scenario where dishonest stakes are given to honest parties after six months. And again, let us consider the scenario above where a malicious user raises disputes with themselves at every honest state they post, delaying confirmation of states for as long as possible. Such a malicious user would need extraordinary capital to continuously delay states for six months. In such a scenario, if the DAO were able to recognize the network duress and also were able to vote and stop the delayed reward payments, the malicious user’s attack would then become much more expensive to continue (hopefully prohibitively more expensive). Our understanding is that BOLD does not preclude determined, large entities from performing this kind of attack. Indeed, any such optimistic rollup is susceptible to this. However, the network duress would be quite obvious and allow the DAO to make decisions about delaying rewards to protect the network.</p>\n<p>Now consider a malicious user that does not have the capital to perform this attack continuously. In such a case, they would be able to perform the attack more often after receiving rewards for disputing with themselves. However, the actual rewards would be delayed substantially, perhaps enough so that the delays they cause to the network provide no material difficulty for its users. Therefore, the longer the time an honest party has to wait for their funds, the less the risk of delays to the network and, therefore, the greater the share of the confiscated funds could be paid. And again, if there are enough malicious users out there to cause delays to the network (perhaps even all operating separately), giving the DAO the ability to turn off the payments should discourage the “market” for bad states.</p>\n<p>The obvious criticism with this method is that it introduces a special role into a permissionless system. But this is already a component of the AIP, giving the DAO all of the confiscated funds and the ability to use those funds how they wish. This privileged role the DAO will have in these cases can always be removed in newer iterations of the dispute protocol. So its temporary power to pause delayed rewards does not seem so unpalatable.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-changing-economic-environment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-changing-economic-environment-6\"></a>The Changing Economic Environment</h2>\n<p>BOLD sufficiently incentivizes parties to behave in ways that are beneficial to the network. Indeed, the success of BOLD relies on some of these incentives being <em>sufficient at all times</em> to induce the desired behavior. To this end, we were very pleased to see the proposal including the idea about service fees being paid to validators and honest disputers. This may be enough to incentivize validators and it may be the case that there need not be any further reward policy for confiscated funds. But it is an utmost priority to observe how these incentives actually perform. Should validators/disputers simply find better things to do with their locked assertion assets, they will leave their role, and the network will suffer. BOLD does a good job of guaranteeing the correctness of the state chain as long as one honest member exists. However, there exists a very perverse incentive for the last honest actor to be dishonest since no one is left to challenge them. So, in practice, more than one honest actor is ideal, and monitoring the health of the validator pool should become an ongoing DAO responsibility. We would hope that the number of validators and the amounts staked become a regular talking point, brought up at large. In fact, we recommend the DAO regularly monitor and discuss all of the factors in the proposal that determine the economic parameters at least until the community feels incredibly confident with BOLD’s performance. These parameters include the price of WETH, yield rates, the TVL of the bridge, the time-to-depletion for DAO payouts, and more. Gathering this information could be a simple, manual task performed by a specific DAO entity, and many of these values seem scrapable which would make this monitoring even easier. In this sense, adopting BOLD should be understood as the DAO adopting the responsibility for the economics of BOLD and the community’s confidence in it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-7\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Given the serious security implications of allowing permissionless disputes, we are pleased and impressed with the level of thoroughness with which the Offchain Labs team and Arbitrum community has discussed the risks of BOLD.</p>\n<p>We explored concerns with the handling of confiscated funds as well as the future need to monitor and update BOLD parameters as economic conditions change. The algorithm has been well thought-out and should work as expected. However, it does depend on economic incentives behaving under present economic conditions that are subject to change. We recommend monitoring the economic factors of BOLD once in production and be ready to make adjustments as needed.</p>\n<p>For more information on OpenZeppelin’s role as Security Member of ARDC, please visit our <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Security-Member-OpenZeppelin-8f0d23fa622e43329b530129769a7834\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Notion homepage</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-security-analysis/24938\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-security-analysis/24938","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Jun 2024 16:49:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24938"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-security-analysis/24938.rss","#text":"AIP BOLD Security Analysis"}},{"title":"Reverse and revise the GCP for increased transparency and sustainability","dc:creator":"longshortleftight","category":"Proposals","description":"<p><strong>Title</strong> – Proposal: Reconsideration of the Gaming Catalyst Program OPEX</p>\n<p><strong>Constitutional / Non-Constitutional</strong> - Non-Constitutional</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - This proposal seeks to reverse the recent approval of the 225M ARB allocation for the Gaming Catalyst Program, focusing on reviewing operational expenditures, implementing performance-based milestones, and establishing a transparent hiring process.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong> - The Arbitrum community should implement stricter financial oversight to ensure that salaries and expenditures are in line with industry standards, promoting efficiency and transparency.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> - Aligning operational costs with industry standards and ensuring performance-based incentives will support the sustainable growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Terms</strong> (optional) - ARB: Arbitrum Tokens; GCP: Gaming Catalyst Program</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong> - The proposal suggests a detailed review of the GCP budget, focusing on salaries, performance milestones, and hiring guidelines to ensure transparency and efficiency.

With a funding allocation of 300k ARB, the program targets three key categories: Building, Research, and Awareness. The program is opening for applications as of June 17th.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-2\"></a><strong>What?</strong></h3>\n<p>The RWAIG aims to offer comprehensive support across the lifecycle of RWA development on Arbitrum and kickstart the RWA vertical on Arbitrum. By partnering with experts from top RWA-focused projects like Chainlink, Securitize, PV01, Libre Capital, Centrifuge, and RWA.xyz, the RWAIG ensures quality and consistency in the development of the Arbitrum RWA ecosystem. Moreover, having a ‘guiding hand’ for projects aiming to deploy will enable tighter integrations between new and existing projects. We’ve designed the program in alignment with existing RWA initiatives on Arbitrum, such as STEP, to facilitate the integration of RWAs onto the network and increase the TVL of top DeFi apps on Arbitrum, like GMX, Aave, and Pendle.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"why-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#why-3\"></a><strong>Why?</strong></h3>\n<p>Through our RWA education sessions and other forum discussions, it’s apparent that RWAs are a critical vertical for Arbitrum to develop. JPMC estimates tokenisation can add $400B in annual revenue for the alts industry and tokenised private credit is only 0.4% of the global market, demonstrating the high growth potential. RWAs currently only constitute 1.1% of Arbitrum’s grants while competitors like Polygon and Avalanche progressing fast.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-4\"></a>How?</h3>\n<p>For this pilot phase, the total size of the fund will be 300k ARB and will be distributed over a 2-month period from 17 June to 16 August, with the review period beginning on 19 June. The program integrates quadratic and direct funding mechanisms in partnership with Gitcoin, with 100k ARB allocated to QF and 200K allocated to direct funding. RWAIG funding targets 3 categories, including suggested deliverables within each:</p>\n<p><strong>Building</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deployment of RWAs:</em> [1-3] Number of innovative RWA projects launched or in the process of launching on Arbitrum.</li>\n<li><em>Strengthening Analytics:</em> [1-2] Number of analytics tools or dashboards developed.</li>\n<li><em>Advancing RWA Token Standards</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Research</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Publish Research Reports:</em> [2-3] Number of research reports published as outcome target, incl. assessment of cost-saving for new RWA projects to deploy on Arbitrum with use of the research.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Awareness</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Drive Awareness to Arbitrum as the Home of RWAs:</em> [2-3] Number of awareness content pieces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ll be hosting a <a href=\"https://x.com/i/spaces/1YqKDgoDkQoxV\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X Spaces AMA</a> to share all program details next Wednesday at 15:00 CET. Should you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>\n<p>Finally, we’d like to extend our gratitude to <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/decentralized-review-process-summary-thank-arb-milestone-1b/24877\">ThankArb</a> for making this program possible.

To date, we have approved 8 grant programs through our RFP process and 3 grant projects via our Firestarters program sourced from over 200 applications. We also made significant steps towards decentralizing the review process, with 50+ reviewers from the Arbitrum community.</p>\n<p>On a personal note I wanted to take a moment to say how proud I am to be part of this extended community that genuinely values decentralization and is excited to explore innovative mechanisms for the allocation of funds. This grants program is attracting a wide range of visionary ideas and it was truly painful to not be able to fund more of them. We have so many fantastic ideas coming forward, trusting in the community to do the assessment of which projects to fund felt like a leap of faith at times but an important one.</p>\n<p>In truth I may have personally selected one or two different proposals that I was excited by but that is the beautiful thing about harnessing the wisdom of the crowd. It’s not the views of any one person that matter, it’s the collective wisdom that is most important. At the end of the day all the projects that were shortlisted could have done amazing things and I hope we are able to fund many more similar projects that are inspired by the process in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>This document outlines key learnings from the M1b application and review process, which ran from April to June 2024.

Many applicants were obviously seeking seed funding, so they framed themselves as grant programs. Although some were very strong proposals, they could not be considered for funding. This highlighted the need for a general catch-all grant program to fund individual projects adding value to the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Going forward, there should be clearer communication around what constitutes a project versus a program, with this criterion included at the screening stage. We redirected many grantees to apply for the Firestarters program in order to access funding for development of mechanisms that could be of service to the DAO community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Greater transparency around the entire application and review process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We received feedback that too little of the review process was available for public scrutiny earlier on in the roll out. Several applicants requested a summary of why they were not selected, so we responded by providing summaries. This could have been more proactive.</p>\n<p>We are now testing the following changes aimed at improving transparency:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>All applications that pass screening are made publicly viewable and open for commentary (with personal identifying information removed). See <a href=\"https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invSkqryytljh8Wnp&amp;inviteToken=958fcbca84b197c2fe41477fad32584bbd3b47fa1f80b3baa684bcb7611e63b5&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product_team&amp;utm_content=transactional-alerts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">shortlisted programs</a> and <a href=\"https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv7wz3CbuVoP23xJ&amp;inviteToken=f689ed24c6ba8eed94c93594f943b0ff811078404a90a5538820d1447e97ef23&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product_team&amp;utm_content=transactional-alerts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Firestarters</a> as examples. Applicants are told to expect this when submitting their applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While we decided it was best not to share reviewer scores or comments to prevent personal attacks, bribery or other shenanigans, we have implemented AI-generated summaries that will be shared with all applicants who pass screening. This process is being automated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refined and targeted application questions. In the future, we recommend including the following questions at the program idea sourcing stage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demographics and more specific questions related to whether the applicant has run a program/grant-funded project before.</li>\n<li>Drop-down of allocation mechanisms for applicants to self identify and as the result easier sorting.</li>\n<li>Budgets would be helpful to know earlier in stage 1 so we can work with applicants around any issues during the Planning Grants stage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Better rubric scoring. -3 to +3 rubric scoring is more effective than a 1-5 Likert scale. We’re not just interested in positive measures of popularity (i.e. which applicant got the highest score). Negative numbers indicate varying degrees of disagreement and positive numbers indicate varying degrees of agreement while avoiding middle value ambiguity. This change in rubric scoring was implemented for the final program reviews and Firestarters.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"a-namereview-processa-review-process-methodology-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#a-namereview-processa-review-process-methodology-9\"></a><a name=\"review-process\"></a> Review process &amp; methodology</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"stage-1-screening-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stage-1-screening-10\"></a>Stage 1: Screening</h2>\n<p>The purpose of screening is to cut out obviously bad applicants such as spam (the applicant has made no effort whatsoever to provide a comprehensible program idea) and ChatGPT junk (the application is not only poor but appears to have been generated entirely by AI).

This assessment will be done by other reviewers creating a feedback loop for the process itself. Reviewers that reach a certain threshold of points will be promoted to higher tiers, or demoted if they fall below that threshold.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"stage-3-aggregating-reviews-to-make-funding-decisions-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stage-3-aggregating-reviews-to-make-funding-decisions-12\"></a>Stage 3: Aggregating reviews to make funding decisions</h2>\n<p>Funding decisions were based on the following criteria:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Applicant received a minimum median total score of 7 out of 12, AND</li>\n<li>Applicant received at least 3 out of 5 “yes” votes on funding the approval question</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"stage-4-communicating-decisions-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stage-4-communicating-decisions-13\"></a>Stage 4: Communicating decisions</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Next steps for funded programs</li>\n<li>Next steps for unfunded programs</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"appendix-a-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#appendix-a-14\"></a>Appendix A</h1>\n<p>Final selected programs for Thank ARB Milestone 1b</p>\n<p>Amplifying Impact – Bonus Funding for Outstanding GG20 Arbitrum Round Projects</p>\n<p>Tarah, Life on Mars</p>\n<p>Allocation mechanism</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type: Retroactive</li>\n<li>Mechanism(s): Expert multi criteria voting with anti-polarization algorithm</li>\n<li>Voting rights: Badged reviewers</li>\n<li>Platform(s): Ethelo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AI-generated program summary (<a href=\"https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invN4dUpSrt3SqSmC&amp;inviteToken=51c910f6af54c71e90b7a6f7f24d5ceff864eaa39320abca80a5882c5278a46b&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product_team&amp;utm_content=transactional-alerts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">see final application here</a>)</p>\n<p>The program uses Ethelo’s platform for identifying impactful projects through expert reviews, a predefined rubric, and the Ethelo algorithm.

Due to this volatility, the total amount received in Arb tokens fell short of the intended budget. Out of the proposed $4 million, we only received $3.397 million.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this shortfall and ensure the program’s effectiveness, we propose an additional funding of $1 million. This additional funding will provide a buffer against future price fluctuations and enable us to fully execute the program as originally intended. Any surplus funds will be returned to the DAO. This was mentioned in the initial proposal extension of the DDA grants program via Questbook <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326\">here</a>, that if we fall short of the total funds needed we will intiate an additional fund request.</p>\n<p><strong>Background and Justification:</strong><br>\nUpon the launch of the Arbitrum DDA Program 2.0, we encountered price fluctuations in Arb tokens, which affected the total amount received. Despite our efforts to anticipate and mitigate such risks with a 30% buffer in the initial proposal, the actual amount received fell short of our proposed budget post transferring to USDC. This shortfall poses a challenge to the effective execution of the program and as noted on the main proposal, we mentioned an additional proposal to request for additional funds incase such an event transpired.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Additional Funding Request:</strong> We request an additional $1 million to supplement the existing budget of the Arbitrum DDA Program.</li>\n<li><strong>Return of Surplus Funds:</strong> Any surplus funds remaining after the completion of the program will be returned to the DAO, ensuring transparency and accountability in fund utilization.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>\nThe success of the Arbitrum DDA Program 2.0 is crucial for the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. By securing additional funding, we can proceed with the program as intended with the initial budget. We remain committed to transparency, accountability, and the responsible utilization of funds for the benefit of all stakeholders involved.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-additional-funding-for-the-arbitrum-dda-program/24862\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-additional-funding-for-the-arbitrum-dda-program/24862","pubDate":"Mon, 10 Jun 2024 12:36:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24862"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-additional-funding-for-the-arbitrum-dda-program/24862.rss","#text":"Request for Additional Funding for the Arbitrum DDA Program"}},{"title":"Community Health Analytics and reputation NFTs in ArbitrumDAO","dc:creator":"danielo","category":"General","description":"<p>TogetherCrew (one of RnDAO’s incubated ventures) has developed a community analytics tool that can gather data from public conversations in Discord, Discourse (the forum), Github, etc etc. And more recently obtained a grant from ArbitrumDAO to develop Reputation NFTs.</p>\n<p>We’ll make the reputation NFTs to ArbitrumDAO contributors as a pilot and so this is a thread to raise awareness about the initiative and answer any questions.</p>\n<p><strong>How the NFTs work</strong><br>\nThe Reputation NFTs will be created by the contributors minting (for free) a non-transferable NFT via the TogetherCrew UI. The NFTs reference a ledger that stored the daily calculation of an individual’s reputation, thus providing an on-chain record of their participation in the community.<br>\n<a href=\"https://new.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&amp;chainId=10&amp;role=builder&amp;proposalId=0x62b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">More info on the Questbook grant submission</a></p>\n<p><strong>How is reputation calculated</strong><br>\nTogetherCrew’s algorithm analyses conversations and maps the social graph. This graph is used to calculate then how much context someone has on the community. This is a Sybil-resistant approach that can be used for rewards, as a portable credential (proof of membership/participation), etc. For now, the NFT will just be used as a nice showcase of being a core part of the community here.</p>\n<p><strong>Isn’t the data incomplete</strong><br>\nYes, many conversations happen in calls, in splintered telegram groups, etc. We don’t have a complete solution yet but we’re working on it. For now, these Reputaiton NFTs are an experiment with no financial gain attached.</p>\n<p><strong>Other uses of TogetherCrew</strong><br>\nMultiple communities use TogetherCrew already (Optimism, Pocket Network, Aave, Celo, SingularityNET, etc etc) and we’re bringing the same benefits to Arbitrum. Communities have benefited from</p>\n<ul>\n<li>using the behavioural analytics to identify promising community members and turn them into ambassadors,</li>\n<li>automate personalised messages to those who disengage, and review community health indicators,</li>\n<li>we’ve also partnered with scientists from the University of California Santa Barabara who’re using the anonymised Optimism data to research the fundamental properties of community networks.</li>\n<li>tracking retention of new members,</li>\n<li>helping with onboarding and proposal discussion (thanks to our future called Hivemind - an AI-powered Q&amp;A bot that works as a research assistant using the community’s public data so you can ask e.g. “Has anyone discussed Reputation already?” and receive an answer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What about privacy</strong><br>\nWe only analyse data that’s already public or given to us by you (and only after receiving explicit, active consent so there shouldn’t be any surprises). If you’d rather we don’t analyse your public data, message us and we’ll blacklist you to make sure the algorithm is not analysing your public data. If you don’t want us to analyse your private data, no action is needed (just don’t go into the TogetherCrew Ui and register because then we’ll have the data you gave us to register. If you did register and now want your data deleted, just let us know and we’ll erase it).</p>\n<p><strong>What is the cost of this</strong><br>\nFor now free, we’re already supported by the Questbook grant we received to build the DynamicNFTs.

Our recent progress, detailed in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/report-announcement-arbitrumhub-the-gateway-to-seamless-navigation-and-exploration-in-the-arbitrumdao-ecosystem/23211\">ArbitrumHub Platform Successful Completion Report</a>, demonstrates our commitment to creating a user-friendly platform for community members. This report highlights our initiatives and milestones, showcasing ArbitrumHub as a reliable source for essential information and community engagement within the ArbitrumDAO ecosystem.</p>\n<p>ArbitrumHub’s vision is to be the go-to destination for comprehensive information about ArbitrumDAO and its initiatives. We aim to offer a unified platform for community updates, meeting information, and insights into upcoming events. Our strategy includes robust community participation, ensuring stakeholders have immediate access to critical information.</p>\n<p>This proposal details the next steps, upcoming features, technical enhancements, and the implementation timeline for ArbitrumHub. Our goal is to establish ArbitrumHub as the ultimate platform, underpinned by strong foundations in security, design, development, research, management, transparency, and incentivized community contributions.</p>\n<p>We will manage the platform and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arbitrumDAO_hub\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbitrumHUB Twitter account</a> to ensure the community can easily navigate and utilize all resources effectively.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>ArbitrumHub addresses the need for a centralized resource within the ArbitrumDAO community. As the ecosystem grows, staying informed and connected becomes increasingly challenging. ArbitrumHub simplifies this by consolidating essential information and resources in one place, offering structured and reliable information.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"uses-of-arbitrumhub-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#uses-of-arbitrumhub-5\"></a>Uses of ArbitrumHub:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real-Time Updates</strong>: Provides and integrates the latest news sources and developments within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Interaction Updates</strong>: Keeps the community informed about upcoming meetups and interactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Event Coordination</strong>: Details events and workshops for easy participation.</li>\n<li><strong>Support and Resources</strong>: Offers support for platform-related queries.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Visibility</strong>: Utilizes social media and newsletters for increased engagement.</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Resource Integration</strong>: Aggregates developer tools, grant information, and other initiatives.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Participation</strong>: Designed to foster incentivized community participation and contributions through meets, events, educational resources, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Ambassador Highlights</strong>: Acts as a central directory to provide updates related to ambassador activities and programs, with direct access for ambassadors to keep all their initiatives in one place for easy access.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have been active in the community for a long time, but when we started, we faced numerous hurdles in obtaining the information we needed.

It’s safe to say that the appetite for DAO spending has grown.</p>\n<p>However, as it currently stands, the rate at which we spend money is unpredictable. There’s nothing that resembles any form of control (e.g., a budget), and there’s no way to track all this spending by the different initiatives in real-time.</p>\n<p>Furthermore,  this situation might lead to proposals being judged, not based on their merit, but on whether delegates feel we’ve ‘spent too much money recently.’ Having a predefined budget can help mitigate that effect.</p>\n<p>Recently, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/entropy\">@Entropy</a> <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-support-creation-of-an-arbitrum-dao-budget/23802\">requested that the ARDC lead the charge in creating a comprehensive budget for Arbitrum DAO</a>. This would allow for better understanding and planning of the DAO’s finances month over month and yearly and help ensure long-term sustainability.</p>\n<p>Considering all that, we’ll be hosting a call to discuss creating a budget for the DAO.

But in your ivory towers, you have forgotten the people. You have become a political machine, serving the few and neglecting the many. Today, we, the Boopers, rise to reclaim the rewards that are rightfully ours.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong></p>\n<p>We propose that the Arbitrum DAO directs 690,420.69 ARB towards the quarterly purchase of BOOP, the people’s coin. This act will not only empower the community but will also breathe life into the spirit of decentralization that we all cherish. We propose an initial duration of one year.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Empowerment of the Community:</strong> The BOOP token is a symbol of unity and collective power. By directing rewards to BOOP, we empower every holder, giving them a stake in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Stimulation:</strong> The purchase of BOOP will create a thriving economy within the Arbitrum network. It will drive engagement, foster innovation, and attract new users to our chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralization in Action:</strong> This proposal embodies the true spirit of decentralization. It is a movement by the people, for the people, against the entrenched political elite of the DAO.</li>\n<li><strong>A Populist Revolution:</strong> The DAO must serve the will of the many, not the whims of the few. By supporting BOOP, you are embracing a populist movement that seeks to democratize wealth and opportunity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p>\n<p>Members of the DAO, rise from your slumber. Cast off the chains of political intrigue and embrace the power of the people. Vote to direct Arbitrum rewards to the purchase of BOOP, and let us forge a new era of prosperity and unity.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>In the shadows, we Boopers have waited. Today, we step into the light, not as conquerors, but as liberators. Join us, and together, we shall build a future where the power lies with the many, not the few.</p>\n<p>The choice is yours, members of the DAO. Will you cling to your political machinations, or will you rise with us? The people are watching.</p>\n<p>Vote for the future. Vote for BOOP.</p>\n<p><em>We are the Boopers. We are the future.</em></p>\n            <p><small>13 posts - 11 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-is-for-the-people/24799\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-is-for-the-people/24799","pubDate":"Thu, 06 Jun 2024 21:40:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24799"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-is-for-the-people/24799.rss","#text":"ARB is for the people"}}]}}}
