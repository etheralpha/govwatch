OpenZeppelin was asked by the ARDC to review the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232\">AIP</a>.  We assume that readers have read the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232\">AIP</a> or at least the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/bold/gentle-introduction\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gentle introduction</a> to which the AIP refers.  Our analysis focuses on the parameters of BOLD involving the distribution of confiscated funds and their implications for the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impressions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#impressions-2\"></a>Impressions</h2>\n<p>Overall we were impressed with the amount of work that went into creating BOLD as well as the thoroughness of the analysis, and the quality of the documentation. The several documents linked in the AIP describe its intricacies well and do so effectively to the different target audiences. If they could be improved, we would suggest adopting a single nomenclature across the several documents (e.g. “<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232\">challenge bond</a>” vs. “<a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">mini-bond</a>”, “<a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">challenge period</a>” vs. ”<a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dispute period</a>”).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"confiscated-funds-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#confiscated-funds-3\"></a>Confiscated Funds</h2>\n<p>The current validation scheme allows anyone to propose the next state in a canonical state chain, and users stake funds on which state they believe to be the correct next state. This proposed next state could be wrong, so anyone is allowed to dispute a proposed state within a confirmation period.  Within the proposal, there were some questions about exactly what should be done with confiscated funds from parties that lose disputes. The research provided is extremely concerned about collusion between challengers, and we share this concern. Alternatives to hardcoding a reward distribution amount or schedule may mitigate collusion.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"reward-funds-based-on-actual-network-delay-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#reward-funds-based-on-actual-network-delay-4\"></a>Reward funds based on actual network delay</h3>\n<p>In the scenario where a malicious user wishes to delay state confirmation for as long as possible, they would start a dispute at the end of the challenge period to maximize delay. If they were disputing with themselves, they could take as long as possible and continue to do this in the future. They’d essentially be paying stakes over time to double the confirmation time of blocks. This is textbook griefing and should <em>not</em> be made cheaper by rewarding the confederate challenger. However, consider the case where such a user starts a dispute at the start of the challenge period. If they indeed finish the dispute within the challenge period, no delay to the network would actually have occurred, and therefore the protocol need not be so worried about potential collusion. In such a scenario, it seems reasonable to reward the honest party with some amount of the confiscated funds immediately (perhaps split at some percentage with the DAO Treasury). The key here is that the research argues that it should cost a dishonest party proportional to the opportunity cost of the delay. And the greater the delay, the more incentive the griefer has to collude. So if no delay has occurred, there is less incentive to collude and less worry about rewarding the dispute winner.</p>\n<p>Of course, the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Technical Deep Dive</a> recognizes this would incentivize honest parties to compete against each other to raise and finish disputes faster than each other (see <strong>Bonding in Challenges</strong>, pg 11). But we would love to hear more about what the paper describes as “needless competition between honest parties.” Honest parties that are able to stake together in the dispute game <em>and</em> have an incentive to resolve disputes seems like a win-win.</p>\n<p>Above we discussed the classic delay attack. Now consider the simple case where a dishonest party asserts a state, an honest party quickly disputes it, and the faster a dispute is resolved, the more of the slashed funds the honest party receives. Quickly identifying fraud is ideal behavior. And yes, a malicious user with censorship abilities would lessen the reward won by honest parties if they could make the dispute take longer; but, this would not remove the strong incentive to dispute the dishonest state just lessen it temporarily. An abundance of caution leads us to believe that the full slashed amount should never be rewarded to the honest parties but making the ratio of the slashed amount dependent on how quickly a dispute begins and how quickly the dispute ends seems worth exploring further.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"postpone-rewarding-funds-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#postpone-rewarding-funds-5\"></a>Postpone rewarding funds</h3>\n<p>Next, consider a scenario where dishonest stakes are given to honest parties after six months. And again, let us consider the scenario above where a malicious user raises disputes with themselves at every honest state they post, delaying confirmation of states for as long as possible. Such a malicious user would need extraordinary capital to continuously delay states for six months. In such a scenario, if the DAO were able to recognize the network duress and also were able to vote and stop the delayed reward payments, the malicious user’s attack would then become much more expensive to continue (hopefully prohibitively more expensive). Our understanding is that BOLD does not preclude determined, large entities from performing this kind of attack. Indeed, any such optimistic rollup is susceptible to this. However, the network duress would be quite obvious and allow the DAO to make decisions about delaying rewards to protect the network.</p>\n<p>Now consider a malicious user that does not have the capital to perform this attack continuously. In such a case, they would be able to perform the attack more often after receiving rewards for disputing with themselves. However, the actual rewards would be delayed substantially, perhaps enough so that the delays they cause to the network provide no material difficulty for its users. Therefore, the longer the time an honest party has to wait for their funds, the less the risk of delays to the network and, therefore, the greater the share of the confiscated funds could be paid. And again, if there are enough malicious users out there to cause delays to the network (perhaps even all operating separately), giving the DAO the ability to turn off the payments should discourage the “market” for bad states.</p>\n<p>The obvious criticism with this method is that it introduces a special role into a permissionless system. But this is already a component of the AIP, giving the DAO all of the confiscated funds and the ability to use those funds how they wish. This privileged role the DAO will have in these cases can always be removed in newer iterations of the dispute protocol. So its temporary power to pause delayed rewards does not seem so unpalatable.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-changing-economic-environment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-changing-economic-environment-6\"></a>The Changing Economic Environment</h2>\n<p>BOLD sufficiently incentivizes parties to behave in ways that are beneficial to the network. Indeed, the success of BOLD relies on some of these incentives being <em>sufficient at all times</em> to induce the desired behavior. To this end, we were very pleased to see the proposal including the idea about service fees being paid to validators and honest disputers. This may be enough to incentivize validators and it may be the case that there need not be any further reward policy for confiscated funds. But it is an utmost priority to observe how these incentives actually perform. Should validators/disputers simply find better things to do with their locked assertion assets, they will leave their role, and the network will suffer. BOLD does a good job of guaranteeing the correctness of the state chain as long as one honest member exists. However, there exists a very perverse incentive for the last honest actor to be dishonest since no one is left to challenge them. So, in practice, more than one honest actor is ideal, and monitoring the health of the validator pool should become an ongoing DAO responsibility. We would hope that the number of validators and the amounts staked become a regular talking point, brought up at large. In fact, we recommend the DAO regularly monitor and discuss all of the factors in the proposal that determine the economic parameters at least until the community feels incredibly confident with BOLD’s performance. These parameters include the price of WETH, yield rates, the TVL of the bridge, the time-to-depletion for DAO payouts, and more. Gathering this information could be a simple, manual task performed by a specific DAO entity, and many of these values seem scrapable which would make this monitoring even easier. In this sense, adopting BOLD should be understood as the DAO adopting the responsibility for the economics of BOLD and the community’s confidence in it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-7\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Given the serious security implications of allowing permissionless disputes, we are pleased and impressed with the level of thoroughness with which the Offchain Labs team and Arbitrum community has discussed the risks of BOLD.</p>\n<p>We explored concerns with the handling of confiscated funds as well as the future need to monitor and update BOLD parameters as economic conditions change. The algorithm has been well thought-out and should work as expected. However, it does depend on economic incentives behaving under present economic conditions that are subject to change. We recommend monitoring the economic factors of BOLD once in production and be ready to make adjustments as needed.</p>\n<p>For more information on OpenZeppelin’s role as Security Member of ARDC, please visit our <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Security-Member-OpenZeppelin-8f0d23fa622e43329b530129769a7834\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Notion homepage</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-security-analysis/24938\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-security-analysis/24938","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Jun 2024 16:49:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24938"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-security-analysis/24938.rss","#text":"AIP BOLD Security Analysis"}},{"title":"Open Letter to the Arbitrum Foundation - Request to stop the exclusion of 24 Nations from participation in the Arbitrum Ecosystem","dc:creator":"Sixty","category":"General","description":"<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“I just wanna see my people empowered”</strong><br>\n<strong>“If you wanna a make change, it’s going to take commitment”</strong><br>\nJo-Vaughn Virginie Scott</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GM GM,<br>\nIt is with great sadness that this is my first post on the Arbitrum Forum. Nevertheless, this is an issue I would like to speak out about openly and hopefully see resolved. I am putting my reputation and livelihood at stake here because who knows what backlash I might receive for seemingly going against an organization the size of the Arbitrum Foundation. However, someone has to speak up eventually.</p>\n<p>I have been a participant in the web3 ecosystem for close to 4 years, and this year, I experienced what has to be some of my most painful moments in web3. After successfully participating in and qualifying for a grant in one of Arbitrum’s many programs, I was required to pass a KYC process run by the Arbitrum Foundation. Despite being announced as a winner of this program, I failed to pass the KYC due to the fact that the Arbitrum Foundation currently does not approve any residents of 24 nations that appear on the <a href=\"https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">FATF Black and Grey Lists</a>. These nations include:</p>\n<p><strong>Black List</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Democratic People’s Republic of Korea</li>\n<li>Iran</li>\n<li>Myanmar</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Grey List</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bulgaria</li>\n<li>Burkina Faso</li>\n<li>Cameroon</li>\n<li>Croatia</li>\n<li>Democratic Republic of Congo</li>\n<li>Haiti</li>\n<li>Jamaica</li>\n<li>Kenya</li>\n<li>Mali</li>\n<li>Mozambique</li>\n<li>Namibia</li>\n<li>Nigeria</li>\n<li>Philippines</li>\n<li>Senegal</li>\n<li>South Africa</li>\n<li>South Sudan</li>\n<li>Syria</li>\n<li>Tanzania</li>\n<li>Turkey</li>\n<li>Vietnam</li>\n<li>Yemen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At first, I decided to brush it off. Due to the fact that I am a person of color, I have had to deal with various forms of discrimination throughout my life. However, web3 was my safe space, I could hide behind a cartoon PFP and not have to face any of the harsh realities of real life. I have been involved in multiple DAOs, including leadership roles, and never have I been denied participation due to where I am from. Most recently, a good friend of mine who is an active participant in Arbitrum DAO, encouraged me to apply for a different non-grant program that had passed through the Arbitrum governance process. At first, I was excited to be able to participate in something, anything within the Arbitrum ecosystem, as I honestly love all the great work being done at Arbitrum DAO. However, after reading through the proposal again, I discovered that successful applicants would be required to undergo KYC by the Arbitrum Foundation. As you can imagine, It felt pretty horrible knowing I shouldn’t even try because, once again, I would be rejected based on being born in the wrong place.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I am not asking for some sympathy or trying to throw a pity party. This is not about money or looking for an apology; I want to see a change in a system I feel is wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>I request that the Arbitrum Foundation rethink its compliance process to at least include countries on the Grey List at a minimum</strong>.</p>\n<p>For most of these nations, Layer 2s like Arbitrum and Optimism are their first foray into the on-chain world, as they have relatively low fees compared to mainnet.

With a funding allocation of 300k ARB, the program targets three key categories: Building, Research, and Awareness. The program is opening for applications as of June 17th.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-2\"></a><strong>What?</strong></h3>\n<p>The RWAIG aims to offer comprehensive support across the lifecycle of RWA development on Arbitrum and kickstart the RWA vertical on Arbitrum. By partnering with experts from top RWA-focused projects like Chainlink, Securitize, PV01, Libre Capital, Centrifuge, and RWA.xyz, the RWAIG ensures quality and consistency in the development of the Arbitrum RWA ecosystem. Moreover, having a ‘guiding hand’ for projects aiming to deploy will enable tighter integrations between new and existing projects. We’ve designed the program in alignment with existing RWA initiatives on Arbitrum, such as STEP, to facilitate the integration of RWAs onto the network and increase the TVL of top DeFi apps on Arbitrum, like GMX, Aave, and Pendle.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"why-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#why-3\"></a><strong>Why?</strong></h3>\n<p>Through our RWA education sessions and other forum discussions, it’s apparent that RWAs are a critical vertical for Arbitrum to develop. JPMC estimates tokenisation can add $400B in annual revenue for the alts industry and tokenised private credit is only 0.4% of the global market, demonstrating the high growth potential. RWAs currently only constitute 1.1% of Arbitrum’s grants while competitors like Polygon and Avalanche progressing fast.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-4\"></a>How?</h3>\n<p>For this pilot phase, the total size of the fund will be 300k ARB and will be distributed over a 2-month period from 17 June to 16 August, with the review period beginning on 19 June. The program integrates quadratic and direct funding mechanisms in partnership with Gitcoin, with 100k ARB allocated to QF and 200K allocated to direct funding.

To date, we have approved 8 grant programs through our RFP process and 3 grant projects via our Firestarters program sourced from over 200 applications. We also made significant steps towards decentralizing the review process, with 50+ reviewers from the Arbitrum community.</p>\n<p>On a personal note I wanted to take a moment to say how proud I am to be part of this extended community that genuinely values decentralization and is excited to explore innovative mechanisms for the allocation of funds. This grants program is attracting a wide range of visionary ideas and it was truly painful to not be able to fund more of them. We have so many fantastic ideas coming forward, trusting in the community to do the assessment of which projects to fund felt like a leap of faith at times but an important one.</p>\n<p>In truth I may have personally selected one or two different proposals that I was excited by but that is the beautiful thing about harnessing the wisdom of the crowd. It’s not the views of any one person that matter, it’s the collective wisdom that is most important. At the end of the day all the projects that were shortlisted could have done amazing things and I hope we are able to fund many more similar projects that are inspired by the process in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>This document outlines key learnings from the M1b application and review process, which ran from April to June 2024. Where possible, some of these takeaways have already been applied, while others are highlighted for future implementation. Please share your thoughts and feedback in the comments section below.

Many applicants were obviously seeking seed funding, so they framed themselves as grant programs. Although some were very strong proposals, they could not be considered for funding. This highlighted the need for a general catch-all grant program to fund individual projects adding value to the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Going forward, there should be clearer communication around what constitutes a project versus a program, with this criterion included at the screening stage. We redirected many grantees to apply for the Firestarters program in order to access funding for development of mechanisms that could be of service to the DAO community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Greater transparency around the entire application and review process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We received feedback that too little of the review process was available for public scrutiny earlier on in the roll out. Several applicants requested a summary of why they were not selected, so we responded by providing summaries. This could have been more proactive.</p>\n<p>We are now testing the following changes aimed at improving transparency:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>All applications that pass screening are made publicly viewable and open for commentary (with personal identifying information removed). See <a href=\"https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invSkqryytljh8Wnp&amp;inviteToken=958fcbca84b197c2fe41477fad32584bbd3b47fa1f80b3baa684bcb7611e63b5&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product_team&amp;utm_content=transactional-alerts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">shortlisted programs</a> and <a href=\"https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv7wz3CbuVoP23xJ&amp;inviteToken=f689ed24c6ba8eed94c93594f943b0ff811078404a90a5538820d1447e97ef23&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product_team&amp;utm_content=transactional-alerts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Firestarters</a> as examples. Applicants are told to expect this when submitting their applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While we decided it was best not to share reviewer scores or comments to prevent personal attacks, bribery or other shenanigans, we have implemented AI-generated summaries that will be shared with all applicants who pass screening. This process is being automated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refined and targeted application questions. In the future, we recommend including the following questions at the program idea sourcing stage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demographics and more specific questions related to whether the applicant has run a program/grant-funded project before.</li>\n<li>Drop-down of allocation mechanisms for applicants to self identify and as the result easier sorting.</li>\n<li>Budgets would be helpful to know earlier in stage 1 so we can work with applicants around any issues during the Planning Grants stage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Better rubric scoring. -3 to +3 rubric scoring is more effective than a 1-5 Likert scale. We’re not just interested in positive measures of popularity (i.e. which applicant got the highest score). Negative numbers indicate varying degrees of disagreement and positive numbers indicate varying degrees of agreement while avoiding middle value ambiguity. This change in rubric scoring was implemented for the final program reviews and Firestarters.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"a-namereview-processa-review-process-methodology-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#a-namereview-processa-review-process-methodology-9\"></a><a name=\"review-process\"></a> Review process &amp; methodology</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"stage-1-screening-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stage-1-screening-10\"></a>Stage 1: Screening</h2>\n<p>The purpose of screening is to cut out obviously bad applicants such as spam (the applicant has made no effort whatsoever to provide a comprehensible program idea) and ChatGPT junk (the application is not only poor but appears to have been generated entirely by AI).

Due to this volatility, the total amount received in Arb tokens fell short of the intended budget. Out of the proposed $4 million, we only received $3.397 million.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this shortfall and ensure the program’s effectiveness, we propose an additional funding of $1 million. This additional funding will provide a buffer against future price fluctuations and enable us to fully execute the program as originally intended. Any surplus funds will be returned to the DAO. This was mentioned in the initial proposal extension of the DDA grants program via Questbook <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326\">here</a>, that if we fall short of the total funds needed we will intiate an additional fund request.</p>\n<p><strong>Background and Justification:</strong><br>\nUpon the launch of the Arbitrum DDA Program 2.0, we encountered price fluctuations in Arb tokens, which affected the total amount received. Despite our efforts to anticipate and mitigate such risks with a 30% buffer in the initial proposal, the actual amount received fell short of our proposed budget post transferring to USDC. This shortfall poses a challenge to the effective execution of the program and as noted on the main proposal, we mentioned an additional proposal to request for additional funds incase such an event transpired.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Additional Funding Request:</strong> We request an additional $1 million to supplement the existing budget of the Arbitrum DDA Program.</li>\n<li><strong>Return of Surplus Funds:</strong> Any surplus funds remaining after the completion of the program will be returned to the DAO, ensuring transparency and accountability in fund utilization.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>\nThe success of the Arbitrum DDA Program 2.0 is crucial for the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Our recent progress, detailed in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/report-announcement-arbitrumhub-the-gateway-to-seamless-navigation-and-exploration-in-the-arbitrumdao-ecosystem/23211\">ArbitrumHub Platform Successful Completion Report</a>, demonstrates our commitment to creating a user-friendly platform for community members. This report highlights our initiatives and milestones, showcasing ArbitrumHub as a reliable source for essential information and community engagement within the ArbitrumDAO ecosystem.</p>\n<p>ArbitrumHub’s vision is to be the go-to destination for comprehensive information about ArbitrumDAO and its initiatives. We aim to offer a unified platform for community updates, meeting information, and insights into upcoming events. Our strategy includes robust community participation, ensuring stakeholders have immediate access to critical information.</p>\n<p>This proposal details the next steps, upcoming features, technical enhancements, and the implementation timeline for ArbitrumHub. Our goal is to establish ArbitrumHub as the ultimate platform, underpinned by strong foundations in security, design, development, research, management, transparency, and incentivized community contributions.</p>\n<p>We will manage the platform and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arbitrumDAO_hub\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbitrumHUB Twitter account</a> to ensure the community can easily navigate and utilize all resources effectively.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>ArbitrumHub addresses the need for a centralized resource within the ArbitrumDAO community. As the ecosystem grows, staying informed and connected becomes increasingly challenging. ArbitrumHub simplifies this by consolidating essential information and resources in one place, offering structured and reliable information.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"uses-of-arbitrumhub-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#uses-of-arbitrumhub-5\"></a>Uses of ArbitrumHub:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real-Time Updates</strong>: Provides and integrates the latest news sources and developments within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Interaction Updates</strong>: Keeps the community informed about upcoming meetups and interactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Event Coordination</strong>: Details events and workshops for easy participation.</li>\n<li><strong>Support and Resources</strong>: Offers support for platform-related queries.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Visibility</strong>: Utilizes social media and newsletters for increased engagement.</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Resource Integration</strong>: Aggregates developer tools, grant information, and other initiatives.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Participation</strong>: Designed to foster incentivized community participation and contributions through meets, events, educational resources, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Ambassador Highlights</strong>: Acts as a central directory to provide updates related to ambassador activities and programs, with direct access for ambassadors to keep all their initiatives in one place for easy access.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have been active in the community for a long time, but when we started, we faced numerous hurdles in obtaining the information we needed.

But in your ivory towers, you have forgotten the people. You have become a political machine, serving the few and neglecting the many. Today, we, the Boopers, rise to reclaim the rewards that are rightfully ours.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong></p>\n<p>We propose that the Arbitrum DAO directs 690,420.69 ARB towards the quarterly purchase of BOOP, the people’s coin. This act will not only empower the community but will also breathe life into the spirit of decentralization that we all cherish. We propose an initial duration of one year.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Empowerment of the Community:</strong> The BOOP token is a symbol of unity and collective power. By directing rewards to BOOP, we empower every holder, giving them a stake in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Stimulation:</strong> The purchase of BOOP will create a thriving economy within the Arbitrum network. It will drive engagement, foster innovation, and attract new users to our chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralization in Action:</strong> This proposal embodies the true spirit of decentralization. It is a movement by the people, for the people, against the entrenched political elite of the DAO.</li>\n<li><strong>A Populist Revolution:</strong> The DAO must serve the will of the many, not the whims of the few. By supporting BOOP, you are embracing a populist movement that seeks to democratize wealth and opportunity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p>\n<p>Members of the DAO, rise from your slumber. Cast off the chains of political intrigue and embrace the power of the people. Vote to direct Arbitrum rewards to the purchase of BOOP, and let us forge a new era of prosperity and unity.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>In the shadows, we Boopers have waited. Today, we step into the light, not as conquerors, but as liberators. Join us, and together, we shall build a future where the power lies with the many, not the few.</p>\n<p>The choice is yours, members of the DAO. Will you cling to your political machinations, or will you rise with us? The people are watching.</p>\n<p>Vote for the future. Vote for BOOP.</p>\n<p><em>We are the Boopers.

The aim is to develop a detailed and executable proposal that can be swiftly implemented to maximize the benefits for the DAO while minimizing the potential pitfalls of higher fees.

But that’s not a realistic world view to hold. Especially for optimistic rollups.</p>\n<p>In centralized institutions, a single entity holds all the decision-making power, determining what is right and which direction to take. This concentration of authority leaves little room for other users or stakeholders to present their interests or versions of the truth.</p>\n<p>Conversely, in decentralized systems like blockchains, there is no single source of truth. Instead, the truth emerges from the consensus of multiple entities within a system that is permissionless to participate in. This structure allows for diverse perspectives but can also lead to disputes when different entities have varying versions of the truth. And this necessitates dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum’s BoLD</strong></p>\n<p>Bounded Liquidity Delay, or BoLD, is Arbitrum’s new dispute resolution mechanism. This protocol is designed to be resistant to attack vectors such as delay attacks, resource exhaustion attacks, and censorship attacks. BoLD is permissionless compared to Arbitrum’s currently deployed dispute resolution protocol. Other optimistic rollups, such as Optimism, Cartesi, and Fuel, are also developing their own dispute-resolution methods.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-dispute-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-dispute-3\"></a><strong>The Dispute</strong></h1>\n<p>Before we dive into the different dispute resolution mechanisms, let’s clarify a few things. Let’s have a look at where or when a dispute resolution mechanism enters the picture in an optimistic rollup. When funds are withdrawn from an optimistic rollup back to Ethereum using a roll-up bridge, funds are not immediately credited to your account. Why is this the case?</p>\n<p>Optimistic rollups exist so that the L1, Ethereum, should not have to do the compute-heavy job of executing transactions.  They optimistically accept L2 state outputs unless those outputs are challenged.  Claims are assertions about the state of the L2 given a set of inputs.</p>\n<p>Now, the claims aren’t considered valid immediately. They must first pass through a challenge period, which usually lasts 7 days. During this challenging period, each claim can be challenged by a challenger who can contest that a claim is invalid. Now, what we have here is a dispute between those who consider a particular claim valid and those who consider that claim invalid.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-resolution-how-are-disputes-resolved-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-resolution-how-are-disputes-resolved-4\"></a><strong>The Resolution</strong> - <strong>How Are Disputes Resolved?</strong></h1>\n<p>With Arbitrum’s currently deployed dispute resolution mechanism, you have assertions about Arbitrum’s state being posted to Ethereum by proposers. These assertions can be challenged by “challengers” during the 7-day period. During this period, the proposers and challengers engage in an interactive step-by-step bisection process. This is where the proposers and the challengers narrow down on the exact point of dispute from the global state down to single blocks. As shown in the diagram below.</p>\n<p>After isolating the dispute to a single block, the process further bisects down to the individual execution steps within that block. This involves providing competing state transitions and proving the correctness of each step. And now, when the dispute is further narrowed down to a single execution step, the proposer or challenger, whosever turn it is to respond, has to provide data proof to execute the next step. If executing this step results in a different state than previously asserted, the current responder wins the challenge.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this bisection mechanism is to minimize the computation required to verify fraud-proof. If the entire rollup block had to be verified, the L2 throughput would be limited by the L1’s throughput.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0891b71d02cff31d5cf8b1222a39032c42fc7978.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1dO0PdHF8pMHqNjMfXXvPS1HAnu.png?dl=1\" title=\"1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0891b71d02cff31d5cf8b1222a39032c42fc7978_2_418x500.png\" alt=\"1\" data-base62-sha1=\"1dO0PdHF8pMHqNjMfXXvPS1HAnu\" width=\"418\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0891b71d02cff31d5cf8b1222a39032c42fc7978_2_418x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0891b71d02cff31d5cf8b1222a39032c42fc7978_2_627x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0891b71d02cff31d5cf8b1222a39032c42fc7978_2_836x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FCFCFC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Optimism initially used a single-round mechanism to verify the transactions in question in the EVM but now the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-fault-proofs/8161\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">newly proposed mechanism</a> will use a <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/stage-one/fault-dispute-game.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">multi-round dispute mechanism</a> similar to Arbitrum (add trade-offs between the two).

In a dispute where an invalid block is submitted and challenged, the block is run through several ZK provers. The resulting ZK proof is submitted as a fraud-proof.</p>\n<p>The dispute resolution period on Arbitrum and Optimism lasts 7 days. This is for various reasons, but mainly to give the Arbitrum &amp; Ethereum community enough time to coordinate a recovery in case of censorship attacks from malicious actors. This works well as long as the censorship attack does not last more than a week. Given that With Hybrid Proving, there is a reduced number of interactive rounds, in a happy case, the dispute resolution window could potentially be reduced to one day. However, it only takes one validator not to do anything, i.e., to not check-in for the 7-day period to kick in. This would lead to the validator getting slashed. Validators may fail to check-in either due to honest inactivity or maliciousness. To account for honest inactivity, validators could placed with an MPC set-up. So even if some nodes go down, they will collectively continue to check-in.</p>\n<p><strong>Who takes part in disputes?</strong></p>\n<p>Generally speaking, there are two main types of actors: the proposers and the challengers. The role of the proposer is to post assertions to the L1, and the challenger can raise a dispute. Operating both these roles requires a stake. This stake can be slashed if the party is found guilty of raising false flags or misbehaving. The stake is also required to post claims or assertions during each step of a challenge. Some protocols may also use another party whose role is only to verify assertions being posted by the proposer. This role does not require a stake to operate.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"extent-of-maliciousness-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#extent-of-maliciousness-5\"></a><strong>Extent of Maliciousness</strong></h1>\n<p>As of now, Optimistic rollups collectively hold over $30 Bn in TVL. All of this value would be at risk if malicious actors win disputes by posting false assertions unless there are robust dispute resolution protocols in place, if not, Optimistic rollups stand to lose hundreds of millions or billions to these actors potentially.</p>\n<p>There are several attack vectors that malicious actors can use to disrupt the chain. These can mainly be classified into delay attacks, economic attacks, and censorship attacks. Current dispute resolution mechanisms that are live, operate on a permissioned and trusted model consisting of entities with high reputations. If any of them were to behave maliciously, they can be punished or kicked off the network. But now, optimistic rollup teams have been coming up with more permissionless dispute resolution methods that would lower the barriers to raising and participating in a dispute. We will look at how Arbitrum’s BOLD, Cartesi’s DAVE, Optimism, and Fuel’s Hybrid Proving mechanism fair against these attack vectors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"delay-attacks-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#delay-attacks-6\"></a>Delay Attacks</h2>\n<p>The idea with delay attacks is to affect the protocol’s liveness. An attacker’s goal is to prevent or delay the confirmation of withdrawals on the L1. A successful delay attack can halt the chain’s progress and cause honest parties to expend resources unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>An attacker may also try to delay a dispute from being resolved by keeping the interactive bisection process going for a much longer duration. If an honest actor cannot respond in time, the challenge could be lost due to a timeout, resulting in the attacker winning the dispute.</p>\n<p>Unlike the currently deployed dispute protocol on Arbitrum, BOLD is designed to resolve disputes within a bounded duration regardless of the number of participants or assertions being made. The currently deployed dispute protocol of Arbitrum has a  “Chess Clock” or a local timer system that allows each responder to have a fixed time period to respond. Once a party makes a move, their timer pauses, and the opposing party’s timer starts ticking. Whichever party’s timer reaches 0 first loses, and the other party ends up winning. This way, causing delays by not responding is not a working strategy for a bad actor.</p>\n<p>With BOLD, there is a concept of “parent” and “child” assertions. The original assertion made by a proposer is the parent, and the resulting assertion is the “child” assertion. Each party has a fixed timer to make their moves, and each assertion inherits the timer from its parent assertion. For example, if the first assertion made had a challenge period of 7 days, and it was challenged on the 2nd day, the time remaining is 5 days. So, the child assertion would now have a timer of 5 days.</p>\n<p>Optimism also uses a local timer mechanism. Additionally, if any bad actor tries to delay the dispute resolution by posting “freeloader” claims, which are claims that do not contribute to the resolution, that actor will be slashed. Similar to the concept of inheritance of timers from parent to child assertions, with Optimism, if a “grand-child” assertion has less than X amount of time remaining, the “grand-child” assertion’s timer is extended to have exactly X amount of time. While this is designed to ensure that the assertion has enough time to be resolved or challenged, it may allow adversaries to cause more delay.</p>\n<p>Cartesi uses a tournament-style refereed mechanism to manage disputes. It splits the dispute into smaller stages and uses binary search to narrow down the exact point of dispute. Each step must be resolved within a predefined time frame. This mechanism is similar to that of BOLD and Optimism, but each round has a separate timer and timing rules. Not meeting the timer limits in each round leads to eliminations. But with a separate timer for each round, a bad actor can choose not to respond and delay the full duration of each of the rounds. Even though the bad actor would get slashed, this would lead to significant delays.</p>\n<p>With Fuel, given that there are no local timer based bisection games in which parties take turns to respond. When there is a dispute, the whole block in question is run through several ZK provers and the resulting ZK proof is submitted as a fraud-proof. Effectively being more resilient to any delay attacks that a malicious attacker could use at this stage. There are possibilities of an attacker controlling some of the ZK provers and verifiers in order to delay the proof generation process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"economics-of-dispute-resolution-protocols-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#economics-of-dispute-resolution-protocols-7\"></a><strong>Economics of Dispute Resolution Protocols</strong></h2>\n<p>Participating in dispute resolution protocols requires different types of economic resources, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bond to be eligible to post assertions and participate in dispute games</li>\n<li>gas costs associated with posting the assertions or moves to the L1</li>\n<li>computation resources that are used as a part of participating in a dispute.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal of an economic attack for an attacker would be to have the honest party expend significantly higher resources than what it would cost the attacker to perform the attack.</p>\n<p>Even a delay attack can be a type of economic attack given that participating in extended disputes requires more resources. So, the attacker may try to exhaust honest parties’ resources so they can no longer afford to participate.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the attacker may try to order transactions being posted to the L1 by placing their own transactions ahead of the honest actor’s transactions. This is possible by either bribing validators or running their own.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cost-of-participation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#cost-of-participation-8\"></a>Cost of Participation</h3>\n<p>Dispute resolution protocols require a bond to be placed in order to function as a proposer/validator to post assertions or challenge assertions. It also helps deter delays by preventing just anyone from participating in the validation process.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum requires a bond of 3600 ETH to post assertions and can be withdrawn after an assertion has been confirmed. This amount is roughly $13.4 Mn based on current prices. Though this is a high sum, it can also be trustlessly pooled. A challenge bond is required when it comes to opening challenges against assertions posted to Ethereum. These have a 555/79 ETH bond requirement based on the level or granularity of the interactive bisection game. The higher the level, the greater the requirement. BoLD has a maximum depth of 3 with a base fee assumption of 500 Gwei per gas. For reference, Gwei per gas today is 12.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3c0536a79ebcd75b1bc819cc30741e6d47c17969.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8yXOIJtIU1LyBqKUArgJeZ2ljGp.png?dl=1\" title=\"3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3c0536a79ebcd75b1bc819cc30741e6d47c17969_2_690x148.png\" alt=\"3\" data-base62-sha1=\"8yXOIJtIU1LyBqKUArgJeZ2ljGp\" width=\"690\" height=\"148\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3c0536a79ebcd75b1bc819cc30741e6d47c17969_2_690x148.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3c0536a79ebcd75b1bc819cc30741e6d47c17969_2_1035x222.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3c0536a79ebcd75b1bc819cc30741e6d47c17969_2_1380x296.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAF9FC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethereum Average Gas Price Daily Insights: Ethereum Statistics | YCharts</a></p>\n<p>High bonding requirements may lead to centralizing forces, but high costs also mean that it would not be trivial for a bad actor to cause delays. BoLD’s bond requirements are set based on resource exhaustion ratios. The ratio calculates the cost ratio between an honest and malicious party, e.g., a ratio of 5 means defending a $5 attack costs $1. A higher ratio increases security but also bond sizes. BoLD’s ratio has been set to optimize for the tradeoffs between the cost of participation and the security of the chain during challenges. A resource exhaustion ratio &gt;1 means that the defender is always economically advantaged.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/441d8e12caa683512f0c79adf6fac7ab5edb106c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9IzMVNNxJsKX8Wslv97bSc3G3ZW.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/441d8e12caa683512f0c79adf6fac7ab5edb106c_2_690x377.jpeg\" alt=\"4\" data-base62-sha1=\"9IzMVNNxJsKX8Wslv97bSc3G3ZW\" width=\"690\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/441d8e12caa683512f0c79adf6fac7ab5edb106c_2_690x377.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/441d8e12caa683512f0c79adf6fac7ab5edb106c_2_1035x565.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/441d8e12caa683512f0c79adf6fac7ab5edb106c_2_1380x754.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F9F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Having a higher bond requirement will also prevent a bad actor from performing resource exhaustion attacks by making it financially unviable to set up several bonds, causing multiple disputes. Additionally, challenging an assertion is trustless, given that challenge bonds can be set up permisionlessly.</p>\n<p>Optimism’s FDGs’s bond requirements are also similar as the size of the bond depends on the depth of the move or the level of the dispute. There is a base fee assumption of 200 Gwei per gas, and the first depth of the game has a baseline cost of 400,000 gas. Games have a maximum depth of 73. A scaling factor of 1.09493 is used to calculate the required bond at each level of depth. At the max level of depth, the required bond would be about 300,000,000 gas, which amounts to about 60 ETH. Bond requirements at this level are designed to cover double the cost of a max Preimage Proposal. Preimage Proposals are used to submit and verify large data inputs required to verify claims. There is no explicit mention of a bond required to be a part of the network and post assertions in the docs. Given that it is not costly to open challenges, it can lead to an attacker opening multiple challenges and delaying the protocol. Having an initial bond requirement to start posting assertions would deter an attacker from performing such attacks.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/00cb9ceb049514d93406c4d88525e41c5c310ea8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/72eNMwUK2RKJSxvvGkO1pbcVXa.png?dl=1\" title=\"5\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/00cb9ceb049514d93406c4d88525e41c5c310ea8_2_690x385.png\" alt=\"5\" data-base62-sha1=\"72eNMwUK2RKJSxvvGkO1pbcVXa\" width=\"690\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/00cb9ceb049514d93406c4d88525e41c5c310ea8_2_690x385.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/00cb9ceb049514d93406c4d88525e41c5c310ea8_2_1035x577.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/00cb9ceb049514d93406c4d88525e41c5c310ea8.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8FB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Fuel’s fast finality mechanism talks about requiring a dynamic stake that would influence how long a validator could delay withdrawals in the event of a challenge. If an honest validator with high bonding fails to check-in, it could delay the protocol by 7 days. On the other hand, a validator with a lower bond could delay the withdrawals by 3 days. Withdrawal delays give enough time for the protocol and the remaining honest parties to respond to attacks. In case multiple honest minorities do not respond or go offline, all of their stakes can be weighted together to extend the window longer. Fuel currently has not published the exact bond size numbers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"incentives-to-defend-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentives-to-defend-9\"></a><strong>Incentives to Defend</strong></h3>\n<p>Given that honest participants in a dispute use these resources to contest against malicious actors, they stand to win a portion of the slashed stake from the malicious actor.</p>\n<p>BOLD tries to ensure that it is economically unviable for an attacker to increase an honest party’s cost of participation. Dishonest parties stand to be slashed and they lose all of their bond. On the other hand, honest parties will be compensated for all their costs and be rewarded with 1% of the slashed funds. As for when there are no challenges, active honest parties will be paid a service fee by the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p>BOLD uses a bisection game where parties are required to commit to the entire execution history using a Merkle tree. In this approach, each step’s assertion and its previous step’s assertions are committed to the Merkle tree. This ensures that if one honest party has used their stake to calculate and commit to an assertion, other honest parties do not need to use their resources to repeat the same step again. This allows honest parties to collaborate trustlessly against bad actors without having to know each other. For example, if Alice and Bob do not know each other but they are both honest, Bob can help Alice defend the right assertion against a bad actor without needing to know each other.</p>\n<p>The currently deployed dispute protocol for Arbitrum allows challenges to happen sequentially. This allows bad actors to start multiple disputes and delay withdrawals.  BoLD enables an honest party to fend off multiple challenges simultaneously &amp; even in such a case, the attacker would be at a disadvantage since the costs for an attacker would always exceed the cost for a defender at the end of the challenge. BOLD can be resistant to such attacks with fixed challenge periods with a local timer and stake being required to make moves.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8fbd28ee3f53f164faa745b3d6b0d7a03bf5b08f.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kvzybOf2I5jwcgsJCtvPKmpCV8r.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fbd28ee3f53f164faa745b3d6b0d7a03bf5b08f_2_514x499.jpeg\" alt=\"6\" data-base62-sha1=\"kvzybOf2I5jwcgsJCtvPKmpCV8r\" width=\"514\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fbd28ee3f53f164faa745b3d6b0d7a03bf5b08f_2_514x499.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fbd28ee3f53f164faa745b3d6b0d7a03bf5b08f_2_771x748.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8fbd28ee3f53f164faa745b3d6b0d7a03bf5b08f.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CDC6DB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Cartesi’s DAVE also uses the same approach of multi-level refinement and committing to execution histories. This way, honest parties can collaborate trustlessly against bad actors and avoid incurring additional costs. Additionally, with DAVE, the cost of participation for an honest party grows logarithmically with the number of bad actors. This helps honest parties defend against an increasing number of bad actors while their cost of participation does not rise exponentially. But this would lead to delays with an increase in bad actors.</p>\n<p>Given that Fuel uses a check-in-based model, validators have to check in periodically to attest to the validity of state transitions. Depending on the frequency of the check-ins, validators could incur higher or lower costs. To lower these costs, Fuel plans on using ZK aggregator or batching all check-ins over a period of time. Validators here are incentivized by random stake-weighted rewards to check-in.</p>\n<p>With Optimism, the bond/stake required depends on the level or position of the move that a party is about to make in a dispute. Honest responses/moves are incentivized in Optimism’s FDG (<a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/stage-one/fault-dispute-game.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Fault Dispute Game</a>) such that honest moves that successfully counter invalid moves will be <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/stage-one/bond-incentives.html#leftmost-claim-incentives\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">rewarded with the bond of the invalid moves</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"self-disputes-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#self-disputes-10\"></a><strong>Self-Disputes</strong></h3>\n<p>This is where “self disputes” become a problem. Here, a single malicious actor could cause delays by putting up both an honest and a dishonest move. Having an invalid move slashed only for it to be rewarded to the honest move. Effectively making it a zero-cost delay. Additionally, there is a delay before the slashed bonds are rewarded. This is so that the protocol can verify that the dispute game played out correctly and the slashed funds are being rewarded to the right party.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d7afcc212fe968e1f62ef06cefb68f8a5cea31d6.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uM3iClGJHYovNgnHJRF9X93zn14.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d7afcc212fe968e1f62ef06cefb68f8a5cea31d6_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"7\" data-base62-sha1=\"uM3iClGJHYovNgnHJRF9X93zn14\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d7afcc212fe968e1f62ef06cefb68f8a5cea31d6_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d7afcc212fe968e1f62ef06cefb68f8a5cea31d6_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d7afcc212fe968e1f62ef06cefb68f8a5cea31d6.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"72505F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>To model against self disputes, In Arbitrum, all bonds are held in an escrow contract by the dispute protocol.

If the assertion is rejected, bonds are confiscated and sent to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. 1% of the confiscated bonds are rewarded to honest actors who defend against bad actors.  The remainder of the confiscated could be used to reimburse the cost of participation for honest parties. This way, it is not economically feasible for a bad actor to self-dispute to cause delays as they would only be rewarded with 1% of the slashed bonds and may never get their hands on the rest of the 99%.</p>\n<p>Optimism’s FDG docs do not mention if 100% of the slashed bonds are rewarded to the other party or if it is a specific portion. A “DelayedWETH” contract holds bonds for each game. This contract has an “owner” address parameter that can act as the last defense in case bonds from a game are incorrectly distributed. It is unclear how the protocol will notice two or more colluding addresses that may self-dispute to attribute whether funds were incorrectly distributed.</p>\n<p>Fuel’s <a href=\"https://forum.fuel.network/t/why-wait-a-week-fast-finality-optimistic-rollups/4471\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">post</a> did not explicitly mention how they manage self-disputes. But whenever there is a dispute, the whole block in question is ZK proven, and the resulting proof is submitted as fraud-proof. Cartesi’s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12439\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">paper</a> has not explicitly modeled for self-disputes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"quest-against-censorship-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#quest-against-censorship-11\"></a>Quest Against Censorship</h2>\n<p>It is possible for a bad actor to try to censor assertions made by honest parties to the L1 and post their own false assertion instead to win or delay the dispute. The attacker bears the cost of censoring transactions, which grows based on the severity and duration of censorship. For example, it will cost the attacker more to gain control of 2/3 of Ethereum validators for 1 week than to gain control of 1/3 of validators for 3 days.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3be85624411de52016c45b4fd26fd021eaed97db.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8xXWRsIq5bF26Bx7XPKiyhHxFpx.png?dl=1\" title=\"8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3be85624411de52016c45b4fd26fd021eaed97db_2_690x385.png\" alt=\"8\" data-base62-sha1=\"8xXWRsIq5bF26Bx7XPKiyhHxFpx\" width=\"690\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3be85624411de52016c45b4fd26fd021eaed97db_2_690x385.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3be85624411de52016c45b4fd26fd021eaed97db_2_1035x577.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3be85624411de52016c45b4fd26fd021eaed97db_2_1380x770.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1C2630\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Alternatively, an attacker can fill up Ethereum blocks with frivolous transactions and bribe block builders to include those transactions, effectively pushing out honest parties’ transactions from being included in the current block to the subsequent blocks. This, too, can be considered as a form of a delay attack.</p>\n<p>To kick a bad actor off the network, a transaction must be submitted to Ethereum. Now, if Ethereum is being censored, it will be difficult to carry out this operation. Full censorship is possible if we assume that it could use billions to carry out the attack. But if Ethereum is only being partially censored, the transaction would be validated by the remaining honest validators on Ethereum. As for the set of L2 validators, they can be governed by a DAO or a security council. But censorship would still be possible on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>In BOLD’s case, as there is a local timer mechanism that eliminates a party if their timer runs out, an attacker could potentially censor or prevent an honest party from responding until their timer runs out and the attacker wins. To account for such situations, there is an added buffer to the timer in case an honest party is being censored. It is safe to assume that an attacker will not be able to censor indefinitely as it would consume indefinite resources.</p>\n<p>BOLD has two parameters called Nominal Delay and Censorship Budget (Cmax). Nominal Delay accounts for the regular, expected delays that may occur. Cmax is the maximum amount of time an attacker can censor an honest party before Ethereum’s social layer takes action. This is when both the honest parties’ timer is paused. This allows the honest party to respond once the censorship attack stops.</p>\n<p>Optimism does not have a parameter similar to a Censorship Budget, but the FDG protocol accounts for a nominal delay that an actor could face while operating a validator (time required to coordinate a multi-sig). Optimism uses an off-chain monitoring system that will keep track of all root assertions made by validators and make sure they align with the correct state.</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, Fuel’s mechanism operates on a check-in model where validators must periodically check in, signaling either that everything is correct (true) or indicating a problem (false).  Fuel has modeled for a mass censorship situation where honest parties are unable to respond or check-in. Even if they spot an invalid block, they would not be able to check-in as “false”. Missing a check-in is treated as censorship or inactivity, extending the challenge window up to a maximum of 7 days. Once the censorship attack has concluded, honest parties can check-in again to keep the state finalization process going. Validators may fail to check-in either due to honest inactivity or maliciousness, in which case they would get slashed. To account for honest inactivity, validators could placed with an MPC set-up. So even if some nodes go down, they will collectively continue to check-in.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"role-of-security-councils-and-guardians-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#role-of-security-councils-and-guardians-12\"></a><strong>Role of Security Councils and Guardians</strong></h3>\n<p>Security councils play a role in monitoring whether or not the protocol is functioning as intended and also step in when corrections or reversions are required. They especially come in handy when new protocol designs are deployed that sustain millions, if not billions. Dispute resolution protocols rely on security councils or other entities that have the power to govern the protocol in dire situations. The level of involvement from such an entity directly reflects how thorough or decentralized the dispute resolution protocol is.</p>\n<p>With BoLD, the challenge period lasts 6.4 days. While BoLD does not require proactive monitoring, it has an additional 2-day delay for its security council to step in if there are any major bugs in the protocol in extreme situations.  Under normal conditions, BoLD will function without any intervention from the security council.</p>\n<p>Optimism’s FDG uses a Guardian contract coupled with a security council that takes a more <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-protocol-upgrade-7-fault-proofs/8161/37\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proactive approach</a> and has the final say over the protocol and can disable fault proofs in an emergency. This failsafe mechanism would be at risk if Ethereum is being censored.</p>\n<p>The level of involvement of Fuel’s security council in the fast finality mechanism is unclear but they will be able to step in and take charge of the final state transition in case of attacks or bugs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-13\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>All of the proposed dispute resolution protocols are yet to go live on the mainnet. BoLD has had <a href=\"https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">private</a> and <a href=\"https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">public audits</a> and is expected to go live in July/August once the BoLD proposal is voted on successfully. If the vote is successful, Arbitrum will get closer to being a stage 2 rollup.</p>\n<p>Optimism’s FDG will likely be audited in June-July, and Optimism’s <a href=\"https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/72085170435228531173144599119267762084652443676555508407874836206178427511368\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fault-proof proposal</a> was voted on successfully. There is no official date as to when this would go live, but protocol upgrade <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#7</span> mentioned it would be shortly after the proposal had been voted on successfully.</p>\n<p>Cartesi’s DAVE is under development, as depicted <a href=\"https://cartesi.io/technical-evolution-plan/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.  Fuel’s hybrid proving and fast finality mechanism are also under development.</p>\n<p>Each dispute mechanism is modeled based on the respective Optimistic rollup’s fraud-proving design. As Arbitrum, Optimism, and Cartesi use interactive verification games, their protocols are more prone to delay and economic attacks, and hence, their dispute mechanism protocols are modeled to handle them better. On the other hand, Fuel’s mechanism is less vulnerable to delay attacks given that there are no interactive verification games but is more prone to censorship attacks as it is reliant on a set of provers and verifiers computing a ZK proof. All the different fraud-proving systems and dispute-resolution protocols can still be vulnerable to a number of attack vectors and internal bugs. Teams are actively working on research and development of these protocols.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1c849cb42a9b8e3d46c2e8f498615b125c9ab536.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/44hul0Z0CSG16Up6q63qYetZLT0.png?dl=1\" title=\"9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1c849cb42a9b8e3d46c2e8f498615b125c9ab536_2_690x386.png\" alt=\"9\" data-base62-sha1=\"44hul0Z0CSG16Up6q63qYetZLT0\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1c849cb42a9b8e3d46c2e8f498615b125c9ab536_2_690x386.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1c849cb42a9b8e3d46c2e8f498615b125c9ab536_2_1035x579.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1c849cb42a9b8e3d46c2e8f498615b125c9ab536.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"3D3E3F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>We’ve seen a handful of L2s and L3s emerge based on Optimistic rollup frameworks. XAI and Syndr, Degen on Arbitrum; Zora and Farcaster on Optimism. With Arbitrum L3s, assertions about L3 state can either be posted by an L3 sequencer or an L2 sequencer through a delayed inbox queue. If the L3 sequencer is censored or offline, assertions can be posted to the L2 sequencer, but if the L2 sequencer is also censored or offline, there is a “forceinclusion” mechanism in place that bypasses the sequencer after 24 hours. This is the happy path without any disputes. If there are disputes, the challenge resolution could take well beyond 7 days, depending upon the number of moves in the dispute. In this case, Arbitrum has a “DelayBuffer” mechanism that allows parties to make moves without being limited by the 24-hrs per move limit by reducing the “forceinclusion” window below 24hrs.</p>\n<p>Shared sequencers will also require faster withdrawal periods to be atomically interoperable. Current fraud-proving delays introduce other possible attack vectors, such as delay attacks, economic attacks, and censorship attacks, that can hinder and extend dispute resolution periods that may not be optimal for shared sequencers.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02880\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Incentive Schemes for Rollup Validators</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10491\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BoLD: Fast and Cheap Dispute Resolution</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-fault-proofs/8161\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism Upgrade Proposal: Fault Proofs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.fuel.network/t/why-wait-a-week-fast-finality-optimistic-rollups/4471\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Why wait a week?

Our report aligns with the goals and overarching objectives of both programs, which aim at understanding the mechanics of effective incentivization within Arbitrum, and the wider web3 ecosystem while supporting network growth. These are our preliminary research findings, which can be greatly expanded upon should we continue the work with the LTIP program.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>As the race for L2 dominance picks up steam, newcomers and incumbents are deploying considerable amounts of capital and resources in an attempt to grow their network size, attract builders, and expand their user base. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand how the design of these incentives influences its outcome and how the DAO can better equip itself to maximize the growth and effectiveness of these mechanisms.</p>\n<p>This report attempts to lay the foundations of a comprehensive analysis that offers actionable insights and highlights notable trends and patterns that inform how subsequent initiatives may be designed, iterated, and improved upon.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>STIP was designed to support network growth by accelerating the distribution of incentives through Arbitrum dApps. This approach allowed for a wide array of incentivization designs, serving as experimental grounds for the development of novel, and better, incentive distribution designs. Our analysis leverages onchain and offchain data sources, including the Arbitrum Governance Forum and Snapshot space, to assess STIP’s impact on network top-line metrics performance, user engagement, acquisition costs, retention, and governance participation and effort.</p>\n<p>Building off the feedback of STIP, LTIPP was designed to continue accelerating network growth. Therefore, we also compared it against its predecessor in terms of feedback distribution, surfacing the most common themes, and quantifying the effort invested by the community during the initial phase of both programs.</p>\n<p>With this report, we aim to empower the Arbitrum Community and the broader ecosystem with actionable insights to boost the impact of incentive initiatives. By better understanding how incentives work and perform, we hope to foster sustained growth for Arbitrum while guiding DAO Operators and Delegates toward more effective strategies that align with the community’s interests and objectives.</p>\n<p>StableLab, as a direct participant in Arbitrum Governance and an advocate for better governance, is aligned with these goals and remains committed to providing accurate, unbiased, and comprehensive analysis to ensure solutions that maximize the DAO’s overall success.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-takeaways-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-takeaways-4\"></a>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>STIP was cost-effective in driving relative growth of top-line network metrics compared to other large initiatives, such as the ARB airdrop.</li>\n<li>User Retention remains a significant challenge with activity levels returning to pre-STIP figures, indicating the necessity of further refinement and innovation in how incentives are designed.</li>\n<li>STIP primarily attracted users that can be labeled as “Traders” (94% of the incentivized users), suggesting the need to adjust the program design in order to further attract and engage with other user segment types.</li>\n<li>During the application phase of STIP, community engagement was extremely skewed toward Yield Aggregators (18 applicants) and DEXs (17 applicants). However, community effort was concentrated in a handful of applicants, belonging to the DEXs (930 hours) and Perpetuals (590 hours) sectors, most likely due to the perceived relevance and renown of some applicants.</li>\n<li>The application phase changes introduced in LTIPP (creation of the advisor role and implementation of a council system) improved the quality and consistency of the feedback received by the applicants while reducing community effort. To be determined if this translates to more impactful incentive designs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"limitations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#limitations-5\"></a>Limitations</h2>\n<p>While we attempted to use as much data available, due to the wide variety of incentive designs deployed, we could not analyze all of these in detail. This remains as something that could be expanded in the future with further research. While the technical data can be obtained, an analysis on how grantees distributed the received funds would need to be made on a case-to-case basis.</p>\n<p>On another note, reading and writing estimates used in the analysis will improve as we acquire additional data from more participants, leading to more accurate effort calculations. Finally, another limiting factor is the time elapsed since the STIP and LTIPP execution and distribution of incentives. As user/engagement metrics rely on user behavior over time, the current data set needs more information to produce definitive conclusions. As with reading and writing estimates, accuracy will improve as more user behavior data is collected and incorporated into the analysis.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"stip-analysis-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stip-analysis-6\"></a>STIP Analysis</h1>\n<p>We used a multi-pronged approach to gain a holistic overview of STIP’s effectiveness. Firstly, we gauged its impact on top-line network metrics through a Causal Impact Analysis. However, we do note that, given the dynamic nature of the space, there is likely unaccounted variance.</p>\n<p>Next, we set out to identify the type of users attracted by the program while attempting to put a price on each user engaged. In addition to tracking user acquisition, we also sought to track their permanence in the network to evaluate the program’s ability to retain users. While the nature of pseudo-anonymity on blockchains makes this a challenging feat, we attempted to track users’ transactions and identify changes before and after STIP. With this data, we produced basic user statistics akin to active users and churn rates.</p>\n<p>Finally, we analyzed the impact of STIP in terms of how much overhead or effort went into the program execution from a community point of view (opportunity cost), and how it compared to LTIPP, which featured a different application and feedback design. More details on this can be found in the section about the LTIPP vs. STIP comparison.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"causal-impact-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#causal-impact-7\"></a>Causal Impact</h2>\n<p>Using Causal Impact Analysis, it is evident that STIP had a significant relative impact on the following top-line network metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total Transactions: 24% increase</li>\n<li>Unique Users: 29% increase</li>\n<li>Total Value Transacted 47% increase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To put this into perspective, ARB airdrop’s relative impact on the same metrics went as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total Transactions: 42% increase</li>\n<li>Unique Users: 85% increase</li>\n<li>Total Value Transacted: 32% increase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we see that the ARB airdrop seems to have produced larger effects by all metrics, we have to take into consideration the price and effort connected to it. STIP had a cost 50M ARB tokens (±40M USD, at a price at the time of voting of ~0.8 USD), whereas the ARB airdrop totaled 1.275B ARB tokens (±1.72B USD). Of course, the goal of the airdrop was not solely to drive the metrics mentioned above. Nevertheless, we can see that in perspective STIP has been very efficient in using the funds.</p>\n<p>To gauge STIP’s impact, we used the time when 75% of proposals had been approved. This is to factor in the delayed response to the incentive being paid out and to find a pessimistic starting point for the effects of STIP being felt in top-level metrics. To gauge the ARB airdrop, we used the exact moment in time when the airdrop was executed.</p>\n<p>Causal Impact analysis takes the period before the event, referred to as “Pre-period”, and the period after the event referred to as “Post-period”. It then compares the change in a metric to a model predicting the most likely trend in the data, if no event would have occurred. The relative difference between the actual found value and the predicted value indicates the impact of the event.</p>\n<p>In a dynamic environment like the Arbitrum ecosystem, these outcomes serve more as an indicator than as a specific value to be derived. They can help put events in perspective but should not be seen as ground truth about the impact of events, as it is impossible to account for all external circumstances from general market sentiment to social trends influencing users around the globe.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e4cf941da8a2a7de04b2bb95f4c68e124d17589d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wE9B5UUiEvnrOQ9NpVViMQpBSsl.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e4cf941da8a2a7de04b2bb95f4c68e124d17589d_2_624x403.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"wE9B5UUiEvnrOQ9NpVViMQpBSsl\" width=\"624\" height=\"403\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e4cf941da8a2a7de04b2bb95f4c68e124d17589d_2_624x403.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e4cf941da8a2a7de04b2bb95f4c68e124d17589d_2_936x604.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e4cf941da8a2a7de04b2bb95f4c68e124d17589d_2_1248x806.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"162128\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Fig. 1 - Impact Analysis - Total Transactions</em><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/15f10f4c5afdaceb11ddb8c0f4e303895b2164a8.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/386uGTHLdGofk1M8BPmmw9GjREY.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/15f10f4c5afdaceb11ddb8c0f4e303895b2164a8_2_627x405.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"386uGTHLdGofk1M8BPmmw9GjREY\" width=\"627\" height=\"405\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/15f10f4c5afdaceb11ddb8c0f4e303895b2164a8_2_627x405.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/15f10f4c5afdaceb11ddb8c0f4e303895b2164a8_2_940x607.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/15f10f4c5afdaceb11ddb8c0f4e303895b2164a8_2_1254x810.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"162028\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Fig. 2 - Impact Analysis - Total Value Transacted</em><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-655x422uploadp5wbpwybalbmxupsih4strqgovqjpeg-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-655x422uploadp5wbpwybalbmxupsih4strqgovqjpeg-8\"></a><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/afd610cd0eea4d6693f565ae53d6c97fc8ef1c98.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/p5wbPwyBalBMxupSIH4sTrQGoVq.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/afd610cd0eea4d6693f565ae53d6c97fc8ef1c98_2_655x422.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"p5wbPwyBalBMxupSIH4sTrQGoVq\" width=\"655\" height=\"422\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/afd610cd0eea4d6693f565ae53d6c97fc8ef1c98_2_655x422.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/afd610cd0eea4d6693f565ae53d6c97fc8ef1c98_2_982x633.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/afd610cd0eea4d6693f565ae53d6c97fc8ef1c98_2_1310x844.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"172128\"></a></div></h3>\n<p><em>Fig. 3 - Impact Analysis - Unique Users</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"user-acquisition-vs-churn-in-stip-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#user-acquisition-vs-churn-in-stip-9\"></a>User Acquisition vs. Churn in STIP</h2>\n<p>The graph below (Figure 4) illustrates users who participated in STIP, displaying wallet creation events and the inactivity that followed.

However, data suggests that the program may have been ineffective in retaining new users after the incentive distribution had ended.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that these analyses become less accurate as we get closer to the present date.

The exact definitions for each category can be found in the Ouroboros post linked before.</p>\n<p>To gauge effort, we used engagement metrics on the messages to estimate how many people have read a post and determine the effort, measured in hours, based on metadata like length and complexity of language. To give a brief explanation, we try to estimate the reading and writing effort of a post as a function of word length and the quality/complexity of the post. This means the effort is in simple terms (the amount of people we estimate reading it) multiplied by (word count * average reading speed) multiplied by (the complexity of the language). Added to that is our estimation of the write effort, roughly expressed as (word count) multiplied by (writing speed) multiplied by (constant dependent on language complexity) plus (overhead factor for writing the post).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Est. Reading Effort ~ Est. Readers(Word Count Est. Avg.Reading Speed)</em></p>\n<p><em>Est.Writing Effort ~ Word Count Writing SpeedLang Complexity+Writing Overhead</em></p>\n<p><em>Est.Total Effort ~ Est. Reading Effort +Est.Writing Effort</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, it is important to note that, in terms of writing, an estimation can differ wildly as a well-thought-out message may take a multitude of time to write from a short comment, and factors such as the Writing Overhead and the Language Complexity might require adjustments.</p>\n<p>To determine the value (high vs. low) of the Effort invested, we utilized LLMs to extract and identify the most common topics. Then, based on these topic clusters, we labeled all forum posts (excluding the original application post), highlighting those that were deemed High Value, meaning they contributed useful critiques of the proposal. The exact definitions for each category can be found in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stip-vs-ltipp-comparison-statistics-27\">Posts/Discord Messages Category Definition</a> section in the appendix.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"comparison-to-ltipp-analysis-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#comparison-to-ltipp-analysis-13\"></a>Comparison to LTIPP Analysis</h2>\n<p>Lastly, our goal was to compare STIP and LTIPP in terms of governance operations.

This was achieved via feedback on a Discord <a href=\"https://discord.gg/nUe7QpYCB2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">server</a>. We analyzed messages from the Discourse forum (STIP and LTIPP) and relevant Discord channels within the LTIPP dedicated server to gain better insights on the changes introduced to the process.</p>\n<p>Then we utilized the previously mentioned effort calculation and high-low value categorization to understand the nuances of the feedback discussions taking place during the application process.

STIP successfully increased top-line network activity metrics. Although these impacts were lower compared to other initiatives, STIP proved to be cost-effective. However, retaining users remains a challenge, with activity levels returning to pre-STIP figures. STIP primarily attracted ‘Traders’, with acquisition costs at approximately 29 ARB per user.</p>\n<p>Applicant distribution was heavily skewed towards Yield Aggregators and DEXs, and community effort was concentrated in only a handful of applicants. LTIPP’s advisor role and the council system introduced improvements, resulting in higher-quality feedback and reduced community effort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"recommendations-and-final-thoughts-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recommendations-and-final-thoughts-15\"></a>Recommendations and Final Thoughts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Retention Strategies: Future initiatives should pay special attention to incorporating mechanisms that sustain user engagement beyond initial incentives.</li>\n<li>Experiment with Different Audiences: By continuing to experiment with incentive designs that focus on other user segments, opportunities to optimize acquisition costs should become evident.</li>\n<li>Continuous Improvement: Use empirical data for iterative improvements and adopt successful elements from LTIPP’s advisor role and the council system into future program designs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>StableLab is dedicated to continuing to provide accurate analyses to support the Arbitrum community.

It may also express concern over the timeline of the proposed grant distribution, over whether the address is a 2/3 multisig, or whether the community support on the forums is authentic or generated by bots.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Size:</strong> The post expresses concern that the amount of ARB tokens that the applicant asked for is too large, especially if the applicant is a non-native protocol. Often the grant size is considered too high relative to the applicant protocol’s TVL, volume, and the perceived value of the applicant’s contributions to the ARB Ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Effectiveness:</strong> The post expresses concern that the proposed incentive mechanisms will not effectively attract and retain the targeted users; however, this does NOT include existing or previous incentive programs that the applicant already has. Furthermore, the users will likely dump the received ARB tokens instead of continuing to participate in the applicant’s protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Applicant Quality:</strong> The post expresses concern about the applicant protocol’s quality. Quality refers to the capital efficiency of the applicant’s product, whether the applicant’s user engagement, trading activity, or TVL is genuine or due to previous or ongoing incentives, the competency of the applicant team, the applicant’s track record on Arbitrum (and other Networks), the maturity of the applicant’s product, the uniqueness or innovation of the applicant’s product, whether applicant’s product has launched or is operational, the applicant product’s TVL, volume, or demand may be too low, or the applicant engaged in wash-trading.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefit to Arbitrum:</strong> The post expresses concern that the grant will be used to mostly benefit the applicant’s protocol, instead of bringing new users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, or expanding the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"support-categories-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#support-categories-20\"></a>Support Categories</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Applicant Quality:</strong> The post expresses praise about the applicant protocol’s quality, which includes but is not limited to mentions of the protocol’s efficiency, the team’s capability, track record in the Arbitrum ecosystem (and other Networks), transparency and honesty.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefit to Arbitrum:</strong> The post expresses confirmation that the application will benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem at large, not just the applicant’s own protocol. Benefits could include, but are not limited to, mentions of flywheel and attracting other protocols to build on Arbitrum or on the applicant’s protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Effectiveness:</strong> The post expresses praise that the proposed incentive mechanisms will effectively attract and retain the targeted users. Furthermore, the users will likely continue to participate in the applicant’s protocol instead of dumping the ARB token.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"value-determination-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#value-determination-21\"></a>Value Determination</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"high-value-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#high-value-22\"></a>High Value</h4>\n<p>High-value contributions include posts that provide significant insights or constructive criticism.

The criteria for low-value posts are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General comments that do not provide substantial feedback or detailed insights.</li>\n<li>Repetitive or redundant comments that do not

It covers operational research and the deployment of a transparency dashboard to improve incentive data accessibility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/953780107\">ArbGrants Dashboard Concept</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is <em>Powerhouse</em>?</strong><br>\n<em>Powerhouse</em> began as MakerDAO Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES) Core Unit in the MakerDAO supporting the incubator program and building the operational infrastructure of one of the largest DAO experiments to date. As SES, <em>Powerhouse</em> team members helped teams to organize operations and connect them with relevant service providers. We learned a lot during the two years of operating this incubator and are now working at translating our best practices into open-source software for DAOs.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Powerhouse</em> Builds Open-source Operations Platforms</strong><br>\nWe translate business workflows, processes, and information systems into software to power large on-chain organizations. <em>Powerhouse</em> retains a full stack operations staff and technical staff, including Business Development, Business Analysts, Marketing, and a Full Stack Software Development team. <em>Powerhouse</em> focuses on modular open source systems as public goods. This modular approach reduces implementation time and accelerates the growth of DAOs. The objective of <em>Powerhouse</em> is to help DAOs scale by overcoming coordination failure.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Powerhouse</em> Uses Embedded Project Teams</strong><br>\n<em>Powerhouse</em> retains a complete project team to fulfill the proposed Research Bounty scope. The team will manage and implement the SOW described below: the workflow analysis in Milestone 1 and the delivery of a transparency dashboard in Milestone 2.<br>\nThe workflow analysis will review and map the current LTIPP workflows with recommendations for improvement. Independent of this analysis, the grant also delivers a transparency dashboard to permit easy access to LTIPP incentive data.</p>\n<p><strong>LTIPP and STIP are Complex</strong></p>\n<p>STIP and LTIPP are ambitious initiatives designed to rapidly increase the adoption of Arbitrum through liquidity incentives. The LTIPP strategy involves a broad distribution of ARB tokens within a short period. Due to the large scale and complexity of this distribution, stringent operational practices are necessary to ensure the program’s success.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Powerhouse</em> Software as the Solution</strong></p>\n<p><em>Powerhouse</em> provides several software products that together form the <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/products\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>Powerhouse</em> Platform</a>. Teams begin by using software to structure and implement their operational workflows (<em><strong>Powerhouse Connect</strong></em>). These workflows capture data which provides the information to an analytics backend enabling data availability (<em><strong>Powerhouse Switchboard</strong></em>) which is presented and interacted with publicly via a dashboard (<em><strong>Powerhouse Fusion</strong></em>). Access and roles in workflows are managed using Ethereum addresses on Arbitrum to provide identity and authentication (<em><strong><em>Powerhouse</em> Renown)</strong></em>. All <em>Powerhouse</em> Software modules are open-source to build on and extend the public commons. For more information regarding each product, please see a recent keynote <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5GnRqdoXt8o?si=TkjzKJvjTqPAoNUe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>, with <em>Powerhouse</em> Product Lead, callmeT.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1e77bcabb89475c53785b8217e85ccd26547773d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/4lwRhHfLivrPofFnpOQ9s8NiHeJ.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1e77bcabb89475c53785b8217e85ccd26547773d_2_624x349.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"4lwRhHfLivrPofFnpOQ9s8NiHeJ\" width=\"624\" height=\"349\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1e77bcabb89475c53785b8217e85ccd26547773d_2_624x349.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1e77bcabb89475c53785b8217e85ccd26547773d_2_936x523.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1e77bcabb89475c53785b8217e85ccd26547773d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"2A3339\"></a></div><br>\n<strong>Figure 1.</strong> An Overview of the Four <em>Powerhouse</em> Products<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://arbgrants.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbGrants.com</a>: <strong>Live Operational Software for Arbitrum LTIPP</strong></p>\n<p><em>Powerhouse</em> partnered with <em>Stablelab</em> to prepare a software proof of concept. First, we performed a requirements analysis and examined the current critical path blockers for Arbitrum LTIPP and STIP Program Management. We identified the largest pain point was organizing ongoing incentive reporting. <em>Powerhouse</em> then designed an ideal workflow and reviewed the proposed user experience with the Grants Council and Program Manager. The workflow was intended to replace the current incentive reporting workflow on the Arbirtum Discourse Forums.</p>\n<p><em>Powerhouse</em> then developed and implemented this reporting workflow as an open source software module. The module is currently hosted at <a href=\"https://www.arbgrants.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.arbgrants.com</a> and supports the reporting and organization of bi-weekly incentive information. This workflow makes accessible information for use by the LTIPP Program Manager, the Grants Council, Incented Projects, and the community at large.</p>\n<p>The software captures information that was previously hard to consolidate. It offers the 100 protocols a reliable and standardized way to report their biweekly metrics. At a later point in time, <em>Powerhouse</em> may prepare a proposal to provide Arbitrum an option for retroactive funding if they desire.</p>\n<p>Today, in this proposal, we present an opportunity to continue the momentum and extend this work through further business analysis and a transparency dashboard to improve presentation and accessibility of this LTIPP incentive data.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Step: Visualizing Incentive Data and Preparation for Full LTIP</strong><br>\nNow that we have a workflow to report data, the next step is to prepare a custom dashboard to make this data accessible. Using <em><strong>Connect</strong></em>, <em><strong>Fusion</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Switchboard</strong></em>, we will prepare a dashboard to report relevant metrics. Attached below are two example screenshots of a grantee directory and dashboard. This first scope of work establishes a dashboard to view LTIPP information reported and will be forward compatible with additional <em><strong>Connect</strong></em> data streams should Arbitrum desire.</p>\n<p>In order to prepare Arbitrum for LTIP, we will proceed in parallel with a deeper workflow and business analysis on the existing STIP and LTIPP program implementations. Through this analysis, we intend to map existing workflows and identify opportunities to leverage software to improve program efficiency and transparency.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/81b4159dc316da3aaffa4bbfc363eeeef43a3acd.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ivpqdjmVNyEMo0xgQEO6lc795Ex.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81b4159dc316da3aaffa4bbfc363eeeef43a3acd_2_530x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ivpqdjmVNyEMo0xgQEO6lc795Ex\" width=\"530\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81b4159dc316da3aaffa4bbfc363eeeef43a3acd_2_530x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81b4159dc316da3aaffa4bbfc363eeeef43a3acd_2_795x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81b4159dc316da3aaffa4bbfc363eeeef43a3acd_2_1060x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F9F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> An example of the LTIPP grantee directory.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/18fbd20ecf943692235d0ac10d2a6b1b71c18c27.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3z0YTZ5dwEhVoTXctHLqLfHJhrN.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18fbd20ecf943692235d0ac10d2a6b1b71c18c27_2_429x499.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"3z0YTZ5dwEhVoTXctHLqLfHJhrN\" width=\"429\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18fbd20ecf943692235d0ac10d2a6b1b71c18c27_2_429x499.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18fbd20ecf943692235d0ac10d2a6b1b71c18c27_2_643x748.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18fbd20ecf943692235d0ac10d2a6b1b71c18c27_2_858x998.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF3F7\"></a></div><br>\n<strong>Figure 3.</strong> An example of the LTIPP Overview Dashboard.<p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"statement-of-work-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#statement-of-work-2\"></a><strong>Statement of Work</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Term</strong></p>\n<p>The statement of work is anticipated to span approximately 12 weeks from June 10 to September 10. Both Milestones will run concurrently and conclude no later than 12 weeks from initiation. <em>Powerhouse</em> will meet weekly with the LTIPP Program Manager, who will act as the Arbitrum interlocutor, to provide status updates and report progress.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Milestone 1.</strong> STIP/LTIPP Workflow Business Analysis and Report</strong></p>\n<p>Milestone 1 prepares a workflow analysis to map and describe the current LTIPP process, identifying areas for improvement. The scope of the report will include an analysis of the following phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RFP preparation and presentation;</li>\n<li>Proposal Creation, Submission, and Review;</li>\n<li>Project (Grantee) onboarding; incentive reporting;</li>\n<li>and Performance Reporting and Evaluation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The focus will be to identify opportunities to improve existing processes, with the express goal of later translating these processes into scalable open-source software modules. The process will include planning and qualitative interviews with key stakeholders (e.g. Program Manager, Grants Council Members, and Grantees). This workflow analysis and research will help Arbitrum establish a calibrated operational budget for the full scale LTIP to support both the requisite operations as well as the necessary software to facilitate scaling and transparency.</p>\n<p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p>\n<p><em>1.1</em> Project Roadmap and Gannt. <em>Powerhouse</em> scopes the high level research phases in collaboration with key stakeholders and prepares a project roadmap.</p>\n<p><em>1.2</em> Qualitative Stakeholder Interviews. <em>Powerhouse</em> will identify key stakeholders and perform qualitative interviews in order to identify outstanding issues and potential remedies.</p>\n<p><em>1.3</em> Final Report. <em>Powerhouse</em> delivers a final report which includes a visual mapping of existing workflows and stakeholder actions, a review of identified issues, and proposed technical solutions and improvements where available.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2. LTIPP Transparency Dashboard</strong></p>\n<p>Milestone 2 supports LTIPP transparency through an informational dashboard. The project involves connecting the information provided from the grant reporting workflow into a software product for use by key stakeholders and the community. The dashboard will display all data captured by ARBgrants, including the biweekly ARB distributed, each incentivized contract, and the total ARB distributed. It will feature graphs plotting ARB distribution against each two week incentive term. The dashboard will dynamically update as incented projects submit new data allowing for near real-time display.</p>\n<p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p>\n<p><em>2.1</em> Project Roadmap and Gannt. <em>Powerhouse</em> scopes the high level grant phases in collaboration with key stakeholders and delivers a project roadmap.</p>\n<p><em>2.2</em> Qualitative Stakeholder Interviews. <em>Powerhouse</em> performs qualitative interviews in order to identify requirements and stakeholder preferences for dashboard metrics and UX.</p>\n<p><em>2.3</em> Dashboard Development. <em>Powerhouse</em> develops the required dashboard frontend to connect to the existing backend for <a href=\"http://arbgrants.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">arbgrants.com</a> and the Switchboard API.

The initial section of this report delves into all pertinent aspects of Silo Finance’s functionality, providing necessary context and reference.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, detailed analyses of efficiency and risk are conducted, leveraging insights from the protocol deep-dive. This examination aims to identify all factors that could potentially lead to negative outcomes. The findings are then used to derive both positive and negative insights from Silo Finance’s STIP allocation, which will inform the design of future incentive schemes.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive Amount:</strong> 1m ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive Uses:</strong> Incentivize borrowing and lending in existing and new markets, subject to the existence of a robust oracle.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Matching:</strong> Yes -  The equivalent of 1M $ARB in $SILO tokens as part of the Silo V2 launch (pending DAO’s approval). The DAO plans to launch Silo V2 on Arbitrum before any other chains.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"silo-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#silo-overview-3\"></a>Silo Overview</h1>\n<p>Silo is a risk-isolated lending market that allows users to deposit tokens to earn interest or as collateral to borrow other tokens.</p>\n<p>Silo is actually composed of multiple individual lending markets consisting of a base asset and the bridge asset(s).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overview-4\"></a>Overview</h2>\n<p>Silo is a risk-isolated lending market that allows users to deposit tokens to earn interest or as collateral to borrow other tokens.</p>\n<p>Silo assets are separated into bridge assets, which are common to all pools, and base assets, which are unique to each pool.  Bridge assets on the Arbitrum deployment are currently only USDC.e and WETH.  This design ring-fences the risk of each pool, allowing a wider range of assets to be onboarded than more common single pool protocols.  Any markets with willing-lenders, such as Curve LP tokens and Pendle PT tokens, can be created.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"base-and-bridge-assets-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#base-and-bridge-assets-5\"></a>Base and Bridge Assets</h3>\n<p>Silo categorizes assets as either bridge or base assets. Bridge assets are defined assets per deployment useable as collateral in any silo, while base assets are any asset other than bridge assets.</p>\n<p>Bridge assets refer to predefined assets that may be used as collateral or deposited into any silo in a deployment.</p>\n<p>Bridge Asset deposits are only exposed to the silo they are deposited into. For example, if $USDC is deposited into the $ARB silo, its exposure is limited to $ARB (the base asset) and $ETH (the secondary bridge asset) only. An exploit in the $PENDLE silo will not affect $USDC deposits in the $ARB silo since they are standalone markets.</p>\n<p>Bridge Asset deposit rates are derived from the IRM configuration for that specific silo. More aggressive models may be applied to riskier silos (e.g., low on-chain liquidity), allowing counterparty lenders to receive more interest to reflect risk exposure.</p>\n<p>Base assets refer to any non-bridge asset that has a lending market on Silo. Base assets can theoretically be any token, including standard and esoteric tokens.</p>\n<p>Base assets can only be used as collateral in their own market. For example, $ARB can only be used as collateral to borrow from bridge lenders in the $ARB silo - it cannot be used in the $PENDLE silo, which only accepts $PENDLE as base asset collateral.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"markets-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#markets-6\"></a>Markets</h3>\n<p>Each market on Silo Arbitrum consists of the base asset, which defines the market, and the two bridge assets, USDC.e and WETH.

Occasionally, there is demand to borrow base assets for purposes like shorting, hedging, or yield arbitrage, which generates yield for lenders. GMX, PENDLE, RDNT, LUSD, and weETH were generally the base tokens that generated the most yield.</p>\n<p>Users depositing tokens as collateral usually deposit base tokens and borrow either USDC.e to leverage their exposure to the base token price or borrow WETH to leverage their exposure to the token’s yield.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"impact-on-total-bridged-asset-lending-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#impact-on-total-bridged-asset-lending-16\"></a>Impact on Total Bridged Asset Lending</h3>\n<p>The launch of STIP rewards was transformative for Silo Finance in attractive lending capital.  USDC.e deposits received most of the incentives, but over time, as Pendle PT markets and LRT markets launched, WETH deposits overtook them in total value supplied.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the STIP program, total bridged assets supplied increased 332% from $13m to $56m.  The total dollar amount of this growth was relatively evenly split between USDC.e and WETH; however, when measured in percentage terms, the growth of WETH is much higher at 581% vs 229% for USDC.e.</p>\n<p>Since the end of the STIP program, USDC.e deposits have fallen 46% from $30m to $16m.  This highlights how sensitive USDC.e suppliers are to incremental yield.  The conclusion of the STIP program also coincided with a general spike in stablecoin yields across DeFi which could have cannibalized some of Silo’s yield-earning suppliers.</p>\n<p>WETH deposits, however, have continued to grow, increasing a further 36% since the program ended.  The favorable environment of yield and airdrop farming of LRTs via looped lending on Silo directly and through Pendle PT tokens has supported this growth.  The successful bootstrapping of these markets on Silo over the STIP has worked out favorably for Silo and Arbitrum DeFi generally, as leverage seekers have a deep, liquid venue for their strategies.</p>\n<p>Currently USDC.e supplies are up 76% since the start of the STIP program, and WETH supplies up 825%.  This leaves bridged asset supplies up 3x, a similar level to the end of the program.  <strong>This clearly demonstrates a significant, lasting impact from the use of incentives in growing bridged asset lending.</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/p3a3N7Ifdpvg8Tb8qbJ00L5rdaC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Silo Arbitrum Bridged Asset Deposits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e_2_574x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Silo Arbitrum Bridged Asset Deposits\" data-base62-sha1=\"p3a3N7Ifdpvg8Tb8qbJ00L5rdaC\" width=\"574\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e_2_574x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e_2_861x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"272D2E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/n25CiGkzy9PHXikSZh0LaaocNRD.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Share of Bridge Assets Supplied on Silo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1_2_574x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Share of Bridge Assets Supplied on Silo\" data-base62-sha1=\"n25CiGkzy9PHXikSZh0LaaocNRD\" width=\"574\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1_2_574x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1_2_861x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"374E5A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"bridged-asset-borrower-reactions-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#bridged-asset-borrower-reactions-17\"></a>Bridged Asset Borrower Reactions</h2>\n<p>As the supply of bridged assets flowed to Silo at the start of the STIP, it was immediately lent out.

This is  especially true when large competitors like Aave received no incentives so would have disproportionally benefited from the program ending, as is evident in all competing lending protocols.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a5a5949b9958b992bbe51b866f099e4910937ae8.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nDnxj1CsSpecIeZJebviYTlKLd6.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Silo Arbitrum Bridged Borrow Share (1)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a5a5949b9958b992bbe51b866f099e4910937ae8_2_574x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Silo Arbitrum Bridged Borrow Share (1)\" data-base62-sha1=\"nDnxj1CsSpecIeZJebviYTlKLd6\" width=\"574\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a5a5949b9958b992bbe51b866f099e4910937ae8_2_574x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a5a5949b9958b992bbe51b866f099e4910937ae8_2_861x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a5a5949b9958b992bbe51b866f099e4910937ae8.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"7B4D35\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0bd319d7cafe4109189fa447590915f1339b387d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1GBx6cHIbUY0cbDXq64zCI4xJxj.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Share of Arbitrum Lending Protocol Borrows\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0bd319d7cafe4109189fa447590915f1339b387d_2_574x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Share of Arbitrum Lending Protocol Borrows\" data-base62-sha1=\"1GBx6cHIbUY0cbDXq64zCI4xJxj\" width=\"574\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0bd319d7cafe4109189fa447590915f1339b387d_2_574x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0bd319d7cafe4109189fa447590915f1339b387d_2_861x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0bd319d7cafe4109189fa447590915f1339b387d.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"7B4A36\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"incentive-distribution-breakdown-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentive-distribution-breakdown-21\"></a>Incentive Distribution Breakdown</h2>\n<p>Silo rewards were distributed across 2421 wallets with limited concentration amongst the highest earners.

This effort paid off as early markets such as the WBTC market, with a large potential size and good elasticity with respect to incentives, grew rapidly, growing supplies and borrowing on the protocol.</p>\n<p>Another important trend Silo leant into was the rise of levereged restaking using Pendle and LRTs.  This accounted for a significant portion of growth, and directing incentives to these markets aggressively helped significantly.</p>\n<p><strong>Grew External Integrations</strong></p>\n<p>Silo announced many external integrations over the course of the STIP, broadening their funnel of value into the protocol.  The most successful of these, with Pendle, now makes up the two largest markets.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple Incentive Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>Incentives subsidized borrowing and lending where the Silo team determined they would be most impactful.  This resulted in easy to understand and optimize for incentive criteria, allowing a wide range of users to see benefits and onboard to Silo.</p>\n<p><strong>Horizontal Expansion by Launching New Markets</strong></p>\n<p>New markets drove significant growth on Silo, which continued after the STIP ended.  Twelve new markets were launched over the STIP, with 6 now in the top ten markets on the protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintaining Momentum with a Native Token Incentive Program</strong></p>\n<p>After the completion of the STIP, Silo launched a native incentive program to continue their momentum.  This has likely played an important role in the continued growth in activity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"silo-incentive-potential-improvements-29\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#silo-incentive-potential-improvements-29\"></a>Silo Incentive Potential Improvements</h2>\n<p><strong>Onboard and Incentivize Native USDC instead of Legacy Bridged USDC.e:</strong> Silo incentives focused on a legacy version of USDC, and there could be a future challenge migrating to native USDC.  This poses a long-term risk to the effectiveness of incentives targeted at USDC as TVL could migrate in the migration process, or it could cost significant future incentivization.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"silo-stip-useful-resources-30\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#silo-stip-useful-resources-30\"></a>Silo STIP Useful Resources</h1>\n<p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/silo-finance-final-stip-round-1/16640\">STIP Application</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oqcE3lnIfLq3icKThIu8IFtvf1ksPS5j5sxWtgD2TkE/edit#heading=h.wgyafa1g4w1j\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Grant Distribution Framework</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/silo-stip-program-updates/19596\">Weekly Update Thread</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-2-silo-finance/24752\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-2-silo-finance/24752","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Jun 2024 14:52:09 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24752"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-2-silo-finance/24752.rss","#text":"STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Case Study #2: Silo Finance"}},{"title":"STEP Committee Shortlist","dc:creator":"thedevanshmehta","category":"STEP Applications","description":"<p>We have some exciting news to start off June with: the STEP committee has gone through each application and come out with a first shortlist of 17 products that merit further analysis over the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>Without further ado, the shortlist comprises of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Backed (bIB01, bERNA, bZPR1)</li>\n<li>Centrifuge Anemoy LTF</li>\n<li>DigiFT DRUST</li>\n<li>Franklin FOBXX</li>\n<li>Fortunafi</li>\n<li>Gyroscope SGYD</li>\n<li>Hashnote</li>\n<li>LibreCapital (LUMA)</li>\n<li>Matrixdock STBT</li>\n<li>Midas</li>\n<li>Mountain USDM</li>\n<li>Ondo USDY</li>\n<li>OpenEden Tbill</li>\n<li>OpenTrade</li>\n<li>PV01 Capital Markets (TBL)</li>\n<li>Securitize (BUIDL)</li>\n<li>Superstate (USTB)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Congratulations to the providers making the shortlist.
