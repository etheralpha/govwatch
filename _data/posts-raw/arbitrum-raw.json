As an introductory proposal and a call for collaborators, we welcome feedback from delegates, analysts, protocols, Orbit chains, and the community.</em></p>\n<p><em>We’d also like to note that while this proposal is under development, it is designed to complement existing Arbitrum project incentive programs like STIP and LTIPP, as well as Foundation programs for Orbit partners. It is not intended to compete with or deter those programs, but rather bring new tooling, onchain innovation, and important marketplace dynamics to the Arbitrum Incentives ecosystem.</em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum Orbit Stimulus Pilot introduces an objective and metric-driven onchain incentives program designed to provide infrastructure and tokens to help grow Arbitrum’s Orbit chains.</p>\n<p>This proposal evolves protocol-driven incentives by leveraging composable, permissionless, and onchain infrastructure to facilitate decentralization, via third-party incentives managers, and streamlined operations, via onchain tooling.</p>\n<p>The proposal introduces a six-month and 9M ARB program to support user growth and retention on up to six Arbitrum Orbit chains. Orbit chains will be selected via an Arbitrum DAO council with a budget to both setup infrastructure and incentives to bootstrap their project. Each accepted chain is eligible to receive the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Up to 1M ARB for onchain user incentives (including performance fees for Incentive Managers, etc.)</li>\n<li>Up to 500k ARB budget for onchain infrastructure support (Including rpc, indexer, data, and incentives infrastructure).</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The ultimate motivation of this proposal is to simultaneously endow Arbitrum Orbit chains with long-term onchain infrastructure for sustainable growth while simultaneously offering an alternative model that improves upon existing incentives programs by addressing existing issues of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karelvuong/status/1749859056292942268?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bureaucracy</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0x_ultra\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">capture</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-now-a-pragmatic-approach-for-the-moment/15779\">inefficiencies</a>.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Orbit strategy represents “freedom”. By encouraging its Orbit partners to customize their L2/L3 chains with unprecedented flexibility, Arbitrum is well positioned to attract a diversity of use-cases, structures, and strategies to the ecosystem. As such, this proposal aims to establish growth support for every Orbit chain (defined as an Orbit L2 sharing sequencer revenue or an Orbit L3 built on Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova).</p>\n<p>We believe that validating the efficacy of onchain incentives infrastructure and performance-driven incentives will establish a foundation for long-term Orbit success. Equipped with robust tooling, Orbit chains, the DAO, and even third-parties (DEXs, onchain games, creators, etc.) can leverage the infra beyond the ARB granted from the program, either leveraging future grants, native tokens or digital assets, even when DAO incentives dry up.</p>\n<p>The proposal aims to address multiple issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Experience</strong>: By establishing a unified incentives funnel, it seeks to unify Orbit chain discovery into a cohesive user experience, addressing fragmented users and providing a scalable growth strategy for each protocol’s journey from an app to a chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Onchain Tooling</strong>: By replacing short-term programs with long-term tooling and infrastructure, Orbit chains will leave the Stimulus Pilot program with robust user data (CAC, segmentation analysis, growth metrics) and onchain relationships with their users, extending value beyond the status quo of continuous incentives via program extensions.</li>\n<li><strong>Objective-based Grants</strong>: By grounding Orbit growth in <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/learnings-from-stip-community-interview-summaries-and-notes/20916\">objective</a> metric-based <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353/14\">strategies</a> (i.e. <a href=\"https://journey.mantle.xyz/en/rewards\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.blast.io/airdrop/api\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blast</a>, <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/3tkU-Y5479JPw83I6jp7GTu_0_q-TWEKAXckm3XKl28\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism</a>) the DAO can align it’s impact with specific Orbit chain goals and objectives.</li>\n<li><strong>Evolving Onchain Incentives</strong>: As a pilot step toward the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-new-thesis-for-network-level-incentives-programs/20757\">direct-to-contract philosophy</a>, the Arbitrum Orbit Stimulus Pilot aims to realign DAO grants with blockchain principles: transparency, decentralization, and <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">automation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO has approved over 115M ARB worth of incentive grants on Arbitrum. Although these<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-new-thesis-for-network-level-incentives-programs/20757\"> project-based grants</a> spurred significant on-chain activity, they’ve been impeded by operational inefficiencies, unclear governance, and a lack of strategic direction. The absence of clearly defined success metrics has created a disconnect between <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353/27\">expectations and outcomes</a>. The DAO has largely been unable to define success, leading to misaligned expectations, grants, and results. Further, as Arbitrum chains grows, its user base becomes increasingly fragmented, leading to a disunified user experience and making it more difficult to explore complementary protocols and chains in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This fragmentation complicates interaction with complementary protocols and chains within the ecosystem. While previous incentives favor protocols with precedent and governance influence (existing dApps on Arbitrum), an increasing wave of partners and protocols require support for new challenges in launching Orbit chains. This proposal advocates for a technical collaboration to foster and validate efficient, decentralized, and forkable on-chain workflows, along with tooling that will last long beyond the incentives themselves.</p>\n<p>Concentrating on Arbitrum Orbit chains, this proposal aims to establish an adaptable, user-centric, and accountable bootstrapping framework. This initiative is designed to address unique challenges of L2 and L3 chains, offering innovative solutions that underline the proposal’s goal to exemplify its strategies within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"program-structure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-structure-4\"></a>Program Structure</h1>\n<p>The program is managed by three key roles: The Orbit Pilot Council, Orbit Grantees, and Incentive Managers.</p>\n<p>How incentive programs generally work</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1sHBBHz6XNS05mrgoypjlvPx6AX.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_539x427.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1sHBBHz6XNS05mrgoypjlvPx6AX\" width=\"539\" height=\"427\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_539x427.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_808x640.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_1078x854.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAF8F1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>How The Orbit Stimulus Pilot Works<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/brRK90SCwLy141pwQKHbPGbCMaV.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_494x402.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"brRK90SCwLy141pwQKHbPGbCMaV\" width=\"494\" height=\"402\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_494x402.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_741x603.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_988x804.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F1F6ED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Program Roles and Responsibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orbit Pilot Council</strong>: The Orbit Pilot Council is responsible for evaluating, approving, and validating both Orbit Grantee and Incentive Manager applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Orbit Grantees</strong>: These are the Orbit Chains receiving incentives. They work with eligible Incentive Managers to define key objectives, metrics, campaigns, and KPIs. Orbit Grantees are approved by the Orbit Pilot Council.</li>\n<li><strong>Incentive Managers</strong>: These are professionals or entities whitelisted by the Orbit Pilot Council to design and deploy incentive strategies tailored to Orbit chains’ unique needs.

The DAO holds ultimate responsibility and governance for the Council. The Council will comprise five individuals elected by the DAO in the Orbit Pilot Council election. At least one seat will be filled by an appointed representative from either the Arbitrum Foundation or Offchain Labs at the time of the proposal’s onchain vote.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"process-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#process-6\"></a>Process</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Election Stage</strong>: The DAO elects council members for the Orbit Pilot Council.</li>\n<li><strong>Application Stage</strong>: Incentive Managers and eligible Orbit Chains submit applications in their respective tracks.</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluation Stage</strong>: The Orbit Pilot Council reviews and approves up to six Orbit applications and whitelists eligible Incentives Managers.</li>\n<li><strong>Proposal Stage</strong>: Accepted Orbit Chains work with Incentive Managers to propose strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution Stage</strong>: Orbit Pilot Councils approve proposals, allowing Incentive Managers to deploy strategies. Once approved, grantees will be empowered to distribute incentives over a 6-month period, from the date upon which incentives are received. Over this period, Incentives Managers and Orbit Chains will design, execute, and deploy strategies over 1-month periods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"technical-implementation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#technical-implementation-7\"></a>Technical Implementation</h1>\n<p>The program leverages the Boost Protocol, a composable, permissionless, and on-chain infrastructure for deploying incentive strategies. Incentive Managers can use no-code onchain tools to incentivize specific onchain actions, with parameters like address whitelisting, action types, protocols, assets, reward sizes, and incentive lengths.</p>\n<p>The innovative approach outlined below leverages the Llama protocol alongside a sovereign governance model, integrating role-based solutions to streamline grant operations without compromising the core principles of flexibility and decentralization. This model employs a contract system to establish a primary account and define policyholders, utilizing soulbound ERC-721 tokens to enable permissioned responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this framework introduces a management platform and no code incentives deployment, facilitating the direct control of DAO over program goals while ensuring compensation and monetization for each side of the incentives marketplace. The subsequent sections will delve into the distribution mechanisms, data and measurement strategies, and the economic impact of these innovations, underpinning a governance model that not only enhances program management but also fosters accountability, transparency, and community engagement in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"onchain-program-management-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#onchain-program-management-8\"></a>Onchain Program Management</h3>\n<p>The Program employs a role-based solution using <a href=\"https://llama.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Llama</a> protocol contracts, streamlining grant operations while maintaining flexibility and decentralization. The contract establishes a primary account, with the ability to define policyholders. A policy is a soulbound ERC-721 granted to an EOA, enabling permissioned responsibilities to either create (mint) new policyholder NFTs or spend permissioned amounts from the Llama primary account. This structure allows for onchain program management, ensuring both security and the use of funds on the appropriate use cases.</p>\n<p>The following summary outlines a sovereign governance model that enables direct DAO control over program goals, objectives, budgets, and managers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orbit Program Account</strong>: An account managed by Policyholders. This account will receive the program budget (ARB) from the Arbitrum Treasury upon passage of the AIP. The program account will only be able to transfer ARB on the whitelisted deployment addresses (Boost Deployer Contract Address) OR in a clawback to the Arbitrum Treasury. The Orbit Pilot Council will be able to select a spend limit for each approved Orbit Program Account (one account per accepted grantee).</li>\n<li><strong>Incentive Managers</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orbit Pilot Council Policy</strong>: The Orbit Pilot Council Policy will be assigned to a specific budget within the Program Account to which the Orbit Pilot Council may assign Incentive Manager Policies for each program (Network Stimulus, User Adoption, and Incentive Sandbox).</li>\n<li><strong>Incentive Manager Policy</strong>: Incentive Managers will be permissioned to spend ARB from the Program Account.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>View the technical specifications of this onchain infrastructure here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Id3h-_ShUy_PV2Y7Bh5aSLW6oN2Q_hJ9OH67bJRGNdQ/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Orbit Incentives Technical Spec</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"no-code-incentives-deployment-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#no-code-incentives-deployment-9\"></a>No Code Incentives Deployment</h3>\n<p>To encourage both decentralization and streamline incentive deployment, Incentives Managers will leverage the <a href=\"https://manager.boost.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost Manager</a> toolkit. Manager is a “no code” tool to deploy incentives in a trustless manner. This interface provides access to Orbit chain plugins which allow them to incentivize specific actions (swaps, mints, etc.) and collaborate with the Orbit Chains to enact pre-determined strategies targeting areas like user adoption, liquidity management, or transaction volume.</p>\n<p>Built into the incentives deployment is a native fee structure, allowing a small portion of the incentives budget, and user claim fees, to provide compensation to both Boost creators, and user platforms, to help align each stakeholder in the incentive process.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/21869ed6aa469aaf4662fb89dcd5586819f5f168.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/4MAb88C89kzGrjdE1b6JArwLEO4.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/21869ed6aa469aaf4662fb89dcd5586819f5f168_2_241x259.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"4MAb88C89kzGrjdE1b6JArwLEO4\" width=\"241\" height=\"259\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/21869ed6aa469aaf4662fb89dcd5586819f5f168_2_241x259.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/21869ed6aa469aaf4662fb89dcd5586819f5f168_2_361x388.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/21869ed6aa469aaf4662fb89dcd5586819f5f168_2_482x518.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1A1D1D\"></a></div><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3a36e421e6342674c2cf31ec42add3c5703db5c4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8iZipJdA1OqxXNCidsLgM7xiR1i.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3a36e421e6342674c2cf31ec42add3c5703db5c4_2_197x262.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"8iZipJdA1OqxXNCidsLgM7xiR1i\" width=\"197\" height=\"262\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3a36e421e6342674c2cf31ec42add3c5703db5c4_2_197x262.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3a36e421e6342674c2cf31ec42add3c5703db5c4_2_295x393.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3a36e421e6342674c2cf31ec42add3c5703db5c4_2_394x524.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1C1E20\"></a></div><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/cb5ee3f13cc3da886052d782ec95977b577af812.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/t16e9nayQg1cphlzFeGdX9xAbAu.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cb5ee3f13cc3da886052d782ec95977b577af812_2_233x260.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"t16e9nayQg1cphlzFeGdX9xAbAu\" width=\"233\" height=\"260\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cb5ee3f13cc3da886052d782ec95977b577af812_2_233x260.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cb5ee3f13cc3da886052d782ec95977b577af812_2_349x390.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cb5ee3f13cc3da886052d782ec95977b577af812_2_466x520.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1D1D21\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"distribution-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#distribution-10\"></a>Distribution</h3>\n<p>Orbit chains instantly tap into a cohesive user experience facilitated by the <a href=\"https://docs.boost.xyz/boost-protocol/for-developers/boost-api\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost API</a>.

Despite strong efforts, the DAO has failed to agree upon concrete KPIs, while paying for reporting that, as a result, provides little actionable information. KPIs and accurately report them. To help solve this issue, this proposal provides financial support for both RPC and Indexer costs (if needed). Eligible chains will also receive integration with either Dune or Flipside, providing open data for the community and, therefore, accountability and performance.</p>\n<p>Leveraging native attribution, standardized claims, and the <a href=\"https://docs.boost.xyz/boost-protocol/for-developers/boost-api\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost API</a>, this proposal enables comparable analysis in real-time. As each Incentive Manager deploys strategies, The Orbit Pilot Council and Orbit Grantees have the ability to provide feedback on iterative campaigns. This means that each individual Boost strategy can be picked apart, compared, and incentive managers can conduct sophisticated methods such as A/B testing, targeted whitelisting, and iterative approaches.</p>\n<p>The goal is to collaborate with these entities to create comprehensive dashboards tailored to the specific objectives of each program. These dashboards will enable anyone to analyze, report, and evaluate the performance of various incentive strategies deployed by Incentive Managers. Since the underlying data is open-source, these dashboards can be modified, built upon, or critiqued by anyone in the community, fostering transparency and collaborative improvement.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"key-performance-indicators-kpis-and-data-driven-results-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-performance-indicators-kpis-and-data-driven-results-12\"></a>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Data Driven Results</h3>\n<p>Imperative to the proposal is the ability for each Orbit chain to be accountable to deliver reasonable and expected results. Thus, Incentives Managers, the Arbitrum Orbit Council, and Orbit Chains will work together to define and present key performance metrics to support their proposed strategies. The Council will be responsible for the approval of Orbit Chain KPIs and deployment objectives, while Incentive Managers and Orbit Chains will work together to design and implement strategies, iterating based on real-time results and campaign objectives.</p>\n<p>Depending on the chain, these metrics will be held as key indicators in each grant’s structure, holding both grantees and incentive managers accountable to performance. User KPIs will benefit from in-depth analyst guidance, including user segmentation, profiling, advanced targeting, and sybil-resistance (where necessary). Alternative KPIs can include number of transactions, mints, strategic asset volumes, bridging volume, etc., all depending on a chains specific business needs and objectives.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"program-economics-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-economics-13\"></a>Program Economics</h2>\n<p>Beyond its technical advantages, the Orbit Stimulus Program also features a built-in attribution that streamlines and powers a compensation structure to align each program stakeholder within the program itself. This allows earning opportunities for Incentive Managers, user frontends (through referrals), and further protocol development.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"incentive-managers-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentive-managers-14\"></a>Incentive Managers</h3>\n<p>The program’s success heavily relies on incentive managers, responsible for crafting and implementing strategies for Orbit grantees. To attract and compensate these managers, the program leverages Boost Protocol’s fee structures, allocating one-third of all protocol claim fees and 5% of all rewards to the managers (see fee structure below). This approach not only aligns the interests of the program and the incentive managers but also makes the role appealing to analysts and third parties, fostering competition for these positions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"frontend-clients-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#frontend-clients-15\"></a>Frontend Clients</h3>\n<p>Boost Studios will collaborate with the Arbitrum DAO to develop and launch an Arbitrum Inbox front-end, serving as a central point for user engagement. This platform will not only facilitate user discovery but also generate revenue through Boost Protocols’ fee mechanisms. By leveraging Boost Protocol’s attribution feature, frontend clients can access one-third of protocol claim fees and 2.5% of all rewards generated. This revenue-generation capability extends to the DAO and third-party frontend clients, including grantees, motivating them to integrate with the platform. This integration fosters a competitive environment among frontends, wallets, and dApps, all aiming to attract users to Orbit chain incentives.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protocol-maintenance-and-growth-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#protocol-maintenance-and-growth-16\"></a>Protocol Maintenance and Growth</h3>\n<p>Funds are directed to the <a href=\"https://app.llama.xyz/orgs/boost\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost Guild</a>, a group of Boost community members, to encourage innovation and activity on the Boost Protocol.

The DEF uniquely provides a dedicated voice for DAOs and DeFi in legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy efforts. You can find a summary of their past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US, below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>DeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.</p>\n<p>At this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.</p>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.</p>\n<p>Originally funded by Uniswap governance in 2021 with a one million UNI grant, DeFi Education Fund’s work is a public good that periodically requires funding to continue. This proposal would contribute funding to the organization so that it can expand its legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.</p>\n<p>The DeFi Education Fund’s work focuses on (further details below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Legal advocacy and litigation for DeFi, DAOs, and developers;</li>\n<li>Fighting regulatory overreach from the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, CFPB, IRS, et. al.;</li>\n<li>Advocating and lobbying for DeFi in Congress and at the state level;</li>\n<li>Educating elected representatives and traditional media about DeFi and its benefits; and</li>\n<li>Informing and serving the DeFi community about policy and regulatory developments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DEF is eager to continue leading the charge in the fight on behalf of DeFi. We can only do that with the backing of the DeFi community, which is why we will be initiating governance proposals for financial support from several DAOs. With the community’s support, we will</p>\n<ol>\n<li>super charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;</li>\n<li>expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;</li>\n<li>more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; and</li>\n<li>enhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"more-information-on-def-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#more-information-on-def-4\"></a>More Information on DEF</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/about\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Team</a>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/millercwl\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Miller Whitehouse-Levine</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amandatums\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Amanda Tuminelli</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbernstein6395\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Max Bernstein</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LazPieper\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lizandro Peiper</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://defieducationfund.substack.com/archive\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Weekly updates</a> on policy developments and activities</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTt5vI0P5MuBF2vq1UyhByKqmM6XbMp-twre8ahm_gs/edit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">12 Month Estimated Budget</a></li>\n<li>Historical financial <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/financial-information\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">information</a> (annual and monthly)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fund_defi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X</a></li>\n<li>Contact - Please reach out to discuss!\n<ul>\n<li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:miller@defieducationfund.org\">miller@defieducationfund.org</a></li>\n<li>Telegram: <span class=\"mention\">@millwl</span></li>\n<li>Twitter: <span class=\"mention\">@fund_defi</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#implementation-5\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<p>Upon passage, 500,000 ARB is to be transferred to and held in a <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x937561C09a3b19317958438489B4Bd0a8C986e45\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dedicated wallet</a> at Coinbase.

Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"faqs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#faqs-7\"></a>FAQs</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Why are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are seeking Arbitrum’s support now for three primary reasons.</p>\n<p>First, we need a sense of our longer term funding in order to take on the projects that our work focuses on, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will take a total of at least two years from start to finish. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting that challenge, we would not have been able to take that project on. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.</p>\n<p>Second, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States could cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects.</p>\n<p>Third, DeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Why are you asking Arbitrum for money and not other DAOs?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will definitely be passing around the hat! We seek Arbitrum’s support as a leading DAO that is building for the long term. The Uniswap DAO took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that other leading DAOs will contribute to funding our work going forward.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>When and how are you planning on selling tokens?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is important to us that the DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. We will hold half of any ARB tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will not sell any ARB tokens without pre-disclosing a sales plan in writing. For example, we received our initial grant from the Uniswap DAO in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18-month written <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/post/def-provides-update-on-our-funding\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sales plan</a>. We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"accomplishments-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#accomplishments-8\"></a>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h4>\n<p>Legal Advocacy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEC v. Kraken - In February 2024, we submitted an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_7c5fd096e8234f9bb66e4629d5f31b60.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> explaining the various incorrect and often inconsistent legal positions the SEC employs in its attempts to justify its position that digital asset transactions are securities transactions.</li>\n<li>Van Loon v. Treasury - In November 2023, we filed another <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_dc5e8345b3d34bd4af4d06663c12d413.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> related to the Tornado Cash sanctions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We argued that the use of privacy-protecting technology is normal and not inherently illicit and that Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) exceeded its statutory authority in issuing sanctions that included purely domestic transactions.</li>\n<li>Harper v. Internal Revenue Service - In October 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_492b137460ef4263aa43f3fcb946a1cd.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in a case involving a challenge to a “John Doe” summons the IRS sent to Coinbase that resulted in the collection of information (including information revealing on-chain wallet addresses) about 14,355 Americans (none of whom were accused of any wrongdoing prior to the summons) over a three-year period. Our brief explained the sweeping Fourth Amendment implications of indiscriminately collecting digital asset transaction information and how doing so is more revealing than in the context of TradFi.</li>\n<li>SEC v. Coinbase - In August 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_05b10d3583a647b08dd071727ab8b7f1.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in support of Coinbase. We explained how wallets and staking actually work and supported Coinbase’s arguments that it is not a broker through its wallet software, nor did it offer securities through its staking program.</li>\n<li>Coin Center v. Treasury - In June 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_aff0399d95324a94af6b5f6cd3e31b91.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in support of a challenge to OFAC’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment ag. In October 2022, Coin Center and several individuals sued Treasury, challenging OFAC’s designation of Tornado Cash smart contracts. The plaintiffs argued that doing so exceeded the Treasury’s authority, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the First Amendment. Our brief supported arguments that the sanctions were beyond the Treasury Department’s statutory authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act, made the point that Tornado Cash is an important privacy-protection tool, and argued that the sanctions designations made no sense when considering the realities of the technology at issue.</li>\n<li>Van Loon v. Treasury - In April 2023, we submitted our first <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_347cf86b54b540e9be5773f8560d62bc.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">brief</a> related to Treasury’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. In addition to Treasury’s lack of statutory basis for the actions, We argued that the downstream implications of sanctioning a software protocol will lead to not only a weakening of the digital asset industry, but will also seriously jeopardize law-abiding Americans’ financial privacy.</li>\n<li>CFTC v. Ooki DAO - In late 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) served Ooki DAO, alleging it is “illegally offering leveraged and margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets” without a Futures Commission Merchant designation or a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) program. The CFTC served “Ooki DAO” via a help chat box with a contemporaneous notice posted on a website purportedly affiliated with Ooki DAO. We filed a brief in the case explaining: “First, the Commission has named Ooki DAO as a defendant in this action, asserting that Ooki DAO is an “unincorporated association comprised of Ooki Token holders.” But nothing about the structure of a DAO inherently dictates that result. In many cases, DAOs lack any central organization or management, and many DAO token holders often lack coordination or common objectives. As a result, DAOs will often not be “associations” of any kind, and therefore will not be proper defendants in an enforcement action brought under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), which requires that a defendant be a “person” (defined to include “associations”). The Commission has not yet alleged facts sufficient to establish that Ooki DAO is an association, so its attempt to serve Ooki DAO here is premature.”</li>\n<li>Combatting crypto patent trolls: In September 2023, we took action to protect DeFi and crypto from invalid patent infringement claims. We filed a<a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_ed2f23226fbb4adaa53b86efa5d58f44.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> petition</a> with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to initiate an inter partes review and cancellation of all claims in a patent owned by True Return Systems LLC. TRS is a patent troll who first tried to sell the patent as an NFT, and when that didn’t work, sued both MakerDAO and Compound Protocol in federal court for alleged infringement of<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US10025797B1/en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> U.S. Patent No. 10,025,797</a>. Our petition argued that the technology that TRS purported to patent was not in fact TRS’s invention, but was instead very similar to oracle technology that had been in development and use for years prior to the patent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regulatory Advocacy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In January 2024, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_a5bb9050d8414cbab3f0285202464a29.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">urged</a> the Department of the Treasury to reconsider its proposed rule to classify crypto “mixing” transactions to be a “primary money laundering concern” subject to enhanced reporting requirements. Among the issues we commented on is the proposal’s all-encompassing definition of “mixing,” which would capture almost all crypto transactions and designate them to be “high risk.”</li>\n<li>In January 2024, we submitted <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_4bdb18a7e1b94bfea406dfbb0a0ffcc8.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our thoughts</a> on a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed rulemaking that could expand the CFPB’s supervisory authority to capture self-hosted wallets. We argued that the rulemaking should not move forward as it would further scramble the Federal government’s already-convoluted regulatory treatment of DeFi and crypto-related activities.</li>\n<li>In November 2023, we filed a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_40d4255857d142f2a1744be79f1dab3f.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">comment letter</a> regarding the Treasury Department’s proposed “broker” rulemaking. The proposed rule would introduce a brand new category of broker called a “digital asset middleman,” a new term that is essentially limitless in scope and creates brokers out of thin air in DeFi and, as we argue, runs contrary to the statute and legislative history. Furthermore, we argued that the proposal violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on warrantless searches and seizures of a person’s papers and effects because individuals do not voluntarily turn over their personal data to “digital asset middlemen” who themselves neither collect nor have any legitimate business reason to collect that information. For a plain language review of our issues with the rulemaking, read: “<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/11/15/congress-gets-the-runaround-from-regulators-again/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Congress Gets the Runaround From Regulators, Again</a>.”</li>\n<li>In October 2023, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_1dfebf33d77f40a0895314105ed47079.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to France’s Autorité de Marchés Financiers (AMF) concerning their DeFi regulatory discussion paper. Our comment letter addressed many topics including permissionless blockchain protocols, legal enforceability of smart contracts, off-chain elements, etc. Importantly, we addressed the legal liability of smart contract developers, arguing that smart contracts’ code is open-source for anyone to audit and make informed decisions. Furthermore, we argued that open-source code is a form of expression as it conveys ideas for societal change and demands protection. We also argued against the AMF’s proposal to create a government-run certification regime for smart contracts.</li>\n<li>In September 2023, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_94bb62e0bac1428585c944bc06884bd2.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to a request for comment from the Senate Finance Committee regarding the taxation of digital assets. In our submission, we recommended Congress: 1) Revise Section 6050I so that it does not “deputize recipients of digital assets to collect and report information about their payers;” 2) Do not tax staking rewards until a sale or other disposition; 3) Do not apply wash sale rules to taxpayers who utilize digital assets as a form of currency; and 4) explicitly extend the application of section 1058’s nonrecognition rule to “loans” of actively traded fungible tokens.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we submitted a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_e73f5656c9a047788521cf09259db7a4.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response </a>to a consultation from HM Revenue and Customs, the United Kingdom’s tax, payments, and customs authority, regarding “the taxation of DeFi involving the lending and staking of cryptoassets.” At a high-level, our submission noted that any changes to the tax regime that concern DeFi must: be flexible to account for future innovation; exhibit clarity and simplicity to promote compliance by minimizing the burden on taxpayers; and align with the underlying economic substance of a typical DeFi transaction.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we submitted a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_dbc796a8e44644539ffcd4722e1b442a.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response </a>to Banque of France’s Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) regarding their discussion paper: “Decentralised’ or ‘Disintermediated’ Finance: What Regulatory Response?” Our primary arguments included that ACPR should not directly regulate miners and validators by establishing standards for public blockchains; a policy that would “force centralization” would eliminate the core innovations of public blockchains; and a framework for smart contract certification would require centralization and the inappropriate regulation of speech.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we filed our <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_f997b07bbb6d43b8a3b6c0626f57cdf3.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">third comment letter</a> on the SEC’s proposed “exchange” rulemaking. Our brief made two primary arguments: first, the proposal improperly reads and misapplies the Exchange Act and exceeds the SEC’s statutory authority and mandate under the Act; and second, the SEC has flatly failed to comply with numerous procedural and statutory rulemaking requirements.</li>\n<li>In August 2022, the DEF filed a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khRThXkBfev9uTTtSlakcckfKjP1_8TT/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response</a> to the U.S. Treasury Department’s request for comment on innovation in digital assets. In our response, we explained how DeFi protocols have the potential to benefit consumers, investors, and businesses in the United States and around the world by creating accessible financial infrastructure usable by any individual with an internet connection.</li>\n<li>In June 2022, we <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y6_UbL2DBMvICeuhdENSGGWPJrZCBAWM/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to Abu Dhabi’s DeFi consultation, in which we expressed our view that decentralization and disintermediation serve important societal objectives and that forcing the reintroduction of intermediation via legal obligations is a misguided approach to DeFi that would undermine its core potential and innovation.</li>\n<li>In June 2022, In our second <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1inWXw7MSO8VjrbuPro8izeewgmRGNC9r/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">letter</a> on the SEC’s exchange rulemaking, we argued that the proposed rule represents an improperly static regulatory response to a dynamic innovation and therefore needs to be reconsidered in total.</li>\n<li>In May 2022, we <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GC4QPms1JxzrBr7sLDlSzoVVk3EcTsNP/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commented</a> on the SEC’s “dealer” rulemaking, which could not only subject large DeFi market participants to the threat of arbitrary SEC enforcement actions but also, potentially, capture liquidity pools themselves as so-called “dealers” under the securities laws. But how would it do so? In what way? The SEC did not say when it proposed the rule nor when it later finalized the rule in early 2024, which we expect to see challenged in court. .</li>\n<li>In April 2022, we submitted the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cjQIDH3VE9303k-r55lQFfn1v-tH5l0n/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">first</a> of three comment letters on the SEC’s “exchange” rulemaking, which would de facto ban DeFi protocols in the United States. We argued that the Proposal’s expanded definition of an “exchange” is so broad that it could be interpreted to cover DeFi market participants, yet the rule didn’t specify which or why—it didn’t even mention “crypto,” “DeFi,” or “digital assets” once. In January 2023 in response to these concerns, the SEC released 167 pages of additional information explaining that the proposal does apply to DeFi and crypto, which we also responded to.</li>\n<li>In April 2022, we submitted a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kaURtD9UIFBaB4mMkcZXRi15uGJ5d3dK/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">comment letter</a> to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on its proposed <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/oecd-seeks-input-on-new-tax-transparency-framework-for-crypto-assets-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.htm\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">framework</a> for tax reporting in the digital asset ecosystem. Broadly, when it comes to DeFi, the proposal fits squarely in the “how do we apply existing regulations and tactics to innovative systems” camp. This concept would force the creation of intermediaries where they do not exist for tax reporting purposes, a concept that the Treasury Department is now attempting to enshrine in the United States (see November 2023 comment letter on the IRS’s proposed “broker” rulemaking).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Legislative Advocacy</p>\n<p>The past year has yielded some fruit in the industry’s push for crypto-specific legislation, but legislation is still a few years out, in our view. In July, The House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) voted, with bipartisan support, to advance the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/20/us-house-republicans-introduce-crypto-oversight-bill-to-protect-investors/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act</a>, a bill that would create a regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S. That same month, the HFSC advanced a bill to establish a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4766/BILLS-118hr4766ih.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">federal regulatory regime</a> for stablecoins.</p>\n<p>More recently, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce passed the <a href=\"https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/H_R_Deploying_American_Blockchains_Act_Reps_Bucshon_and_Blunt_Rochester_e4ce972799.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Deploying American Blockchains Act</a> (by a 46-0 margin), which would direct the chief of the Department of Commerce “to promote the competitiveness of the United States related to the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology.” While these bills are not perfect, we’re pleased that Congress has taken a serious approach to these matters.</p>\n<p>There’s another factor that gives us hope for the long-term chances of good legislation passing both chambers. And that is the willingness of Congressional offices and policymakers to engage with DEF and learn about the foundational aspects of the technology. We do “DeFi Demos” on Capitol Hill and advocate for policies welcoming of DeFi and DAOs. We explain why we believe in DeFi and why government officials and elected representatives should be just as curious as we are as to how this technology can improve the lives of their constituents. Away from sensational media headlines and televised hearings, one can see that a better, more open future for DeFi is developing.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we’ve provided a perspective from DeFi’s corner on the following federal legislation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>H.R. 1122, CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act</li>\n<li>H.R. 1177/S. 427, Financial Freedom Act of 2023</li>\n<li>H.R. 1414.

All incentives were thoroughly analyzed to make sure there are no inefficiencies and gamification of the system. All incentives were emitted in the hands of organic traders without any riskless “farming”. Kickback rate of rewards was analyzed to be below fee + spread rate for all Thales Protocol products incentivized by ARB rewards.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There were 9,766 unique traders participating in Thales Arbitrum products during the STIP program. Average daily unique user count across Thales Protocol on Arbitrum during the entire 4 months is 206, with the final month of March 2024 culminating with &gt;500 unique daily users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Focused Events campaigns had a large impact on inviting new users to the Sports Markets product through interactive and fun isolated reward systems of lucrative ARB rewards for all targeted participants. These types of campaigns were not only impactful for overall growth metrics, but also for marketing and brand awareness. Because they were subsidized with ARB rewards, they were mostly exclusive to Arbitrum network deployments, which brought many new active users exclusively to the Arbitrum network deployments. A shining example is the March Madness campaign, where users could mint a Bracket NFT on Arbitrum to participate in the Bracket Competition while also having secondary rewards for all March Madness volume drivers. This campaign brought in ~ 4,000 unique volume drivers to Thales Sports Markets on Arbitrum and 430 Bracket NFTs minted accumulating approximately 20,000$ prize pool from mint cost.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\"

We ran a three-month (January-March 2024) hybrid blockchain development boot camp, featuring a hackathon, to onboard quality developers into the Arbitrum ecosystem. The program is divided into two tracks - front-end and back-end development.</p>\n<p>Front-end developers learned how to integrate the Arbitrum SDK into their applications and develop amazing web3 UI/UX. Back-end developers, on the other hand, focused on building scalable backends using Node.js and integrating Arbitrum. Participants in both tracks learned Solidity and Ether.js.</p>\n<p>The physical sessions were live-streamed and recorded, allowing participants to contribute in real-time and ensuring an all-round engagement. We believe these recorded classes will serve as resources for anyone interested in building on the Arbitrum chain in the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-milestones-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-milestones-3\"></a>Key Milestones</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>800 registrations</li>\n<li>164 preliminary selection</li>\n<li>100 participants</li>\n<li>43 completed the program</li>\n<li>6 Projects submitted for the hackathon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"program-goals-vs-achievements-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-goals-vs-achievements-4\"></a>Program Goals vs Achievements</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Goal</th>\n<th>Achievement</th>\n<th>Achieved?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Achieve 500 registrations for the program.</td>\n<td>Achieve 800 registrations for the program.</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Create engagement with 100 active participants the program.</td>\n<td>Achieved 100 participants</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Target an 80-90% completion rate among participants.</td>\n<td>Achieved 43% completion rate</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Render assistance to participants in launching a minimum of 10 projects on Arbitrum.</td>\n<td>Only 6 Projects deployed from the Hackthon</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provide live and recorded video sessions of every class within the program</td>\n<td>Achieved 100% video recording</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Receive anonymous feedback and ratings from participants.</td>\n<td>We collected anonymous feedback and ratings from participants.</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Create a program evaluation report 2-3 months after the program ends to analyse its long-term impact on the participants.</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sponsor/participate in pitching events for participants to onboard users into their projects.</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Generate media coverage through billboard advertisements and social media promotions, with an expected reach of 25,000 to 50,000 people.</td>\n<td>YouTube - 20,000+ impression</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Put together an end-of-program report to highlight achievements.</td>\n<td>Twitter - 15,773+ views</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Generate a comprehensive monthly report on training progress.</td>\n<td>We submitted monthly reports on Questbook, Arbitrum Forum and KarmaGap</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"projects-from-the-hackathon-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#projects-from-the-hackathon-5\"></a>Projects from the Hackathon</h2>\n<p>During the last week of the Bootcamp, a Twitter space was held on the 27th of February to announce the timeline of the Hackathon and explain the other Hackathon requirements to the participants. During this Twitter space, the judges for the Hackathon were introduced and asked to give useful tips for project development to the participants. The building and the submission period started from the 1st of March to the 23rd of March but was later extended due to a timezone error when setting up the hackathon on DoraHack. Individuals with strong affiliations and interests in the Arbitrum ecosystem were chosen as the hackathon judges. The Hackathon review started on March 24th, 2024, and ended on March 28th, 2024. They were able to review, grade, and give helpful comments on each of the Hackathon projects. The projects are outlined below:</p>\n<p><strong>1.

This number was narrowed down through a preliminary selection process to 164 candidates, culminating in a final selection of 100 candidates. Out of the 100 candidates selected, 54 opted for the front-end track, while 46 pursued the back-end development path within the program.</p>\n<p>We prioritized inclusivity, ensuring equal opportunities for both male and female candidates, and applying a balanced set of selection criteria uniformly across all participants.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f0f9716ef8a0b0e428e9457c0443a527e40166e0.png\" alt=\"image3\" data-base62-sha1=\"ynL1nEQqE3Yr1rRqVdif1o5OyEE\" width=\"421\" height=\"417\"></p>\n<p>Of the participants selected, 16 opted for onsite classes while the remaining 84 participants attended the classes virtually.</p>\n<p>Throughout the two months of boot camp, our goal was to maximize participant engagement, as evidenced by two key indicators: the rate of assignment submissions and attendance. We consistently aimed for high performance in these areas to gauge the program’s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>The rate of attendance reduced as the Bootcamp came to an end while the YouTube watch rate increased significantly. Two major factors contributed to participants not attending the live classes: school/work commitments and internet connectivity issues. We provided immediate solutions for each of these challenges.</p>\n<p>The attendance rates dropped in the second month compared to the first, due to learners’ inability to attend the live classes. This led to an increase in the amount of time spent watching our YouTube content and the impressions received on the channel. This trend highlighted learners’ preference for flexible learning options and also showed that external parties benefited from the program’s content.</p>\n<p><img

This goes as far back as 1990 when Phil Zimmerman released Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), one of the first openly available public-key cryptography applications that featured end-to-end (E2E) encryption. Zimmerman’s creation prompted a criminal investigation that was eventually dropped, resulting in federal court decisions that protect encryption under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. This clash on personal privacy became dubbed the “encryption wars.”</p>\n<p>Our team over at Axis Advisory has published a write-up that offers contextual information in relation to the above: <a href=\"https://axisadvisoryxyz.substack.com/p/defending-open-source-a-united-stand\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Defending Open Source: A United Stand for Developer Rights and Software Freedom</a></p>\n<p>In this regard, we are proposing a contribution from the ArbitrumDAO to CoinCenter to continue its policy &amp; litigation efforts in relation to privacy-enhancement tooling and software developer advocacy. Some of Coin Center’s most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Coin Center’s case against the Office of Foreign Assets Control about adding Tornado Cash to the OFAC Sanction List, (naturally, Tornado Cash not being a person or entity but a mere set of open-source smart contracts running on the Ethereum Blockchain).

In this regard, Coin Center highlighted the rule’s extensive scope and lack of precedent. They argued that the proposed designation lacks clarity and narrowly tailored definitions, potentially leading to the misclassification of legitimate transactions as criminal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>[Refer: <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/comments-to-the-financial-crimes-enforcement-network-on-proposal-of-special-measure-regarding-convertible-virtual-currency-mixing-as-a-class-of-transactions-of-primary-money-laundering-conce/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Comments to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on “Proposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing, as a Class of Transactions of Primary Money Laundering Concern”</a>]</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Coin Center’s letter to the Senate Finance Committee highlighing the need for a regulatory approach that mirrors the successful, light-touch framework applied to the internet.

The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately.</p>\n<p>Coin Center has been at the forefront of policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties of software developers and other stakeholders within the industry.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTRIBUTION TO COIN CENTER [A NOTE FROM THE ORGANIZATION]</strong></p>\n<p>Founded in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coin Center</a> is an independent non-profit organization focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies. Our mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code – to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately. We do this by producing and publishing policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and by engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties.</p>\n<p>We are presently litigating two cases against the U.S. government. One is on Section 6050I crypto tax reporting, <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-has-filed-a-court-challenge-against-the-treasury-dept-over-unconstitutional-financial-surveillance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">pushing back against expanded warrantless financial surveillance</a>. The other is a civil case <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-is-suing-ofac-over-its-tornado-cash-sanction/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">challenging the U.S. Treasury Department’s designation of immutable smart contracts</a>. We argue that the Treasury does not have the statutory authority to add the Tornado Cash pool contracts to the list of sanctioned persons because immutable smart contracts are neither sanctioned persons themselves nor the property of any sanctioned person. We are fighting not only for the right of U.S. persons to continue using these tools but also seeking to set an important precedent: that the Treasury Department can’t simply identify decentralized apps and add them to the sanctions list without any evidence that the app is controlled by or enriches any sanctioned person.</p>\n<p>We are also coordinating with Roman Storm’s legal defense on an amicus brief in his criminal defense. Our amicus focuses on accurately describing the operation of Tornado Cash and the role that developers play in creating decentralized apps like Tornado Cash. We argue that publishing decentralized app software, both to the blockchain and to web servers, is not the kind of activity that can give rise to prohibitions under U.S. sanctions laws because (a) U.S. sanctions laws exclude from prohibitions any transactions for information or information materials and (b) the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment protects publishing software as “pure speech” warranting the strictest scrutiny from our courts.</p>\n<p>Finally, we are <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/blog/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">continuously engaged</a> in education and lobbying efforts in Congress and the various federal agencies in the U.S. to ensure that any changes to financial surveillance law does not impinge the free speech, privacy, and assembly rights of developers and users.</p>\n<p>A grant to Coin Center will be used to support our ongoing work and to contribute to the legal defense of developers facing criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>\n<p>In conclusion, the contributions mentioned above are not just a matter of protecting individual rights but a testament to our collective commitment to preserving the principles of innovation, decentralization, and individual sovereignty within the industry.

This rationale can be posted either in the delegate’s communication thread (if they have one) or in the proposal’s discussion thread itself. To adhere to best practices, we recommend that delegates communicate their voting intention and rationale as soon as possible after casting their vote.</p>\n<p>Examples of rationale communication:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Rationale posted in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/13794/32\">delegate’s communication thread </a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rationale posted in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223/36\">proposal’s discussion thread </a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the voting process in the DAO, where voting typically first occurs on Snapshot and then on Tally, it’s understandable that delegates may keep the same voting stance in both stages. It’s reasonable for delegates not to issue a new rationale for the second stage if it was already provided during the first stage (Snapshot) and their position remains unchanged. <strong>In these cases, we simply expect delegates to indicate that they have maintained their vote based on the previously expressed rationale.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<h4><a name=\"orange_circle-commenting-in-proposals-7-cps-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#orange_circle-commenting-in-proposals-7-cps-6\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/orange_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":orange_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":orange_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Commenting in proposals (7 CPs)</h4>\n<p>It is important to clarify that for this parameter, only the number of Snapshots in the month is counted (11 in total for March), given that most of the debate is centered during the Snapshot period and not so much in tally.

This represents a big percentage of march’s Snapshot votings. This votations lacked the option ‘ABSTAIN’. So, some delegates expressed that they will not-cast their votes.</p>\n<p>One of these delegates was BlockworksResearch, expressing its concerns about this situation. After analyzing it, to solve this situation and prevent making changes on the karma dashboard that might be very complicated to executed, we decided to give an additional score as Bonus Points to those delegates that abstained to vote of the following 4 snapshots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x05e8fa22813e74fd6e5f3360fda4bb6388d0f85d4e6aef834acbb48451307b01\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC Research Member Election</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x9210912a0a77090d1407107dcb9143864aa6c1faa5c6ed9046b6a0a56bf6bbcc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC DAO Advocate Election</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3d41ffb43e44e83d004505e362e70f703aed0e740322e8ebfbb390d54724ca91\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC Security Member Election</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb04e968c2439cd68e429f722722944c960f82ce75d9f75efe8be52333e1d6554\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC Risk Member Election</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to mention that voting in all snapshots of the months represents the 15% of the final score that a delegate can get each month. In this particular month there were 11 snapshots voting in total.</p>\n<p>If we make basic math (Rule of Three) :</p>\n<p><strong>11 Snapshot</strong> --------------------- <strong>15 % of SV</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1 Snapshot</strong> --------------------- X = <strong>1,3636 of SV%</strong></p>\n<p>And, if we consider the <strong>4</strong> Snapshots mentioned above:</p>\n<p><strong>1,3636</strong> of SV% x <strong>4 Snapshots</strong> = <strong>5,4545 %</strong></p>\n<p>So this <strong>5,4545 %</strong> is the bonus points that will be added to those delegates that abstained from voting on the ARDC Snapshots and expressed it in the forum.</p>\n<p>Of all delegates that form part of the program, only <strong>1</strong> delegate indicated that it would abstain.</p>\n<p>So this <strong>5,4545 %</strong> will be added as BP to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/blockworksresearch\">@BlockworksResearch</a></p>\n<p>Even this is not the ideal solution, our approach is that delegates participate in these votes by standing by their convictions. To avoid this in the near future, we will ensure that the ballots have the necessary options for delegates to express their voting intentions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"family_woman_woman_girl_boy-new-members-of-the-program-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#family_woman_woman_girl_boy-new-members-of-the-program-18\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/family_woman_woman_girl_boy.png?v=12\" title=\":family_woman_woman_girl_boy:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":family_woman_woman_girl_boy:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> New members of the program</h3>\n<p>As we said in previous posts, any delegate can <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945\">apply to the program anytime</a>.</p>\n<p>In fact, we have some new participants that will be part of it from the next month (APRIL):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/itublockchain/summary\">ITUblockchain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ocandocrypto\">ocandocrypto.eth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo/summary\">Jojo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945/47\">Bobbay</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"police_car-security-council-elections-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#police_car-security-council-elections-19\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/police_car.png?v=12\" title=\":police_car:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":police_car:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Security Council Elections</h3>\n<p>When the proposal was written, security council elections were not considered.

The efforts have addressed several challenges and introduced key updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Handling On-chain Voting Complexities</strong>: The process of calculating accurate lifetime voting percentages for delegates was complicated by numerous canceled or invalid proposals. Adjusting for these anomalies was essential for reliability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Standardizing Voting Rationale Documentation</strong>: The absence of a uniform method for delegates to report their voting rationale—spread across proposal threads, delegate communication threads, and Snapshot—posed a significant challenge. Karma employed AI (Large Language Models) to efficiently extract these rationales from forum posts, streamlining administrative workflows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Archiving Delegate Activities</strong>: To ensure transparency and provide a historical perspective, Karma has begun archiving snapshots of all delegate activities, allowing for the review of monthly statistics by any interested party.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are continuing to make more updates to provide even more granular information.

Let us broadly call these instruments, targeted not only at healthy self sustainable returns, but ecosystem strategic objectives - Development Venture Capital or dVC.</p>\n<p>What a lot of the above stakeholders have figured out over decades of work is that even if you only care about the ecosystem impact, having it enabled via high growth for profit schemes produces by far the best impact. And on top of that, returns are generated allowing for sustainability and growth of the treasury enabling even more funds to be deployed. These characteristics more than justify the added setup complexity compared to grant schemes, where applicable. For clarity, Grant financing is still a crucial part of the whole value chain, especially for funding public goods and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>If Artibrum is able to rapidly leverage not only its progressive values and commitment to decentralized governance, but also the best in class talent and practices from more matured Developmental Venture Capital approaches in the Web2 world, it can jump ahead of the competition, attract the best builders, capital allocators, and ecosystem support players, thus setting the trend for others to follow.</p>\n<p>Given the complex landscape of Web3 verticals and market segments, as well as the varying needs of ventures across the stages of their lifecycle, resource allocation is best done through a multitude of specialized programs and instruments. Additionally, it’s best to partner with and support the emergent players of the ecosystem instead of trying to reinvent them top down, as this enables access to the talent, networks, market insights, and momentum of the emergent players. Thus enabling Arbitrum to move faster, with lower risk, and more cost effectively.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, Arbitrum needs to do this without allowing any of the partners or capital allocators to capture AVI and the DAO’s resources for their own exclusive gains, but rather use the capital in deep alignment with Arbitrum, generating win-win outcomes for Arbitrum, program operators, and projects.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"key-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-5\"></a>Key Considerations:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The structure should have an executive team that is able to operate at speed and provide a stakeholder friendly counterparty for GPs to negotiate with and raise money from Arbitrum as an LP.</li>\n<li>Potentially be able to get involved in direct investments or acting as a liquidity provider, but without competing with its main objective to attract a broad group of VCs and programs to operate in the ecosystem. Whether AVI should at all make direct investments or act as a liquidity provider is debatable and will require further exploration.</li>\n<li>Have an oversight committee that is elected by the DAO and includes key qualified representatives. These might include key Arbitrum DAO contributors and delegates, representatives of the Foundation and of key investors of Arbitrum with relevant competence, whose main vested interest is clearly the success of the chain above all else.</li>\n<li>The liquidation of Arb tokens, while they are being funnelled to be used in the venture ecosystem should be done under policies dictated by the DAO in alignment with avoiding causing undesirable price action. Furthermore concentration of such tokens in this substructure should not concentrate governance rights as a result of delegation by the small group of appointed executives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"case-studies-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#case-studies-6\"></a>Case Studies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The group referred to some of the many case studies from our experience in thread <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/what-do-we-want-for-arbitrum-venture-funds/22213\"><em>What do we want from Arbitrum Venture Funds</em></a>.

Everyone thought ARB as go-to L2 token &amp; the fastest ETH beta initially. However, for various reasons, ARB has lagged every single L2 chain including OP, METIS and even BOBA.</p>\n<p>That is why Arbitrum needs a fundamentally different approach from the previous ones. Thanksfully, we can use reference of the market. We should use leverage market-oriented approach. We have to focus on what market is already paying rewards among the Arbitrum-based infrastructure.</p>\n<p>L3. The market starts to pay attention to L3 narrative, finally. DEGEN, the strongest and the most organic BASE memecoin, adopts Arbitrum Orbit L3 solution for its own chain.

L3 repricing is the most <strong>fundamental &amp; organic</strong> theme that Arbitrum ecosystem faced for its entire lifetime.

The novel soft-liquidation protects all users according to their risk appetite and helps to avoid liquidations.</p>\n<p>Soft-liquidation allows users to set a liquidation level close to the market price and leads to a more capital efficient way of using collateral.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"boosting-core-liquidity-for-arb-on-arbitrum-41\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#boosting-core-liquidity-for-arb-on-arbitrum-41\"></a>Boosting Core Liquidity for ARB on Arbitrum</h4>\n<p>Soft-liquidation is done over arbitrage with liquidity venues for ARB on Arbitrum. A deep crvUSD/ARB liquidity pool on Curve allows it to work smooth. The low gas fee on Arbitrum allows for more efficient soft-liquidation, as the arbitrageur doing the soft-liquidation has less gas cost to cover than on mainnet.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"sustaining-incentives-with-crv-emissions-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#sustaining-incentives-with-crv-emissions-42\"></a>Sustaining Incentives with CRV Emissions</h4>\n<p>A short-term incentive program runs the risk of seeing mass liquidity outflows after incentives end. Our goal is to jumpstart ARB lending market. As the soft-liquidation is far superior to the hard liquidation used in other lending markets, we are convinced users keep using the lending market if the incentive is tapering off.</p>\n<p>As we incentivize the supply side, the supply side earns lending reward from borrowers on top of the supply during bootstrapping and after bootstrapping.</p>\n<p>veCRV stakeholders will be motivated to continue allocating CRV emissions toward lending markets even after the ARB incentives end.

Stylus is an upgrade that introduces a new virtual machine that runs alongside the EVM. This enables developers to write smart contracts in new programming languages, like Rust, that are more efficient than Solidity smart contracts.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Stylus is a first-of-its-kind technology resulting from breakthrough engineering efforts in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Unlike other alternative VMs, Stylus is purely additive to the EVM. This means that Stylus contracts and EVM contracts are fully interoperable.</p>\n<p>Some defining features of Stylus include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Preferred Languages: There are <a href=\"https://research.slashdata.co/reports/65b90140343d024fbe70f369\">estimated</a> to be roughly 20k Solidity developers, compared to 3.5 million Rust developers and 10 million C++ developers. Developers can use their preferred programming language, all interoperable with each other, on any Arbitrum chain with Stylus. Scaling to the next billion users requires onboarding the next million developers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>EVM+: Stylus brings the best of both worlds. Developers still get all of the benefits of the EVM, including the ecosystem and liquidity, while getting efficiency improvements and access to existing libraries in Rust, C, and C++ — without changing anything about how the EVM works. EVM equivalence is no longer the ceiling; it’s the floor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cheaper Execution: Stylus is a more efficient execution environment than the EVM, leading directly to gas savings for complex smart contracts. Computation can be over 10x cheaper, and memory can be over 100x cheaper. Cryptography libraries can be deployed as custom application layer precompiles, permissionlessly. Use cases that are impractical in the EVM are now possible in Stylus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Safer By Design: Stylus doesn’t just improve on cost and speed. WASM programs are also safer. Reentrancy is a common vulnerability that developers can only attempt to mitigate in Solidity. Stylus provides cheap reentrancy detection, and using the Rust SDK, reentrancy is disabled by default, unless intentionally overridden.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fully Interoperable: Solidity programs and WASM programs are completely composable. If working in Solidity, a developer can call a Rust program or rely on another dependency in a different language. If working in Rust, all Solidity functionalities are accessible out of the box. This means your Rust smart contracts can rely on primitives and infrastructure (such as oracles) that were built using Solidity.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several exciting teams have been building their apps on the Stylus testnet for the past few months. These apps would simply not be possible on Arbitrum without the added efficiency or new language support. Stylus can onboard (1) the next generation of developers from alternate VM ecosystems and (2) new use cases that users cannot experience on EVM chains.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>This proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s mission and values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Ethereum-Aligned: Stylus does not change anything about how the EVM works. Rather than replacing, Stylus is completely additive and extends what is possible in the EVM.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sustainable: More efficiency at the execution layer can give Arbitrum chains long-term competitive advantages by allowing higher throughput, cheaper costs, and new use cases that are not possible on other EVM chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accessibility: Arbitrum can become the home for new types of developers who don’t know Solidity. This includes Rust, C, C++, and any other programming language that compiles to WebAssembly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inclusivity: The Stylus SDK is 100% open-source, meaning developers are free to fork, modify, and contribute to the core patterns that the SDK represents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Empowerment: The parameters defined in Stylus are fully configurable by the Arbitrum DAO (for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) and individual Orbit chains. These customizations can supercharge Stylus by, for example, dropping activation prices, increasing contract size limits, and lowering opcode pricing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"key-terms-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-5\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<p>Stylus: A new programming environment, including a WebAssembly-based virtual machine, a CLI, and a canonical SDK that defines the patterns and frameworks for writing smart contracts.</p>\n<p>WebAssembly (WASM): WebAssembly is a modern binary format used in significant web standards, browsers, and companies to speed up computation. Built to be fast, portable, and secure.</p>\n<p>Virtual Machine (VM): The software that executes smart contracts and processes transactions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The Stylus VM and fraud prover have been developed as a fork of the Nitro codebase. These repositories will be merged into the main branch of Nitro if the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stylus: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus: Stylus VM and Fraud Prover</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Fork of <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro: Nitro goes vroom and fixes everything</a></li>\n<li>Includes node software, VM, and Fraud Prover</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>stylus-geth: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-geth\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-geth</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Fork of <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/go-ethereum</a></li>\n<li>Includes the execution client and databases</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>stylus-contracts: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Fork of <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts: The core Arbitrum Nitro contracts deployed to the base chain to host the rollup</a></li>\n<li>Includes rollup and fraud proof smart contracts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Stylus VM is not a replacement for the EVM. Instead, the two VMs work together to facilitate state transitions, each playing their part in executing their respective bytecode. EVM contracts written in Solidity still use Geth’s EVM exactly as before, ensuring EVM equivalence. In other words, Stylus is entirely additive — a paradigm called EVM+.</p>\n<p>Stylus contracts can be written using the Stylus SDK, which employs Solidity-equivalent ABIs and storage patterns to ensure cross-language interoperability. For example, existing Solidity DEXs can list Rust tokens without modification. New SDKs for additional programming languages can be added over time.

For example, a contract might query the runtime for information about its balance, emit logs, or even call out to other contracts. In these cases the Stylus VM provides Host Input / Output operations, aka Host I/Os, for interacting with the contract’s environment. They are called via standard WASM ABI, which means they are available in all programming languages. For standardization purposes, types are also denoted in Rust form, which can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/stylus/stylus-sdk/src/hostio.rs\">SDK</a>. Some host I/Os require accessing the EVM, which cannot be implemented entirely on the Rust side. For these, a special system of callbacks (an API) connects Rust to Go.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"the-memory-model-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-memory-model-8\"></a>The Memory Model</h4>\n<p>Stylus introduces a novel VM that provides an opportunity to improve upon the EVM’s quadratic memory model. Rather than using a per-call quadratic memory model, Stylus programs use a global, exponential memory pricing policy. The maximum memory footprint per block is currently set to 8 MB. This footprint reflects all programs ever executed during a transaction rather than being isolated to a per-call-context basis and does not include EVM contracts.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"dynamic-linking-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#dynamic-linking-9\"></a>Dynamic Linking</h4>\n<p>Proving fraud over untrusted WASMs presents novel challenges to the design of the dispute protocol. Arbitrum fraud proofs consist of two phases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The bisection protocol, wherein the parties narrow down to a single WAVM opcode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The One Step Proof, wherein L1 contracts emulate that single instruction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stylus does not change the bisection protocol or its implementation. All changes are compatible with <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum-chains-9934eb5328cc\">BOLD</a> and the current system. However, there is one conceptual difference: instead of bisecting over the vanilla replay machine’s execution of a block, user programs are dynamically linked in and out throughout execution.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"activation-pricing-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#activation-pricing-10\"></a>Activation Pricing</h4>\n<p>There are two primary costs when activating user programs: compute and storage.</p>\n<p>Activated Stylus programs expire after 1 year. The original compressed WASM is kept around for future reactivation. Like all Stylus parameters, the Arbitrum DAO can configure this expiration period. This policy has two benefits. First, it decreases state bloat by only keeping information necessary for the long term, pruning short-lived contracts over time. Second, the Stylus VM can charge less for activated contract code. Today, the EVM charges 200 gas per byte of contract code, which makes sense for permanent state, but leaves an opportunity to cut costs for Stylus.</p>\n<p>The Stylus VM provides 120Mb of temporary storage per hour for activated contract code. If demand for this temporary storage exceeds this limit, the price rises, eventually to a value that exceeds 200 gas per byte.</p>\n<p>Stylus is designed to withstand powerful adversaries that can censor Ethereum for up to a week, buy the entirety of Arbitrum’s blockspace indefinitely, or similar worst-case assumptions. Stylus defaults to a configuration intended for this extreme environment, with generous error margins usually exceeding 100%.</p>\n<p>Under this configuration, nodes will never exceed 1TB of activated contract code. In practice, the state size will be over an order of magnitude smaller, due to the generous error margins used and realistic user demand.</p>\n<p>Along with the data fee for temporary storage, users must also pay for compute when activating a program. This compute component pays for the work done instrumenting the contract and lowering it to the node’s local assembly. For most contracts, this is about 2 million gas, though in some unusual circumstances, the costs may be higher.</p>\n<p>This means deploying a Stylus contract end-to-end will generally cost more than in the EVM. However this is only true for the first time a contract is deployed. If multiple contracts share the same code hash, only the first needs to pay for activation. Additionally, for most onchain applications, these economics work out since after a contract has been activated, compute becomes over an order of magnitude cheaper than in the EVM.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"opcode-pricing-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#opcode-pricing-11\"></a>Opcode Pricing</h4>\n<p>Opcode pricing is similar to activation: each opcode takes an amount of time to run, the length of which determines the price. Unlike activation, opcode execution is measured in fractions of a nanosecond and is highly variable. This pricing table for opcodes is informed by the benchmarking numbers found via the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/tree/stylus-pricer-benchmarks/arbitrator/tools/pricers/benchmarks\">benchmarks</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/tree/stylus-pricer-benchmarks/arbitrator/tools/pricers/runtime\">runtime</a> crates of the aforementioned ‘stylus-pricer-benchmarks’ branch. Another way pricing has been checked for correctness is by generating trillions of gas worth of instructions and then trying to sync nodes from scratch. In practice, on representative hardware, it was found that almost 360 million gas per second can be synced, or 50x faster than our current speed limit. This implies many opcodes are being overcharged, the prices of which can drop over time as confidence is gained in the model.</p>\n<p>Host I/O pricing is more straightforward. Through benchmarking and static analysis, clear bounds on VM affordances can be determined. This <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/stylus/arbitrator/stylus/src/test/timings.rs\">file</a> benchmarks all the Rust-only Host I/Os.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"steps-to-implement-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-12\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discussion of the proposal on the forum</li>\n<li>Completing the audit and remaining code changes</li>\n<li>A vote on Snapshot to enable Stylus on Arbitrum Sepolia</li>\n<li>Merging the Stylus branch into the canonical Nitro codebase</li>\n<li>Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet that emulates production environments</li>\n<li>An onchain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-13\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<p>Stylus is rapidly progressing toward being production-ready.

href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#kpi-liquidity-growth-and-retention-6\"></a><strong>KPI: Liquidity Growth and Retention</strong></h2>\n<p>The STIP for Trader Joe aimed to boost liquidity pools with incentives over 28 days and assess retention in the following 28 days. The hypothesis was that initial high rewards could elevate liquidity to self-sustaining levels post-incentive. Overall, the data indicates that while liquidity levels remained satisfactory in most pools immediately after the incentive period, only four pools failed to meet the targeted KPIs. However, in the absence of further incentives and facing increased yield competition, most pools saw diminished activity over the extended period post incentives.</p>\n<p>In summary, while the strategy successfully attracted liquidity, maintaining liquidity without incentives past a 28 day period proved to be a challenge in the context of competitive yield opportunities elsewhere. This outcome validates the original hypothesis to some extent—that retaining liquidity is feasible without incentives over a period of time. However, that period of time largely depends on the dynamics of yield competition across the ecosystem. These are valuable learnings, moving forward.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Token</th>\n<th>Liquidity Pre Incentives</th>\n<th>Peak TVL During Incentives</th>\n<th>Average

This proposal intends to set up this subsidy fund, seeking $10 million worth of ARB to be administered and selected by the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ADPC’) to facilitate the selection of projects that will benefit from the whitelisted security audit service providers selected via the ADPC’s procurement framework. The ultimate decision will be made by the ADPC based on the Means Test and the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYCtfP_GqfjkKQafVr86hCpjEsQ2Ec4a/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Application Process Terms</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-request-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposal-request-3\"></a>Proposal Request</h1>\n<p>We propose the creation of a procurement subsidy fund allocating $10 million worth of ARB to provide financial assistance to both new and existing projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>These subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees. This approach eliminates the need for the ADPC to assess the reasonableness of funds requests.</p>\n<p>The aim of the subsidy fund is to incentivise participation and growth among smaller projects helping them to overcome barriers to entry, such as challenges to acquire funding to pay for the cost of robust security audits.</p>\n<p>The figure of $10 million worth of ARB has been determined via a benchmarking exercise conducted with various security audit service providers. This <a href=\"https://noteforms.com/forms/subsidy-fund-service-fee-consultation-mtg039\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">form</a> was shared with these service providers and based on the responses of 10 service providers (including the likes of Spearbit, Halborn, Nethermind, Three Sigma, Guardian, Zellic, etc.) on their scope of services and fees associated, we have estimated that each project will require a 2-month security audit at an average cost of $200K. This will enable the ADPC to potentially fund up to 50 projects; however, it should be noted that the average of $200K is an estimate and fees are usually specific to each project, each project requires a scoping exercise, and audit costs will vary based on the size of the codebase, complexity, etc.</p>\n<p>Any feedback on this proposal is encouraged via a public discussion on the community forum.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"subsidy-fund-design-approach-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#subsidy-fund-design-approach-4\"></a>Subsidy Fund Design &amp; Approach</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"exec-view-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#exec-view-5\"></a>Exec View</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>$10 million worth of ARB allocated across ~50 projects to spend on whitelisted security audit service providers, with an average amount of $200K worth of ARB allocated per project and a max cap of $500K per project.</li>\n<li>ADPC responsible for selection and oversight.</li>\n<li>Our aim is to distribute the Subsidy Fund in an 8-month period, in 4 cohorts of 8 weeks each.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"key-pillars-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-pillars-6\"></a>Key Pillars</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"a-subsidy-fund-principles-and-criteria-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#a-subsidy-fund-principles-and-criteria-7\"></a>(A) Subsidy Fund Principles and Criteria</h3>\n<p><strong>Core Principles Underlying the ADPC Subsidy Fund</strong></p>\n<p>Before considering a subsidy application, applicants should carefully evaluate the need for support. The purpose of these guidelines is to clarify the subsidy program and make the process as straightforward as possible.</p>\n<p>All applicants should keep in mind the following key principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Transparency &amp; integrity</strong> - Applicants must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and receipt of any prior funding.</li>\n<li><strong>Encouragement of investment</strong> - Subsidies should incentivise investment that would not otherwise occur without the subsidy. They should not cover costs that the beneficiary would have funded independently in the absence of any subsidy.</li>\n<li><strong>Proportionate and necessary</strong> - Subsidies should be proportionate to their intended objective and limited to what is necessary to achieve it.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic neutrality</strong> - The requested subsidy amount should not confer an economic advantage. It should be provided on fair terms, comparable to what could reasonably be obtained on the market.</li>\n<li><strong>Consideration of funding options</strong> - Applicants are expected to explore all available funding options and responsibly choose the option that best suits their needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement of beneficiary security</strong> - Subsidies should bring about changes that enhance the security of the beneficiary’s protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem</strong> - Subsidies should have a beneficial effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem, contributing to its growth and sustainability.</li>\n<li><strong>Value for Money</strong> - The evaluation method should ensure decisions maximize both financial and non-financial value to Arbitrum.</li>\n<li><strong>Probity</strong> - Subsidies should be issued in an environment that ensures fairness, impartiality, and compliance with established guidelines and rules. There will be an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and integrity throughout the procurement process, evidenced by the development of this publicly documented Means Test methodology. This focus on Probity will mitigate procurement risks and safeguard the integrity of the procurement process.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Management</strong> - Risk management policies will be implemented to identify and mitigate procurement risks.</li>\n<li><strong>Engagement with SMEs</strong> - We have invited a wide range of organisations to participate, all of whom will be subject to the eligibility criteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Cyclical Whitelist events</strong> - We will have clear rules for cyclical whitelist reviews to open a pathway for future applicants and new market entrants.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Means Test: Criteria for Evaluation</p>\n<p>The reason for this approach over a purely quantitative approach is that most projects, especially the smaller ones being targeted within this subsidy program do not possess obvious immediately measurable metrics.</p>\n<p>The development of this Means Test aims to provide a structured approach for the ADPC to evaluate applications for financial assistance. This tool is designed to identify applicants who would benefit most from support, ensuring equitable access to subsidies within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, particularly for smaller entities with valuable contributions.</p>\n<p>The intent is to allocate subsidies to those most in need, avoiding exploitation by larger players looking for a ‘free lunch/handout’. Such an event could give recipients an unfair advantage over their competitors or be an inefficient use of the DAO’s funds if they do not bring about a net positive change.</p>\n<p>The means test will include a scoring system ranging from 1 to 5, reflecting the merit of each application.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rating 1: Unsatisfactory</li>\n<li>Rating 2: Below expectations</li>\n<li>Rating 3: Meets expectations</li>\n<li>Rating 4: Above expectations</li>\n<li>Rating 5: Exceptional</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the sub-criteria in the means test have varying levels of importance, and they will each have a weighting attached. A weighting of 1 indicates low importance, 2 indicates neutral importance, and 3 indicates high importance.</p>\n<p>Each application will be scored by ADPC members, followed by a collective decision on the most deserving grant recipients, taking into account the rating against the eligibility criteria, a value-for-money evaluation and the funds available. The ADPC may make other decisions in relation to the operation of the fund and selection of applicants as further detailed in the Application Process Terms.</p>\n<p>After the applications have been reviewed and decisions taken as to the grant beneficiaries, the average score assigned to each project will be shared publicly, ensuring that transparency is maintained throughout the process. In the event that an applicant receives a high score but is not chosen as a grant recipient, explanatory feedback will be provided either on an individual or collective basis to the cohort.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Criteria</th>\n<th>Sub-Criteria</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Weight</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Arbitrum Ecosystem Contribution</strong><br><em>How aligned is the project with the Arbitrum ecosystem and how easy will it be to track the applicant’s use of the subsidy funds?</em></td>\n<td>Ecosystem Contribution</td>\n<td>How does the applicant’s project contribute towards the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Transparency Practices</td>\n<td>To what extent does the applicant demonstrate transparency in its operations?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Community Engagement</td>\n<td>How does the applicant engage with the DAO community and solicit feedback/input on its project, incorporating this into its decision-making?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Accountability Measures</td>\n<td>What mechanisms does the project have in place to ensure accountability and responsible stewardship of subsidy funds, including governance structures in place?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Business Model &amp; Need for the Subsidy</strong><br><em>How effectively does the applicant’s business model align with their need for the subsidy?</em></td>\n<td>Clarity of Business Model</td>\n<td>How well-defined and understandable is the applicant’s business model?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Team Experience</td>\n<td>What is the track record of the team on their ability to execute their plan?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Funding Gap Rationale</td>\n<td>Is there a clear explanation of the funding gap the applicant is facing, along with the rationale for why additional subsidy funding is necessary to achieve its objectives?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Reasonableness of Subsidy Amount Requested</td>\n<td>Does the requested subsidy amount make sense within the context of the project’s needs and potential impact?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Scalability Potential</td>\n<td>What is the scalability potential of the applicant’s business model following the support of the subsidy?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Financial Analysis</strong><br><em>How realistic and stress tested is the applicant’s financial status and projections and is their plan for the use of the subsidy funds clearly outlined?</em></td>\n<td>Accuracy of Projections</td>\n<td>How realistic and well-supported are the financial projections provided by the applicant, inclusive of revenue forecasts and cost analysis?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Sensitivity to Scenarios</td>\n<td>To what extent does the applicant’s financial analysis consider different scenarios, such as base, target and stress scenarios to assess the projects’ resilience and adaptability to changing market conditions?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>KPIs</td>\n<td>Are there clearly defined KPIs that will be used to track the project’s performance and measure progress towards achieving its goals?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Preferred Funding Distribution</td>\n<td>Does the applicant have a preferred distribution plan for the subsidy funds, and is there a rationale provided for this distribution approach, such as front-loading funds for critical start-up costs or phased funding based on project milestones?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Risk Analysis</strong><br><em>Is the applicant aware of risks with their project and what is their plan for mitigating these risks?</em></td>\n<td>Risk Identification</td>\n<td>How effectively does the applicant identify and assess potential risks and vulnerabilities that the project may have?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Security Requirements</td>\n<td>Does the applicant have a clear understanding of its security requirements and the measures needed to protect against security breaches, such as through the conducting of a security audit?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Mitigation Strategies</td>\n<td>What strategies does the applicant have in place or intend to implement to safeguard against the aforementioned risks?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Regarding the ‘Ecosystem Contribution’ metric above, we have conducted an initial assessment of the types of projects that are currently building in the Arbitrum ecosystem and identified a few verticals that the ecosystem would benefit from funding.

Each cohort will consist of an initial submission period of 2 weeks, followed by a 6-week review period. Moreover, a maximum cap of 25% of the total Subsidy Fund amount can be disbursed per cohort to ensure that the fund is structured to allow the door to be opened to new entrants over time. Each cohort will operate on a first-come-first-served basis for application reviews, and if the maximum capital has been allocated for the cohort, the remaining applicants will be rolled over to the next cohort.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Screening</strong></p>\n<p>To efficiently handle the anticipated surge in applications and to ensure that the highest quality and most relevant applicants are selected, the below 5 sub-criteria (with the highest weights as mentioned above in the Means Test) will first be applied to all applicants, with the top-scoring applicants moving forward in the evaluation process and being assessed in greater depth:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Funding Gap Rationale</li>\n<li>Reasonableness of Subsidy Amount Requested</li>\n<li>KPIs</li>\n<li>Ecosystem Contribution</li>\n<li>Accountability Measures</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The ADPC reserves the right to introduce Mandatory Requirements over time that operate as threshold tests and will publish those requirements if introduced.</p>\n<p><strong>In-Depth Review &amp; Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Projects that pass the initial screening will undergo a review due diligence (DD) by the ADPC, including interviews and constructive feedback (either individually or on a collective basis).</p>\n<p><strong>Award &amp; Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>Once approved, projects receive subsidies, with periodic check-ins and a concluding evaluation to measure impact and success.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"c-selection-process-reporting-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#c-selection-process-reporting-9\"></a>(C) Selection Process &amp; Reporting</h3>\n<p>Transparency and continuous dialogue form the backbone of our selection and reporting process, ensuring that each funded project remains aligned with program expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Bi-Monthly Reports</strong></p>\n<p>We will provide bi-monthly updates on our selections and updates on funded projects (i.e., in line with each Cohort). These updates will include general project trajectory and progress toward milestones. To create the reports we will set regular monthly check-in dates where projects fill a template/slide in order to give the key info about the project’s status, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Summary of Achievements for the Month</li>\n<li>Funds Utilized</li>\n<li>Milestones Reached</li>\n<li>Challenges Faced &amp; Plan of Action</li>\n<li>Feedback Integration, i.e., how projects have incorporated feedback provided.</li>\n<li>Next Steps &amp; Priorities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Output Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>With the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for meaningful output will look as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Number of Projects Funded:</strong> Number of projects funded during each cohort.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Funds Allocated:</strong> Cumulative sum of funds distributed in each cohort, showcasing the program’s financial impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Percentage of projects funded in target verticals:</strong> As outlined in the Means Test, the three key verticals we have identified are RWAs &amp; Tokenization, Gaming, and Collab Tech.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcome Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on the final portfolio of funded projects, we will gauge the success rate of awarded projects through specific outcome metrics. While these metrics can be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as market conditions and individual decisions on a project level, we are committed to supporting and funding the most promising projects to the best of our ability. Metrics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Percentage of funded projects successfully deployed on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Percentage of KPIs outlined in the application achieved by funded projects</li>\n<li>Percentage of projects successfully deployed as Orbit chains: One of the key aims of the Arbitrum DAO is to build and expand the Orbit ecosystem. Funding projects that grow the Orbit ecosystem is a net positive to the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"d-project-allocation-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#d-project-allocation-10\"></a>(D) Project Allocation</h3>\n<p>Our approach to subsidy fund allocation focuses on achieving high impact while ensuring that a de minimus number of projects obtain funding.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the subsidy is spread across a large number of projects rather than concentrated in several larger projects, the maximum subsidy to be granted will comprise 5% of the subsidy fund available. Therefore, given that the subsidy fund comprises $10 million, the maximum subsidy that a project can receive will comprise no more than $500K worth of ARB. This will ensure that the fund is designed to subsidize at least 20 projects, at a minimum.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"e-team-setup-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#e-team-setup-11\"></a>(E) Team Setup</h3>\n<p>The administration and selection process of these subsidies will be managed by the ADPC. Even though the ultimate decision will lie with the judgment of the ADPC, their assessment will be strongly guided by a means test that evaluates key metrics to determine deserving projects.</p>\n<p>The activation of the ADPC to manage the Subsidy Fund will hinge on extending the current 6-month mandate once the Subsidy Fund becomes operational. Should the DAO or the ADPC opt against a continuation of the ADPC, a Subsidy Fund Management Committee will need to be elected. The ADPC will allocate ample time for this process to ensure the Subsidy Fund operation is not reliant on the ADPC’s mandate extension.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"g-governance-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#g-governance-12\"></a>(G) Governance</h3>\n<p>The Subsidy Fund governance aims for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement. It outlines mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced decision-making for all stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Sig</strong></p>\n<p>All providers must undergo and successfully complete the standard Know-Your-Business (hereinafter referred to as the ‘KYB’) verification processes with the Arbitrum Foundation prior to receiving the service-subsidy.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the designated Multi-sig members, established at the inception of the ADPC and voted in favour of by the ArbitrumDAO, will take charge of disbursing funds to the selected beneficiaries, whereby the transactions will be streamed using Hedgey.</p>\n<p>In recognition of the additional responsibilities undertaken, each of the five multi-sig wallets is proposed to receive a supplementary compensation ranging from 500 ARB - 1,000 ARB monthly.</p>\n<p>It is also important to note, as per the ratified proposal which led to the formation of the ADPC, that the multi-sig committee grants the ArbitrumDAO the authority to claw back funds from the ADPC’s multi-sig wallet using the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-procurement-clawback-capability\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Zodiac Governor Module</a>, if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Checks &amp; Balances</strong></p>\n<p>Kindly note that the subsidy fund will be subject to the same checks and balances found within the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064\">procurement committee proposal</a>, regulated by an agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members, with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the agreement. These checks and balances include:</p>\n<p><strong>Conflict of Interest Provision:</strong> ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position &amp; disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Members’ involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.</p>\n<p>To sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Record-keeping and Reporting:</strong> Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress &amp; internal ADPC Administration.</p>\n<p><strong>Duty of Impartiality:</strong> ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks &amp; workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.</p>\n<p><strong>Obligation of Recusal:</strong> ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project and/or service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation &amp; administration of the applicable procurement process.</p>\n<p>P<strong>rohibition of Self-Dealing:</strong> Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethical Trading:</strong> Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Application Terms and Conditions can be found</strong> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYCtfP_GqfjkKQafVr86hCpjEsQ2Ec4a/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>CCing: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer\">@Immutablelawyer</a>; <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/pablo\">@Pablo</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/sid_areta\">@sid_areta</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cliffton.eth\">@cliffton.eth</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/raam\">@raam</a></p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 8 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 20:58:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22958"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958.rss","#text":"[Non-constitutional] Subsidy Fund for Security Services"}},{"title":"# Thank ARB monthly report: February 2024","dc:creator":"BenWest","category":"Grants Discussions","description":"<p>Hi, this is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benwest\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ben West</a>, I will be working with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/disruptionjoe\">@DisruptionJoe</a> and the team to deliver the Thank ARB program.

Simply put, what is the benefit that you will bring to the DAO through the execution of your proposal, and what do you stand to gain if your proposal passes?</p>\n<p>If you have solid reasons to believe that the value created from your proposal justifies the organizational and/or monetary overhead created for the DAO, then you should proceed with the process as outlined below.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, it might be hard to assess your proposal in the context of the DAO. A good approach is to see whether there have been any similar proposals to the DAO in the past, or if there have been any similar proposals to other DAOs. Having a reference point can help put things into perspective both for you and also for the delegates when they are reviewing.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"frameworks-vs-direct-to-dao-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#frameworks-vs-direct-to-dao-3\"></a><strong>Frameworks vs Direct-to-DAO</strong></h2>\n<p>Once you’ve assessed your proposal, it’s time to see if it fits into any of the frameworks that already exist. As is the case with most DAOs, Arbitrum has frameworks in place to facilitate governance proposals. The 2 main categories of proposals are <strong>constitutional</strong> and <strong>non-constitutional</strong> Arbitrum Improvement Proposals, or AIPs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Constitutional AIPs</strong> are those that modify the text or procedures of the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Constitution</a> or AIP-1, install or modify the software on any chain, or take any action that requires “chain owner” permission on any chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-constitutional AIPs</strong> are all other AIPs, such as those that request funds/grants or provide general guidelines or information to the community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re reading this guide before proposing, chances are your proposal falls into the second category - and that’s where we’ll focus in this guide.</p>\n<p>Two easy questions to help you narrow down even further on how you’ll approach the DAO with your proposal are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Am I requesting a grant for something I’m building on Arbitrum?</li>\n<li>Is this something that would require a framework, or is it a one-off thing?\n<ol>\n<li>As a follow-up: if it does require a framework, does one already exist?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Requesting Grants</strong></p>\n<p>If you answered yes to the first question and you’re seeking a grant for something you’re building, then the choice you have to make is who you’ll request the grant from. There are several grant programs through which you can request funding without having to go through the governance process and a DAO-wide vote. You can find <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/9f7afd29c06f4f65ac637ae755546181?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">more information on different grant programs here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Different kinds of proposal</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re trying to make a different kind of proposal, or looking to fund a governance initiative, then you first need to assess whether what you’re requesting would open the floodgates for other individuals, teams, or projects to also request. For example, if you’re a service provider and want to offer your services to the DAO, or if you’re a protocol looking for liquidity incentives, then you need to understand that you probably aren’t the only one out there with that idea.</p>\n<p>When delegates evaluate these kinds of proposals, a factor they take into consideration is whether there needs to be a more holistic approach or a framework in place. If your proposal has a wide scope that could potentially be applied to others, then you should first seek to see whether a framework like that already exists.</p>\n<p>If you’re a service provider, you should contact the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064\">Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (ADPC)</a> and get whitelisted, and if you’re looking for liquidity incentives, you should be on the lookout for initiatives like <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131\">Short-Term Incentives Proposal (STIP)</a>, or <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223/41\">Long-Term Incentives Pilot Program (LTIPP)</a>.</p>\n<p>If a framework doesn’t exist for what you’re seeking to propose, then you should either discuss with delegates and see whether one is being worked on or, if you’re feeling brave, start working on one yourself.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pre-rfc-request-for-comment-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pre-rfc-request-for-comment-4\"></a>Pre-RFC (Request for Comment)</h2>\n<p>Before going to the forums and publishing your proposal as a ‘Request for Comment (RFC)’, you should first make sure that you’ve somehow established yourself in the Arbitrum DAO community. Ways to do that include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having been active in the governance forums</li>\n<li>Having attended open governance calls</li>\n<li>Having talked with delegates online or in person</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you haven’t done any of the above, you might need to either have someone who’s already in the DAO introduce you to the right people or have a strong and credible out-of-the-DAO presence and reputation.</p>\n<p>Although not explicitly required, having established yourself in the community will make it easier to attract attention to your proposal, and get the ball rolling in terms of discussion and feedback.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you want to share your proposal with a few delegates before you even publish. Given their high context and experience in the DAO, they’ll probably have feedback to offer which will make your proposal better before you publish it.</p>\n<p>While getting in direct touch with delegates might seem daunting at first, if you get a hold of one and ask them to connect you with others, the thread of contacts will start untangling pretty quickly.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"request-for-comment-rfc-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#request-for-comment-rfc-5\"></a>Request For Comment (RFC)</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, you need to format your proposal in a way that is familiar to the DAO and easy to navigate. There’s a proposal template in the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/how-tos/create-submit-dao-proposal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DAO’s governance docs here</a>. Drafting an easy-to-understand yet solid proposal is more art than science. Below we’ve compiled some advice that will save you the time and effort of going back and forth with delegates and other community members that review your proposal.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Include a TL;DR at the top.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The point of having a TL;DR of the proposal at the very top, similar to the one found at the start of this post, is so people can quickly get an overview and a refresh of the essence of the proposal without having to read through endless text. It doesn’t need to cover all the minor details, but it should include all the important ones.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Avoid using “sales” language.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’re excited that you want to build “the first in the world” or the “best-in-class” whatever, but the DAO is not a customer. The feedback you will receive will be based on the merit of the proposal rather than that of the pitch. If anything, you’re tiring both yourself and the delegates by adding unnecessary fluff. Be concise and to the point and it will be much better received.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Get specific and don’t leave things hanging</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>While you want to avoid unnecessary fluff language, you do not want to be brief with the things that matter. Important information that pertains to your proposal should be extensively covered.</p>\n<p>A non-exhaustive list of things that have been typically discussed in the past are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The total amount requested. You can denominate in either USD or ARB, but the funds you’ll receive will most likely be in ARB so keep that in mind.</li>\n<li>The timeline of your proposal</li>\n<li>A breakdown of how the money is going to be spent</li>\n<li>How will the funds be managed - will it be a multisig? If yes, who are going to be the signers?</li>\n<li>Will it be converted into stables or used as ARB?</li>\n<li>Is there going to be a milestone-based funding? If yes, what will the milestones be and how much money is it going to be unlocked at each?</li>\n<li>If there have to be some sort of elections relevant to your proposal, how will they be carried out? Who will manage the process?</li>\n<li>If there are smart contracts associated with your proposal, who is going to create them and audit them?</li>\n<li>If your proposal is meant to be a pilot or trial, what happens when it concludes?</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Contact info</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Feedback on your proposal will typically be given publicly under your forum post. However, you might want to give delegates a way to reach you in case they want to discuss your proposal in more detail. Telegram is most delegates’ app of choice, but any line of communication is welcome.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"temperature-check-on-snapshot-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#temperature-check-on-snapshot-6\"></a>Temperature Check on Snapshot</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve submitted an RFC to the forum, it’s generally a good practice to allow for some time (typically a week) before moving for a temperature check on Snapshot, unless the proposal is time-sensitive. If you’ve collected a lot of feedback under your forum post before the week is up, then you could move forward earlier so as not to waste time. If you haven’t collected enough feedback (or if you haven’t collected any feedback), worry not! Going to a temperature check on Snapshot is a sure way of getting delegates’ attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating a Snapshot vote</strong></p>\n<p>To submit a temperature check using Snapshot you must have an Ethereum wallet address that represents at least 0.01% of votable tokens (so 1,000,000 ARB). The Snapshot vote should run for 7 days and the outcome is decided by a simple majority with no required participation threshold. If you do not have that, you need to find a delegate who can post the proposal on your behalf.</p>\n<p>If you’ve followed the steps above, you should already have a line of communication with a few eligible delegates by now. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Updating your forum post</strong></p>\n<p>After creating your Snapshot vote, head back to your forum post and update it to include the link to the Snapshot. You can also add the link as a reply to “bump” your post to the top of the feed.</p>\n<p><strong>Discussing your proposal</strong></p>\n<p>There’s a bi-weekly call hosted by the Arbitrum Foundation where proposals are being discussed. You can <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Warsaw\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">find the calls on the Arbitrum Governance Calendar</a> and attend one of those to discuss your proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p>Doing a temperature check on Snapshot is an optional, but strongly recommended step in the governance process. If an AIP fails this temperature check, the original AIP author is encouraged to refrain from proceeding with an on-chain vote, and voters are encouraged to reject it if the author proceeds anyway. If an AIP proposer decides to skip temp-check, voters consider it as a factor when casting their vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"formal-vote-on-tally-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#formal-vote-on-tally-7\"></a>Formal Vote on Tally</h2>\n<p>After the temperature check, and given it was successful, the next step is to proceed with the on-chain vote on Tally. As with Snapshot, a Tally vote can only be initiated by $ARB token holders who hold (or represent) at least 0.01% of the votable supply. The Tally vote would run for 14 days and to be approved, more than 50% of the votable tokens that voted on the proposal must have voted in favor of the proposal; constitutional proposals must receive votes from at least 5% of all votable tokens in existence; non-constitutional proposal must receive votes from at least 3% of all votable tokens in existence.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparing up for an on-chain vote</strong></p>\n<p>The on-chain vote is executed permissionlessly after the vote concludes. For example, if you’re requesting funds from the DAO, successfully passing an on-chain vote doesn’t mean an entity will transfer the funds to you after the fact. You need to have the wallet that will receive the funds set up so the address can be used in the executable code associated with the proposal. The address and the requested amount will have to be a part of the on-chain proposal. If they’re not, <em>no funds</em> will be transferred, regardless of whether the proposal passes or not.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12\" title=\":bulb:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":bulb:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> If it’s a multi-sig wallet (e.g. Safe), make sure it’s deployed on Arbitrum. While EOA wallets like Metamask typically share the same address across different networks, multi-sig wallets do not work in the same fashion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Post-vote implementation</strong></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that if your proposal is successful, it won’t be executed for another 14 days after the on-chain vote has concluded. This waiting period is because of the L2 waiting period, the L2-to-L1 message, and the L1 waiting period.

To do so, you need to reflect on the feedback received from delegates, especially the ones who voted against it, make amendments to your proposal, and resubmit it.</p>\n<p>It is advised to create a new forum post for the revised proposal which will contain a link to the previous AIP, the reason why the previous AIP didn’t pass, the changes you made to the AIP to<br>\naddress the concerns raised by delegates and any additional information that differentiates the new proposal from the old one.</p>\n<p><strong>Governance process for resubmissions</strong></p>\n<p>If your proposal passed the temp-check and failed during the on-chain vote and you only made minor changes based on delegate feedback, you could skip the temp-check phase and go for an on-chain vote directly when resubmitting.</p>\n<p>If your proposal didn’t pass the temp check, then you should go through the entire process as outlined above as if the proposal is a new one.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-incomplete-guide-to-submitting-a-proposal-to-arbitrum-dao/22956\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-incomplete-guide-to-submitting-a-proposal-to-arbitrum-dao/22956","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 17:21:16 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22956"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-incomplete-guide-to-submitting-a-proposal-to-arbitrum-dao/22956.rss","#text":"The Incomplete Guide to Submitting a Proposal to Arbitrum DAO"}},{"title":"RabbitHole: Retro STIP Analysis (4/1/2024)","dc:creator":"RabbitHole","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overview-1\"></a>Overview</h2>\n<p>In November 2023, Boost Studios <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rabbithole-final-stip-round-1/17159\">secured 1M ARB</a> through the Arbitrum DAO’s STIP backfunding <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/13413460212244439965325761903593975061091934953503684497413508380387288651335?chart=0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposal</a>.

This allowed us to easily adjust daily reward budgets based on external changing factors such as completion costs. This includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gas fees:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Action Transaction Fee: transaction fee(s) associated with completing the action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Protocol Fee: protocol fees associated with completing the transaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Claim Transaction Fee: the transaction fee required to claim the reward from the boost.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Fee and reward token prices:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>ETH price: impacts the $ cost required to complete a boost.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ARB price: impacts the reward size relative to the costs associated with completion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By closely monitoring these dynamic market factors, we made daily adjustments to our distribution strategy to ensure that we always maximize the use of the funds in the most efficient way possible.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"key-highlights-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-highlights-3\"></a>Key Highlights</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Total ARB distributed: 1,000,000</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Total Boosts deployed: 445</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Total Boost completions: 2,386,557</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Total unique addresses: 150,041</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Total fees generated: $996,273</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New Arbitrum Users: 147,292</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Top Contract usage over three months (<a href=\"https://dune.com/blockworks_research/l2-comparison-dashboard\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockworks Dashboard</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consistently claiming 30-50% of contract usage on Arbitrum throughout STIP</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boost’s QuestFactory contract was one of the most used contracts on Arbitrum throughout the STIP program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What’s more impressive is that most Boost transactions require a preliminary external transaction, which this 30-50% doesn’t account for.

With Boost, anyone can target and incentivize any wallet to perform an onchain action. This is possible because every boost is a smart contract that is customizable by action type, reward amount, and target wallets. You can learn more about the Boost features <a href=\"https://docs.boost.xyz/boost-protocol/overview/introduction/what-is-boost\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This flexibility enables the creation of an unlimited number of custom boosts, each tailored for specific use cases or objectives. In the STIP program, we collaborated with various Arbitrum projects to explore diverse use cases, all contributing to our KPI goals and the overarching objective of expanding the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"trading-volume-growth-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trading-volume-growth-9\"></a>Trading Volume Growth</h3>\n<p>While our primary goal for the STIP program was to drive transaction volume on Arbitrum, we also acknowledge that transaction value holds equal importance for many issuers. Therefore, we launched boosts to evaluate the protocol’s effectiveness in facilitating higher-value transactions.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"boosting-trading-volume-on-camelot-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#boosting-trading-volume-on-camelot-10\"></a>Boosting Trading Volume on Camelot</h4>\n<p>Objective: Increase swaps on Camelot, emphasizing increasing swap volume.<br>\nMethod: Setting action parameters to a minimum of 100 USDC swapped on Camelot.</p>\n<p>Boosts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://manager.boost.xyz/boosts/c1ecfad5-fff3-4e78-8fd5-1854a464bdd0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost 1</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://manager.boost.xyz/boosts/7fc36d4e-21bf-461f-a75b-01bc869aef4e\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost 2</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://manager.boost.xyz/boosts/0e19db5f-528e-46db-9609-b3ef3b5d0e50\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost 3</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3389859/5694935\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boosted Camelot volume query</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3566189\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Camelot volume by boost query</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In January, we successfully tested the protocol’s ability to drive transaction value.

The STIP journey has provided us with invaluable insights and experiences, greatly enhancing our understanding of incentive distribution and reward optimization at the network level. This knowledge will undoubtedly shape our future strategies and approach.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, Boost Studios is excited to further develop the partnerships and connections we’ve established with some of Arbitrum’s leading teams. Working closely with these protocols has not only deepened our understanding of the DAO’s priorities but also showcased the unique capabilities of Boost to meet various specific and complex business needs.</p>\n<p>As we reflect on the STIP program’s successes, we identified a few areas that we are eager to explore further in future grants and initiatives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Deeper user retention: We’d love to explore user retention by leveraging deep user segmentation, in-depth user profiling, and action-driven retention strategies to engage and retain users within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User Acquisition: Further optimizing customer acquisition costs (CAC) for both conquest campaigns, such as GMX, and more novel onchain use cases, such as Knights of the Ether, with the primary goal of driving natural user growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Asset-driven campaigns: We see great potential in supporting asset volume on platforms like Camelot and facilitating the bridging of specific assets to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes focusing on native assets, native-minted assets, and strategic assets such as stablecoins or LST/LRTs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minting and Creator Use Cases: The success of our Zora use case has inspired us to explore creator-focused verticals further. Boost Protocol can play a vital role in helping creators gain visibility for their art and empower them to reach new audiences through targeted incentive campaigns.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The STIP program has been a transformative experience for the Boost Protocol, and we’re incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead. Boost remains dedicated to <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-new-thesis-for-network-level-incentives-programs/20757\">pushing the boundaries</a> of what is possible with incentive distribution and optimization, and we look forward to continued collaboration with the Arbitrum DAO!</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rabbithole-retro-stip-analysis-4-1-2024/22955\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rabbithole-retro-stip-analysis-4-1-2024/22955","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 17:10:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22955"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rabbithole-retro-stip-analysis-4-1-2024/22955.rss","#text":"RabbitHole: Retro STIP Analysis (4/1/2024)"}},{"title":"Idea for a Direct User Rewards Program","dc:creator":"AJC","category":"Proposals","description":"<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> WIP to initiate a simple rewards program that directly airdrops ARB tokens to users. The goal is to create a long-lasting program that continuously reward both new and old Arbitrum users. This proposal is currently still in ideation, so exact details of how this will look is TBD. Please feel free to critique and make any suggestions.</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>\n25 million ARB tokens airdropped to users that complete the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Link Twitter Account</li>\n<li>Link Wallet Address</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ARB tokens will be distributed equally, so for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>250,000 users sign up, each user gets 100 ARB tokens,</li>\n<li>500,000 users sign up, each user gets 50 ARB tokens,</li>\n<li>1 million users sign up, each user gets 25 ARB tokens, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong><br>\nRecent Arbitrum DAO initiatives have been mainly geared to attracting capital/liquidity (STIP/LTIP) or assisting existing projects (GCP). However, these initiatives have done very little to onboard new users to Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Although not exactly a 1:1 proxy for users, weekly active addresses (WAA) on Arbitrum have largely stagnated over the past year. Solana’s WAA is currently ~5x Arbitrum, and Base’s WAA has eclipsed Arbitrum for the first time ever. New users are arriving to crypto every day, but the vast majority are not choosing Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The best way to onboard users is quite simple: Incentives. Complex farming mechanisms, ‘Build it and they will come,’ and other non-user focused mechanisms do not onboard users. If you want users, you need to directly incentivize the users.</p>\n<p>The DAO needs to take immediate action to reemedy this and make Arbitrum a top spot for users.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> -<br>\nOffchain Labs and the Arbitrum DAO has done the hard part of making Arbitrum the L2 with the best technology and most liquidity, but now it is time to begin the process of onboarding the next generation of crypto users onto Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The establishment of a rewards program that directly incentivizes users on Arbitrum is perfectly aligned with the Arbitrum community’s mission and values.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong><br>\nThe pilot program should be extremely basic. Ideally, we want users to take as few as steps as possible to be eligible for the pilot program. The more steps and requirements, the less likely Arbitrum is to onboard new users. To achieve this, I propose that the pilot program should only consist of two steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Link Twitter Account</li>\n<li>Link Wallet Address</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sybils are obviously a concern, so anti-sybil measures will need to be implemented. Twitter accounts that are (i) Bots or (ii) Less than 1 month old should not be included in the airdrop. Additional anti-sybil measures will likely be needed, so if you have expertise or knowledge on this, please make additional suggestions.</p>\n<p>Once sybils have been identified, 25 million ARB will be airdropped equally to the users that successfully attached. There are no strings attached with this ARB, users are free to do as they please with their tokens.</p>\n<p>However, being that this is just a pilot program, the goal is for the pilot program to be the first of many airdrop rounds. User behavior will be paramount for inclusion in future rounds. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>User A receives 100 ARB tokens from the pilot program. User A sells 100 ARB tokens for 150 USDC tokens and then sends the USDC to a centralized exchange. User A is value extractive and should not be eligible for future airdrops.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User B receives 100 ARB tokens from the pilot program. User B sells 50 ARB tokens for 75 USDC and then uses the ARB and USDC to provide liquidity on a decentralized exchange. User B is generating economic activity on Arbitrum and should be eligible for future airdrops.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Either the Arbitrum Foundation or a newly established committee should be tasked with collecting data related to the behaviors of users that participated in the pilot program. This data will be utilized to establish criteria for future airdrop rounds, if approved by the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong><br>\nBeing that this proposal in its current form is largely just an idea, significant work will be needed on it to make it a reality. If you are large Arbitrum DAO delegate or an active participant that likes this idea, feel free to spearhead the effort into making this idea a reality.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 week user sign-up period for the pilot program</li>\n<li>2 week period for Arbitrum Foundation/Committee to identify sybils</li>\n<li>1 month+ period to collect user behavior data to serve as foundation for future reward rounds</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong><br>\n25 million ARB</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/idea-for-a-direct-user-rewards-program/22939\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/idea-for-a-direct-user-rewards-program/22939","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 02:34:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22939"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/idea-for-a-direct-user-rewards-program/22939.rss","#text":"Idea for a Direct User Rewards Program"}},{"title":"Final Grant Achievement Report: DeFi Africa's Web3 BUIDL Workshops","dc:creator":"defiafrica","category":"DAO Grant Programs","description":"<h2><a name=\"executive-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#executive-summary-1\"></a>Executive Summary</h2>\n<p>The DeFi Africa Web3 BUIDL Workshops project, funded through the generous support of the <a href=\"https://www.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x650b4a0dc2aec18f55adb72f13c5d95631db04be&amp;chainId=10&amp;role=builder&amp;proposalId=0x483\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum grant program on Questbook</a>, embarked on an ambitious journey to elevate the understanding, engagement, and innovation within the realms of Web3 technologies across Ghana, west Africa.

About 60% of these contracts were pushed to github, while others promised to work more on them later before pushing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even Though, the smart contracts deployed were basic, these deployments signify a pivotal step towards integrating the African developer community with the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Showcasing Arbitrum’s capabilities to a new audience, potentially setting the stage for its increased adoption.</li>\n<li>All 150+ participants gained firsthand experience with Arbitrum’s technology through the deployment exercises.</li>\n<li>Equipped them with the necessary skills and confidence to undertake more complex projects in the future.</li>\n<li>Our post-workshop surveys indicated a 70% increase in participants’ confidence in their ability to learn more about web3 development and contribute to the ecosystem.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"projects-initiated-a-forward-looking-approach-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#projects-initiated-a-forward-looking-approach-20\"></a>Projects Initiated: A Forward-Looking Approach</h3>\n<p>Given the participants’ early stage in their Web3 journey, immediate outcomes focused on foundational experiences rather than fully developed projects. However, this phase is invaluable, marking the start of an impactful venture into decentralized technologies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Future Project Potential:</strong> While immediate tangible projects were not the outcome, the groundwork has been laid for participants to embark on innovative and impactful projects as they further their journey in the Web3 space.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"challenges-and-solutions-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#challenges-and-solutions-21\"></a>Challenges and Solutions</h2>\n<p>Below, we discuss the significant challenges encountered and the solutions implemented to overcome them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-participant-familiarity-with-web3-technology-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-1-participant-familiarity-with-web3-technology-22\"></a>1. Participant Familiarity with Web3 Technology</h3>\n<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: A significant portion of the workshop participants were new to Web3 technology, which presented an initial barrier to achieving the project’s hands-on objectives, including the initiation of full-scale projects on the Arbitrum network.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Recognizing this, we adjusted our curriculum to include more foundational content on blockchain and Web3 technologies. Additionally, we implemented a phased learning approach, where participants first focused on understanding the basics before moving on to more complex concepts and hands-on activities. To provide practical experience, we guided participants through the process of deploying smart contracts to the Arbitrum network, serving as a preliminary step towards building more impactful projects in the future.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-logistical-issues-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-logistical-issues-23\"></a>2. Logistical Issues</h3>\n<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Organizing in-person workshops across multiple universities presented logistical challenges, including securing venues, ensuring reliable internet access, and adhering to students safety protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: We established strong lines of communication with the student leadership in each university early in the planning process to secure appropriate venues and address connectivity issues.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-technical-difficulties-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-3-technical-difficulties-24\"></a>3. Technical Difficulties</h3>\n<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Some participants faced technical difficulties, especially when deploying smart contracts to the Arbitrum network, due to varying levels of experience and the complexities of working with a new platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: To address this, we introduced additional support sessions focused on troubleshooting and problem-solving, facilitated by our technical team. We also provided step-by-step guides and resources tailored to the Arbitrum deployment process, ensuring participants could follow along at their own pace. Where possible, peer-to-peer support was encouraged, leveraging the knowledge within the community to help resolve issues more efficiently.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-4-maintaining-participant-engagement-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-4-maintaining-participant-engagement-25\"></a>4. Maintaining Participant Engagement</h3>\n<p>Challenge: Maintaining high levels of engagement and motivation among participants throughout the duration of the workshops was challenging, particularly for those who were completely new to the material.</p>\n<p>Solution: We took the time to explain the foundational details of the whole process without rushing. Also, we conducted post-workshop online sessions to guide those that could not deploy and provided resources for them to work at their own pace.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"financial-reporting-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#financial-reporting-26\"></a>Financial Reporting</h2>\n<p>Below is a detailed breakdown of the allocation and utilization of the grant funds throughout the various phases of the project.</p>\n<p>Total Grant Received: $9,750<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/434ef9467bb051571b017bde221b2c7482ccd2e7.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9BrbQ36YOVEDLYttkt6AcY4X4F1.png?dl=1\" title=\"web3_buidl_workshops_financial_allocation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/434ef9467bb051571b017bde221b2c7482ccd2e7_2_690x482.png\" alt=\"web3_buidl_workshops_financial_allocation\" data-base62-sha1=\"9BrbQ36YOVEDLYttkt6AcY4X4F1\" width=\"690\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/434ef9467bb051571b017bde221b2c7482ccd2e7_2_690x482.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/434ef9467bb051571b017bde221b2c7482ccd2e7_2_1035x723.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/434ef9467bb051571b017bde221b2c7482ccd2e7_2_1380x964.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4D8D1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"allocation-and-utilization-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#allocation-and-utilization-27\"></a>Allocation and Utilization:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Program Development and Curriculum Design: $900</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This portion of the budget was allocated towards the development of the workshop curriculum, including compensation for experts consulted during the curriculum design phase and necessary subscriptions including internet data, notion plus, zoom pro and eventbrite plus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Workshop Facilitation: $7,050 ($2,350 per workshop)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Venue Rental and Accommodation: $2,430 ($810 per workshop) - Costs associated with securing venues at the selected universities to host the workshops, ensuring a conducive learning environment for participants.</li>\n<li>Meals and Refreshments: $3,150 ($1,050 per workshop) - Provided to maintain high levels of participant engagement and comfort during the sessions.</li>\n<li>Facilitator Honoraria: $1,920 ($640 per workshop) - Compensation for facilitators who led the workshop sessions, recognizing their expertise and contribution to the program’s success.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Publicity: $600</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This budget line covered the costs associated with publicity activities to raise awareness of the workshops and encourage participation.

I think this would provide a very cool visual for new entrants and arb daoists.</p>\n<p>Not a dev,(yet) but in time I would create this. Maybe others can pull this off, here is a simple explanation of the design concept:</p>\n<p>Building the Visualization</p>\n<p>Data Collection and Preparation:<br>\nCollect Data: Use Arbitrum’s APIs or blockchain explorers to extract data on transactions, smart contracts, and interactions between them. Focus on identifying projects and their interactions.<br>\nPrepare Data: Process the data to highlight relationships between projects. This might involve mapping transactions to the projects initiating or receiving them and identifying smart contracts that facilitate these interactions.</p>\n<p>Network Analysis:<br>\nCreate a Graph Model: Treat each project as a node and each interaction (transactions, smart contract calls) as edges between these nodes. Use attributes to represent the volume or significance of the interactions.<br>\nAnalyze the Network: Use network analysis techniques to identify key projects (nodes with high connectivity), clusters of closely interacting projects, and the overall structure of the network.</p>\n<p>Visualization:<br>\nChoose a Visualization Tool: Options include graph visualization tools like Gephi, web-based libraries like D3.js, or programming libraries like NetworkX in Python.<br>\nDesign the Visualization: Represent the Arbitrum blockchain’s project ecosystem as a network diagram where nodes represent projects, and edges represent interactions. Customize node sizes and edge thicknesses based on metrics like transaction volume or interaction frequency. Use color coding to differentiate types of projects or activity levels.</p>\n<p>Interactive Features:<br>\nImplement Interactivity: Allow users to zoom in/out, click on nodes to get more information about projects, and filter by types of interactions or projects.<br>\nDynamic Updates: If possible, make the visualization dynamically update with new transactions and interactions to keep the overview current.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/birds-eye-view-explorer-a-network-perspective/22919\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/birds-eye-view-explorer-a-network-perspective/22919","pubDate":"Sat, 30 Mar 2024 23:35:23 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22919"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/birds-eye-view-explorer-a-network-perspective/22919.rss","#text":"Bird's Eye View Explorer: A Network Perspective"}},{"title":"Thetanuts Finance Bi-Weekly Update (29 March 2024)","dc:creator":"Thetanuts_Finance","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p>In December 2023, Thetanuts Finance saw the launch of its v3 Upgrade – entailing a major architecture revamp and brand new Trading Interface, where users could go long or short on on-chain options. While Thetanuts Finance is a multi-chain protocol, Arbitrum network is the only instance where Thetanuts Finance v3 is integrated.</p>\n<p>Thetanuts Finance began distributing $ARB rewards from Arbitrum STIP on January 29, where 200,000 $ARB was distributed equally over 8 weeks. Arbitrum STIP rewards will end on March 29.</p>\n<p>Below, we recap on the growth of our metrics on Arbitrum at each key milestone.

While these products will first be on Ethereum Mainnet, we intend to integrate them onto Arbitrum shortly – and to incentivize them using Arbitrum STIP Bridge rewards.</p>\n<p>The roadmap for the Leveraged LRT Strategy Vault includes asset coverage of other leading LRTs on Pendle – including $pufETH, $ezETH, $rsETH, and $swETH.
