How can the devs advertise their shitcoin to normies if they must complete dozens of steps just to purchase it? Well, they can pay ~$25,000 and enable card payments for the shitcoin.</p>\n<p>Or… they can use Toob.Finance for free! With the lowest fee on the market (3.8% versus 5-10% + $25k listing), no listing fee - all Arbitrum tokens are “listed” by default. Just drop the contract address and buy with a card.</p>\n<p>What is Toob Finance?<br>\nA product brought to the Arbitrum Ecosystem by Toob Dog - a memecoin on Arbitrum. We felt the need to allow card purchases as we did some advertising for normies on IG. Some joined the TG and asked how to buy Toob. Now, explain to someone with 0 experience with crypto how to DeFi, Metamask, Uniswap, Contract Address, ETH, Gas Fees, Networks. At that moment, we knew we must enable card payments for Toob.</p>\n<p>After some research, we thought, why not enable card payments for all the tokens?<br>\nAnd that’s what we did.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1bfff8557db90664e5e5ac406cd11e649c54fa1d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3ZHiUtwrJUShfz7mTHrfFGWUgDb.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1bfff8557db90664e5e5ac406cd11e649c54fa1d_2_257x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"3ZHiUtwrJUShfz7mTHrfFGWUgDb\" width=\"257\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1bfff8557db90664e5e5ac406cd11e649c54fa1d_2_257x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1bfff8557db90664e5e5ac406cd11e649c54fa1d_2_385x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1bfff8557db90664e5e5ac406cd11e649c54fa1d_2_514x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DCDBD9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>ANY Arbitrum token is available.<br>\nNo need to connect wallet.<br>\nNo KYC under 1,000$.<br>\nFast and easy checkout.</p>\n<p>It’s like Uniswap, but you buy with card.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/10d3c99f4efd490a6181de6e4da4cc697888acc5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/2oRok9zN1qhmzAZXjjBoX10Ul6t.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/10d3c99f4efd490a6181de6e4da4cc697888acc5_2_690x459.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"2oRok9zN1qhmzAZXjjBoX10Ul6t\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/10d3c99f4efd490a6181de6e4da4cc697888acc5_2_690x459.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/10d3c99f4efd490a6181de6e4da4cc697888acc5_2_1035x688.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/10d3c99f4efd490a6181de6e4da4cc697888acc5.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"5B676B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>We are working on Apple Pay integration, API for developers and Widget that devs can integrate on their website to allow fiat to their coin directly there.</p>\n<p>if you want to whitelist your token: team@toob.finance</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/introducing-toob-finance-buy-any-token-on-arbitrum-via-card-payment/24670\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/introducing-toob-finance-buy-any-token-on-arbitrum-via-card-payment/24670","pubDate":"Sun, 02 Jun 2024 01:51:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24670"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/introducing-toob-finance-buy-any-token-on-arbitrum-via-card-payment/24670.rss","#text":"Introducing Toob.Finance; Buy Any Token on Arbitrum via Card Payment"}},{"title":"Announcing the Launch of the Reclaim <> Arbitrum Grant Program!","dc:creator":"adiiHQ","category":"DAO Grant Programs","description":"<p>We are excited to announce the launch of the Reclaim &lt;&gt; Arbitrum Grant Program, designed to foster innovation and drive progress within the Reclaim ecosystem!</p>\n<p><strong>What is Reclaim Protocol?</strong></p>\n<p>Reclaim Protocol (YC W21) uses https session keys to generate zkproofs of users’ profile information.

We aim to empower our developer base and secure Arbitrum as a leading force in innovation and growth within the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Born out of the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-6-builder-pathways-towards-adoption/21510\">Betting on Builders</a> proposal from GovHack at ETHDenver 2024, we are presenting a collaborative accelerator program strategy, expected to run from Q3FY2024 through Q4FY2025. This strategy acts as a proof-of-concept for a pathway that any accelerator initiative can participate in. To begin, <a href=\"https://www.evmcapital.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EVM Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rndao.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RnDAO</a> and <a href=\"https://outlierventures.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Outlier Ventures</a> are partnering on this proposal to launch the initiative, collect data, and establish best practices.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this document is to detail our understanding of the current landscape, present a vision for advancement, propose a practical strategy, and provide specific outcomes and KPIs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thankarb-a-strategy-framework-platform-for-arbitrum-s-success/19130\">ThankARB</a>, which gathered data from 15,000 respondents within the ecosystem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We have more developers than most chains, but we don’t currently know how to best mobilize them for the benefit of the ecosystem.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We would like to try our hand at answering this question. Some opportunities for developer mobilization, which we intend to enhance with the “Infinite Launchpad” include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhancing Builder Onboarding and Support</strong>: Offering highly-tailored support at all stages (Idea through Series A) will prepare projects for commercial success or investment.</li>\n<li><strong>Creating Positive Feedback Loops</strong>: As Arbitrum’s technological stack evolves, builders can leverage the technology and benefit from their own contributions to its advancement, ensuring a symbiotic progression for both the platform and the projects it supports.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical support and product feedback</strong>: Providing technical guidance and iterative feedback is invaluable during the transition from alpha/beta stages to full project launches.</li>\n<li><strong>Enterprise contracts and funding</strong>: Providing subsequent funding opportunities for mature projects. While initial grants facilitate early-stage development, there is a void in support for scaling projects to a level where they can attract significant enterprise interest and investment, crucial for long-term sustainability and impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>To address these needs, we are asking the DAO to allot $10m in ARB from Q3FY2024 through Q4FY2025 for a program to enhance the Arbitrum developer and startup ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This initiative is designed to aid our ecosystem of developers, startups, and enterprises by providing a clear incubation track that propels innovations that include but are not limited to governance, process automation/ AI, financial infrastructure, and on-chain reputation through the help of direct collaborations with 100+ commercial partners.</p>\n<p>As teams go through the Programs, we can onboard them as Arbitrum customers, integrate them with the software stack, platforms or protocols, and support them as they become adopted in the ecosystem. If the product has significant traction, we can assess bringing them deeper into the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>How this fits into <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thankarb-a-strategy-framework-platform-for-arbitrum-s-success/19130\">Arbitrums strategic priorities</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Robust DevRel</strong>: Establishing a custom-tiered DevRel program with robust, accessible, and responsive tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance optimization</strong>: Identifying and iteratively improving key capabilities to increase DAO performance and accountability.</li>\n<li><strong>Future-proofing</strong>: Strengthening our capacity to scale Arbitrum software adoption.</li>\n<li><strong>Growing the community</strong>: Awareness, participation, efficient inquiry handling, and bias reduction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional key value opportunities for Arbitrum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Developer feedback</strong>: As the incubated projects build on Arbitrum, we can collect direct and honest feedback to be distributed to Offchain labs, Arbitrum Foundation, and other stakeholders to refine their roadmap and improve Arbitrum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Builder representation and visibility</strong>: Showcasing teams composed of individuals representing their given region, background and culture - building with Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mutual reputation building</strong>: Participating teams can enhance their credibility by claiming involvement in an Arbitrum-funded accelerator program, while also promoting the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaborative research and knowledge sharing</strong>: Research findings will be shared as insight reports, highlighting market opportunities and supporting ongoing learning and improvement for all DAO working groups (M&amp;A, Arbitrum Ventures Initiative, Foundation Grants program, Questbook programs, etc). This can be used as a public good to refine the ecosystem’s approach and de-risk capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alpha</strong>: The early development stage of a product, typically for internal testing and refinement.</li>\n<li><strong>Beta</strong>: When a more advanced version of a product is released to a broader audience for testing and feedback before the official launch.</li>\n<li><strong>Series A</strong>: When startups begin to raise capital to scale their business after the initial seed stage.</li>\n<li><strong>GTM</strong>: “Got-to-Market” strategy and execution plan for launching a startup’s product and acquiring customers.</li>\n<li><strong>MVP</strong>: “Minimum viable product” the simplest version of a product to gather feedback for future development.</li>\n<li><strong>PoC</strong>: “Proof of Concept” stage where startups validate the feasibility and viability of their product or technology.</li>\n<li><strong>EiR</strong>: Entrepreneur in Residence” an experienced entrepreneur who provides mentorship, strategic guidance, and assistance in establishing valuable business connections.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The “Betting on Builders” suite of programs work together to support projects at any stage of their journey, guiding them seamlessly from inception through Series A and beyond.

This post is aimed at sharing the technical details of this process. We share it after a technical deep dive pursued by ScopeLift, in collaboration with Tally and other Arbitrum stakeholders.</p>\n<p>No specific action is required by community members at this time. Instead, we share this post for transparency purposes, and welcome any feedback or questions the community might have.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"technical-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#technical-summary-1\"></a>Technical Summary</h3>\n<p>ScopeLift will upgrade the Arbitrum Core Governor and the Arbitrum Treasury Governor. The new Governors will have the same feature set as the current Governors with the following additional features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proposal Cancellation</strong>: During the proposal delay phase, before the voting period has started, the delegate who put the proposal onchain will have the right to cancel it. This means voting on the proposal will not proceed. This feature comes in handy in many scenarios, notably in the instance that a malformed proposal is submitted in error. In such a case, the situation can be rectified without a mass effort to notify delegates to vote against it.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible Voting</strong>: We will add ScopeLift’s <a href=\"https://flexiblevoting.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">extension</a> to the Governor which allows delegates to cast rolling, fractional votes. This is most useful when smart contract delegates are used to roll up the votes of many pooled token holders. Use cases this extension will enable include voting with tokens in DeFi, shielded voting, voting from Orbit chains, and more. Note that this extension has been <a href=\"https://blog.openzeppelin.com/scopelift-flexible-voting-audit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audited</a> and will soon be <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/5045\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">part of</a> the OZ standard Governor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ScopeLift will <strong>not</strong> upgrade the Governors using the proxy upgradeable contract pattern. The contracts will <strong>not</strong> be upgraded in place by pointing the proxies to a new implementation. Upgrades via proxy are less flexible, more time consuming, and more error prone. In the case of the Governors, a superior upgrade path is available, as described below.</p>\n<p>ScopeLift will first assemble and extensively test new Governor contracts. The contracts will be audited, then deployed on Arbitrum One. ScopeLift will then coordinate with <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Frisson</a> as the delegate who will submit proposals to each existing Governor which will transfer the proposer role on the Timelock contracts to the new Governors.</p>\n<p>If the proposals pass and execute, the new Governors will become the entry point for Arbitrum Governance moving forward. The old Governors will continue to exist onchain, but will be vestigial, with no ability to actually execute proposals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"faq-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#faq-2\"></a>FAQ</h3>\n<p>This approach might raise a number of questions. We will attempt to anticipate and answer them below.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: How will delegates know to propose and vote through the new Governors after the upgrade?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Upgrading Governors by transferring Timelock ownership is a common pattern, and Tally is set up to handle it. Immediately after the upgrade executes, Tally will be updated to use the new Governor contracts, while all historical vote data sourced from the old Governors will still be visible in the client.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Won’t upgrading the Governors require moving the treasury and assigning protocol permissions to the new contracts?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. The Timelock contracts hold the Treasury ETH and protocol permissions, because the Timelock is the contract that ultimately executes Governance proposals. This allows us to upgrade the Governors (where virtually all the logic related to governance lives) without needing to move funds or reassign protocol permissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: How will other Governance proposals be impacted by the upgrade?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Any proposal that executes before the upgrade proposal will not be impacted, even if voting on the upgrade proposal has already begun. Any proposal that is either queued or being voted on when the upgrade proposal executes could be left in limbo<sup>1</sup>. For this reason, we suggest the DAO plan to avoid non-critical proposals during the upgrade voting window.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will the new contracts be proxy upgradeable?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. Although using proxy upgradeability is not preferred in general, there are scenarios where it might be the right tool for the job. For example, adding a simple view method to the Governor might best be accomplished through a small proxy upgrade. Leaving this tool in the DAO’s toolbox is helpful. Thus, the new Governor contracts will be deployed as Transparent Proxies, using the same Proxy Admin as the existing contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will customizations made by Arbitrum to the Governor contracts be carried forward to the new Governors?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. Namely, the new Governor will have all the features provided by the extension from which it <a href=\"https://www.contractreader.io/contract/arbitrum/0x065620d99e1785ccf56fa95462d3012eb844fdc9#l2arbitrumgovernor-1-30-25\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">inherits</a>. It will also have the custom <code>onlyOwner</code> <a href=\"https://www.contractreader.io/contract/arbitrum/0x065620d99e1785ccf56fa95462d3012eb844fdc9#l2arbitrumgovernor-1-30-105\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">relay functionality</a>, and the fractional quorum which <a href=\"https://www.contractreader.io/contract/arbitrum/0x065620d99e1785ccf56fa95462d3012eb844fdc9#l2arbitrumgovernor-1-30-127\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">excludes specific tokens</a> from the quorum calculation.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is upgrading the Governors risky?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: If done carelessly, a botched upgrade could certainly cause problems. This is why ScopeLift will exercise great care in performing the upgrade.</p>\n<p>In particular, ScopeLift will assemble the new Governor using the latest version the OpenZeppelin contracts upgradeable library, along with ScopeLift’s fully audited Flexible Voting extension. We will then write a large suite of tests and simulations to ensure the upgrade will be successful, and that all DAO operations will be able to proceed normally after it is completed.</p>\n<p>Based on our previous experience with Gitcoin, PoolTogether, Radworks, and others, we expect this test suite will include hundreds of tests and thousands of lines of code.</p>\n<p>These tests simulate the upgrade to the new Governor, from deployment, proposal, Governance vote, and future votes by the DAO. The tests run on a “forked” state from Arbitrum One to simulate the closest possible production state. They exercise all scenarios before and after the upgrade, and ensure governance will still function properly after it is completed.</p>\n<p>We will also write scripts for deploying the new Governor and for submitting a proposal for the upgrade to the existing Governor. The scripts will be exercised by the tests.</p>\n<p>All tests and simulations are specific to Arbitrum. They exercise the actual code that is live on the network in a simulated environment. They will ensure the upgraded Governor can manage the DAO treasury and execute its role within the protocol.</p>\n<p>These tests will be written as fuzz tests and invariant tests, meaning they will take random arbitrary inputs rather than hardcoded parameters. We will execute millions of scenarios through these tests before proceeding.</p>\n<p>The entire codebase will be carefully audited by the OpenZeppelin team before being deployed. Finally, the tests will also be updated to run with the actual, deployed bytecode, and with the proposal calldata, once both are live onchain.</p>\n<p>ScopeLift has executed on this process for other DAOs. With these safeguards in place, we are confident the upgrade can be completed with minimal risk and without disruption to the DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"timeline-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-3\"></a>Timeline</h3>\n<p>ScopeLift has already begun preliminary work on this process, and will be accelerating on it in the weeks ahead. We are aiming to complete the work by the end of June, such that the contracts can be audited in early July. The DAO should expect a proposal for the upgrade to be submitted in mid-July at the earliest.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><sup>1</sup> It is, in fact, possible to graft old proposal state onto the new governor so that even mid-flight proposals stay valid. This approach would increase complexity and risk, and on balance, we don’t find it worthwhile vs. the alternative, i.e. a short window during which no new proposals should be created.</p>\n

provide insights on best practices in order to help the Arbitrum DAO distribute grant funding for scalable, impactful growth.</p>\n<p>Our invite-only participants have demonstrated great interest in managing their own grant programs, in areas of their expertise, through our application process and our goal is to not only empower their mission, but to also help facilitate the intricacies within the grant funding process.</p>\n<p>For our introductory Planning Grants Workshop, we covered various topics to kick off our thought process behind planning grant programs:</p>\n<p>Planning Grant Workshop Overview section was to go over the high-level goals and details that come with it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rewarding participants for further refining their grant program proposals, claimable at end of ThankARB Season 10</li>\n<li>Attending our Workshops to assure alignment with ThankARB &amp; Arbitrum DAO</li>\n<li>Not guaranteed for future funding - ThankARB is selecting 10 to 15 programs to fund</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We went over our Timeline to give grant program managers an idea of how long we expect these programs to run.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\"

Our grants are funded in $ARB so we emphasize the need to plan accordingly</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For our last topic, we focused on scalability. It’s important for our grant program managers to demonstrate scalability with their program. If they received 10x the funding, would they be able to achieve 10x the results or more? We ask our grant program managers to think about the scalability of their programs and consider the potential impact they could make for the Arbitrum DAO as the ecosystem continues to grow.</p>\n<p>We are looking to make drastic improvements within the DAO ecosystem, and in order to do so we intend to focus on winners by scaling their programs as much as they can.</p>\n<p>All in all, we’re extremely grateful for the participation in these meetings as it helps us not only understand the thoughts behind these amazing grant program ideas but to also reflect on potential hurdles and avenues of improvement. The Arbitrum DAO has an endless pool of exceptional talent and we have full intention to harness that talent for the betterment of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We can’t wait to review the refined proposals, select our grantees, and roll out these grant programs to help fund &amp; scale our Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Onward &amp; upward.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/planning-grants-workshops-hosted-by-thank-arb/24535\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/planning-grants-workshops-hosted-by-thank-arb/24535","pubDate":"Thu, 30 May 2024 17:57:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24535"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/planning-grants-workshops-hosted-by-thank-arb/24535.rss","#text":"Planning Grants Workshops - Hosted by Thank ARB"}},{"title":"Proposal: The Startup Collective - Ecosystem Growth in Arbitrum.","dc:creator":"scollen","category":"Proposals","description":"<p>This proposal is the work of the team behind <a href=\"https://elixircapital.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Elixir Capital</a> in collaboration with members of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

This proposal establishes the Arbitrum Startup Collective, a comprehensive program designed to accelerate and bring capital to promising early-stage startups building on or migrating to the Arbitrum protocol and its related product suite.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has successfully launched several initiatives to attract new users and liquidity to Arbitrum through initiatives like grant programs for idea-stage and pre-seed startups (e.g RnDAO, PL, etc), and incentive programs (STIP, Backfund, LTIPP) for later-stage players and established protocols.</p>\n<p>Building on this success, the Arbitrum ecosystem is now ready to explore other models (not grant-based) for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling startups beyond early stages: Supporting the growth of ventures that emerge from existing programs.</li>\n<li>Attracting top teams building on Arbitrum: Enticing high-caliber startups, particularly those in the Seed to Series A stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In collaboration with the Arbitrum DAO, the current founders’ community, and the wider stakeholders; our initiative will aim to support and invest in up to 150 high-potential startups at the Seed to Series A stage and across verticals in the Arbitrum ecosystem over a three year period.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivations-2\"></a>Motivations</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>New model for ecosystem development</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the current up-cycle in the industry, there is a tremendous opportunity for growth and innovation. New market cycles bring higher token prices, which historically attract new builders and new users. Data from <a href=\"https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=22411-monthly-active-open-source-developers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Electric capital’s developer report</a> shows that the number of developers grew 3x during the 2021 bull market and grew 10x in the 2017 bull market.</p>\n<p>Ethereum aside, Polygon and Solana are the top two ecosystems which have attracted more developers than any other ecosystem. Both have been amongst the most active in running venture-style ecosystem development programs such as the Polygon Accelerator, the Polygon Venture fund, the Polygon Village initiative, the Solana Ecosystem Fund, Solana Hackers House, and the Solana Super Team initiatives.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Why does Arbitrum need this initiative?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Arbitrum requires strategic investment initiatives to maintain its rapid growth and solidify its position as a leading ecosystem. While Arbitrum has achieved impressive success with a strong user base and Total Value Locked (TVL), competitors like Optimism and Polygon have deployed significantly more capital to fuel their ecosystem growth. Today, there are programs tackling both ends of the start-up growth spectrum in the Arbitrum ecosystem (refer diagram below) but it seems there is a clear gap at the Seed to Series A level.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hWV1uesBBQ3Gj0DEdWuBdbAHLmO.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_449x164.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hWV1uesBBQ3Gj0DEdWuBdbAHLmO\" width=\"449\" height=\"164\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_449x164.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_673x246.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_898x328.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D6E0E9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Building a successful venture ecosystem cannot rely solely on capital deployed; it is about enabling existing participants, providing structured value creation &amp; support to new participants, and creating hyper-connectivity - that ultimately reinforces a powerful ecosystem growth flywheel.</p>\n<p>Leading startup accelerators like Y Combinator and Techstars demonstrate the power of structured programs. These programs cultivate vibrant communities where startups collaborate, invest in each other, and attract top talent, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth (e.g Paypal “mafia” - the initial group of people who were with PayPal during its early days and that went on to establish influential companies like Tesla, SpaceX, LinkedIn, YouTube, Yelp, and many more).</p>\n<p>The proposed Arbitrum Startup Collective targets strategic investments in up to 150 Arbitrum-focused companies at Seed to Series A stage with a comprehensive support program. This approach stimulates network effects, attracting talent while providing startups with a compelling capital and value creation proposition.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective will activate existing builders and ecosystem participants to serve as mentors and experts, while our team will be responsible for program management, community building across several regions, and founders’ support initiatives. This proposal is a long-term investment that will create lasting value within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>By establishing this Arbitrum Startup Collective now, Arbitrum can continue to solidify its leadership position and propel the network to explosive growth.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What is the expected impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ecosystem funds have historically played a crucial role as growth catalysts for emerging protocols and ecosystems, especially for the growth of developers and decentralized applications (dApps). As a result, new wallets have emerged, contributing to the growth of total value locked (TVL) and ultimately driving growth of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We believe that the Arbitrum Startup Collective will help achieve the following objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funnel capital into the best start-ups building on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Drive adoption of Arbitrum among developers and dApps</li>\n<li>Provide high quality diligence and support to reputable (Web2 &amp; Web3) investors to deploy in Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Geographical diversification and stronger localization in key regions</li>\n<li>Increase the Arbitrum DAO treasury through investments returns</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"initiative-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#initiative-summary-3\"></a>Initiative Summary</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective aims to supercharge the ecosystem by fueling promising startups, attracting developers and dApps, driving more capital into the ecosystem, and ultimately maximizing returns for the Arbitrum DAO treasury.</p>\n<p>a- Growth stage:</p>\n<p>The initiative is designed to tackle three stages of growth to cover the startup lifecycle and provide optimal impact to the Arbitrum ecosystem through tracks of support and investing:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9cbe08baf60fd2f878c6408aa5db48aef94e4c1d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/mmBD9MCjVmTiet2DPrbmTCXNP8V.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9cbe08baf60fd2f878c6408aa5db48aef94e4c1d.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"mmBD9MCjVmTiet2DPrbmTCXNP8V\" width=\"624\" height=\"363\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"EBECE8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The program is envisioned as a three-year initiative. This timeframe acknowledges the maturity cycle of accelerator models and allows for cross-fertilization between different programs within the Startup Collective (e.g., scout program feeding into scale and follow-on programs).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Scout Program (Pre-Seed Focus): To identify the most promising founders in the ecosystem, we propose to leverage a Scout Network composed of experienced entrepreneurs and angel investors deeply familiar with the Arbitrum ecosystem. These scouts significantly extend the reach by leveraging their networks and industry knowledge to uncover innovative ideas before a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Scouts get access to promising startups through various channels, including inbound, referrals through their network, and industry events. This proactive approach allows us to spot ventures before traditional funding rounds, ensuring we capture the most disruptive and impactful ideas for the Arbitrum ecosystem and serve as a feeder to the Scale Program (described below).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scale Program (Seed to Series A stage): These companies already have a product with early users, or demonstrate early signs of success. Seed funding rounds are typically led by venture capitalists to complete product launches and refine growth models. Alongside a capital investment, the Arbitrum Startup Collective offers a structured program to provide additional support and value creation (details below). This program will go beyond just deploying capital and equip startups with the resources they need to thrive, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mentorship: Connect with experienced builders, advisors and mentors who will provide strategic guidance and industry insights.</li>\n<li>Network Access: Gain access to a network of investors, partners, and potential customers within the Arbitrum ecosystem and beyond.</li>\n<li>Technical Resources: Benefit from workshops, educational programs, and access to technical resources to accelerate product development.</li>\n<li>Community Building: Facilitate connections and collaboration between startups within the program and the broader Arbitrum community.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Follow-on (Series A+): For top performers from within the portfolio, the plan is to double down on winners to support them in later stages and maximize upside. Follow-on investments will be limited to companies coming from the Scout or Scale program described above who are proven to increase activity or adoption of Arbitrum</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>b- Geographical focus:</p>\n<p>The initial focus of this initiative will be on Europe, Middle East, and South Asia to allow us to leverage our existing expertise and connections within this region. Although the program is fully remote and there are no requirements for teams to be located at any specific place, there will be in person events organized during the program to drive more collaboration between the teams.</p>\n<p>c- Sector focus:</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective is not sector specific and would consider startups across various sectors as long as they build on or plan to integrate with Arbitrum technology. However, to avoid any overlap with the RnDAO or the GCP initiative, collaboration tools and gaming will be specifically excluded from the Arbitrum Startup Collective to avoid any overlap.</p>\n<p>Expected Outcome</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective is designed to achieve a lasting impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem by fostering a vibrant community of talented developers, entrepreneurs, and users. The key expected outcomes for this initiative include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Innovation: This initiative will act as a catalyst for the success of promising early-stage startups building on Arbitrum. We target up to 150 startups to join or grow in the Arbitrum ecosystem through this initiative. A high percentage of the portfolio companies will achieve significant milestones, generate user activity within the ecosystem, and potentially lead to the launch of groundbreaking startups.</li>\n<li>Network Growth: This initiative will contribute to the creation of a dynamic and engaged Arbitrum ecosystem and we expect the launch of over 10 Orbit chains, fostering a rich and diverse ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) built on Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Financial Returns: This initiative is designed to generate a strong return on investment for the Arbitrum DAO (structured as investments - not grants - with the Arbitrum DAO retaining upside). By strategically investing in high-growth companies and fostering a thriving ecosystem, we aim to deliver exceptional financial returns for the DAO upon the fund’s maturity.</li>\n<li>Attracting Capital: The success of this initiative in fostering innovation and attracting high-caliber startups is expected to generate significant interest from other investors. We anticipate securing co-investment and follow-on capital from these investors - further fueling the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By delivering on these ambitious yet attainable goals, the Arbitrum Startup Collective will propel Arbitrum to the forefront of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"program-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-details-4\"></a>Program Details</h1>\n<p>a- Scout Program</p>\n<p>Scouts are existing members of the Arbitrum DAO or community, experienced entrepreneurs with strong expertise in different domains, and likely already angel investors with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by early-stage founders inside and outside of Web3.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hOLJGGjmqT3gJCvnaxOKrvaDhlQ.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-31 at 18.43.41\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6_2_690x376.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-31 at 18.43.41\" data-base62-sha1=\"hOLJGGjmqT3gJCvnaxOKrvaDhlQ\" width=\"690\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6_2_690x376.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6_2_1035x564.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E3E5E2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Once elected, Scouts can invest capital into opportunities by following the process below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Submit an investment memo to the Arbitrum Startup Collective team</li>\n<li>The investment team will review if all investment criteria are met, including that capital is directed to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Arbitrum Startup Collective team will conduct expedited due diligence to ensure the capital is being appropriately allocated (e.g. sanctions, background checks, conflict of interest, etc) and other factors that maintain the reputation of the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>The Arbitrum Startup Collective team will review the legal documentation and ensure it is appropriate for such investment (priority will be given to simplicity and using market standard documentation when possible e.g predominantly SAFE, token warrants, and SAFTs as appropriate)</li>\n<li>Capital is deployed directly into the start-up by the Arbitrum Startup Collective investment vehicle</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: Please note that these are structured as investments, not grants. The investments are made through the Arbitrum Startup Collective investment vehicle which will have the Arbitrum DAO as its sole investor. The Arbitrum DAO will therefore retain exposure to the upside from these investments and will receive distributions upon exit.</p>\n<p>The Scouts will be incentivized and compensated for their contribution through an allocation of up to 10% of the upside generated from the investments attributed to them (i.e. if a scout refers a $50,000 investment that is subsequently exited with net proceeds of $500,000; that scout would receive $50,000 compensation).

This agreement will clearly define the scope of work, outlining Elixir Capital’s responsibilities in detail including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Startup identification, application process, and selection</li>\n<li>Cohort management and program delivery, including mentorship, workshops, and events</li>\n<li>Regular reporting and communication with the Arbitrum DAO Oversight Committee</li>\n<li>Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The service agreement will establish clear performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the service provider. Regular reviews will be conducted by the Arbitrum DAO (through the Oversight Committee) to assess performance against these metrics.</p>\n<p>The service provider’s compensation will be structured to incentivize strong performance and alignment with program goals. It is based on a fixed fee basis to cover core program management activities and is paid based on specific milestones.</p>\n<p>In the event of underperformance or non-compliance with the service agreement, the Arbitrum DAO will have the right to terminate the agreement with reasonable notice. A clear process for transitioning program management to a new service provider will be outlined within the agreement.</p>\n<p>Investment Agreement</p>\n<p>A separate investment agreement will govern the management of funds allocated to the Arbitrum Startup Collective. This agreement will establish a framework that ensures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investor Upside: The Arbitrum DAO, as the investor, retains upside generated from the program’s investments.</li>\n<li>Investment Management: Elixir Capital will be accountable for managing the deployed funds effectively, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio oversight, and exit strategies.</li>\n<li>Investor Liability Protection: The investment agreement will be structured to limit the liability of the Arbitrum DAO as the investor. It will function as a legal shield, protecting the DAO from potential liabilities arising from the fund’s activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the investment nature of the program, we will appoint a professional fund administrator (such as NAV Consulting, Formidium, etc) to manage the vehicle and ensure compliance with the investment agreement. This appointment offers several benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliance: The fund administrator ensures adherence to the investment agreement and relevant regulations.</li>\n<li>Transparency: They provide independent oversight and reporting on the investment portfolio.</li>\n<li>Risk Management: Fund administrators mitigate risks associated with fund operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The investment capital will be contributed to the investment vehicle following a capital call schedule which would likely be twice annually to fund program activities and investments. Upon successful exits, the generated returns and distributions will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO, the sole investor in the program. The investment agreement will include clawback provisions that allow the Arbitrum DAO to recoup investment funds if they are not invested within the investment period.</p>\n<p>The investment manager compensation will be structured to incentivize strong performance and alignment with program goals. It is based on a combination of a fixed management fee and a performance-based fee that incentivizes the investment manager to generate strong returns on the invested capital.</p>\n<p>Note: A formal contractual agreement ensures clarity, transparency, and accountability in the program’s execution and delivery.

We estimate the funds will last for 3 years of operation and the Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to collect any service fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Refund L1 gas costs.</strong> 400 ETH to reimburse all L1 gas costs for active proposers who are actively advancing the chain and defending against malicious challenges, assuming 1 challenge per year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal is contingent on the proposal “<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1\">AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD</a>” being approved by the ArbitrumDAO. If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD does not pass - then the Arbitrum Foundation will return the funds, in its entirety, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days of the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1\">BOLD proposal</a> being hypothetically rejected.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1\">AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD</a> is scoped to only propose the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet include the introduction of an economic incentive mechanism. In the absence of an economic incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-terms-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-3\"></a><strong>Key Terms</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One honest party.</strong> In BoLD, a single party has the capability to protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.</li>\n<li><strong>Assertion.</strong> A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum rollup inbox contract that are ordered by the Sequencer.</li>\n<li><strong>Assertion bond.</strong> Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the submitter to join the validator set by putting up a large bond, in the form of (currently) 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion.</li>\n<li><strong>Proposer.</strong> An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Active proposer.</strong> A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping to advance the chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Service fee.</strong> A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions. The fee is paid for every on-chain assertion posted by the proposer.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenge bond.</strong> The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the big-step and one-step challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"budget-request-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#budget-request-4\"></a><strong>Budget Request</strong></h1>\n<p>This section focuses on the budget request from the ArbitrumDAO treasury alongside the motivation for why the funding is required.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"assertion-and-challenge-bonds-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#assertion-and-challenge-bonds-5\"></a>Assertion and Challenge Bonds</h2>\n<p>We are requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO treasury to cover the bonds required to establish a single honest proposer with the capability to defend the system.</p>\n<p>The requested ETH is a combination of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3600 ETH required to post an assertion bond, and;</li>\n<li>Subsequent 555 ETH + 79 ETH for challenge bonds for one challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation will deposit these funds in the <code>RollupCore.sol</code> contracts on L1 Ethereum for the validator. If the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1\">BoLD AIP</a> passes, then the Arbitrum Foundation’s staked validator will be enabled to immediately act as a proposer for Arbitrum One</p>\n<p><em>Note: the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to be the first active validator, not the ONLY validator. BOLD removes the reliance on a permissioned set of validators, and any interested parties and/or teams can permissionlessly run nodes and validators for Arbitrum chains upon a successful upgrade of the dispute protocol.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"service-fees-for-bold-validators-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#service-fees-for-bold-validators-6\"></a>Service Fees for BOLD Validators</h2>\n<p>All blockchain systems, including Arbitrum, should reward participants who actively work to advance the system.</p>\n<p>In the case of Arbitrum, the DAO will pay a service fee to an active proposer who is helping to advance the system by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet. At the time of writing, the estimated annual income is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH, according to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr\">Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices</a>.</p>\n<p>We must highlight that this payment is a fee and not a reward. In BoLD, a new assertion can be posted every round (1 hour) and only a single fee is paid per round. There can be multiple agents who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1. The proposer whose assertion is accepted by L1 and paid the service fee is called the active proposer for this round. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. Meanwhile, if an entity, say Bob, has posted a successor assertion to one previously made by another entity, Alice, then Bob would be considered by the protocol to be the current active proposer. Alice would no longer be considered by the protocol as the active proposer and once Alice’s assertion is confirmed, then Alice gets her assertion bond refunded.</p>\n<p>We estimate the following service fee per year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Foundation is therefore requesting 500 ETH to support service fee payments for up to 3 years (with a buffer of 68 ETH in case the average Ethereum validator income increases) in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. Moving forward, the DAO may consider allocating a portion of ETH from the ArbitrumDAO governed chains’ sequencer fees to fund the ongoing service fees for active proposers.</p>\n<p>To learn more, please read the section on <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7\">Service Fees in the BOLD AIP</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7\"></a>Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs</h2>\n<p>We are requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain.

Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The ArbitrumDAO reserves the right to revoke the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and return the bonds back to the treasury.

To date, RWAs represent a small percentage of Arbitrum’s builder activity, accounting for 1.1% of grants in 2023. It is critical for Arbitrum to take the lead and future-proof platform growth, especially when competitors like Polygon and Avalanche have made significant strides in tokenizing assets on their platforms.</p>\n<p>As promised, we are sharing the summary notes and resources from our session for those who were unable to attend or want to review! Additionally, we now have a dedicated TG channel for comms and questions on this keep topic (h/t Robin Nagpal).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To join the Arbitrum DAO RWA Group on Telegram, click <a href=\"https://t.me/+H0zCKfluNbliMDVh\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"i-key-highlights-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#i-key-highlights-2\"></a><strong>I. Key Highlights</strong></h2>\n<p>The session began with an introduction to the topic of RWAs and their relevance to Arbitrum,  followed by presentations from Devansh and PaperImperium of GFXLabs. After, we heard in-depth presentations from industry leaders Chainlink, Karpatkey, and Gauntlet. The 60-minute session concluded with an open-ended Q&amp;A period, allowing community members to engage directly on RWAs with these experts.

A longer report is coming, and for now we looked at the top 5. A few insights are emerging:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Many of the top delegates are active in multiple DAOs. Clearly a good way to facilitate communication and partnerships, and also a potential source for conflict of interests.</li>\n<li>Looking at the top delegates is a good way to identify lesser known, up and coming DAOs, which draw their interest. See an example in the tweet.</li>\n<li>An open question. Are the top delegates the new financial elite, managing 10s of billions of USD value in top tokens?</li>\n<li>Another open question: are we seeing delegation as a force of centralization, or the opposite, are they a 2nd power center, balancing the power with the original team and the foundation?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’re working on more data and insights.

class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>OpenZeppelin, as the Security Member of the ARDC, was asked to review the recent <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/24\">Event Horizon proposal</a> that passed its <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x66fd48c246080260275e60e327b4d14d3ca202c6d13aba17e970c55536b44664\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">snapshot vote</a>. We have been asked by the DAO to provide security considerations for voters when the proposal reaches its on-chain Tally vote. We have generally formed our review process from <a href=\"https://defisafety.com/documentation-09\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi Safety’s scoring process</a> to set expectations for Event Horizon’s security posture and make recommendations to mitigate risk.</p>\n<p>In the course of our review, we discussed many of our findings with the Event Horizon team and found their team to be responsive and helpful with our inquiries. We now share our findings and recommendations below to help the Event Horizon team improve their security stance and to better inform Arbitrum delegates on the potential risks that should be carefully considered before moving to an on-chain vote.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"review-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#review-summary-2\"></a>Review Summary</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"team-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#team-3\"></a>Team</h2>\n<p>The Event Horizon Team first began publishing work in July 2023. They have an active Discord and have been very responsive to user questions there and in other community forums. They have an active <a href=\"https://docs.eventhorizon.vote/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documentation site</a> which highlights their projects including DAO token staking. They have also written several blog articles about DAO governance on their blog.</p>\n<p>The Event Horizon team has been operating and participating in DAO voting for over a year. They have also recently received large-scale delegations from communities such as <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin</a>. It’s important to note that some of their <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/24#specification-6\">stated claims</a> of performance in other DAOs is based on voting activity, not total delegations. For example, they claim to be the “10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem” but they are only the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/delegates\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">108th largest delegate listed on Tally</a>. We point out this distinction to ensure that readers do not conflate active voter with total delegation rankings. The Event Horizon team also provided further clarification on the terminology used:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“voter” and “delegate” are clearly completely different terms. The clarification being a highlight that we don’t say “delegate” we say “voter” and voter is different than delegate. Many delegates have never voted. Aave as an example, the vast majority of the largest delegates are not <em>voters</em>. Again, given most large delegates haven’t voted or are “ghost delegates”, “voter” is the salient metric.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe encourage Arbitrum community members to be familiar with the team behind this proposal and fully understand the context and claims of their past performance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"code-documentation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#code-documentation-4\"></a>Code &amp; Documentation</h2>\n<p>The proposal’s voting system as described needs to aggregate votes and submit them on-chain by the described logic. All of this occurs today off-chain by code that is currently unavailable for scrutiny. The Event Horizon team did inform us that their architecture utilizes the <a href=\"https://docs.snapshot.org/tools/snapshot.js\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a> and <a href=\"https://apidocs.tally.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tally</a> SDK &amp; APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nOpenZeppelin believes strongly in the trust that comes from on-chain deployments and largely eschews projects where the code is not available. We encourage Event Horizon to deploy all of their voting logic on-chain and/or open up their architecture for public scrutiny before it goes live for usage on Arbitrum delegations. The Event Horizon stated their intent to address this recommendation with the following response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding documentation of off-chain systems, we’ll include it in our public documentation and make it easily visible from our web client.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is one component that is on mainnet: the required voter pass. It is an upgradeable contract and its source code is hosted <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/hvaxlaunch/blob/main/contracts/HVAXVoterCard.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. Relevant addresses are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voter Pass Proxy Contract: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4E911626Fa378cC95fB1A26Cc272c070eF79e4b7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>0x4E911626Fa378cC95fB1A26Cc272c070eF79e4b7</code></a></li>\n<li>Voter Pass Implementation Contract: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x68fecd506273714b25b0293f26dc40e5fc041c28\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>0x68fECD506273714B25B0293F26dC40E5fc041c28</code></a></li>\n<li>Voter Pass Owner: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xFAD69Bd739c64cC8e3f1C3bb3B60fe4f160174Cc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>0xFAD69Bd739c64cC8e3f1C3bb3B60fe4f160174Cc</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposal requires the development of an Arbitrum-specific <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/franchiser\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">“franchiser”</a> contract which allows the DAO to control the delegated tokens. Event Horizon references an existing Uniswap version that was reportedly audited by Trail of Bits. That audit report has not been published but the results are reportedly available as GitHub issues <a href=\"https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%28TOB\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe recommend that the Franchiser contract be subjected to a security audit before being deployed (as is suggested by the Event Horizon proposal). This could be conducted through either the Arbitrum Foundation or with OpenZeppelin directly as a member of the ARDC. In any case, the audit should be completed and published before any delegations are assigned.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-access-control-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#security-access-control-5\"></a>Security &amp; Access Control</h2>\n<p>The currently deployed <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4E911626Fa378cC95fB1A26Cc272c070eF79e4b7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Voter Pass contract</a> previously mentioned has a <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xFAD69Bd739c64cC8e3f1C3bb3B60fe4f160174Cc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">single EOA</a> as its owner and is upgradable without a timelock. If the Owner EOA were to be compromised, it could be used to manipulate delegated votes.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe recommend that Event Horizon use an M-of-N multi-sig for any ownership roles in the Voter Pass contract and any other contracts that impact Arbitrum delegations. We also recommend that the Event Horizon team consider implementing a timelock for upgradable contracts and/or make public commitments for how upgrades will be performed in a safe and transparent manner. Regarding the Multi-sig, the Event Horizon team stated their intent to address this recommendation with the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the VoterPass ownership - I think that’s a good recommendation. We will change to a Multi-Sig.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the tokens are to be delegated and not outright transferred, there should be no risk of losing custodial control of the 7M $ARB as long as the Franchiser contract is secure. The worst-case risk aside from Event Horizon’s accounts being compromised, is if Event Horizon acts as a bad-faith delegate and allocates the votes contrary to how they promised.</p>\n<p>In these cases, Event Horizon states that an <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523\">Oversight Committee</a> multi-sig made up of “5 existing, notable delegates” will have ownership control over the Franchiser contract where delegations are received which will enable them to veto votes. However, Event Horizon <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/9\">later stated</a> that this Oversight Committee will only be able to force Event Horizon delegations to abstain from a vote and nothing else.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to note that the Event Horizon team states that the Oversight Committee will only have 24 hours to veto decisions “between the closing of the Event Horizon proposal, and the underlying DAO’s proposal”. It could be challenging for a 3-of-5 multisig to identify a vote that should be vetoed and sign a transaction within this 24 hour period, although the Oversight Committee could still enact a veto anytime prior to the the closing of the Event Horizon proposal if a problem was detected early-on.</p>\n<p>The current setup in the <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/franchiser/blob/f91fff5face262a2306576a9e0b49c257d131f4a/src/Franchiser.sol#L195\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Franchiser contract</a> allows the Owner role to recall delegations, which may be desirable if the Event Horizon system is ever compromised or the voter pools begin acting in bad-faith. When discussing this mechanic with the Event Horizon team, they stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While the proposal doesn’t explicitly state that the DAO can undelegate, we think it’s a useful function to allow the DAO to undelegate through the OC (Oversight Committee) should they wish. The OC would operate through the DAO for this. To clarify: the OC cannot remove delegation per the constraints of the proposal. even though they technically can. a kosher removal of delegation would first have to be approved by the DAO on tally and then can be carried out by the OC</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe recommend that Arbitrum delegates carefully think through the responsibility and powers of the Oversight Committee to manage the delegations to Event Horizon. We recommend a greater time window than 24 hours for the Oversight Committee to make vetos and that the powers to recall delegations also be retained in the Franchiser contract for emergency scenarios. We encourage a careful selection process for delegates to serve on the Oversight Committee to ensure they can actively monitor and manage the delegations assigned to Event Horizon and respond to potential issues.</p>\n<p>Overall, it’s important to emphasize that the Oversight Committee serves a critical function of managing the ARB delegations to Event Horizon and would be the DAO’s primary responder to any security or governance issues that might arise. All other access control permissions maintained by the Event Horizon team in other contracts should be protected and restricted to minimize their potential impact over the ARB delegations.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-6\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>We’ve provided several important security recommendations here that we encourage the Event Horizon team to implement in their system to enhance the system’s transparency and security stance before deploying any contracts to be used for ARB delegations. We have also highlighted several risks and concerns that Arbitrum delegators should consider in their decisions regarding the Event Horizon proposal as well as the selection for the Oversight Committee.

combined with a dynamic caller premium, allowed the exploiter to profit from their own liquidations.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Looking back at the details of the exploit, I believed, and still do, that the main issue was a lack of coverage.</p>\n<p>The review for this change was a small, short, solo review, instead of what we have come to call a Security Contest, in which tens if not hundreds of professional whitehats all compete to find the most unique bugs.</p>\n<p>Not enough eyes went through this change before it was enacted.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While the Exploit looked very complex from the outside, it could have been caught with a single global property: “No Direct Action should make an account Liquidatable”.</p>\n<p>The check would allow the fuzzer to do what’s best, try random stuff, and show you what it was able to produce.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was from these two incidents that I decided to do something about this</p>\n<p>Initially, I wrote my own code generation tool for foundry, which would set some automated calls, and it would then check for an attacker having a gain in value at the end of that sequence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Example output from codegen tool<br>\n<a

href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#context-1\"></a>Context:</h1>\n<p>This proposal picks up from the conversations we had in Denver and 6 weeks of running the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI) Working Group, including weekly workshops, async conversations, and multiple 1-1s with delegates.</p>\n<p>We’ve confirmed existing pain points within the community, formulated an overall vision for the Arbitrum Venture Initiative, developed a high-level strategy for deployment, and started aligning with interested parties.</p>\n<p>We are planning to submit a pilot phase proposal for a Snapshot vote this week based on all the feedback received so far, with a focus on developing a concrete strategy (thesis) for funds deployment and test case with allocators (VCs and other programs) while advancing stakeholder alignment. This will enable the initiative to launch successfully once the appropriate legal setup is ready and avoid delays leading to significant opportunity costs for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We want to make sure to highlight our commitment to integrate the work that we are doing into any larger construct/umbrella that the DAO decides on if this should materialize and not create any conflicting workstreams. As well as to make all the learnings and insights produced available to the DAO or Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p>Further context in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-proposal-non-constitutional-establishment-of-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-avi/23222\">original AVI proposal</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/announcing-the-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-working-group/23012\">AVI workgroup thread</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>Our team’s mission is to enable the Arbitrum DAO to boost the development and financial sustainability by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>defining an effective approach for ArbitrumDAO to setup an Ecosystem Fund that would fund ventures aligned with the ecosystem through venture programs (e.g. VCs, venture builders, accelerators, etc.) and direct investing;</li>\n<li>and then executing on the said approach.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal is focused on a ‘pilot sprint’, where we’ll:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Facilitate an IRL thesis development event and series of online workshops leading up to it, together with experts and the key stakeholders to develop the thesis and strategy in agreed-upon target areas for venture programs;</li>\n<li>In parallel do a market consultation with at least 30 founders and 15 funds, to test how the market sees the opportunity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The learnings and resulting thesis will be documented in a report to equip the delegates and group working on the thesis with the relevant insights.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"why-conduct-a-pilot-sprint-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#why-conduct-a-pilot-sprint-3\"></a>Why conduct a pilot sprint?</h1>\n<p>Operating AVI represents a bold and pioneering initiative for blockchain ecosystems and as such it is also a complex undertaking that involves high capital needs. It also is one of several such in the Arbitrum DAO that require complex stakeholder alignment around setting up legal and governance structures. Thus, it is not appropriate to rush it before the relevant structures have been put in place.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there is a significant opportunity cost in not progressing with good velocity on at least the components that can already clearly be acted on. A lean and pragmatic pilot phase to analyze key themes thoroughly and develop the necessary clarity will provide us with a solid foundation to build on.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"pilot-sprint-approach-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pilot-sprint-approach-4\"></a>Pilot sprint approach</h1>\n<p>The pilot sprint outputs intend to provide the DAO delegates and stakeholders with sufficient information to decide on advancing the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI), or parts of it into the next phase of development, including its operationalisation and funding requirements. The sprint is designed to fund the operational team for 8-weeks long and is the natural progression of our existing Working Group efforts. As well as hosting a series of activities, workshops and an IRL thesis development event. The later would run before the 8 week sprint and and after it shaping up an overall timeline of up to 18 weeks depending on the approval date and scheduling constraints of various stakeholders.</p>\n<p>The sprint will kick off in-depth research and workshops to identify opportunity areas (thesis development).</p>\n<p>The pilot sprint will provide concrete data and analysis from various ecosystem participants and stakeholders. Armed with this information, we will have the strategic perspective (thesis development) ready for AVI’s operation.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"key-output-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-output-5\"></a>Key Output</h1>\n<p>An in-depth report detailing a shared, well-researched understanding in the Arbitrum community of where the opportunities related to investment lie.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Expected Outcomes</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Equip the DAO delegates and community participants with a deeper shared understanding about a strategy and approach to a coordinated and optimized horizontal strategy for Ecosystem funding and venture development.</li>\n<li>Align the DAO on strategic targets by providing strategic analysis and coordinating key stakeholders and delegates.</li>\n<li>Provide a platform for open discussion as well as active collaboration as we advance towards the next phase of the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI).</li>\n<li>Engage a broad range of builders, capital allocators and talent around new ventures and value creation related to Arbitrum, while embedding their needs and ideas with deep empathy in future design.</li>\n<li>Produce general exposure and community engagement.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\nDeliverables\n<ol>\n<li>3 market opportunity mapping workshops (online)*A.</li>\n<li>3 Briefs for Delegates to prepare for the Thesis Building Event</li>\n<li>1 AVI Thesis Building event where key experts related to the thesis will be invited (1-day event in London / 20-40 ppl).*B</li>\n<li>1 public evening event (on the same day as the thesis event), during which key insights and talks will be presented including a bigger community (80 - 120 ppl). *C</li>\n<li>30 interviews with builders.</li>\n<li>15 interviews with General Partners and other fund managers from various ecosystems</li>\n<li>A Synthesis Market Consultation Report summarizing key challenges and opportunity areas that the VC funding should address. *D</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<p>A* Examples of thesis exploration ideas that would be discussed during the online workshops and honed down on during the IRL event. DeSci and DePIN are two important current trends. DeSci is interesting from an Arbitrum perspective, among other reasons, because it naturally requires handling a lot of data and transactions on chains. DePIN solutions are relevant in that regard, however as things stand at present it is likely that a lot of these applications might get scattered across different L2s. In that case this would make them computationally inefficient, as they would have to work via the L1. But if a well considered cluster of such applications get attracted to Arbitrum this can create a particularly powerful network effect, making the natural place for such a well defined category. This is an example of a type of scenario that can benefit from being studied in depth to inform a thoughtful ecosystem investment strategy. While this is not necessarily the particular focus being proposed, it illustrates the sort of areas of exploration that might require the attraction of a diverse group of experts. Some of whom might not yet be natively in the Arbitrum ecosystem or in Web3 altogether.**</p>\n<p>B* Location: The Farstar team favors doing the above work in London, where we have access to a  broad engaged community to pull experts from.

Scope of coverage included mainly private mergers and acquisition deals. Throughout investment banking career he covered deals with total value in excess of c. 2bnUSD. Was actively involved within blockchain markets since 2016 conducting research and running own investments. Current scope of responsibilities includes analysis and coverage of DAO governance.</p>\n<p><strong>3.Total team size: 7 + affiliated dev team (20)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4.Number of Years in Operation: 5</strong></p>\n<p><strong>III. Applicant Performance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5.Past experience if any for performing each of the roles and responsibilities described in the appendix (Divide your answer into three sections corresponding to the 3 parts in the appendix).</strong></p>\n<p>The Avantgarde team has relevant previous experience as full time capital allocators to third party fund managers within traditional finance, including building &amp; overseeing institutional grade investment and operational due diligence processes for selecting and monitoring external investment vehicles.</p>\n<p><strong>Cashflow and Accrual Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>The team have previous experience with monitoring cash flows of external mutual fund structures within traditional portfolios, including the monitoring of 9 figure dollar allocations into US Dollar prime and government money market funds for large family offices. This included working with fund managers, fund administrators, and custodians in reconciling fund positions and dividend payments from underlying fund allocations.</p>\n<p>Because of our background with Enzyme and having worked with other DAOs in the space we have accumulated a wealth of experience when it comes to DeFi reporting, cashflow tracking and reporting. We have the ability to automate processes where necessary and can very confidently tackle any on-chain challenges. Some examples of our on-chain work include working with oracles and on-chain NAV calculations, token valuation, reconciliation of accounts (or asset management performance), management &amp; performance fee calculations and automation of processes (eg. reporting for on-chain funds and DAOs).</p>\n<p><strong>Underlying Asset Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>Previously as institutional allocators to third party fund managers within traditional finance, members of the team have over a decade of experience managing segregated accounts of external asset managers for large institutional clients, including day to day monitoring at both the asset class and fund level. Within this experience, members of our team have also built institutional grade quantitative portfolio monitoring tools for breaking down risk exposures from portfolio holdings and returns data across multiple asset classes and fund universes.</p>\n<p>The Avantgarde team also has a strong background in on-chain asset monitoring within DeFi. This includes monitoring of positions within our on-chain funds, monitoring assets for 3rd party protocols for factors which may lead to mispricing (eg., depegs, market depth, etc) and portfolio weights (rebalancing needs).</p>\n<p><strong>Operations and Counterparty Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>The team have experience conducting operational due diligence both with centralised entities, including across fund manager service providers such as administrators, custodians, lawyers, risk management services. We’re also able to identify risk factors to monitor and set up internal processes to track and react.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde have conducted operational due diligence on smart contracts as part of integration work for Enzyme, an on-chain asset management protocol that has been running since 2018 without being exposed to any significant exploits. Operational work on Enzyme integrations includes rigorous testing, including on fund flows and redemptions from vaults, and encompasses working with external smart contract auditors. Additionally, we have conducted operational due diligence and monitoring within the Ethereum node operator space, including service level agreements around slashing and forgone staking rewards for example.</p>\n<p>On the interaction of smart contracts, legal fund structures, and fund management service providers, Avantgarde has a unique perspective in operating fund vehicles run on blockchain rails and the nuances in integrating smart contracts with legal contracts across the fund management stack.</p>\n<p><strong>6.Describe any conflicts of interest your entity, its investors or key personnel may have with any potential service providers selected under the program</strong></p>\n<p>We have a broad client base with both TradFi and DeFi players. We currently don’t see any conflicts of interest but we are happy to disclose any that may come up publicly as and when they do.</p>\n<p>It is also worth highlighting the importance of an independent risk and monitoring function, which is often separate from investment teams who select allocations. Since Avantgarde was not part of the screening committee for the service providers, we feel we are in a good position to act in an unbiased way in monitoring the providers selected, and can provide an additional independent level of oversight beyond the opinions provided at the screening stage.</p>\n<p><strong>7.Under what situations would you make a recommendation for Arbitrum to withdraw its assets from a selected service provider to fulfil each aspect of the outlined scope in the appendix?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a wide variety of reasons for redeeming from a provider, and whilst significant material issues are often evident in net performance figures, in our experience more subtle issues from a risk perspective often require a mosaic of quantitative and qualitative factors to pick up before the fact. In our view, this is also likely to be the case in monitoring for the STEP program - whilst we have no visibility into the final service providers which will be selected, within the money market fund fund categories (which is where the underlying strategies of many of the applicants belong) there is little performance dispersion because of the tight constraints of money market fund regulation on eligible securities, weighted average life, weighted average maturity, and liquidity.</p>\n<p>As program manager we would look to develop a holistic forward looking view based on other factors that could impact the repeatability of past performance, including: deviations in portfolio exposures, turnover in key personnel, irregularities at the smart contract level, data inconsistencies between centralised sources, relevant changes for the provider at the firm &amp; regulatory levels, amongst others. A key point is that no single indicator is a silver bullet, and we believe a significant part of effective monitoring is in being able to identify the causes for material changes - crucially, effective monitoring requires the ability to differentiate between 1) the inherent noise that is present in all aspects of external portfolio surveillance, and 2) genuine signals that arise when incremental uncertainty becomes significant enough to warrant action.</p>\n<p>There may also be other exogenous factors to consider for withdrawing from a project, such as diversification considerations at the overall level or where a project’s alignment with the Arbitrum ecosystem evolves in a way that is not consistent with the longer term goals of the STEP program.</p>\n<p><strong>8.Please list any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organisational structures</strong></p>\n<p>Avantgarde has worked with leading protocols including Uniswap, Apecoin, The Graph, Arbitrum, Nexus Mutual, Paraswap, Enzyme and others. DAOs leverage Avantgarde’s combined expertise in protocol development and asset management for developing strategies to improve treasury sustainability. Avantgarde has been involved with Arbitrum’s Treasury &amp; Sustainability Working Group since the early stages, including the production of a study focusing on how traditional asset classes, accessed via real world assets, can reduce risk within DAO treasuries which played a role in the evolution of the STEP program to where it is today - <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-research-risk-reduction-in-dao-treasuries/20662/2\">link</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>9.What is the value of assets monitored by your entity?</strong></p>\n<p>Provided by email</p>\n<p><strong>10.Can you explain how risk management (investment and operational) is being done for assets under monitoring?</strong></p>\n<p>Avantgarde currently performs risk management from a number of perspectives. On it’s asset management strategies, the investment thesis for each holding is reassessed on a continuous basis to ensure the quantitative and qualitative factors for inclusion have not materially changed. This includes monitoring flags on key on-chain and off-chain risk metrics. A few of the metrics which are deemed time critical have pre-trade approval when they hit certain thresholds, enabling action to be taken on the position when triggered. Other metrics flag major changes that require further investigation, in conjunction with other data analysis or by speaking to related project teams. The team will also monitor related social channels such as twitter and discord for related announcements and changes to protocols. Where applicable, periodic reviews with underlying project teams are performed, including refreshing qualitative or proprietary information that is not available on-chain to ensure documentation is up to date.</p>\n<p><strong>11.Describe the content, format and preparation process of performance reports. This should include details of interest earned and status of total assets. Provide a sample if available.</strong></p>\n<p>Reports should be tailored based on the portfolio/product. The content of the report will be dependent on the specific product. Typical performance reports for money market related products will include: yield over multiple horizons (1 day, 7 days, 30 days), fund and firm level assets under management, portfolio breakdown by major asset types (such as overnight repo and treasury bills), breakdown by maturity buckets, weighted average life, weighted average maturity, daily and weekly maturing assets as % of the fund, and token prices by major price sources. The reports and corresponding updates to the Arbitrum governance forums should also be customised to include requested information from the foundation and DAO community, such as total interest earned.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Applicant Pricing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>12.Provide a copy of your standard contract, or one similar to what is being proposed here.</strong><br>\nProvided by e-mail</p>\n<p><strong>13.Comprehensive pricing breakdown inclusive of the full scope of services requested</strong><br>\nProvided by e-mail</p>\n<p><strong>14.Terms of fee payment such as upfront vs monthly costs</strong><br>\nProvided by e-mail</p>\n<p><strong>15.Approximate percentage of your annual budget that this service contract would constitute ?

We are committed to strategic funding that emphasizes plurality, diversity, and meets the immediate needs of the Arbitrum DAO, paving the way for transformative change. There’s approximately 3 million ARB of funding available, which will be distributed across 5-10 programs. We encouraged applicants to consider scalability in their proposals, focusing on achieving a “one dollar in, two dollars out” impact. Applications closed at the end of April, and decisions will be made by a decentralized group of reviewers in mid-May. We have finalized the rubrics for both. The selected programs are expected to roll out from June to September.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/db41d156bd5e51f88b4ca2d51ba32af1b425de2c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vhDzWZQpCGzgKfgsAqVThJIeSIY.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/db41d156bd5e51f88b4ca2d51ba32af1b425de2c_2_624x328.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"vhDzWZQpCGzgKfgsAqVThJIeSIY\" width=\"624\" height=\"328\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/db41d156bd5e51f88b4ca2d51ba32af1b425de2c_2_624x328.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/db41d156bd5e51f88b4ca2d51ba32af1b425de2c_2_936x492.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/db41d156bd5e51f88b4ca2d51ba32af1b425de2c.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"13577E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"gitcoin-grants-20-gg20-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#gitcoin-grants-20-gg20-5\"></a>Gitcoin Grants 20 (GG20)</h2>\n<p>The Thank ARB program has enthusiastically embarked on a collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-gg20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin Grants 20 (GG20)</a>, marking the first time all core rounds and Allo protocol V2 operate exclusively on Arbitrum.
