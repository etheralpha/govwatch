name=\"p-57970-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h3>\n<p>OpenZeppelin, the Security Member of the ARDC, reviewed the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/enhancing-multichain-governance-upgrading-rari-governance-token-on-arbitrum/26096\">Rari multichain governance proposal</a> and its specifications. If enacted, the proposal execution will register a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract that will migrate the RARI DAO from the Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The <a href=\"https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">new token contract</a> has been fully audited and deployed to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet and all contracts have been manually tested.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-overview-2\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>The $RARI token that is used to govern the RARI DAO is currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradeable. However, the RARI DAO would like to upgrade its governance to allow for new features to be implemented such as snapshots and delegations. By bringing its governance to the Arbitrum ecosystem, RARI DAO would also improve the user experience through lower gas fees and increased accessibility of their system. Despite the non-upgradeability of the $RARI token, it is possible to make these changes to the governance model by using a custom gateway to register a new token contract. This proposed solution requires the Arbitrum DAO’s approval.</p>\n<p>Despite the non-upgradeability of the $RARI token, it is possible to make these changes to the governance model by using a custom gateway to register a new token contract. This proposed solution requires the Arbitrum DAO’s approval.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-57970-custom-gateway-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-custom-gateway-motivation-3\"></a>Custom Gateway Motivation</h4>\n<p>The Arbitrum chain allows for tokens to be bridged between various networks, such as between Arbitrum and Ethereum. In the case of many ERC-20 tokens, this involves associating a token contract on some other chain with a paired token contract on Arbitrum. When users wish to bridge their tokens, the tokens are escrowed in a bridge contract on the host chain, and an equal amount of tokens is minted on Arbitrum. Using <code>StandardERC20Gateway</code>, any ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainnet can be permissionlessly bridged to Arbitrum by default. However, this standard approach is not suitable for some tokens. For example, tokens accruing interest need to ensure that the rewards are dispersed properly to other chains instead of just being accrued to the bridge contract. A <strong>custom gateway system</strong> allows for specialized cross-chain asset bridging in such exceptional cases where additional bridging logic is necessary to be implemented.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum generic-custom gateway is designed as a flexible solution that is suitable for most custom needs beyond what is available using <code>StandardERC20Gateway</code>. In the case of the new $RARI token, the proposed changes include the addition of snapshotting and delegation functions, as well as the introduction of proxy-based upgradeability. According to the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum Foundation documentation</a>, this is likely the right solution for such a migration since these changes are limited in scope (as opposed to the addition of minting functionality directly on Arbitrum, for example).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-technical-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-technical-details-4\"></a>Technical Details</h3>\n<p>In order to register the new $RARI token to the custom gateway, <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the relevant steps</a> are outlined by the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Deploy your token on Arbitrum</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The new $RARI token deployed on Arbitrum should conform to the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/IArbToken.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">IArbToken</a> interface, as in the following <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/L2GatewayToken.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example implementation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Register your token on L1 to your token on L2 via the <code>L1CustomGateway</code> contract</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The $RARI token currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet should make an external call to <code>L1CustomGateway.registerTokenToL2</code>. This registration can alternatively be performed as a chain-owner registration via an Arbitrum DAO proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Register your token on L1 to the L1Gateway router</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Finally, the $RARI token deployed on the Ethereum mainnet should make an external call to <code>L1GatewayRouter.setGateway</code>. This registration can alternatively be performed as a chain-owner registration via an Arbitrum DAO proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The RARI DAO has already voted in favor of a <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/85102068202527969889208024703113668965813715410446115075088330064807449302588\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposal</a> that would deploy the custom $RARI token on Arbitrum, ensuring the completion of the first action item. The RARI DAO is now requesting registration to the <code>L1CustomGateway</code> and <code>L1GatewayRouter</code> contracts via this governance proposal. The mapping between the tokens deployed on the mainnet and the Arbitrum chain would then be updated and the RARI token would be registered to the generic-custom gateway, completing the remaining two steps in the registration process.</p>\n<p>The upgraded token contract from the proposal has also been <a href=\"https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fully audited</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The proposed changes, including registration of a new $RARI token to the generic-custom gateway, are appropriate to meet the needs of the RARI DAO. Since the currently deployed contracts are non-upgradeable and the RARI DAO wishes to add new features to their token, as well as enhance user experience, this operation is necessary. Using the standard ERC-20 gateway would not support the new desired enhancements and the changes do not require a unique, tailor-made gateway. Registering with the generic-custom gateway is a good fit for this transition.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648","pubDate":"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 18:59:25 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26648"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648.rss","#text":"RARI Multichain Governance Proposal Security Review"}},{"title":"Lampros Labs DAO Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"Euphoria","category":"Delegate Statements","description":"<p><strong>Delegate Address:</strong> 0xA2D590FEe197C0b614Fe7c3E10303327F38C0dc3<br>\n<strong>Team Member Handles:</strong> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/blueweb\">@Blueweb</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/euphoria\">@Euphoria</a> &amp; <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/nyx\">@Nyx</a><br>\n<strong>Tally Profile:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xa2d590fee197c0b614fe7c3e10303327f38c0dc3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a><br>\n<strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://lamproslabs.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a><br>\n<strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/lamproslabsdao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Delegate Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Lampros Labs DAO is an open community of builders and governance enthusiasts committed to transparency, decentralization, and inclusivity.

Currently, the clr.fund is using MACI.</p>\n<p>MACI can stand alone as a voting system. New users must deposit their tokens when signing and will create a new key pair to vote. There will need to be some customization in order to integrate MACI into the Security council governor. One other complication is that MACI relies on a trusted coordinator to gather and report the vote tally. This coordinator can decrypt votes and can choose to never conclude a round.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Private, but votes can be read by the trusted coordinator.</td>\n<td>Needs a trusted coordinator</td>\n<td>The voter cannot reveal their vote</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The project is under active development and is a promising solution despite its complexity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-semaphore-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-semaphore-5\"></a>Semaphore</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://semaphore.pse.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore</a> offers anonymous group-based signaling and can be used as a foundation to build a private voting system.

As the number of depositors increase the anonymity of the votes increase, and deposits should be represented in fixed numbers. An account that has multiple deposits will have to vote multiple times using multiple transactions. An account will also have to face the trade-off of privately voting and losing their liquidity</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-57854-implementation-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-implementation-10\"></a>Implementation</h4>\n<p>In this construction, a user would deposit their ARB tokens along with a commitment hash of two secrets.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Depositors of the token pool, through a relayer, can cast their vote fractionally using Flexible Voting. A valid proof of a deposit, and a proposal id is required to prevent double voting. Using a zero knowledge proof, depositors can generate a merkle proof without revealing their secrets. Snapshots of merkle tree roots should be stored in order to prevent late depositors to vote for a proposal that has already started.</p>\n<p>To withdraw their deposits, the users will provide their secrets and will be able to withdraw back to the original depositor address that corresponds to the deposit commitment hash. Although all the technological pieces for this solution exist, and have been proven to work in other contexts, a  non-trivial amount of work would be required to put them together to construct production-ready privacy preserving voting. Nonetheless, this approach seems promising, as the work needed is primarily engineering work, rather than fundamental research…</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-stealth-voting-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-stealth-voting-11\"></a>Stealth voting</h3>\n<p>Another possible bespoke solution is a voting system that utilizes stealth addresses via ERC-5564 and ERC-6538. This implementation will require a trusted coordinator that is responsible for holding private keys corresponding stealth meta-addresses and tallying votes correctly.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Needs a trusted coordinator</td>\n<td>Can be optional with an additional governance extension contract</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h4><a name=\"p-57854-implementation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-implementation-12\"></a>Implementation</h4>\n<p>The basic idea is that a trusted coordinator will generate stealth meta-addresses corresponding to each option in a proposal. And anyone can announce their vote preference for a given proposal by including a stealth address generated using one of the stealth meta-addresses. Once the voting period ends, the trusted coordinator can tally the announcements each stealth meta-address owner has received, and output the winning option.</p>\n<p>This implementation would have the usual benefits that comes with stealth addresses. Voters can vote without an extra step and with their full voting weight, but their vote preference is linked to the stealth address’ hidden owner. There’s no liquidity concern as long as your voting weight can be queried from the token. The trusted coordinator portion could potentially be improved by incorporating a zero knowledge proof step to prove that tallying was done correctly. The governor will need to be upgraded to accept tallying results and an extension could be added to overwrite the behaviors of the default <code>castVote</code> function.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-railgun-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-railgun-13\"></a>Railgun</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.railgun.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Railgun</a> as it is now offers transaction anonymity, meaning the identity of the sender, recipient, token, and amount remain private once onboarded onto the system with new private key pairs. Critically, Railgun allows those who have deposited into the privacy pool to interact with external contracts by submitting zero knowledge proofs. Wallet software must be developed to construct the proofs for specific external calls and forward them to Railguns relayer network. The Railgun protcol charges a fee for each transaction sent in this manner.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Customizing or creating a solution based on Railgun might prove challenging while introducing new reliance on the existing Railgun infrastructure. It still is a great privacy framework to keep in mind and Railgun SDK could help with this process. Bridging the gap between its current implementation and unique requirements of an onchain governance system will require significant research and effort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-conclusion-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-conclusion-14\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our assessment of existing private voting solutions concludes that although there are several projects and tools that enable private voting, none of them are plug and play with Arbitrum DAO’s existing governance system. Any effort to add private voting would require additional effort to integrate a privacy solution with a new customized governor.</p>\n<p>We provided different trade-offs and it’s crucial to seek DAO members’ input on implementing an onchain private voting solution, their priorities and preferences, including voter anonymity, result verifiability, and potential trade-offs.</p>\n<p>We recommend the DAO to further explore the proposed new approaches when considering how to bring private voting to the security council election processes. In particular, the Shieled Pool solution seems the most promising in terms of a system that could be producitionized with a reasonable amount of effort, yet has minimal tradeoffs as it relates to privacy properties. Nonetheless, such an effort would require significant resource to be dedicated to developing proof of concepts, further research, audits and bug bounties.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-partial-delegation-solutions-assessments-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-partial-delegation-solutions-assessments-15\"></a>Partial Delegation Solutions Assessments</h2>\n<p>The current delegation structure limits token holders to delegating their voting power to a single address.

It works by having a user deposit the funds into a Franchiser contract that delegates them to the desired delegate. This system allows for the tokens to also be redelegated to another franchiser address.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Separate Vote flow</th>\n<th>Loss of liquidity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-57854-paritial-delegation-erc20votes-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-paritial-delegation-erc20votes-18\"></a>Paritial Delegation ERC20Votes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/voteagora/ERC20VotesPartialDelegationUpgradeable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">This solution</a> was developed by Agora with help from ScopeLift. It overrides the ERC20Votes token contract to allow a token holder to delegate to multiple addresses. It maintains the voting flow and does not cause the token holder to lose liquidity.

It enables token holders to delegate voting power to multiple addresses without losing liquidity and maintains the existing voting flow. Although, it requires a token upgrade and introduces higher gas costs for token transfers, these issues are not a deal breaker because Arbitrum’s token is upgradeable and the token existing on Arbitrum makes gas costs less of a concern. Additionally, the absence of sub-delegation support is not a critical limitation for the current needs of the DAO. Therefore, this solution aligns well with the DAO’s objectives for improved governance flexibility.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-references-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-references-20\"></a>References</h2>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/icon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"64\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore Demo</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a65b4bbcb6742b2b016fcc9d20faaba397072d77_2_690x362.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"13193A\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore Demo</a></h3>\n\n  <p>A zero-knowledge protocol for anonymous signaling on Ethereum.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<p><a href=\"https://projects.ethberlin.org/submissions/334\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://projects.ethberlin.org/submissions/334</a></p><aside class=\"onebox githubrepo\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\" data-github-private-repo=\"false\">\n  <img width=\"690\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b7ab5d00b81bea8be24673a3e4d6e172df72c1d4_2_690x344.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEAEA\">\n\n  <h3><a href=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig: Implementation of PLUME: nullifier friendly...</a></h3>\n\n    <p><span class=\"github-repo-description\">Implementation of PLUME: nullifier friendly signature scheme on ECDSA</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://research.aragon.org/img/main-logo.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">research.aragon.org</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/388;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/ac25e645cdcb672e291b803805ff01d91fde1202_2_690x388.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"B8A3ED\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Nouns Private Voting Research Sprint - General Report - Aragon ZK Research -...</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Nouns sprint report</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/edf96faf9653815ad054301e915997f2bf67ee6d.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"000000\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" title=\"12:00AM - 12 December 2023\">blog.rs – 12 Dec 23</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8605049b519148caab57e1f7c879f9589419ba47_2_500x500.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"4C4943\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The State of Private Voting in Ethereum</a></h3>\n\n  <p>The State of Private Voting in Ethereum and beyond.

We believe the Arbitrum tech speaks for itself in practice, and that with proper stewardship and contributions to the Arbitrum DAO, the aforementioned question will turn into “Why not Arbitrum?”.</p>\n<p>We are interested in contributing to all areas of the Arbitrum ecosystem as needs arise, but will be focusing on improving governance participation as well as tooling and protocol decentralization. The Arbitrum DAO is Entropy Advisors’ only customer, which is not something many other Arbitrum delegates can tout today. Our employees have extensive experience in research and have been active across numerous DAOs in the past, but have identified Arbitrum as the most promising technology stack and want to put all of our time, effort, and collective brainpower into ensuring the sustainable growth of the ecosystem – powered by the Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<p>Put simply, we believe in a diverse and highly capable delegate base, a DAO that is sustainable through diversified and robust revenue streams, responsible and carefully calculated spending that encourages the growth of the ecosystem, a highly intellectual group of service providers that can effectively execute on tasks on behalf of the DAO, and measures for accountability/processes that can stand the test of time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57846-conflicts-of-interest-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57846-conflicts-of-interest-3\"></a>Conflicts of Interest</h3>\n<p>Entropy Advisors often authors or is directly involved in several proposals within Arbitrum DAO.

currently serving as a community manager and technical moderator for the Hop Protocol, a role I’ve dedicated myself to for nearly three years. My responsibilities extend across several critical areas including operational security (OpSec), community support, troubleshooting, bug and vulnerability reporting, and more. Additionally, I have been a part of the Community Multisig committee at Hop Protocol for over a year, contributing to key governance decisions and securing community funds. I believe my unique blend of experience in these areas makes me an excellent candidate for the Security Council.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational Security (OpSec):</strong> In my current role, I prioritize the safety and security of our community members across all platforms, from Discord to our Forum, and beyond into broader web security. My proactive approach to OpSec has led to the elimination of over 150 phishing websites impersonating Hop Protocol, achieved by reporting these threats to MetaMask, various domain registrar providers, and Google.</p>\n<p>During a significant security incident involving our Discord server, where a moderator’s account was compromised, I acted swiftly to contain the breach. By disabling the compromised account’s access within minutes, I ensured that the impact on our community was minimal. This swift response was made possible by implementing a least privilege access model, which I advocate for and enforce rigorously.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Support &amp; Troubleshooting:</strong> Beyond security, I am deeply involved in providing community support and troubleshooting issues as they arise. This includes identifying and reporting bugs and vulnerabilities that could affect the user experience or the security of the platform. My hands-on approach ensures that our community remains engaged, informed, and secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Background in DevOps:</strong> In addition to my work in the crypto space, I bring a strong background as a DevOps engineer with a specialization in production incident resolution. My experience spans handling critical incidents during both regular business hours and 24/7 on-call shifts. I have led cross-team war rooms during critical incidents and have conducted thorough root cause analyses to prevent future occurrences.</p>\n<p><strong>Why I’m a Fit for the Security Council:</strong> My extensive experience in operational security within the Hop Protocol community, combined with my technical expertise in DevOps, positions me uniquely to contribute meaningfully to the Security Council. I am passionate about safeguarding our community and have a proven track record of taking proactive measures to mitigate risks and address threats swiftly.</p>\n<p>I look forward to the opportunity to bring my experience, dedication, and proactive mindset to the Security Council, ensuring the continued safety and resilience of our community.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631","pubDate":"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 16:34:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26631"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631.rss","#text":"Rxpwnz - Candidate for Security Council Elections 2024"}},{"title":"Arbitrum Offsite format: online vs IRL","dc:creator":"danielo","category":"Proposals","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-57826-arbitrumdao-off-site-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-arbitrumdao-off-site-1\"></a>ArbitrumDAO Off-site</h1>\n<p>Non-Constitutional</p>\n<p>This proposal is a continuation of the directional proposal for an offsite which was voted in favour with 130mn ARB in Snapshot: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site-directional-proposal/25660\" class=\"inline-onebox\">ArbitrumDAO Off-site - Directional proposal</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This proposal aims to enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among token holders (including delegates) and key stakeholders by organizing a dedicated off-site event. The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured event will be organized in Q4, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.</p>\n<p>This proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to prioritise the most important agenda items to be discussed at the evente, ensuring the meeting time is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The event will then include professional facilitation to advance alignment, remove blockers, ensure proper note-taking, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.</p>\n<p>The success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem</h2>\n<p>The DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.</p>\n<p>Areas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to test a format for deliberation between key stakeholders with a clearly defined agenda. If successful, the format can be replicated to continuously address agenda items.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution</h2>\n<p>Recent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for focused events to catalyse progress.

The facilitation includes designing the workshops and moderating the conversation, AND thinking through how to create a strategic process for a DAO.<br>\nCosts of Online facilitation might be lower than IRL. We’ll confirm this before the onchain proposal, for now costs are indicative to select a direction.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-agenda-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-agenda-11\"></a>Agenda</h3>\n<p>We’ve already started the process of setting the agenda. We ran a survey, answered by 29 delegates with 86mn+ ARB represented. And then ran SimScore (a collective intelligence algorithm) to cluster responses and identify the key topics. The results are presented below to encourage further discussion.</p>\n<p>Pre-selection of topics (to be refined and prioritised after the format is defined):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defining strategic priorities for the DAO (vision and strategy)</li>\n<li>DAO Budget (how much should the DAO be spending)</li>\n<li>Org Design</li>\n<li>ARB token utility</li>\n<li>Conflict Of Interest</li>\n<li>Grant programs (RPGF, what should be the focus, outcomes, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional work to be done to define the agenda:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 workshops and async discussion to identify root causes (root topics) and prioritise.</li>\n<li>The final agenda will be defined via a subsequent Snapshot vote facilitated by the project manager.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-hybrid-participation-for-irl-events-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-hybrid-participation-for-irl-events-12\"></a>Hybrid Participation for IRL events</h3>\n<p>We’ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost about $600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties. The online setup is of course less good than being IRL but it is still viable to contribute to sessions (anyone leading a session does need to be IRL but, for input in the discussion, online works).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-attendees-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-attendees-13\"></a>Attendees</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on high-context, expert, and senior participants.

Each allocation is carefully crafted for maximum impact, always taking into account available co-incentive schemes and experimenting with different distribution methods and target APYs.</p>\n<p>The delay can be attributed to two factors:<br>\n(1) some ARB was earmarked for integrations with Silo, Spectra, and CreditGuild, which are only now ready to start. And additionally for a further integration with Aave GHO, who is requesting a similar <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-aave-dao-ltipp-grant-extension-request/26612\">extension</a>.</p>\n<p>(2) Similarly, in addition to the rollout of the yield-bearing version, sGYD, a dedicated staking infrastructure was developed that only went live last week.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Generally, the LTIPP grant has been a great success for Gyroscope. ARB is being used to incentivize the use of the GYD meta-stablecoin and to encourage the adoption of Gyroscope’s concentrated liquidity AMMs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gyroscope pools saw a large capital inflow. In the latest period from Aug-26-to-date, the average TVL of Gyroscope pools with ARB incentives was <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3923512\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">11m USD</a>.  Gyroscope’s TVL on Arbitrum grew from 1.48m to 16.7m <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3993279/6720961\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">over the course of LTIPP</a> so far.</li>\n<li>The stablecoin GYD has also seen a lot of adoption on Arbitrum due to ARB incentives. The newly launched yield-bearing version, sGYD, has 70% of its entire supply on Arbitrum, with the remaining 30% being on Ethereum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The remaining 20274.4285716 ARB are planned to be used to bootstrap additional use-cases of sGYD on Arbitrum (via, for example, a Spectra yield-market), generally encourage (s)GYD adoption, and further incentivize Gyroscope AMMs that are coming to market now. Gyroscope plans to match incentives on Arbitrum after LTIPP through sGYD yield sharing mechanisms, SPIN points, and SPIN for Balancer incentive votes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant an extension on deadline to allocate remaining ARB from LTIPP Grant for Gyroscope to allocate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The extension will utilize the remaining ARB tokens from our original proposal for liquidity mining on Gyroscope.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-steps-to-implement-6\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The last, missing integrations with other Arbitrum DeFi participants are very close to being concluded. Even if they were to fail, key infrastructure is in place and existing incentive channels are showing great success.</li>\n<li>Additional time to allow the last integrations to come in and continue to carefully allocate incentives for maximum impact is all that is needed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-timeline-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-timeline-7\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Start Date: September 2nd 2024</li>\n<li>End Date: October 2nd 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-overall-cost-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-overall-cost-8\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p>The extension utilizes the remaining ARB tokens from the originally approved 100k ARB grant.

Aave DAO plans to continue our incentive matching program with Merit once ARB incentives are fully utilized.</p>\n<p>However, due to the deplayed deployment in launching GHO Safety Module and GHO Bridge, rewards for LM on Aave Protocol started later than expected, causing a delay in time and not being able to spend that amount ARB as planned.</p>\n<p>As a result, Aave DAO has not utilized the total amount of 375K ARB from the proposal earmarked for GHO deposit incentives and would like to seek an extension to avoid undue miscommunication and missed rewards for Arbitrum users. The distributed ARB will still retain a 3 month schedule from (the delayed) GHO deployment, in line with the initial program goals to do short term incentive programs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57755-key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57755-key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant an extension on deadline to allocate remaining ARB from LTIPP Grant for Aave DAO to allocate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57755-specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57755-specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The extension will utilize the remaining ARB tokens from our original proposal for LM on Aave Protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57755-steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57755-steps-to-implement-6\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>None, it has already been implemented, it needs more time to reach full ARB distribution amounts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57755-timeline-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57755-timeline-7\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Start Date: September 2nd 2024</li>\n<li>End Date: November 2nd 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57755-overall-cost-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57755-overall-cost-8\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p>The extension utilizes the remaining ARB tokens from the originally approved 750K ARB grant.

With this lite report, we aim to provide a better understanding of how Gitcoin and Jokerace impact community engagement, drive growth, and generate lasting effects in the Arbitrum Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>These are our preliminary research findings, which will be expanded upon in subsequent deliveries. This report serves as the deliverable for Milestone 1.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-key-takeaways-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-key-takeaways-1\"></a>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arbitrum’s Dominance in Gitcoin Rounds:</strong> Arbitrum has positioned itself as the dominant network for Gitcoin rounds, with 87% of all rounds in Q2 2024 happening here. Making it the current preferred choice for funding and community engagement initiatives within the Gitcoin ecosystem, likely due to the Thrive-powered partnership between both ecosystems.</li>\n<li>Strong Donation Participation Despite Lower Averages: Although Thrive-powered Gitcoin rounds have a 63% lower average donation compared to non-Thrive rounds in Arbitrum, this is skewed by large outliers. Thrive rounds excel in generating consistent donations, with +50% more contributions at the 50th and 75th percentiles, indicating strong community engagement. Recommendation: Keep broad participation while exploring how to attract larger donations to further increase impact.</li>\n<li><strong>“Younger” Audience Engagement:</strong> Thrive-powered rounds attracted, on average, younger accounts to Gitcoin. Potentially indicating the onboarding of new users into the Gitcoin ecosystem. Recommendation: Continue to develop initiatives that generate new users, while also working towards the retention of these users as they mature in the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Participation Patterns in Gitcoin Rounds:</strong> Thrive-powered Gitcoin rounds show a “mid-participation period” spike in activity, unlike the general trend of being skewed toward the end of the round participation period. It would appear that Thrive-powered rounds are effective in engaging participants earlier in the process.</li>\n<li><strong>Jokerace’s Short-lived Success on Arbitrum:</strong> While Jokerace saw a peak in activity on Arbitrum during Thrive initiatives, this activity was not sustained and quickly shifted to other networks, mostly Base. This suggests that this activity was heavily dependent on activations, with limited sustained organic growth. Recommendation: Explore new ways of integrating Jokerace into the Arbitrum ecosystem to make its use more organic rather than Thrive-driven.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Reach of Thrive-Powered Jokerace Contests:</strong> Thrive-powered contests on Jokerace achieved significant social media reach, particularly on Twitter/X, almost hitting 100K users. However, this reach was concentrated in a few key participants. Recommendation: Explore new strategies to get more Key Opinion Leaders, or incentivize broader sharing to reduce the reliance on a few key players.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-current-limitations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-current-limitations-2\"></a>Current Limitations</h3>\n<p>This analysis offers preliminary conclusions. Data analyzed for this report is limited to the end of Q2 2024 when the initiatives ended. Jokerace data has been decoded as much as possible and reflects an accurate approximation of reality, however only the listed chains have been taken into account.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57592-gitcoin-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-gitcoin-3\"></a>Gitcoin</h2>\n<p>We focused our analysis on 3 main areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Impact of the Arbitrum-Gitcoin partnership in the context of the pluralistic grants framework.</li>\n<li>Characteristics of Gitcoin Rounds in Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Characteristics of users engaging with Gitcoin Rounds in Arbitrum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-gitcoin-activity-by-network-arbitrum-is-king-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-gitcoin-activity-by-network-arbitrum-is-king-4\"></a>Gitcoin Activity by Network, Arbitrum is King</h3>\n<p>Gitcoin has been one of the preferred bounties platforms in the EVM ecosystem. Under the Pluralistic Grants Framework, Gitcoin was used as a channel to spur growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, facilitating contributions to open-source projects and generating exposure to a vast community of dedicated developers.</p>\n<p>If we take a look at the distribution of Gitcoin Rounds based on the network they were run on, we can see the dominance of Arbitrum as the network to run the rounds, 87% of the rounds in Q2 2024 were executed in Arbitrum.

However, looking at the 50th and 75th percentile - representing how many donations at least 50%/75% of the projects receive - we see that Thrive is outperforming the other gitcoin rounds significantly by over 50. This suggests that Thrive created very homogenous rounds with consistently high donation counts, aligning with Gitcoin’s foundational principles.</p>\n<p>In terms of participation, Thrive rounds showed a somewhat even distribution among the top 30 projects (between 400 and 500 donations). Total donation amounts display a different distribution, evidencing a noticeable gap between the top 3 projects and the runner-ups.</p>\n<p>It is worth to note that the Arbitrum DAO Delegates project received the highest donation count overall, totalling over 1.2k donations, and ranked 3rd in terms of total donation amounts</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hosMFfzrsWCnqocfEEeLsOfEv5h.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hosMFfzrsWCnqocfEEeLsOfEv5h\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_690x386.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"173539\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pIHM7DzR1QaeO2ywgfM11dsECZN.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"pIHM7DzR1QaeO2ywgfM11dsECZN\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_690x386.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"172F33\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-which-users-are-engaging-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-which-users-are-engaging-6\"></a>Which Users Are Engaging?</h3>\n<p>If we take a look at the the users participating in the rounds executed during the analyzed time range, we can see that Thrive-related Rounds appeal to a “younger” audience, compared to non-Thrive rounds in Arbitrum.

The Foundation introduced 5 Grant Tracks that projects can choose from based on their development stage, growth projection and type of project. The 5 tracks are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Growth Track:</strong> For projects showing early signs of traction and aim to launch on the Arbitrum (One or Nova) mainnet soon.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Growth Track:</strong> For projects with proven momentum looking to amplify their growth on Arbitrum (One or Nova).</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Chain Track:</strong> For projects with proven momentum on another blockchain, but keen to integrate with Arbitrum.</li>\n<li><strong>Orbit Track:</strong> For projects building innovative app chains, rollups and rollup infrastructure on Orbit.</li>\n<li><strong>Stylus Track:</strong> For innovative projects like (but not limited to) math-heavy finance algorithms, onchain generative art or complex cryptography on Stylus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57468-strategic-partnerships-and-growth-initiatives-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57468-strategic-partnerships-and-growth-initiatives-5\"></a>Strategic Partnerships and Growth Initiatives</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Solidifying Arbitrum as a robust platform for DeFi:</strong> The Foundation has led key DeFi partnerships and integrations from liquidity protocols to infrastructure projects, and solidified Arbitrum as a robust platform for DeFi applications. <strong>The Robinhood Wallet X Arbitrum Foundation collaboration</strong>, for instance, enabled low-cost in-app swaps for traders and paved the way for a new wave of adoptions. Other key examples include Synthetix, Venus Protocol, CoW Swap, and Renzo.</li>\n<li><strong>Doubling down on Gaming:</strong> Key gaming deployments and milestones for the first half of 2024 include Pirate Nation launching Apex Chain as an Orbit Chain, Square Enix (a prominent video game publisher) bringing Symbiogenesis to Arbitrum One, and InfiniGods’ King of Destiny Web3 mobile game integrating with Arbitrum Nova. Additionally, Arbitrum welcomed more than 15,000 visitors via the 2024 Game Developers Conference (GDC) to its booth during the three-day event, which exposed traditional gaming professionals to the opportunities in Web3 gaming and in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Orbit Chains Multiply:</strong> In January 2024, the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program (AEP) catalyzed the rapid growth of Orbit chains. The AEP introduced licensing terms that made it simple for projects to create custom Arbitrum Layer 2s (L2s) that directly settle on Ethereum, as well as Arbitrum Layer 3s (L3s) on other non-Arbitrum chains. Major communities like Apes and Treasure have chosen Arbitrum Orbit through open procurement processes despite strong competition, and other significant projects, such as Azuki, Degen, and Sanko, have also been drawn to its value proposition and are building their own Orbit chains.</li>\n<li><strong>Stylus Ecosystem Growth:</strong> In an effort to boost pre-launch awareness, the Arbitrum Foundation organized a ‘Stylus Blitz Buildathon’, where 7 teams were granted $1,500 each for building Stylus contracts on Arbitrum Sepolia. In addition to the open competition, the Foundation has also sponsored developer toolings like Software Development Kit (SDK) and Command Line Interface (CLI) tools to ease the migration and development processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57468-educational-and-community-initiatives-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57468-educational-and-community-initiatives-6\"></a>Educational and Community Initiatives</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57468-event-sponsorships-and-participation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57468-event-sponsorships-and-participation-7\"></a>Event Sponsorships and Participation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Foundation cultivates a strong presence within the Ethereum developer community by purposefully sponsoring, attending, and co-hosting important third-party conferences such as ETH events.</li>\n<li>The Foundation plans and leads events tailored to the Arbitrum community, such as Arbitrum Day, which offers networking and targeted education opportunities.

These ambassadors have organized over 30 offline events and produced over 100 high-quality content resources. Their online efforts have totaled 1,870 posts, garnering 14 million earned reach.</li>\n<li><strong>Phase 2 Expansion:</strong> With an emphasis on advancing educational initiatives for the Arbitrum ecosystem, the Ambassador program opened its doors to developers, non-developers, entrepreneurs, Web3 enthusiasts, and students starting in June 2024. The Foundation provides ambassadors with the tools, direction, and rewards they need to become fully committed Arbitrum supporters and community builders. As of June 30, 2024, 2,100 applications had been received for Phase 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57468-technical-advancements-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57468-technical-advancements-9\"></a>Technical Advancements</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation focused on 3 key pillars for technical advancements: enhancing Arbitrum’s security, realizing the vision of rollup as the new server, and expanding the virtual machine and the developer experience.

Every Orbit chain extends a unified Arbitrum brand.</li>\n<li>An incubator that fosters native application and infrastructure development with Arbitrum One, becoming the most sought-after blockspace in crypto across a diverse range of verticals.</li>\n<li>An ARB token recognized by the market as a result of value accrual from various sources in order to enhance rollup security.</li>\n<li>Home to crypto’s most popular apps, many of which use Stylus as a mission-critical component to their codebase.</li>\n<li>A strategic resource allocator capitalizing on Arbitrum’s growth by investing in infrastructure and applications that capture value in the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>The premier tech suite providing flexibility and freedom to builders through features such as Timeboost, BoLD, custom gas tokens, sovereign governance, Stylus, and more.</li>\n<li>Governed by the most robust DAO with aligned, active, sophisticated, and diverse delegates helping drive the ecosystem forward.</li>\n<li>Supported by a sustainable, revenue-generating DAO with multi-faceted programs and efficient operational structures.</li>\n<li>Committed to extending Ethereum’s values. Arbitrum is the default destination  for users to interact with genuinely decentralized, trust-minimized technologies.</li>\n<li>A household name with recognition on par with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Arbitrum is the gateway to Ethereum for new users from other chains and the real world.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In March 2023, the Arbitrum DAO was born with the launch of the ARB governance token. One of the largest and most widespread airdrops to date, the ARB token was distributed to over 580,000 unique addresses and 137 applications built on Arbitrum One. This moment marked a historic achievement, giving decentralized governance full control over all aspects of the execution environment; a pivotal step in the quest to scale Ethereum.</p>\n<p>Over the past 15 months, tremendous progress has been made. Core developers announced the completion of Timeboost, Stylus, and BoLD. The Arbitrum Foundation quickly scaled to a team of over 30 contributors, and the Arbitrum DAO launched multiple grant programs, incentive initiatives, and investment ventures. Yet, one clear hole has emerged in the DAO, <strong>a lack of alignment on our objectives</strong>. When posed with the question, “What will Arbitrum look like in 5 years?”, it’s likely that developers, the Foundation, and the DAO’s many contributors would provide diverse answers. While Arbitrum’s bottom-up nature is one of its strengths, we now recognize the need for a unified vision—<strong>a north star to guide us</strong>. Additionally, a clear vision is required for the DAO to pursue its own brand and marketing strategies.</p>\n<p>Today, each organization operating in the DAO must extrapolate for itself what it should work towards that contributes the most value to Arbitrum. Questions arise like should my organization work toward operational sustainability and painting a picture of ARB as a productive asset? Growth of Orbit? Growth of Stylus? Growth of Arbitrum one? Public Goods? etc. With a lack of visible direction, being an effective DAO operator becomes difficult. Additionally, the absence of concrete goals has made it challenging for the DAO to facilitate oversight and accountability. A system has been created where all the DAO can effectively do is judge “did this organization work hard” but lacks the ability to judge “did this organization do a good job moving Arbitrum forward?”</p>\n<p>Arbitrum has always embraced the principle that the technology should speak for itself. As the largest layer-2 solution by nearly every metric, and the major rollup closest to reaching Stage 2, Arbitrum represents more than just outstanding tech. Arbitrum embodies Freedom:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orbit Chains</strong>: Applications can now create their own fully customizable blockspace. Orbit chains act as Web3 servers tapping into the underlying liquidity and user base of Arbitrum One or any other chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Stylus</strong>: Provides the freedom to leverage the efficiencies of Rust, C, and C++ to write smart contracts without losing EVM compatibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Timeboost</strong>: A new transaction ordering policy with an express lane auction system that generates revenue for the DAO without hindering UX.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, Arbitrum offers permissionless access to the best scaling tech stack in crypto, allowing any user, developer, or individual to build and interact with trust-minimized technologies in seconds.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57467-our-guiding-principles-thus-far-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57467-our-guiding-principles-thus-far-2\"></a>Our Guiding Principles Thus Far</h3>\n<p>Since its creation, the Arbitrum DAO has been governed by its <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Constitution</a> and seven community values:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ethereum-aligned</strong>: Arbitrum is part of the Ethereum ecosystem and community</li>\n<li><strong>Sustainable</strong>: Focus on long-term health of the protocol over short-term gains</li>\n<li><strong>Secure</strong>: Arbitrum is security minded</li>\n<li><strong>Socially inclusive</strong>: Open and welcoming to all constructive participants</li>\n<li><strong>Technically inclusive</strong>: Accessible for ordinary people with ordinary technology</li>\n<li><strong>User-focused</strong>: Managed for the benefit of all users</li>\n<li><strong>Neutral and open</strong>: Foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These values have guided us thus far, but it is time to align on a grander vision. What is Arbitrum’s north star?

To date, we have utilized approximately 75,042 ARB over the 12-week duration of the program.</p>\n<p>We are requesting to retain 174,958 ARB, bringing our total expenditure to 250,000 ARB out of the original 1,000,000, until the new grant programs are established.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Motivation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to highlight that incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods, such as the Pyth oracle, typically do not yield immediate results. The impact from making such incentives available to DeFi often unfolds over weeks or even months.</p>\n<p>For existing DeFi applications, switching to a new oracle involves significant effort and may require a new audit. Similarly, expanding from other chains to Arbitrum can be more time-consuming than anticipated, as illustrated by the Synthetix case <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023/20\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the initial LTIPP program, Arbitrum dApps had the ability to build robust oracle systems covering over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, FX, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. This advancement has eliminated outdated on-chain price updates and high costs, reinforcing Arbitrum’s position as a premier layer for DeFi. This progress empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications without constraints. This extension aims to keep the momentum and further empower potential new entrants like Synthetix to deliver a best-in-class protocol.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed extension of the Pyth Network’s LTIPP grant is designed to further cultivate a thriving and innovative DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The LTIPP program has already proven its effectiveness, with Pyth price updates on-chain increasing by 2-3 times and peaking at nearly 10 times the previous levels, reaching over 70,000 updates on July 14.</p>\n<p>Before the program began, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum was just over 43,000 ETH. This figure has since risen to 52,500 ETH, reflecting an increase of more than 20%.</p>\n<p>Pyth has also enabled over $16.1 billion in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges during June and July (with August data pending). This  underscores the benefits for applications powered by Pyth Network: protocols using Pyth have experienced, including increased total value locked (TVL), higher trading volumes, and more frequent price updates driven by a growing number of applications utilizing Pyth.</p>\n<p>The request for a 12-week extension, with a reduced ARB allocation, is part of our commitment towards responsible resource management commitment to responsible resource management while continuing to support the long-term success of applications built on Arbitrum that leverage Pyth. By covering the gas costs for using the Pyth oracle, the network has enabled more developers to create robust DeFi applications without the burden of high operational expenses.</p>\n<p>This strategy strengthens Arbitrum’s position as a premier platform for DeFi innovation, where developers can access over 500 price feeds without financial or technical constraints.</p>\n<p>It’s important to understand that the impact of incentives for infastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth price oracle are not immediate: it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it’s important to recognize that the impact of incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth oracle is not immediate; it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.</p>\n<p>This proposal, aims to build on the momentum generated by the initial LTIPP program, ensuring the continued growth and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem as new grant strategies are developed and implemented.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key Terms</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>On-demand or pull oracle: An oracle network where anyone can permissionlessly trigger price updates on-chain by doing an Arbitrum tx</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specifications</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>13 weeks duration</li>\n<li>175,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The proposed extension duration is similar to that of the previous LTIPP program—12 weeks versus 13 weeks (including retroactive rebates for the end of August). However, the amount of ARB tokens requested for gas rebates has increased from 75,000 ARB to 175,000 ARB.</p>\n<p>This increase reflects an anticipated rise in activity and associated costs, estimated at approximately 133%. The launch of Synthetix’s Multi-Collateral Perps on Arbitrum is expected to drive a substantial increase in the number of price updates triggered on-chain. For context, Synthetix currently triggers around 1,000 daily updates on Optimism and between 3,000 and 5,000 daily updates on Base—both without additional incentives in place.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves this extension, no additional work or involvement will be required from the DAO itself. The responsibility for managing the funds and continuing the program would remain entirely with the Pyth Data Association.</p>\n<p>As during the initial 12 weeks of the LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association would continue reimbursing dApps for gas costs every two weeks. Additionally, we would maintain our practice of providing bi-weekly updates on the Arbitrum forum to ensure transparency and accountability. Our latest report is available <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-bi-weekly-update-26-august-2024/26525\">here</a>, and we are open to including even more detailed data and information in these reports if needed.</p>\n<p>Since this is an extension of an already approved grant, no additional legal work is necessary. The Pyth Data Association has already completed KYC and signed the grant agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Timeline</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The LTIPP program officially ended on August 26, and until this extension proposal is approved, the Pyth Data Association has paused reimbursing the gas costs incurred by dApps during this period.</p>\n<p>If approved, the extension would be applied retroactively, starting from the end of the LTIPP program on August 26. This means that, depending on the timing of the Snapshot vote, there could be up to 2-3 weeks of retroactive gas rebates.</p>\n<p>The proposed extension would conclude on November 30, 2024.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Overall Cost</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cost to the Arbitrum DAO can be seen as an opportunity cost of 174,958 ARB, or potentially even less. Originally, the DAO approved a grant of 1,000,000 ARB—funds that were effectively budgeted and allocated—of which only 75,042 ARB was utilized during the 12-week LTIPP period.</p>\n<p>We are now requesting to retain 174,958 ARB from the initial allocation to continue offsetting costs for DeFi applications that use Pyth’s on-demand price feeds. The remaining 750,000 ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO as previously agreed under the LTIPP program. Furthermore, if any funds remain unspent before the outlined timeline concludes, Pyth Data Association will promptly return those ARB tokens to the DAO.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Additional Context</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have been actively seeking feedback and advice from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_stablelab\">@Matt_StableLab</a> to determine the best approach for moving forward with this extension request.</p>\n<p>Our interest in extending the LTIPP grant was initiated in the original LTIPP discussion <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003/10\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Currently, we plan to submit this extension request on Snapshot by Thursday, September 5, with support from Wintermute. This timeline allows ample opportunity to gather feedback on the proposal and make any necessary adjustments based on input from the DAO.</p>\n<p>Please note that Wintermute will merely be sponsoring the proposal as a delegate which is separate from their role as an LTIPP Council member.</p>\n            <p><small>18 posts - 13 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-pyth-network-arbitrum-ltipp-extension-request/26533\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-pyth-network-arbitrum-ltipp-extension-request/26533","pubDate":"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:36:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26533"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-pyth-network-arbitrum-ltipp-extension-request/26533.rss","#text":"[RFC] Pyth Network Arbitrum LTIPP Extension Request"}},{"title":"GovHack ETHcc Brussels 2024 - Impact Report - Hack Humanity","dc:creator":"KlausBrave","category":"Grants Discussions","description":"<p>Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024 - Impact Report</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57427-uploadhswo4t4z8qkttvcigljedyjuuepng-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57427-uploadhswo4t4z8qkttvcigljedyjuuepng-1\"></a><strong><strong><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02059913c118e1c850c916854b26fdff524e792c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hSWO4t4z8QKTtvcIgLJeDYjuuE.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/02059913c118e1c850c916854b26fdff524e792c_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hSWO4t4z8QKTtvcIgLJeDYjuuE\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/02059913c118e1c850c916854b26fdff524e792c_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/02059913c118e1c850c916854b26fdff524e792c_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02059913c118e1c850c916854b26fdff524e792c.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"394D63\"></a></div></strong></strong></h1>\n<p><strong>Title:</strong> GovHack ETHcc Brussels 2024</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal ID:</strong> <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-at-eth-cc-brussels/23305\">Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57427-executive-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57427-executive-summary-2\"></a>Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024, a three-day event held just before EthCC, brought together over 200 participants from 16 countries to drive governance innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

This would ensure that all tracks are well-represented and encourage more focused project development.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change the number of Tracks</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We had 10 tracks, while that meant we had a breadth of engagement, was that at the cost of depth of engagement. We could do the next GovHack to a much greater depth say on 3 tracks that are top priorities for the DAO for that quarter for instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Larger Scholarships:</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The $500 scholarships provided were not sufficient for participants travelling from outside Europe. One major delegate suggested increasing the scholarship amount to $2,500 per participant while curating the talent pool more selectively would better support the participation of high-value contributors. Ideal 20 x $2,500.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Workshops on Grants:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>More workshops focused explicitly on available grants and the application process would help participants better navigate the funding landscape and increase the quality of their proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Venue Considerations:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>While the venue was generally well-received, future events should take into account the proximity to related conferences, like EthCC, to make it more convenient for participants.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Post GovHack Support</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facilitated program to support promising proposals to continue development and submission to the DAO.

With more than 200 participants from 16 countries, the event provided a fertile ground for turning ideas into actionable proposals.</p>\n<p>The event’s well-organized structure, featuring pre-event mapathons, expert pitstops, and educational panels, gave participants the tools they needed to navigate the complex process of developing proposals. By focusing on key areas relevant to the DAO’s goals, the event ensured that contributions were both meaningful and impactful. The democratic approach to judging and community voting highlighted a strong commitment to fostering genuine innovation.</p>\n<p>Participants were highly satisfied, as evidenced by a Net Promoter Score of 83 and robust social media engagement. However, the real highlight was the personal connections and sense of community that emerged—something often lacking in virtual environments.</p>\n<p>The insights gained, especially around the timing of educational sessions and team formation, will be invaluable for future events. As Arbitrum continues to grow, the lessons and networks established at GovHack Brussels will be instrumental in shaping the DAO’s future. This event underscored the importance of in-person engagement in driving decentralized governance forward, setting a new benchmark for community-driven innovation.</p>\n<p>HackHumanity has thoroughly enjoyed producing GovHacks and wishes to continue this tradition providing GovHacks as a key competitive advantage for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Have added a Quick Poll for future direction, feedback much appreciated → <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethcc-brussels-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/26530/5\">Poll</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57427-additional-resources-33\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57427-additional-resources-33\"></a>Additional Resources</h1>\n<p>To explore more about the Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024, including videos, proposals, photos, and media coverage, please refer to the following links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>After-Movie</strong>:<a href=\"https://youtu.be/rkbYA9UPw2c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Watch the 4-minute after-movie</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proposal Submissions</strong>: View all proposals on the Arbitrum Forum <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/govhack-brussels/41\">GovHack section</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkbYA9UPw2c&amp;list=PLkNAiFdvbPL5yHNQW8d329fSl9XlrvcAZ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">All media playlist</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mapathon Recordings and Miro Boards</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://us06web.zoom.us/rec/share/aUbuP2IHtmt_DlR17-SzvG8D9nAH7ZeJ5-5zXORtJAqtHNFXGQRjGb1dU6iw8PEH.MWo3ZeC-FyNrad_r?startTime=1718633212000\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mapathon Round 1 -
