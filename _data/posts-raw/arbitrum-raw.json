If the DAO decides to stake, we recommend gradual investment into a regularly-rebalanced, diversified portfolio of LSTs actively managed in a DAO Treasury Management Vault to minimize trust and mitigate centralization while enabling adaptability to changing risk tolerance and market conditions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"staking-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#staking-overview-2\"></a>Staking Overview</h2>\n<p>Staking ETH is part of the proof-of-stake process for Ethereum mainnet. Stakers are allowed to propose/validate specific, new blocks and attest to a correct path through the block tree building a canonical block chain as it goes. If a staker does not attest to a block at the right time they will lose part of their staked funds. Doing everything correctly currently gains stakers about 3% of their stake per year, making staking <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&amp;field_tdr_date_value_month=202406\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">yield less than US treasuries</a> but more attractive than just holding ETH in a wallet.</p>\n<p>Staking, however, does have some interesting systemic concerns. For example, an entity that controls 33% of all staked ETH can delay finality which some have compared to holding finality hostage. An entity that controls 50% can begin to manipulate block chain fork choice and censor a small amount of blocks. An entity that controls 66% cannot forge transactions but otherwise completely controls what transactions occur on the network. They can censor and reorder transactions at will (including even halting finality). This allows them to dictate the rules of the mempool and have a powerful voice for their future vision of the network. Lido (discussed below) has <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">flirted with the 33% threshold</a> in the past and there are serious concerns that centralized exchanges could amass a concerning amount as well. The concentration of ETH is something that should be monitored regularly by the community. The worst-case scenario is that individual entities would be incentivized to create a cartel and reach the larger, more powerful thresholds that no one member of the cartel can reach on their own. Users aware of this possibility can counteract it by diversifying what entities they stake with. Self-staking would be one way to implement such a strategy and would contribute to the decentralization of the network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"staking-options-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#staking-options-3\"></a>Staking Options</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"self-staking-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#self-staking-4\"></a>Self-Staking</h3>\n<p>Self-staking is when users stake their own ETH by running their own validator node. This allows users to have full control over their funds so that they are able to withdraw their stake when and where they choose while also contributing to the decentralization of the network. The tradeoff for more control, though, is more responsibility. Should a user’s hardware go offline and the node not be present when they are required, they will be penalized the rewards amount they would have made. Worse, if a node makes a serious mistake (like proposing two different blocks) then they will lose a significant portion of their staked amount. The Ethereum Foundation documents the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">necessary validator software for a node</a> so getting started should be quite easy.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-5\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Running a node requires mitigations of the operational risks</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hardware Failure</strong>: hardware failing would create downtime for the node and penalties\n<ul>\n<li>What redundancy solutions are in place?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>DDoS attacks</strong>: the node being down could cost you penalties\n<ul>\n<li>Are you implementing methods to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Node Software Bugs</strong>: The software running the node could have bugs causing the node to have bad behavior and be penalized. The worst case scenario can occur when a <a href=\"https://clientdiversity.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">super majority of all clients</a> run the same node software implementation. A bug in this case could mean all these nodes reaching finality on incorrect blocks and getting slashed on the chain that did not encounter the bug.\n<ul>\n<li>What execution client is running? consensus client? Are they part of a super majority of clients being run?</li>\n<li>What will the software be running on? Is it reliable?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Web2 Attack vectors</strong>: A node machine connected to the internet could receive malware. Worst case scenario is the heist of the node’s private keys. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aP9f_1v9Ulc?t=1740\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vitalik cited this as the reason for him not staking his entire ETH amount</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>Are you following good security practices?</li>\n<li>Who has access to the machine and what powers do they have?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mitigation of these risks usually requires utilizing battle-tested <a href=\"https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">resources and practices</a>. The good news is that spinning up a node and a secure plan for its operation can take place on the <a href=\"https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Holesky testnet</a>. Users should spend time assessing their node setup and effectiveness on this testnet prior to moving to mainnet.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"staking-as-a-service-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#staking-as-a-service-6\"></a>Staking As A Service</h3>\n<p>Staking-as-a-service (<strong>SaaS</strong> or sometimes <strong>StaaS</strong>) allows users to outsource the running of the validator node to a hired operator. There are two large distinctions here: custodial and non-custodial. Custodial SaaS means delivering complete control of your funds to an entity who promises to stake and reward in a certain way but users have no control over their funds, the entity’s behavior, and the regulatory regime of the entity. Examples of this are centralized exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/features/staking-coins\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kraken</a>. Not only can the exchange’s regulatory regime change haphazardly and without warning, but the exchange itself also has its own security practices which may or may not be disclosed or correct and many numerous exchanges have lost user funds.</p>\n<p>Non-custodial Saas includes services like <a href=\"https://www.kiln.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kiln</a> and <a href=\"https://stake.fish/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stakefish</a>. Users deposit their ETH with the provider who then runs the node for them. The node will have its own signing keys and allows the user to have their own, private fund keys which allow them to move funds in and out of the node. In this way, users will have more control over their funds but as determined by the staking provider.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-7\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Utilizing a provider requires trust and verifying their system’s behavior. Vetting a SaaS provider means determining how much of their operation is programmatic and transparent and also measuring their operational history against their operational risk management practices.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency Allows Trust</strong>: black-box SaaS providers have no ability to convince users of their practices and guarantees.\n<ul>\n<li>What parts of the system are open source? audited? bug bounties?</li>\n<li>How are critical components like keys and funds handled?</li>\n<li>What fees do they charge? How is this verifiable?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Best Practices Are Best</strong>: providers that have plans for mitigating the operational issues above demonstrate competence. Look for providers that are open and proactive at describing the risks within their systems and how they handle them.\n<ul>\n<li>How long has the provider been operating?</li>\n<li>How much have they experienced penalties over their operation? What for? Have they ever been slashed?</li>\n<li>Do they describe mitigations to the operational risks described above?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Keep Things Permissionless</strong>: if a system is permissionless to enter and exit, then malicious operators and regulatory regimes cannot interfere with user funds.\n<ul>\n<li>Is it permissionless to join?</li>\n<li>Is there a regulatory regime that affects the provider? Does it require Know-Your-Customer information to join?</li>\n<li>What keys are required to be handed over? Are there separate keys for signing and moving funds?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Good vetting goes a long way but ultimately SaaS requires trust. Diversification among many different, qualified providers could protect a user from concentrated bad effects if there are enough trusted providers to be found.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pooled-staking-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pooled-staking-8\"></a>Pooled Staking</h3>\n<p>Pooled staking is when users deposit their funds together for a node operator to utilize and share staking rewards. Pools that are largely managed on-chain are the most common and provide smart contracts for users to manage their participation. Less common are SaaS-like pools where fund management and rewards are handled off-chain to some degree. By far the most common on-chain solution is for pools to provide ERC20-compliant liquid staking tokens (LSTs) for user deposits. This provides a unique opportunity for users. First, it’s incredibly convenient. A simple deposit is often enough to begin. And second, these pools allow users to stake but then re-deploy their LSTs to other financial purposes. In this way, users can stake and then gain further returns on their capital. Posting these tokens as collateral for more ETH and then repeating the staking process is not uncommon and allows users to create leveraged, staked positions but exposes them to the risks of market prices moving drastically against them and swallowing their initial staking capital. Examples of staking pools include <a href=\"https://rocketpool.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Rocket Pool</a> and of course <a href=\"https://lido.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido</a> which is the single largest staked ETH holder.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-9\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Staking pools have similar risks to SaaS providers but must also handle commingled funds across possibly multiple node operators. As mentioned above, Lido is the giant in this space and its operation is handled by the <a href=\"https://lido.fi/governance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido DAO</a>. So responsible users of the protocol should keep themselves apprised of the DAO’s initiatives and votes. Also, the systemic concerns begin appearing here as well. <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido has been criticized</a> for not doing enough to counter its <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x10abedcc563b66b1adee60825e78c387105110fa4a1e7354ab57bc9cc1e675c2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">profit-seeking motivation</a> and the power of the market incentives for cartel-like behavior cannot be dismissed. Lastly and perhaps most difficult to measure, the ability of users to easily create large leveraged positions could create a catastrophic financial contagion scenario in the face of a large transaction or price movement. For example, June 2022’s stEth depeg was the catalyst for the bankruptcy of Celsius, Voyager, and Three Arrows Capital.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Systemic Risks</strong>: Users should be cognizant of the health of the network and play a responsible part. Diversification among different pools can help mitigate centralization risks.\n<ul>\n<li>How much staked ETH does the pool own?</li>\n<li>How many node operators does it employ? How are these node operators chosen? Are there policies in place to limit incentives for collusion?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Market Risks</strong>: Liquid staking tokens allow users the opportunity to re-deploy their capital but that means they’re subject to the market moving against them.\n<ul>\n<li>Does it provide a liquid staking token? Does it swap for ETH one for one or by an oracle?</li>\n<li>How well does the LST price track the price of ETH through time? What is its market history? Are there other market factors that can be seen to influence the price of the LST? Has it ever depegged?</li>\n<li>What financial analyses are available to assess the financial status and risks of the LST? of its penetration into other markets? of its use in leveraged positions?</li>\n<li>Will you be re-investing your LSTs and putting your ETH stake at risk?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pool-specific Operational Risks</strong>: DAOs (malicious or not) could enact bad upgrades, switch infrastructures, or mandate new policies within an ecosystem that was assumed to behave a different way by users. Commingling of funds also presents a new difficult task with its own risks.\n<ul>\n<li>What components are on-chain and off-chain? How are they controlled? What is the governance structure?</li>\n<li>Is there an operating DAO? Is it dominated by a few actors? What are its goals, initiatives, and vote history? Has it defined a philosophy toward its role and services?</li>\n<li>How do funds enter and exit the pool? How are they then staked and unstaked?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"restaking-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#restaking-10\"></a>Restaking</h3>\n<p>In addition to Ethereum’s proof of stake process, there are other processes called Actively Validated Services (AVSs) which also require staked assets to operate. <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/restaking-101-what-are-restaking-and-liquid-restaking/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Restaking</a> is the practice of using ETH or liquid staking tokens to stake on AVSs. They can be oracles, bridges, cryptography schemes, etc. An example of a restaking protocol is <a href=\"https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Eigenlayer</a> and examples of AVSs are <a href=\"https://www.lagrange.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lagrange</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gasp.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gasp</a>. Usually, restaking providers give ERC20-compliant liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) for deposits and these have similar risks to LSTs in the market. This is a relatively newer service and does have slightly higher returns than the above options but at higher risk of losing funds due to the added complexity of running these services. These are much more complicated than liquid staking pools and are utilized by many to lever up a position and get the highest possible return from a staking-based strategy. Leverage among LRTs, like leverage of LSTs, complicates markets in ways that are difficult to quantify and investigate.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-11\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Restaking has all the complexity of liquid staking pools and then more. Restaking’s complexity and the less-developed markets for their tokens create serious risks that may not be worth it for an investor like Arbitrum DAO where safety of the funds is prioritized.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"considerations-for-the-dao-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#considerations-for-the-dao-12\"></a>Considerations for the DAO</h2>\n<p>All of the above describe staking risks but not their prevalence. As staking operations and markets become more mature, these risks become less and less likely. So how should the DAO proceed?</p>\n<h3><a name=\"determining-a-strategy-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#determining-a-strategy-13\"></a>Determining a Strategy</h3>\n<p>In the future, when issues arise and theses no longer hold true, having a written-down investment plan helps justify the path taken and determine what will need to be done next. The DAO should commit to defining:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What their staking and investment goals are</li>\n<li>What is the timeframe of their staking/investing</li>\n<li>Of the risks described above, what are they willing to take on and how much</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we’ve seen from discussions, the staking goals of the DAO appear to be to protect against ETH inflation, to generate revenue from the ETH reserves they hold, and to do all of this as safely as possible. Whether the DAO has specific, future liabilities they are working towards, we are not aware but these should be part of the investment plan if they exist. The time frame appears to be indefinite, i.e. it seems that this may be a permanent use of the ETH reserves. As for risks, the DAO should determine what risks it likes and what it doesn’t.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"risk-assessment-and-diversification-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#risk-assessment-and-diversification-14\"></a>Risk Assessment and Diversification</h3>\n<p>Let’s start a risk assessment by stating that individual staking may be operationally infeasible for a DAO to run. Multi-sigs, payment agreements, and all sorts of logistics can be set up, but the DAO would ultimately have to trust someone to handle the hardware, software, and funds correctly. So all the set up work is effectively the same as staking via with a SaaS provider but with extra, time-intensive steps to begin. This means that there is no option where the DAO stakes without trusting <em>someone</em>. Put another way, to stake the DAO will have to reasonably trust another party with their funds.</p>\n<p>We also do not go into much detail about Restaking and risks and leave it to the DAO to make that determination if they so choose. LRTs are easier to depeg and markets are harder to analyze therefore we’d recommend the DAO consider LSTs and build experience in these services before considering LRTs.</p>\n<p>This leaves SaaS and Staking Pools. From an operational risk and security perspective, there are SaaS providers and Staking Pools with histories of security and good practices. Each will need to be vetted as described above but the general difference between the two are the market forces that act on pools’ liquid staking tokens. Whether to accept market risks is for the DAO to decide. But having worked in the DeFi space, we see that good investment practice is to document the LST’s market forces, the possible blind spots, the market history, have a plan of action that is ready and easy to implement in case certain conditions arise, visit the assumptions and theses of the plan regularly, and to change the plan if the DAOs understanding of things changes.</p>\n<p>To protect itself from catastrophic, operational failure, OpenZeppelin will vet the security and posture of the different options the DAO considers. The DAO could also split its staked ETH across different options, limiting the max amount they can lose in the worst case scenario. The DAO can also consider slowly staking its ETH over time as it grows comfortable with the different options and strategy as a whole.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"strategy-execution-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#strategy-execution-15\"></a>Strategy Execution</h3>\n<p>A DAO treasury management protocol like <a href=\"https://docs.aera.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aera</a> can be used for securing a diverse portfolio of assets, not limited to the recommended LSTs, with programmatically constrained active management.  A solution like this allows the DAO to remain in control of treasury funds and respond to market conditions faster than a governance vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"links-and-references-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#links-and-references-16\"></a>Links and References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2982\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2982</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/staking/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ethereum.org/en/staking/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.md</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guides\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guides</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4840805\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4840805</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/restaking-101-what-are-restaking-and-liquid-restaking/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.coindesk.com/learn/restaking-101-what-are-restaking-and-liquid-restaking/</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/eth-staking-options-and-risks-for-the-dao/25762\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/eth-staking-options-and-risks-for-the-dao/25762","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:36:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25762"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/eth-staking-options-and-risks-for-the-dao/25762.rss","#text":"ETH Staking Options and Risks for the DAO"}},{"title":"Event Horizon Franchiser Contract Audit","dc:creator":"openzeppelin","category":"Security Member","description":"<h2><a name=\"audit-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#audit-summary-1\"></a>Audit Summary</h2>\n<p>Type:   Governance</p>\n<p>Timeline:   From 2024-07-01 To 2024-07-05</p>\n<p>Languages:   Solidity</p>\n<p>Total Issues:   6 (1 resolved)</p>\n<p>Notes &amp; Additional Information:   6 (1 resolved)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"scope-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#scope-2\"></a>Scope</h2>\n<p>We audited the <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">HVAX/arbfranchiser repository</a> at <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser/tree/8caba3d84bb53d1695bfefcf1a99476ef892333e\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commit 8caba3d</a>.</p>\n<p>In scope were the following files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">src\n├── FranchiserFactory.sol\n├── Franchiser.sol\n├── FranchiserLens.sol\n├── base\n│   └── FranchiserImmutableState.sol\n└── interfaces\n    ├── IVotingToken.sol\n    ├── IFranchiserLens.sol\n    ├── IFranchiserImmutableState.sol\n    ├── Franchiser\n    │   ├── IFranchiser.sol\n    │   ├── IFranchiserErrors.sol\n    │   └── IFranchiserEvents.sol\n    └── FranchiserFactory\n        ├── IFranchiserFactory.sol\n        └── IFranchiserFactoryErrors.sol\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The audit only reviewed the smart contract components intended to be deployed on-chain.

This is an EOA that the <a href=\"https://eventhorizon.vote/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Event Horizon (EH) organization</a> will use to represent the voters from their platform. ARB users can only delegate their entire voting power to another address. So, in order to delegate a specific amount, a contract has been created that will have the amount transferred to it and then delegate its voting power to EH.</p>\n<p>The contract that EH provided to do this is a <a href=\"https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fork of a contract that was developed for Uniswap</a>. It was privately audited by Trail of Bits and has a lot of functionality beyond the minimum needs of the ARB DAO. The top-level contract which the DAO will interact with is the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract. It is built to allow anyone to delegate their <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/05f218fb6617932e56bf5388c3b389c3028a7b73/contracts/governance/utils/IVotes.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20 voting token</a>, like ARB, to a delegatee. It does this by creating a <code>Franchiser</code> contract underneath that would mark the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> as the owner, hold the $ARB tokens from the caller, and call <code>delegate</code> on the token to transfer the voting power to the specified user (e.g., the EH EOA).</p>\n<p>When the DAO is ready to take back the funds, a call to <code>recall</code> will pull the tokens out of the <code>Franchiser</code> and return them. There are added methods to batch delegation and recalling which we do not anticipate the DAO will need in this specific case but could use if more delegations of this sort arise. The <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract will create a <code>Franchiser</code> contract as needed for each unique delegator/delegatee pair, while each <code>Franchiser</code> is set up as a <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Clones\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">minimal proxy</a> of a Franchiser implementation contract.</p>\n<p>Each <code>Franchiser</code> contract has to ability for the delegatee to subdelegate their delegated tokens to further subdelegatees. This creates a tree of <code>Franchise</code> contracts with the original delegator/delegatee Franchise contract at the head, each subdelegation from a delegatee at each child node, and the tokens being transferred down the tree to imbue voting power. The original delegatee can sub-delegate up to eight times with each of these sub-delegating up to four, then two, then one. Counting the maximum possible nodes in each level of the tree totals to <code>(1) + (8) + (8 * 4) + (8 * 4 * 2) + (8 * 4 * 2) = 169</code> nodes. At each Franchiser contract in this tree, the delegatee can unsubdelegate and return all of the funds transferred down the tree to their own contract and restore their full voting power delegation. The <code>recall</code> method mentioned above does the same thing but returns all tokens from the tree to the original delegator.</p>\n<p>The scope also includes an optional <code>FranchiserLens</code> contract which contains <code>view</code> functions to get data from the Franchiser tree in flat formats.

If the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract is to be used solely for this one EH delegation, it is possible to change the <code>INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES</code> to one and make further subdelegations by EH impossible. This would ensure that they do not have the ability to further subdelegate to another actor who is not in the proposal but would make vote splitting by subdelegation impossible by EH (at least until <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387\">fractional voting is brought to the governor</a>).</p>\n<p>Of course, by delegating in the first place, the DAO is already trusting EH to behave as promised. Thus, further subdelegations being used maliciously to vote in other ways appears to be a minor risk that is mitigated by the ability to revoke the funds. However, revoking is a slow process that would require a vote to pass as the L2 Governor would be the original delegator. A way around it would be to transfer the funds directly to the security council and entrust them to create the subdelegation from the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract. We are not aware, however, of a precedent or authority for the council to behave this way.</p>\n<p>Possible ways to improve the code and tailor it specifically to Arbitrum’s needs would be to give the non-emergency security council the ability to recall the funds. This can be done by allowing the council to be specified at initial delegation and adding an ability for them to call the <code>recall</code> function. However, even then, a call to <code>recall</code> (even <code>unSubDelegate</code>) could be front-run to get in a last vote before losing voting power. A fix for this could be to add some sort of authorization method for the delegatee to vote only on approved votes, but this seems overly protective and operationally taxing to implement. No matter what the community chooses or how the contract iterates, we will review any on-chain proposal for construction/delegation and opine on its safety and features.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Resolved in <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser/blob/101d01da9b6ca33bf3e9ad1bf12841fc96e5ab8a/src/FranchiserFactory.sol#L18\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commit 101d01d</a>.</em></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-12\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This audit covered the Franchiser contracts provided by Event Horizon.

The <code>Franchiser</code> contract, as audited, allows Event Horizon to further subdelegate their tokens.

Even more important than decentralisation is openness - the degree to which an ecosystem allows for outside-in innovation.</p>\n<p>Decentralisation prevents capture by a small group of participants, but a capture-resistant ecosystem can still die through disruption and being outcompeted. Survival is directly dependent on our ability to adapt and improve, to understand the needs of users, talent, investors, etc. and to provide outstanding solutions. Said otherwise, the key for survival is being able to innovate in how we solve people’s problems.</p>\n<p>Being at the forefront of innovation is a tricky thing. By definition, innovative solutions are not commonly known and understood. Innovation can not be fully planned, it can only be supported and encouraged.</p>\n<p>Critically, because innovative ideas can come from all kinds of places, as an ecosystem, it’s key to be welcoming to innovations that originated somewhere else. Corporations have learnt this lesson the hard way and now commonly fund a trifecta of accelerators, VC funds, and M&amp;A to facilitate outside-in innovation. However, despite these strategies providing some defences to disruption,<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1259275/average-company-lifespan/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20average%20lifespan,even%20further%20throughout%20the%202020s.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> the lifespan of corporations keeps decreasing</a>. More needs to be done!</p>\n<p>For an organisation designer like myself, DAOs are exciting because they promise both capture resistance AND a radical upgrade in our ability to incorporate outside-in innovation. Instead of problems being discussed behind closed doors, DAOs can employ open communication platforms. Instead of rejecting anything ‘not invented here’, DAOs can celebrate experimentation. Instead of falling for the shorter-mist allure of cost-cutting and reducing redundancy, DAOs can decentralise operations and experiment with a variety of methods. In sum, DAOs can transform organisations from closed to open, leading to better outcomes for users, contributors, and investors.</p>\n<p>DAOs could do that but right now that’s far from certain. The allure of centralisation is strong. Innovation compounds over time but it’s hard to measure in the early stages. When appropriate methodologies and assessment frameworks are not in place, cost-cutting (disguised as efficiency) quickly kills anything hard to quantify or explain.</p>\n<p>This is not a new problem, a range of methodologies and tools for what’s called open innovation has been slowly maturing. <a href=\"https://rndao.mirror.xyz/TxGTNemp_c4uNeWGiubJbC3akaNfJIJYcbgQZrHLK10\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Our research shows</a> that sense-making (being able to identify and prioritise challenges and root causes) is the critical first step. We now understand that access to information and being able to search through weak signals is key for outsiders to be able to propose innovations. And we know that offering quick access to funding for small experiments is critical for anything innovative to ever be tested.</p>\n<p>The lack of tools and methodologies for open innovation (or lack of awareness that they even exist), leads many to conclude that only closed-door meetings are effective. <a href=\"https://x.com/_Daniel_Ospina/status/1810670977174417918\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">As Disruption Joe eloquently said</a>, DAOs suffer through a common pattern of decentralising (poorly), then worrying about execution, centralising, and finally stagnating.

Initially, the community was hesitant to sell ARB tokens, resulting in the decision not to convert them. As a result, the remaining funds are insufficient to cover the planned six-month term. The ARDC is requesting an additional 1,200,000 ARB to support operations through August and September, ensuring they can fulfill their mandate. Any surplus funds will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> - The Proposal aims to ensure that the ArbitrumDAO satisfies its payment obligations to ARDC members that were duly elected by the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong> - The proposal will move to a Snapshot vote on the 25th of july.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong> - 1,200,000ARB</p>\n<h1><a name=\"request-for-additional-funding-for-the-ardc-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#request-for-additional-funding-for-the-ardc-1\"></a>Request for Additional Funding for the ARDC</h1>\n<p>[1] Background</p>\n<p>Following the establishment of the Arbitrum Research &amp; Development Collective (‘ARDC’) for an initial 6-month term, we have encountered challenges due to the price fluctuation of ARB tokens. In the proposal passed on <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/56002054155248055908873103086558103132748843103210580613728556162036150296506\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tally</a> and executed on 25-Jan-2024, 1.76M ARB was transferred to the multi-sig wallet worth approximately $3.06M USD at the time (with ARB priced at around $1.74). Currently, the price of ARB is approximately $0.75, resulting in a significant reduction in the purchasing power of ARB, now valued at less than half its original amount.</p>\n<p>At the time, there was community hesitance in relation to OTC’ing the ARB supplied to the ARDC. Hence, this was not done to respect the community sentiment at the time.</p>\n<p>ARDC Members currently get remunerated accordingly as per their election that was held via Snapshot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delphi [72k Worth of ARB/month];</li>\n<li>Blockworks [72K Worth of ARB/month];</li>\n<li>Chaos Labs [53,333 Worth of ARB/month];</li>\n<li>L2Beat [50k ARB for the entire term, in monthly tranches];</li>\n<li>OpenZeppelin [125,000 Worth of ARB /month].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to this volatility, the 1.76M ARB is insufficient to fund the ARDC for its full 6-month term. Currently, the multi-sig wallet holds 163.32k ARB priced at $124,000. To address this, we propose an injection of over and above the original amount requested, which will help fund the ARDC through August and September. This additional funding will enable the ARDC to fully execute its program as originally intended.</p>\n<p>Any excess ARB which will not be utilised will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury.</p>\n<p>[2] Proposal Details:</p>\n<p>Additional Funding Request: We request an additional 1,200,000 ARB to supplement the existing funds used to support the ARDC.</p>\n<p>Return of Surplus Funds: Any surplus funds remaining after the completion of the ARDC’s term will be returned to the DAO.</p>\n<p>[3] Conclusion:</p>\n<p>The ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By providing additional funding to the ARDC to compensate for the negative price movement of the ARB token, the ARDC will be able to fulfil its initial mandate as originally intended.</p>\n

Participation and Incentives</h1>\n<p>This is the first report we present on the Delegate Incentive Program. As an added value, we include in this report an in-depth analysis of voting and participation within Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>The Delegate Incentive Program was officially launched on <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/march-1-incentive-program-start/21492\">March 1</a> and has been operational for nearly four months. In this report, we aim to demonstrate its impact so far and the behavior of the delegates participating in it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we include an analysis of voting and participation on both Tally and Snapshot in ArbitrumDAO. We believe this context is essential for delegates to understand not only the program itself but also the overall governance dynamics we consider.</p>\n<p>We hope this analysis is useful. If you prefer a summary, our conclusions are:</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tldr-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tldr-3\"></a>TL;DR</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Participation Rate of delegates participating in the program has increased by 12% on Snapshot and 13% on Tally compared to the previous three months.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO activity is exceptionally high, even excluding the incentive program votes, which account for the majority of the voting activity. As of May 31, 2024, we had an average of 9 proposals per month, or roughly 1 proposal every 3 days.</li>\n<li>The average Voting Power on Tally exceeds Snapshot by 14 million tokens, but it has decreased by 10 million compared to last year. Governance proposals have the lowest average Voting Power at 136 million tokens, while council or committee member elections have the highest average at 160 million tokens per vote.</li>\n<li>There is a significant number of voters with less than 1k VP, while the majority of VP is concentrated in approximately 50 addresses.</li>\n<li>We must be mindful of the quorum required for each vote, which increases as more tokens are put into circulation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"navigating-arbitrumdao-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#navigating-arbitrumdao-4\"></a>Navigating ArbitrumDAO</h2>\n<p>ArbitrumDAO has existed for approximately one year and two months, officially launched in March 2023 along with the ARB token.

Currently, Arbitrum DAO relies on these approximately 60 addresses that hold the majority of the Voting Power, determining the direction and decisions within the DAO.

The data reflects <em><strong>significant growth</strong></em> in the number of proposals and delegate participation. This comes in a context where activity in Arbitrum DAO has been high, averaging nine proposals per month, even excluding proposals related to the various incentive programs approved by the DAO.</p>\n<p>We observed that the <strong>participation rate of VP from delegates in the program increased by 12% on Snapshot and 13% on Tally during the three months the program has been active</strong>, compared to the three months prior. However, it is important to note that the <strong>average Voting Power on Tally has decreased</strong>. While most voters fall within the lower VP ranges, the data indicates that the majority of VP is concentrated in a small number of addresses, which are crucial for achieving quorum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Delegates who participated in the program showed a high rate of participation in voting and forum contributions</strong></em>. The number of collected comments and participation in forum discussions increased significantly, demonstrating greater engagement from incentivized delegates. <strong>It’s encouraging to see the quantity of discussions rise in the forum.</strong> While there is still room for improvement, we believe we are on the right track.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n

The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured off-site event will be organized right before <a href=\"https://devcon.org/en/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DevCon Thailand</a>, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.</p>\n<p>This proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to identify the most important agenda items to be discussed at the off-site, ensuring the IRL meeting is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The off-site will then include professional facilitation and a distraction-free environment to advance alignment, remove blockers, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.</p>\n<p>The success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively on the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem</h2>\n<p>The DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.</p>\n<p>Areas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution</h2>\n<p>Recent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for IRL events to catalyse progress. We want to build on these learnings and prepare thoroughly to leverage the next big Web3 event (DevCon in Thailand) to advance ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Agenda prioritisation</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Project manager to engage with delegates and key stakeholders, distilling concerns and topic suggestions, and facilitate converging on the agenda.</li>\n<li>Careful planning of each session: aiming to share and agree on frameworks and approaches in advance, focusing IRL discussion on content and not format.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Off-site Event Organization:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>2 full-day event, with the option to participate only one day if needed by some attendees.</li>\n<li>Distraction-free environment (arranged catering and accommodation, separate from other events).</li>\n<li>Focused sessions on key agreed topic(s).</li>\n<li>Professional facilitation for key sessions</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Attendees:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on high-context, expert, and senior participants.

As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the meeting is effective.</p>\n<p>RnDAO can either provide facilitation (we’ve facilitated strategy and org design workshops for years) or we can hire an external facilitator. The tradeoff is high context and full neutrality (as participants of the DAO we’re biased, and although any good facilitator will try to remain neutral, there are still tradeoffs and decisions to be made in moderating conversations).<br>\nAs such, we’ll ask in the Snapshot vote whether the delegates trust us to be the facilitator or would rather have us hire an external facilitator.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"hybrid-participation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#hybrid-participation-8\"></a>Hybrid participation</h2>\n<p>We’ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost $100-$600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties.

favor of the proposal, excluding the playbook. This initiative effectively addresses the DAO’s need for structured problem definition and alignment, ensuring that proposals are well-prepared and strategically aligned. By focusing on early-stage initiatives and using Questbook’s small grants model, we can improve the quality and impact of proposals within the Arbitrum DAO. While the playbook could be a valuable addition, the core elements of this proposal are sufficient to drive significant improvements in our governance and operational processes. This approach will help streamline our decision-making and foster greater engagement within the community.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/governance-pilot-for-a-questbook-jumpstart-fund-for-problem-definition-and-dao-improvement/25648\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/governance-pilot-for-a-questbook-jumpstart-fund-for-problem-definition-and-dao-improvement/25648","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 23:53:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25648"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/governance-pilot-for-a-questbook-jumpstart-fund-for-problem-definition-and-dao-improvement/25648.rss","#text":"Governance：Pilot for a Questbook Jumpstart fund for problem definition and DAO improvement"}},{"title":"Frax Finance Bi-Weekly Update (7/16/2024)","dc:creator":"Frax.Finance","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p>ARB Received Last Disbursement: 125,000 ARB</p>\n<p>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks: 121,376 ARB</p>\n<p>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Contract Address</th>\n<th>Contract Tag/Name</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0x4645e6476d3a5595be9efd39426cc10586a8393d</td>\n<td>Curve -

The core pool mechanisms of Balancer and the STIP Addendum boost settings will foster a healthy and sustainable way for the most beneficial asset classes for Arbitrum to flourish on Balancer.

Balancer is happy to continue expanding options for our user’s and Arbitrums to earn yield on stable coins.

intend to distribute approximately 166,000 ARB during epoch 3 and an additional 166,000 ARB in epoch 4. As for the Trading Incentives program, we plan to allocate around 150,000 ARB initially, followed by another 175,000 ARB one week later.</p>\n<p>Currently, our focus is on assisting accepted grantees in achieving their milestones more efficiently before the conclusion of the STIP Bridge program. Once the grantee’s milestones are successfully completed, we anticipate disbursing approximately $100,000 ARB.</p>\n<p>The trading incentives provided by GMX fell significantly short of their projected goal last week. The aim, as communicated through various channels, had been to ‘reduce trading fees on GMX by up to 75%’.</p>\n<p>The 150,000 ARB provided for trading incentives only resulted in a net trading fee rebate of around 15%, due to a decrease in the value of ARB coupled with a vast increase in trading volume on GMX.</p>\n<p>This disparity resulted in some critical community feedback, and reflection on the allocation and its underlying assumptions.</p>\n<p>To compensate for the unexpected shortfall, the GMX Grants Committee decided to provide an additional 150,000 ARB as trading incentives for this past week.</p>\n<p>This one-time retroactive bonus distribution brings the actual rebate more in line with the stated aim.</p>\n<p>We are planning to disburse around <strong>757,000</strong> <strong>ARB in incentives, and currently, we have around</strong> <strong>274,414.55</strong>  ARB in our multi-sig.

By addressing areas such as rising expenditures, diversifying income streams, managing ARB sell pressure, and optimizing the treasury’s risk exposure, the DAO can fortify its financial health. These are common challenges faced by many DAOs and, which with the right actions, can be overcome.</p>\n<p>With this context in mind, Avantgarde proposes a holistic treasury management process designed to enhance the DAO’s long-term sustainability. Our plan focuses on the strategic diversification of the treasury to generate yield on treasury assets while reducing risk. By implementing this structured approach, we can effectively manage the sell pressure on ARB. We believe it is important to act now to ensure a more stable future for the DAO making it more resilient in future downturns.</p>\n<p>We’re very supportive of the recent proposal by Karpatkey and Gauntlet and would like to put ourselves forward as an option alongside them. We feel that there are strong benefits to manager diversification for several reasons;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Diversification of infrastructure risk</li>\n<li>Variety of approaches &amp; strategies to provide more diversified returns across different market cycles</li>\n<li>A more heterogeneous set of strategies will facilitate the spread of liquidity across the ecosystem</li>\n<li>Provides the DAO Oversight Committee with more data points to assess across multiple managers</li>\n<li>Provides the DAO Oversight Committee with flexibility in the event a manager is not performing (can easily move allocation to another manager in the program)</li>\n<li>Removing a single point of failure is in line with Arbitrum’s ethos towards decentralisation</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Treasury Volatility &amp; Diversification</p>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO currently holds 98% of its treasury in its native token, a heavily concentrated portfolio. Though this is similar to many other DAOs in the space, it can be problematic from a treasury management perspective for a number of reasons. Firstly, holding an entire portfolio in a single asset exposes the treasury to significant risk of failure - even the most optimally run organisations (whether traditional or decentralised) can be impacted by black swan events outside of its control - diversification is a hedge against one’s inability to perfectly predict the future. Secondly, the risk is amplified when that asset is the project’s own token, since its price is linked to the fundamental performance of the project - this constrains the ability of the treasury to act as a counter cyclical buffer when the project is most in need of liquidity. Thirdly, crypto is volatile, far more so than other prices in the economy. This creates a mismatch between a DAOs assets and its liabilities, which include the cash outflows for the current and future projects it intends to fund through its treasury. Though grant payments might be denominated in crypto, human labour is still priced against its own costs, which are largely still denominated in fiat - even during the heightened economic volatility of recent years, price changes in the real economy still pale in comparison to the price movements of most tokens.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"goals-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#goals-3\"></a>Goals</h1>\n<p>The goal as treasury manager is to improve long term sustainability of the Arbitrum DAO, achieved through a number of sub objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allocate to strategies that generate an alternative revenue stream to buffer against poor market conditions</li>\n<li>Initiatives to improve the liquidity of the DAO’s native token</li>\n<li>Managing any price impact of the ARB token from treasury management operations</li>\n<li>(Future direction subject to DAO coordination) Utilise treasury management strategies that bring the risk of the DAO treasury in line with financial objectives</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-to-avantgarde-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-to-avantgarde-4\"></a>Introduction to Avantgarde</h1>\n<p>Avantgarde is a crypto native asset management, advisory and research firm, specialising in asset liability management, R&amp;D, special situations, risk monitoring and on-chain diversification strategies. Avantgarde has conducted work for leading protocols including Uniswap, The Graph, Arbitrum, Nexus Mutual, Paraswap, Enzyme and others. DAOs leverage Avantgarde’s combined expertise in protocol development and asset management for developing strategies to improve treasury sustainability.</p>\n<p>There are many approaches to DAO treasury management. Our philosophy is to take a longer term and data driven approach (where appropriate), with a preference for simplicity over complexity, and to focus on diversification across the treasury management process.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde has been involved with Arbitrum’s Treasury &amp; Sustainability Working Group since the early stages, including the production of a <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-research-risk-reduction-in-dao-treasuries/20662/2\">study</a> focusing on how traditional asset classes, accessed via real world assets, can reduce risk within DAO treasuries which played a role in the evolution of the STEP program to where it is today</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-strategy-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-strategy-5\"></a>Proposed Strategy</h1>\n<p>Risk Reduction</p>\n<p>Although the realised volatility of ARB has been lower recently compared to previous years, it remains at nearly double that of BTC and ETH. Whilst it is worth acknowledging volatility is far from an exhaustive measure of risk, it is useful in a treasury management context since higher volatility reduces the certainty of future grants, diminishing visibility and making longer term financial planning more difficult.</p>\n<p>One pillar of the strategy will look to de-risk the treasury through allocations into lower volatility assets, such as stablecoins and ETH, whilst making considerations for ARB liquidity to regulate sell pressure.</p>\n<p>Revenue Generation</p>\n<p>A by-product of thoughtful diversification of the treasury is the potential for generating revenues for the DAO. In addition to reducing treasury volatility, allocations in stablecoins and ETH can be put to work in DeFi to generate yield that will support DAO sustainability. A key focus of the DeFi strategies considered will be on risk management and earning a risk-adjusted return consistent with the cash flow needs of the DAO. On-chain rates in DeFi vary by collateral, across protocols, and through time (block by block). To estimate an aggregate measure for yields in DeFi, On-chain Stablecoin Yield looks at a TVL weighted average APR of the most prominent stablecoin lending protocols. Rates are currently above ~7% for the largest stablecoins on the most well known and highest capacity lending pools.</p>\n<p>A separate source of organic on-chain yield is staking rewards on ETH. Though execution layer rewards are more stochastic, consensus layer rewards are far more stable and dependent on the number of validators staking on the network. Current consensus layer APR is around 3%, with execution layer rewards averaging just under 1%.</p>\n<p>In practice there are strategies which can improve on the risk adjusted returns of these simple examples, however they provide a useful baseline to illustrate the potential revenue that can be generated for the DAO.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde will implement a range of treasury strategies via a pre-approved protocol universe and agreed risk parameters (for example via a DAO Oversight Committee) which can be enshrined as policies within treasury management infrastructure tooling (as covered in the following section). Beyond the primary objectives of reducing treasury volatility and generating diversified revenue streams through yield, we will also look to allocate to projects that would foster Arbitrum ecosystem growth, where liquidity and capacity would allow. In addition, we will also consider strategies that can earn yield for the DAO without the need to sell ARB.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"infrastructure-security-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#infrastructure-security-6\"></a>Infrastructure &amp; Security</h1>\n<p>Of crucial importance for any treasury management operation is a trust minimised infrastructure setup where the security of the DAO’s assets is the first priority. Avantgarde has the flexibility to work with multiple treasury management infrastructure providers and we are open to community feedback and preferences to ensure the DAO has peace of mind regarding safety of treasury funds.</p>\n<p>Where there are no specific preferences from the community, Avantgarde have used Enzyme as the infrastructure of choice because its adaptable and time-tested architecture enables DAOs to effortlessly manage permissions, both granting and revoking them, while maintaining non-custodial control of the funds at all times.</p>\n<p>Roles and recommended configuration</p>\n<p>The setup involves three distinct and synergic roles if using Enzyme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vault owner (proposed: Arbitrum DAO or multisig address): The vault owner is the address that has full ownership of the vault settings, permissions, restrictions, etc. Vault owner retains exclusive authority over assets and any future changes if required.</li>\n<li>Depositor (proposed: Arbitrum DAO or multisig address): The depositor is the address that is whitelisted for depositing and withdrawing funds from the vault. When a deposit is made, the depositor’s wallet receives and holds vault shares (ERC-20 tokens).</li>\n<li>Delegated Asset Manager (proposed: Avantgarde Finance): The delegated manager is the address chosen by the vault owner to execute specific asset management strategies. Within the boundaries defined by the vault owner, the delegated manager can carry out predefined operations. This delegation framework combines trustlessness (as rules are enforced by code) with higher efficiency and speed (allowing transactions to be executed promptly). Examples of rules set by vault owners include permitted assets, allowed protocols and strategies, maximum slippage tolerance, and authorised trading venues. Importantly, the vault owner can revoke the delegated permission anytime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key considerations regarding Enzyme’s security</p>\n<p>Security is a paramount concern for Enzyme, and several key factors contribute to this commitment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Live on Mainnet for more than five years, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.</li>\n<li>Every integration undergoes a rigorous <a href=\"https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol/tree/v4/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audit</a> process conducted by Chain Security.</li>\n<li>A substantial <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bounty/enzymefinance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bug bounty</a> program on Immunefi.</li>\n<li>Opt-in <a href=\"https://docs.enzyme.finance/managers/signal-an-upgrade\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Protocol upgrades</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"performance-monitoring-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#performance-monitoring-7\"></a>Performance Monitoring</h1>\n<p>Performance measurement in treasury management is multi-faceted. We believe performance should be defined based on the specific financial objectives the program is looking to achieve. For Arbitrum DAO this is centered around:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Risk reduction - how has the risk profile of the portfolio evolved over the reporting period, across measures such as volatility, smart contract risk exposure, and tracking error of stablecoin positions.</li>\n<li>Revenue generation - what level of income has the portfolio been able to generate in both absolute terms and relative to yields across the market, in the context of the stated risk profile of the mandate.</li>\n<li>Portfolio composition - how has the diversification of the portfolio evolved over the reporting period, with reference to the long term diversification objectives of the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An important emphasis is that measurement of risk is as important as levels of return for the DAO to ensure that a manager is remaining consistent with their stated mandate.</p>\n<p>We recognise that the appropriate breadth &amp; cadence of reporting will evolve based on market conditions and events. Transparency is at the core of Avantgarde’s philosophy, and we will be committed to regular dialogue with relevant DAO community members to ensure the highest standards of accountability are maintained.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"fees-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#fees-8\"></a>Fees</h1>\n<p>0.75% on AUM (all-in fee) for a mandate &lt;$50m</p>\n<p>0.45% on AUM (all-in fee) for a mandate &gt;$50m</p>\n<h1><a name=\"contribution-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#contribution-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem-9\"></a>Contribution to the Arbitrum ecosystem</h1>\n<p>As part of our DAO advisory work, Avantgarde is proud to be working closely with Enzyme DAO to support them with their Arbitrum deployment and securing other biz-dev partners for launch. This effort should help increase TVL and transactions on the Arbitrum network and we’re excited to share more on this in coming weeks.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"appendix-manager-diversification-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#appendix-manager-diversification-10\"></a>Appendix - Manager Diversification</h1>\n<p>A key driver for this proposal is to improve long term sustainability through diversification. There are many aspects of diversification that can improve the robustness of the DAO’s treasury, not just at the asset level, but also at the treasury manager level and infrastructure level. As stated in the summary, although this is a proposal for Avantgarde to be considered as a treasury manager for the Arbitrum DAO, we are true believers in the benefits of diversification and we would urge the community to also consider allocations to multiple treasury managers for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Arbitrum ecosystem places great importance on decentralisation and we believe this core tenet should also be applied in the context of treasury management.</li>\n<li>Diversifying across multiple managers, with different approaches and infrastructure setups, will reduce risk and ensure decentralisation of DAO treasury management decisions going forward.</li>\n<li>It will also provide for more fluid expansion of ecosystem liquidity, with multiple allocators spreading capital over a more heterogeneous set of projects than would be the case with one single service provider.</li>\n<li>Manager diversification is established as best practice for institutional capital allocators and Arbitrum’s treasury should aspire to have robust processes put in place from the outset in order to facilitate future growth and development within the DAO.</li>\n<li>A multi-manager set up is in line with the proposed DAO Oversight Committee, who will have more data points to compare &amp; contrast, and more levers to pull in the event any one manager is underperforming in on their KPIs.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/diversification-and-strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25579\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/diversification-and-strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25579","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 13:25:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25579"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/diversification-and-strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25579.rss","#text":"Diversification and Strategic Treasury Management on Arbitrum"}},{"title":"Introducing the Polity GRADE Programme","dc:creator":"Markman","category":"DAO Programs & Initiatives","description":"<h4><a name=\"introducing-polity-grade-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introducing-polity-grade-1\"></a>Introducing Polity GRADE</h4>\n<p>Hello Arbitrum Community!</p>\n<p>We’re excited to introduce the Polity GRADE Programme, an innovative tool designed to enhance the grant evaluation process within the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem. Polity GRADE (Grant Review and Decision Enhancement) leverages Ethelo’s advanced multi-attribute decision-making engine to streamline and improve the efficiency of grant evaluations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"what-is-polity-grade-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-is-polity-grade-2\"></a>What is Polity GRADE?</h4>\n<p>Polity GRADE is a customized, white-labeled solution that enables real-time, multi-stakeholder evaluations of grants. It ensures that funding decisions align with Arbitrum DAO’s strategic priorities and optimizes the value of allocated resources.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"grade-wizard-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#grade-wizard-3\"></a>GRADE Wizard</h3>\n<p>The Polity GRADE Programme will provide a customizable multi-criteria grant evaluation template designed to simplify and enhance the grant application review process. This template is tailored to meet the unique needs of Arbitrum DAO grant managers, allowing for granting decisions based on comprehensive and transparent evaluation criteria that align with the organization’s strategic priorities.</p>\n<p>GRADE is built on Ethelo’s award-wining and patented multi-attribute decision-making engine, which enables advanced real-time criteria and scenario analysis, producing consensus outcomes based on millions of potential scenarios.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"features-of-the-grade-wizard-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#features-of-the-grade-wizard-4\"></a>Features of the GRADE Wizard:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customizable Criteria:</strong> Grant managers can define and adjust evaluation criteria to suit specific grant programs and strategic goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Weighted Scoring:</strong> Criteria can be weighted according to importance, ensuring that the most critical factors have a greater influence on the final decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Decision Launch:</strong> Once the template has been configured, grant managers can launch a granting decision to determine which applicants will receive funding, and even how much funding they will recieve, ensuring a streamlined and transparent allocation process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"grade-decision-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#grade-decision-5\"></a>GRADE Decision</h3>\n<p>The GRADE decision-making process is designed to be transparent, inclusive, and efficient, ensuring that the best grant applications are selected based on a comprehensive evaluation of predefined criteria. Decisions can involve closed project-team groups, or be opened to include wider participation of stakeholders across the Arbitrum community. Here’s how the decision-making process works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Evaluation Setup:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Criteria Definition:</strong> Grant managers set up the evaluation criteria in the GRADE Wizard, determining the specific factors that will be considered during the evaluation process.</li>\n<li><strong>Weighting Factors:</strong> Each criterion is assigned a weight based on its importance, ensuring that more critical factors have a greater influence on the final decision, or weights can be assigned by judges during the evaluation itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Application Upload</strong>: Grant applications are uploaded into the wizard, via a csv file.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Decision Creation</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autogenerated Decision:</strong> Once the wizard has been configured and applications uploaded, a Polity GRADE decision will be generated.</li>\n<li><strong>Invite Evaluators:</strong> Invite evaluators from your team or community with restricted access invitations to the decision, or share an open link for wider participation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Application Scoring:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Individual Evaluations:</strong> Each application is evaluated individually by grant managers, team members, and/or other stakeholders. Scores are assigned based on how well each application meets the predefined criteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Weighted Scoring:</strong> The scores for each criterion are weighted according to the predefined factors, providing a comprehensive and balanced evaluation of each application.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Aggregated Results:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> The platform aggregates the individual scores for each application, providing a clear overview of the overall performance of each applicant. Presenting results in real-time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scenario Analysis:</strong> If the decision involves constraints, such as the maximum number of grants awarded, total amount of funding available, etc., the Ethelo engine will evaluate all potential allocations to find the outcome with the broadest support in the group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consensus Results:</strong>** Consensus Results: Ethelo’s algorithm identifies decision outcomes that represent the strongest consensus among evaluators. The results, including which applicants are funded and the amount of funding, will maximize support and minimize polarization, ensuring a justifiable final outcome that all involved can accept.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"our-deliverables-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#our-deliverables-6\"></a>Our Deliverables</h4>\n<p><strong>1.

To address this, a pilot fund is proposed, utilizing Questbook’s small grants model to support early-stage initiatives focused on problem definition (root causes, gathering requirements), alignment, and scoping proposals for operational and governance improvements. A problem gathering exercise will be conducted to inform proposers and the assessor by identifying key problem areas through user research interviews, qualitative surveys of delegates and other stakeholders, and a collective intelligence algorithm, clustering initiatives to ensure alignment between proposals and the DAO’s current needs.<br>\nThe pilot fund will prioritize initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO’s operations and governance. An assessor, elected by the DAO, will oversee the proposal assessment, following the established Questbook program rules. The success of this pilot will be measured by the number of initiatives that receive subsequent funding, clarity and alignment generated within the community, and an over 80% approval rate in a Snapshot vote to continue the program.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem:</h1>\n<p>The DAO has multiple challenges but currently needs a way to fund the initial steps of addressing them. As a result, only groups with a lot to win will invest all the necessary time and effort and take the risk to evolve a proposal without being paid.</p>\n<p>Areas like organisation design, strategy, spending plan, and more require not just crafting a proposal but they require problem definition work: significant stakeholder engagement to determine the right approach, understand root causes and requirements, generate buy-in, and craft the right proposal to make. There’s currently no way to fund all this problem definition and preparatory work leading to the DAO advancing slowly, delegates being overwhelmed assessing proposals that don’t quite hit the mark, and meanwhile key decisions and needed proposals don’t happen.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>A method for the DAO to aggregate challenge statements or problems</li>\n<li>A funding program for initiatives that will carry out problem definition and initial solution work on one of the challenge statements.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Questbook has shown to be a viable mechanism for distributing small grants to groups. We propose to use this model and set up a pilot fund to evolve proposals that address key Operational and Governance needs to improve Arbiturm DAO.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’ll carry out a “collective intelligence exercise” to identify the key problem areas.<br>\nAnd we’re including an option in the Snapshot to also fund a Playbook for Proposing to the DAO, where we’ll gather the learnings of the grantees who successfully pass a proposal through the DAO and the challenges of those who didn’t, and document them as material for future grantees.</p>\n<p><strong>What will be funded via the Jumpstart Fund:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early-stage initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO ops and gov</li>\n<li>Priority for funding initiatives advancing problem definition and alignment around key challenges.</li>\n<li>Requirement for being referred by at least 3 of the top 30 delegates.</li>\n<li>Priority for proposals including a last milestone for a successful snapshot vote (i.e. success bonus of at least 10%).</li>\n<li>Initiatives expected to last up to 3 months.</li>\n<li>Initiatives can request up to USD$50k equivalent (subsequent submissions considered).</li>\n<li>product/protocol development will not be funded (that’s better suited for other Questbook tracks or programs).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>** How are proposals assessed:**</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An assessor will be selected by the DAO via an election as conducted for previous Questbook tracks.</li>\n<li>Proposals up to USD $25k can be approved directly by the assessor for this track. Proposals above this amount requires cross-checking with the assessors form other tracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fund governance:</strong></p>\n<p>This track will follow the same rules as the ongoing Questbook program (<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326\">link</a>), whereby funds are held in the multisig operated by the assessors of the multiple Questbook tracks.<br>\nThe totality of the funds are to be transferred there and the signers will provide payment for the service provision parts upon completion (e.g. problem assessment, playbook if completed, etc).</p>\n<p><strong>Method to Identify Problem Areas:</strong></p>\n<p>Before opening the fund to proposals, we’ll work with the DAO to identify key problem areas that could then lead to proposals for problem definition and alignment work. This work will be carried by RnDAO’s research team.</p>\n<p>Based on Professor Daniel Kahneman’s work, we have selected a collective intelligence method that provides high efficiency (low time involvement required from delegates) and is credibly neutral. The method is based on the use of a qualitative survey of delegates and other stakeholders to collect a list of statements proposing key challenges. We’ll complement this mechanism with user research interviews with the top 30 delegates.<br>\nThe statements are then analysed using a collective intelligence algorithm (SimScore) that identifies a theoretical ‘central’ statement that would be most agreed upon, and then analyses the provided statements to rank them for proximity to said theoretical centre.</p>\n<p>The ranked statements, as well as the graph (positioning of statements relative to each other), will then be made publicly available to inform (not mandate, just inform) those proposing initiatives to the pilot fund.</p>\n<p>(Further untangling between statements and root cause analysis is part of the work this Questbook track will fund.)</p>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-5\"></a>Timeline:</h1>\n<p>The Pilot is expected to last 4-6 months depending on whether the option to distil learnings into a playbook for proposing to the DAO is approved in Snapshot or not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Month 1 for identifying problem areas.</li>\n<li>Month 2-4 for assessing and funding proposals.</li>\n<li>Month 5 for reporting</li>\n<li>month 6 for (optional) collecting learnings about proposal development into playbook</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-success-look-like-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-does-success-look-like-6\"></a>What does success look like?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Experts in the community can work towards improving Arbiturm DAO.</li>\n<li>The initiatives funded generate clarity, buy-in, and alignment,</li>\n<li>The initiatives funded evolve towards full proposals for the DAO and are funded.</li>\n<li>The delegates love this pilot and want to continue funding it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>KPIs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>40%+ of initiatives continued and received subsequent funding</li>\n<li>Over 80% approval in a Snapshot vote asking delegates whether the program should be continued after the pilot</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"budget-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#budget-7\"></a>Budget</h1>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xaIktXwaW8iFxhVuWy0DNLDPxdC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-07-14 at 08.50.38\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_690x325.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-14 at 08.50.38\" data-base62-sha1=\"xaIktXwaW8iFxhVuWy0DNLDPxdC\" width=\"690\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_690x325.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_1035x487.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_1380x650.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E2E4E8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Note on forum restrictions:<br>\nThis proposal was originally posted 9 days ago (at the start of GovHack), then moved to the GovHack category when the submission guidelines for that were announced.

This course is designed to thoroughly educate potential ambassadors about their roles, responsibilities, and the significant impact they can have within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Through a combination of comprehensive workshops and detailed guides, participants will gain a deep understanding of Arbitrum’s technical features and governance mechanisms. The workshops will cover essential topics such as developing smart contracts, designing DApps with Ethers.js, and integrating WalletConnect, ensuring that participants are well-equipped with practical skills and theoretical knowledge.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the course will include a badge system to incentivize participation and recognize achievements. Participants who complete all three workshops will earn digital badges, such as POAPs or NFTs, serving as credentials that showcase their acquired knowledge and skills. All workshops and guides will be available as evergreen content, providing the entire community with lasting educational resources. This initiative would not only enhance technical proficiency but also would prepare participants for meaningful contributions to the Arbitrum community, thereby fostering a robust and informed pool of ambassadors.</p>\n<p><em>You can check the full proposal <a href=\"https://questbook.app/dashboard/?role=builder&amp;proposalId=6670d0cf64b75d39d0913706&amp;chainId=10&amp;grantId=662f32a15488d5000f0562b3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-stage-three-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#next-stage-three-11\"></a>Next Stage? <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/three.png?v=12\" title=\":three:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":three:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h3>\n<p>A web3 project focused on brand growth, user acquisition, and project engagement requires continuous and fluid effort over time.

Then, a new proposal will be presented to the DAO and its community to achieve greater impact and fully exploit the project’s potential over a more extended period of time.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-latam-report-june-2024/25521\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-latam-report-june-2024/25521","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 15:17:20 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25521"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-latam-report-june-2024/25521.rss","#text":"Arbitrum LATAM Report — June 2024"}},{"title":"STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings","dc:creator":"chaoslabs","category":"Risk Member","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/79a494b807165e0475b5f479bad74d8c71ba17d2.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hm6nZqkWhaY5joKxTJNyCiEuQpA.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"ARDC STIP Risk Analysis - Insights &amp; Key Findings\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79a494b807165e0475b5f479bad74d8c71ba17d2_2_690x345.jpeg\" alt=\"ARDC STIP Risk Analysis - Insights &amp; Key Findings\" data-base62-sha1=\"hm6nZqkWhaY5joKxTJNyCiEuQpA\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79a494b807165e0475b5f479bad74d8c71ba17d2_2_690x345.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79a494b807165e0475b5f479bad74d8c71ba17d2_2_1035x517.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79a494b807165e0475b5f479bad74d8c71ba17d2_2_1380x690.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"0E141C\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Over the past 10 weeks, <a href=\"https://chaoslabs.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chaos Labs</a> has performed a deep analysis of three protocols’ <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131\">STIP programs</a> from a risk and efficiency point of view. This post focuses on aggregating the learnings from these case studies into a consolidated review to help delegates and protocols improve their decision-making in the future.</p>\n<p>The post starts with a risk analysis of the program on these protocols. It then examines the efficiency of incentive spending, offering actionable insights from case studies to form recommended best practices. This leads to a discussion of incentive elements that should ideally be included in future programs.</p>\n<p>The original analyses can be found here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-1-vertex/23848\">Vertex Protocol</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-2-silo-finance/24752\">Silo Finance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-3-pendle-finance/25254\">Pendle Finance</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"risk-footprint-of-the-stip-program-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#risk-footprint-of-the-stip-program-2\"></a>Risk Footprint of the STIP program</h1>\n<p>Overall, there is little evidence that the STIP program contributed to an increase in adverse outcomes manifesting due to the risks introduced. The potential risks identified, such as protocol bad debt, cascading liquidations, overleveraged activity causing price wicks, etc., did not occur during the program.</p>\n<p>However, the absence of adverse outcomes does not mean that the program did not alter the risk profile of the Arbitrum ecosystem.  Risk management must acknowledge that there is always a distribution of potential outcomes, and we need to contain the worst possible outcomes to maintain long-term stability.</p>\n<p>We believe that the starting point of the program coming in a bear market with little appetite for leverage or experimentation by users allowed for the dramatic but safe growth on <a href=\"https://vertexprotocol.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vertex Protocol</a>, <a href=\"https://www.silo.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Silo Finance</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pendle.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pendle Finance</a> as these protocols went from being under-utilized to a reasonable level of utilization.  This does not mean that similar risk outcomes would likely be observed should this growth start from a higher level.</p>\n<p>Chaos Labs recommends that the Arbitrum DAO stay vigilant, particularly where exposures are leveraged and composed of multiple protocol dependencies. To help ensure that risk management remains part of decision-making at all times, it is recommended to add a risk section to future incentive program application forms. This section should ask protocols to explicitly declare potential risks, cross-ecosystem dependencies and integrations, and a plan for mitigating these over the program.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"productive-incentive-attributes-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#productive-incentive-attributes-3\"></a>Productive Incentive Attributes</h1>\n<p>All three of the case studies examined grew their activity by multiple orders of magnitude, compared with an average TVL growth of 9.2% by STIP recipients. This presents us with many clear, actionable incentive strategies and tactics from the program for the Arbitrum DAO to learn from.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Experiment and Iterate:</strong> Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way.  This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2.  The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning.  There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:</strong> Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:</strong> This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Incentivizing Mercenary Behavior:</strong> Wash trading, sybils, and other inorganic activity is solely the result of incentives rewarding such activity and these strategies will be unwound as soon as the incentives end. There is no long-term benefit to incentives spent on these strategies as they are not retained after the program ends. Legitimate strategies earn fewer rewards as a result, and the program impact is diluted.  There was limited evidence of this in the case studies as activity was mainly subject to a small positive fee.<br>\n<strong>Use Incentives to Increase Integrations and Composability:</strong> Incentivizing the end use case was a powerful growth driver for growing the ecosystem of a protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:</strong> Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium.  This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal.  This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain Momentum with Native Incentives:</strong> If feasible, it is advisable to maintain momentum in the most impactful areas through protocol incentives once the incentive program ends. This strategy can better retain activity and position the application more favorably than others in its sector.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"potential-improvements-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#potential-improvements-4\"></a>Potential Improvements</h1>\n<p>Despite the positive STIP outcomes of the protocols analyzed, certain potential improvements were identified that could have made their use of incentives yield even greater results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Onboarding New Users Has the Greatest Positive Impact:</strong> This is easier said than done, given the general microstructure of DeFi.  It would be highly beneficial for applications running on Arbitrum and the Arbitrum ecosystem broadly for incentives to experiment with onboarding new users without getting exploited by sybils.</li>\n<li><strong>Aspire to Broaden the Incentive Distribution:</strong> Expanding on the previous point highlights that the wider the incentive effect, the more diverse and extensive the onboarded activity will be, leading to a healthier application marketplace. Exactly what determines the optimal distribution is application-specific, with different types of apps naturally growing different activity concentration microstructures.</li>\n<li><strong>Align Incentives with Ecosystem Goals:</strong> It does not make sense to grow elements of the Arbitrum ecosystem that are being deprecated over the long term. Bridged USDC.e growth is one element identified that grew as a result of these incentives and is being wound down, making it not an optimal area to target with incentives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The three case studies performed on Vertex Protocol, Silo Finance, and Pendle Finance provided many vital takeaways for Arbitrum DAO members and protocols to consider in future incentive programs.  This analysis covered the impact of the STIP program from a risk and efficiency standpoint.</p>\n<p>Although little consequence was observed due to risks manifesting, this can be attributed to market conditions at the program outset, and future iterations will likely play out differently.  We recommend close scrutiny of the potential for incentives to drive users too far along the risk curve, to the point where the ecosystem destabilizes.  Protocols should be asked to include a plan to contain the impacts of incentive-induced excessive risk-taking in their application forms going forward.</p>\n<p>Several consistent behaviors led to the success of these protocols’ incentive programs. The consistency of these behaviors, along with their overlap with traditional digital marketing strategies, gives us confidence in recommending their implementation in future incentive programs.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a brief list of incentive attributes that were not included but could have further enhanced the impact of these programs is provided. These elements are not straightforward or as evident as the positive aspects and should be considered as areas for future experimentation and improvement.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 12:36:11 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25515"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515.rss","#text":"STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings"}}]}}}
