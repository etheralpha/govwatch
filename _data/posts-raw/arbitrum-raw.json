I’ve been particularly interested in how DAOs would play their role since a project I did in the space in 2015.</p>\n<p>A big part of the story began between 2006 and 2012, when with different groups of friends we set up the first hacker house, tech conference, university tech entrepreneurship club, and then accelerator in Bulgaria. This naturally connected me with many people in the Bulgarian diaspora, who were returning as the country joined the EU in 2007.</p>\n<p>The was one standout group of Harvard alumni I worked with on economic cluster development, where one of them became a government minister who essentially kickstarted the Bulgarian venture capital scene. With just €200 million of EU funds, we sparked an entire economy.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, as he became the chief economic advisor to the president, I got asked to make a list of people I know around the world that would be helpful for advancing the above agenda. We had the president personally invite them, often calling them himself. We organized a number of small private gatherings at the presidential villa, where key relationships and deals were forged. You can now track many of the success stories and unicorns that came out of that scene in one way or another to conversations that happened there. Many of these people now also shape the European venture capital scene out of Brussels and Luxembourg.</p>\n<p>From what I’ve learned since the last GovHack, I believe one of the most important things for the Arbitrum community is to figure out how to support builders sustainably and long-term, while reducing the financial burden of grant-based programs.</p>\n<p>Recent developments in that conversation have striking similarities to the stories above.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p>While we may not have a presidential villa at GovHack, we do have a venture track, which <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/klausbrave\">@KlausBrave</a> kindly invited me to help lead.</p>\n<p>I can’t help but feel that years from now we might end up looking at this event in a similar way as I do to the gatherings from the above story.</p>\n<p>There’s a great group of tremendously capable and experienced people attending and it would be fantastic to come together, set things in motion, define problem statements, consolidate forces and ideas, and move forward in the most mature way possible.</p>\n<p>Which is precisely why I’m so sad that because of a nasty food poisoning I just had to cancel my trip to Brussels. However <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ana.vc\">@ana.vc</a> will be there and I’m sure she’ll do an even better job in my place.</p>\n<p>Ana-Mariya has been a VC for almost a decade and focused on Web3 exclusively over the last 8 years. She has over 200 deals under her belt and led on over 50 as head of the investment team of Outlier Ventures. She’s been leading <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-proposal-non-constitutional-establishment-of-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-avi/23222\">AVI</a> alongside me since we started at GovHack in Denver a few months ago. I can’t think of a better way to more broadly introduce her to the community.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to reach out and let us know if you have any objectives that Ana or I can help you achieve in Brussels in regards to Arbitrum Venture funds.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/making-an-awesome-ventures-track-at-govhack/25287\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/making-an-awesome-ventures-track-at-govhack/25287","pubDate":"Thu, 04 Jul 2024 09:06:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25287"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/making-an-awesome-ventures-track-at-govhack/25287.rss","#text":"Making an Awesome Ventures Track at GovHack"}},{"title":"Timeswap STIP.B Bi-Weekly Update","dc:creator":"ameeth","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"timeswap-stipb-bi-weekly-report-1-july-3rd-2024-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeswap-stipb-bi-weekly-report-1-july-3rd-2024-1\"></a>Timeswap STIP.B Bi-Weekly Report <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> July 3rd 2024</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-2\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p><strong>ARB Received Last Disbursement:</strong> 33,334 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks:</strong> No distribution yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</strong> No distribution yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract address label <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2AYnjAaQjVOLtvemZpsWoN5sTJEJ8dLqdRDExTBQv_SUeug/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Form 48</a> completed for all addresses:</strong> No. No distribution yet.</p>\n<p><strong>ARB left over:</strong> 200,000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for leftover ARB:</strong> Continue as per original proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives:</strong></p>\n<p>Timeswap has been allocated a total of 200,000 ARB, all to be redistributed to users through interacting with the incentivised pools.

As a result, many community members choose to transfer their token-weighted voting power to representatives (i.e. delegates) whose values align with their own and who are better positioned to make informed decisions for the DAO. By doing so, token holders can ensure their interests are represented without needing to actively track and vote on every proposal.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, delegation allows token holders to passively engage in the governance of the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>It is important to note that:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you delegate, you still retain full ownership of the tokens, but your selected delegate will wield the voting power associated with those tokens</li>\n<li>Even if you have already delegated your voting power, it is worth checking whether or not your delegate is still active. You can do so by finding your delegate’s profile <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates\">here</a>, to check whether they have voted in recent proposals and see their <a href=\"https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/\">delegate score and contributor metrics</a> (if they have opted in for this to be shown via Karma)</li>\n<li>Through Tally, you can change or revoke your delegation at any time. You can also proportionally delegate your voting power to multiple delegates</li>\n<li>When selecting a delegate, consider the following:\n<ul>\n<li>The delegate’s values, as outlined in the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\">Constitution</a> and their position on proposals</li>\n<li>The delegate’s track record, if they have one (e.g. check <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates\">whether they have voted in recent proposals</a> and see their <a href=\"https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/\">delegate score and contributor metrics</a>)</li>\n<li>The delegate’s level of engagement within the community and their willingness to listen and respond to feedback</li>\n<li>The delegate’s level of technical expertise and their experience in the space</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visit<a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates\"> Tally</a> to examine delegate profiles, and if you identify a delegate whose values align with yours, you can seamlessly delegate your token’s voting power through the<a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates\"> Tally interface</a>.</p>\n<p>Find out more about how to delegate your voting power, here → <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/how-tos/select-delegate-voting-power\">How to Delegate your Voting Power</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Token holders:</strong> Members of the Arbitrum community who hold the $ARB token.</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate:</strong> A party that can vote on Arbitrum <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-glossary#governance-proposal\">Governance proposals</a>.

There are <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum\">~436K delegates</a> who have enabled the DAO to vote on <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/improving-predictability-in-arbitrum-dao-s-operations/25136#motivation-4\">over 280 Snapshot and 30 Tally proposals</a>. However, to further decentralization and diversity, ArbitrumDAO needs to increase its number of active delegates.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today, plenty of new contributors have become paramount in driving the DAO forward. However, many of these recent contributors have little-to-no delegation power and therefore, cannot significantly partake in decision-making. This is because most delegators delegated their voting power soon after the DAO’s inception, and may not have reassessed their delegations since. Additionally, the Arbitrum community has grown over the past year, meaning that many $ARB token holders have a significant amount of voting power that could, potentially, be delegated to active delegates.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, (Re)delegation Week aims to enable these newer and active contributors to step up, make themselves heard, and potentially get more voting power to become more involved in governance.</p>\n<p>The figures below reiterate the importance of (Re)delegation Week.

This is the third and final case study of a three-part series that entails an in-depth analysis of the risk and efficiency of the Arbitrum STIP on three major protocols, the third of which is Pendle Finance.</p>\n<p>As requested by the DAO advocate for the ARDC, L2BEAT, Chaos Labs has been conducting case studies on STIP recipients. This case study provides an in-depth analysis of the Arbitrum STIP program’s impact on Pendle Finance, focusing on its efficiency and associated risks. This analysis is part of a broader series that evaluates the STIP program across three major protocols.</p>\n<p>Following our previous analyses of Vertex and Silo Finance, we now turn our focus to Pendle Finance to provide a comprehensive evaluation of its performance and risk profile.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-3\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>An in-depth, bottom-up analysis of the protocol is essential to comprehensively understand the specific risks and efficiency factors influencing the Pendle STIP allocation. The initial section of this report delves into all pertinent aspects of Pendle Finance’s functionality, providing context and reference.</p>\n<p>Following this, detailed analyses of efficiency and risk are conducted, using the insights gained from the protocol deep-dive as a foundation. This analysis aims to identify all factors that could potentially result in adverse outcomes. These findings are then used to derive positive and negative insights from the Pendle STIP incentive program, which will inform the design of future incentive schemes.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive Amount:</strong> 2m ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive Uses:</strong> Liquidity incentives (55%), trading incentives (40%), Ecosystem integrations (5%)</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Matching:</strong> Yes</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pendle-overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-overview-4\"></a>Pendle Overview</h1>\n<p>Pendle is a permissionless yield-trading protocol where users can execute various yield-management strategies. This is achieved by first wrapping yield-bearing tokens into Standardised Yield (SY) tokens. SY tokens are compatible with the Pendle AMM and can be split into its principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token), respectively. This process is called yield tokenisation and allows both PT and YT to be traded on Pendle’s AMM.</p>\n<p>By creating a yield market in DeFi, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield, enabling users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed yield (e.g. earn fixed yield on stETH)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long yield (e.g. bet on stETH yield going up by purchasing more yield)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Earn more yield without additional risks (e.g. provide liquidity with your stETH)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A mix of the above strategies</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each PT and YT has a maturity date. For PT, you can redeem the full underlying yield-bearing token after this date. For YT, the yield of the yield-bearing token is only accrued up until the maturity date, after which YT has no value.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-liquidity-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-liquidity-5\"></a>Pendle Liquidity</h2>\n<p>Pendle liquidity comes from holders of yield-bearing tokens wrapping and depositing them into AMM pools. These liquidity providers then earn swap fees, PENDLE rewards, and any other incentives on top of the tokens’ native yield. The fixed maturity nature of these pools also means that if LPs keep providing liquidity until maturity, there will be no impermanent loss, and they will receive their initial tokens back along with the additional yield.</p>\n<p>During the STIP, Pendle launched an Order Book system alongside its AMM to enable peer-to-peer trading of PT and YT. This allows users to place limit orders to buy or sell at a specified implied APY.</p>\n<p>Together, the Order Book and AMM enhance market liquidity, facilitating smoother trading on Pendle.</p>\n<p>The total liquidity in a pool impacts slippage and is therefore crucial for user experience and seamlessly offering the use cases users desire.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-trading-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-trading-6\"></a>Pendle Trading</h2>\n<p>Liquidity pools in Pendle V2 are set up as PT/SY, e.g. PT-aUSDC / SY-aUSDC. Swapping PT is a straightforward process of swapping between the two assets in the pool, while swapping YT is enabled via flash swaps in the same pool.</p>\n<p>Flash swaps are possible due to the relationship between PT and YT. As PT and YT can be minted from and redeemed to its underlying SY, we can express the price relationship:</p>\n<p>P(PT) + P(YT) = P(Underlying)​</p>\n<p>Knowing that YT price has an inverted correlation against PT price, we use this price relationship to utilise the PT/SY pool for YT swaps.</p>\n<p>Traders on Pendle obtain SY tokens by depositing yield-bearing tokens, and swap them to gain exposure to the token of their choice. As yields change they then have the option to trade further to alter their exposures.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-yield-token-integrations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-yield-token-integrations-7\"></a>Pendle Yield Token Integrations</h2>\n<p>A key feature of Pendle’s principal and yield tokens is their ability to support strategies that create specific exposures for users, enabled by ecosystem integrations with other protocols. Pendle offered incentives for depositing PT or LP positions into specific pools on other protocols to foster the broader ecosystem, liquidity, and trading activity. This initiative began in Week 5 of the program and was adjusted based on general market sentiment.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"use-of-incentives-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#use-of-incentives-8\"></a>Use of Incentives</h1>\n<p>The objectives for the STIP, as stated by Pendle, were:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Increasing yield trading volume, inciting activity on the platform, deepening liquidity on existing pools as well as an additional incentive for users to bootstrap liquidity for newly listed Pendle markets Arbitrum, and finally to encourage activity on protocols built on top of Pendle.</strong></em></p>\n<p>This was implemented by allocating 55% of incentives towards liquidity providers on Pendle, 40% towards trading incentives, and 5% to ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidity-incentives-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquidity-incentives-9\"></a>Liquidity Incentives:</h2>\n<p>Slightly over half of the total incentives were allocated to boosting additional yield for LPs, aiming to encourage deeper liquidity and reduce slippage on Pendle.</p>\n<p>Initially, Pendle distributed liquidity incentives based on vePENDLE votes for Arbitrum pools. However, this approach soon proved suboptimal as the incentives were neither distributed broadly nor targeted at the most active markets or new markets needing support. Starting from week 3, the Pendle team took over the allocations, using metrics such as the most active yield markets and new pools requiring initial liquidity. Additionally, there was significant experimentation and iteration in the weekly allocations.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows the evolution of weekly incentives by category. Over the course of the STIP, incentives were redirected from LST and derivative LP markets to lending, LRT, and Silo Pendle LP markets in response to market interest.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/clqSs4QQ4Dd0xdDuTrwCBxI4npy.png?dl=1\" title=\"The Evolution of Pendle Weekly Incentives by Category\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_690x439.png\" alt=\"The Evolution of Pendle Weekly Incentives by Category\" data-base62-sha1=\"clqSs4QQ4Dd0xdDuTrwCBxI4npy\" width=\"690\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_690x439.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_1035x658.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_1380x878.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"222729\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"trading-incentives-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trading-incentives-10\"></a><strong>Trading Incentives</strong>:</h2>\n<p>Trading incentives were designed as campaigns targeted at increasing trading activity on Pendle. The initial STIP application suggested that there would be “at least one campaign per month will be done to keep things fresh and to entice users to keep trying out the campaigns.” Over the course of the STIP, the following campaigns were conducted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Swap fee rebates:</strong> This campaign refunded a portion of traders’ swap fees with ARB tokens. The rebate was set below 100% to ensure wash trading remained unprofitable, starting at 75% and reducing to 50% in week 9. This campaign ran for the entire duration of the STIP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trading leaderboard with prizes for the most successful traders:</strong> An in-app leaderboard showcased the top-ranked users based on percentage gain. These top performers received ARB rewards to stimulate more trading volume and TVL. Performance-based prizes also incentivized traders to improve their strategies, aiding in long-term retention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Supercharged swap fee rebates:</strong> For a limited time, certain pools had their swap fee rebates increased to 120% to further incentivize trading activity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Maker incentives to promote the new limit order book feature:</strong> Rewards were provided for using Pendle’s newly launched limit order feature. Filled limit orders earned ARB rewards proportional to the order size, drawing attention to this innovation. Pendle’s limit orders were initially launched on Arbitrum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"ecosystem-incentives-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ecosystem-incentives-11\"></a>Ecosystem Incentives:</h2>\n<p>Ecosystem incentives were designed to integrate Pendle tokens further into the broader DeFi ecosystem by encouraging their use on partner protocols. Large lending pools that accepted Pendle LP or PT tokens as collateral received ARB incentives to boost their usage. The incentivized protocols included Stella, Dolomite, Timeswap, Silo, and Teller.</p>\n<p>Similar to the liquidity incentives, the focus of these incentives evolved throughout the STIP. Notably, in February 2024, the incentives shifted to emphasize leveraged strategies using LRT PT tokens, aligning with the development of these markets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pendle-incentives-impact-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-incentives-impact-12\"></a>Pendle Incentives Impact</h1>\n<p>The objective of this impact assessment is to evaluate the effects of the incentive program on protocol activity, specifically examining the demand for holding Pendle PT and YT tokens, trading activity and liquidity provision on Pendle’s AMM. This detailed, bottom-up analysis scrutinizes individual components of the STIP, which are unique to Pendle. This allows a clear prescription of how the results of the program were obtained and how this could be applied to other protocols. The unique nature of the Pendle protocol makes direct comparison impossible, but important incentive principles can be gleaned from their program strategy.</p>\n<p>Despite the STIP program’s short-term nature, this report assesses its prolonged benefits by analyzing protocol usage data following the program’s conclusion. The intention is to identify persistent activity changes and what drove them.</p>\n<p>Pendle accepts deposits of yield-bearing assets, wraps these into standardized yield (SY) tokens, and splits these into Principal (PT) and yield (YT) tokens. These PT and YT tokens are then bought and sold on the Pendle AMM, with Arbitrum end users primarily leveraging their PT positions or holding YT for yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the impact analysis will focus on the effects of the incentives on the growth of the supply of yield-bearing assets available for trading (the supply side), the growth in the trading of Pendle yield tokens (trading activity), and the growth of ecosystem TVL.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of Pendle’s incentives is thoroughly examined across various dimensions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How did the incentives affect the supply of yield-bearing assets by LPs?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did the incentives affect trading activity on the Pendle AMM?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Did they attract new users?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect retention?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect the average volume per user?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect the ecosystem growth of Pendle tokens?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of the incentives is also analyzed to gain insight into the structural efficiency of this program.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidity-provider-reactions-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquidity-provider-reactions-13\"></a>Liquidity Provider Reactions</h2>\n<p>Liquidity from AMM LPs on Pendle grew from $52 million to $723 million over the STIP period. Most of this growth occurred between February and March 2024, driven by points programs on Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) that were ideally suited to Pendle’s products. The increase in LRT TVL during this period was clearly due to the demand for Pendle’s offerings, although this growth on Arbitrum was positively affected by the STIP use.</p>\n<p>Pendle’s focus on Arbitrum during this time, enhanced by STIP incentives, brought significant LRT TVL to Arbitrum and added considerable value to the chain. Without these incentives, LRT strategies on Pendle Arbitrum would have been less attractive, and the supply may not have grown as it did. It is also important to highlight how the attention flywheel established Arbitrum as a prominent hub for leveraged LRT strategies, with the incentives having a highly asymmetric effect on its success.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xv2DDOkfOfXXLlEyXl8txLNT5Bv.png?dl=1\" title=\"Total Pendle LP Supply\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_690x429.png\" alt=\"Total Pendle LP Supply\" data-base62-sha1=\"xv2DDOkfOfXXLlEyXl8txLNT5Bv\" width=\"690\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_690x429.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_1035x643.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_1380x858.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"192632\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The aggressive growth observed after the launch of LRTs overshadows the performance during the first three months of the STIP.

Pendle allocated significant incentives to the most exciting new pools, enabling them to scale rapidly. Similarly, new ecosystem pools received early incentive support. The introduction of limit orders also garnered more attention due to maker order incentives throughout the entire second half of the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Keeping the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple</strong></p>\n<p>The incentive criteria on Pendle were extremely clear, even though they iterated throughout the program. Liquidity providers in incentivized pools received incremental yield in the form of ARB tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Growing The Protocol Through Incentivized Integrations</strong></p>\n<p>This was an important focus area for Pendle, unlocking incremental utility for its yield tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Iterating and Experimenting</strong></p>\n<p>Pendle aggressively experimented and culled underperforming strategies on a fortnightly basis using market data.</p>\n<p>Some positive examples included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The focused but aggressive iteration in liquidity pools incentivized. Pendle targeted incentives aimed at increasing activity where the market was at almost every week. This enabled hypergrowth in LRT markets in February, almost since launch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Iteration in ecosystem incentives, resulting in the highly productive growth in Silo pools, offering leverage and growing YT token utility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experiments in trading campaigns.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-incentive-potential-improvements-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-incentive-potential-improvements-26\"></a>Pendle Incentive Potential Improvements</h2>\n<p><strong>Grow the Rate of New User Acquisition As Well As TVL and Activity</strong></p>\n<p>For most of the STIP Pendle active users, there was little change from the prior period.

During this period, we will deliver strategic proposals, guide key partners through the DAO processes, and align the priorities of essential stakeholders for the betterment of Arbitrum. We will also expand our efforts to include a small set of additional verticals by hiring skilled contributors in areas where the DAO needs support, such as data analytics, technical proposal creation, marketing, or any other needs that may arise.</p>\n<p>With a budget of $2.791M for the year paid in monthly installments and stored with the Foundation for DAO-clawback capabilities, along with an optional up to 1.5 million ARB for performance-based bonuses voted on by the DAO near the end of the term and put in a 3-year vesting contact to ensure long-term alignment, we will continue to build a dedicated team focused solely on enhancing the Arbitrum DAO’s success. The primary goal of our work is to help Arbitrum DAO continue its path toward efficient and effective operations and execute its long-term vision of becoming a sustainable entity with diversified revenue streams. We believe that over the coming years, Arbitrum DAO has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year while maintaining its status as the leading Ethereum scaling solution with an ever-growing base of users and developers. All of Entropy Advisors’ employees will work full-time towards achieving this goal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-and-rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-and-rationale-4\"></a>Motivation and Rationale</h1>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO is set up to prosper with its cutting-edge technology stack that will soon support numerous coding languages, a vibrant community of users and developers, abundant resources in the DAO treasury, and the ecosystem’s commitment to scaling the most decentralized and secure L2 on Ethereum. Despite our belief that Arbitrum holds a strong position in the market today, there is a lot of work to be done over the next 3-5 years to ensure Arbitrum maintains and advances its position. We have diagnosed some key areas in need of improvement that we feel well suited to take on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Designing, drafting and executing proposals that benefit Arbitrum.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Strengthening overall governance processes and providing feedback to other DAO contributors, unlocking efficiencies and ensuring redundant work is avoided.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Acting as a mesh layer between key stakeholders, e.g., active delegates, development teams such as Offchain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Helping potential 3rd party strategic partners navigate the DAO to attract high-quality companies and individuals within the ecosystem and RFP applicant pools.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Attracting/retaining top talent working full-time, professionally on behalf of Arbitrum DAO.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Improving the ability of the DAO to spend money effectively and support a long term sustainable future for Arbitrum.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Today the Arbitrum DAO faces friction executing across all of the aforementioned tasks. Many times those creating proposals have known or unknown ulterior motives and incentives at play. It is difficult for aspiring contributors and partners to navigate the DAO. No one is incentivized to bolster RFP applicant pools. Communication is fragmented with no entity in place to tie perspectives together, and operations/goals often overlap across initiatives. There are numerous proposals that are consensus to move forward but do not progress because there is no financial incentive to do so. There is inadequate accountability over and transparency into DAO funded programs. The problems are ever-evolving and growing, and the Arbitrum DAO needs an entity that only has the DAO’s best interests in mind to fill the gaps.</p>\n<p>Our team (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/swmartin19\">@swmartin19</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/mattonchain\">@mattonchain</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/pruitt\">@pruitt</a>) brings an extensive network as well as experience in research, governance, brand building, and project management to the Arbitrum DAO, having led well-known brands in the space such as Blockworks Research and 404 DAO. We have all been involved in the DAO since the beginning, starting with Blockworks Research’s entry into the DAO by <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-1-arbitrum-improvement-proposal-framework/30/91\">highlighting flaws</a> in the DAO’s very first proposal, AIP-1. We are not afraid to push against the status quo if we believe it helps Arbitrum achieve its goals.</p>\n<p>Entropy Advisors was extremely fortunate to receive a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation. As such, we have been able to use the past few months contributing full-time to Arbitrum DAO to further showcase our value in the community. We have hosted bi-weekly 1-on-1 calls with a cohort of large delegates, with the foundation, and with OCL, and feel that we have a strong hold on various stakeholder’s interests, strategic goals for Arbitrum, working initiatives, etc. When paired with our experience and networks within the industry, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help Arbitrum achieve its long-term goals with all stakeholder perspectives in mind. With exclusivity meaning no official or unofficial engagements with any other client, Entropy Advisors can serve Arbitrum DAO with no ulterior motives or conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Today, virtually no money is spent on operations, while the DAO has spent almost 435M ARB in total with ~95% going towards investments, incentives, and grants (Source: Delphi &amp; R3gen). We believe it is absolutely imperative for the DAO to make an investment in operations, simultaneously ensuring different initiatives across the ecosystem can be set in motion swiftly, fit together seamlessly, and can reach the best talent, while the DAO’s expenditures can be managed in a way that enables long-term sustainability. It is evident that this is becoming a wider-reaching theme within the DAO, but requires a heavy lift (see <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737\">OpCo</a> proposal from <span class=\"mention\">@dkpremia</span> that asks for 25M ARB). We are NOT looking to replace OpCo, but rather drastically reduce the scope and funding request by helping formulate operational procedures until the OpCo is formally stood up. At that point, the DAO can decide what role Entropy Advisors plays as a service provider to the OpCo.</p>\n<p>With the budget as outlined, Entropy will be able to hire up to 10 employees with a diverse range of skill sets including governance, data analytics, marketing, and development/engineering. We will be able to hire top talent in our industry who will dedicate their full-time bandwidth to Arbitrum DAO. Regardless of Arbitrum’s current strategic priorities, whether cutting costs or scaling strategies, our team will work to execute the goals of the DAO. Given Arbitrum’s dominance, size, and number of initiatives it is important that we build a well-rounded team at Entropy that can operate as the tip of the spear as a catalyst for change across the many sectors that the DAO operates.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"entropys-portfolio-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#entropys-portfolio-5\"></a>Entropy’s Portfolio</h1>\n<p>At the beginning of May, we <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-print-hello-world/23675/9\">introduced</a> Entropy Advisors to the Arbitrum DAO. We are a governance operations-focused business, working exclusively with Arbitrum. Our initial efforts have already driven several notable initiatives, demonstrating our capability and commitment to enhancing the Arbitrum DAO:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7QFttdqmjBRf3ZP5jNlvRjMxqo6.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96_2_269x478.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"7QFttdqmjBRf3ZP5jNlvRjMxqo6\" width=\"269\" height=\"478\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96_2_269x478.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96_2_403x717.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96_2_538x956.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B1B4BA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worked with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/r3gen_finance\">@r3gen_Finance</a> to create a <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3d5ffb8e23b5f22f495f6460ef5ee8771efe5da5565dfa011917a78a2ec25916\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposal</a> that reduces DAO OpEx on multi-sig signers, by establishing the Multisig Support Service.\n<ul>\n<li>We leveraged our network to ensure a competitive applicant pool, which ultimately resulted in one of the most <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss-nomination-thread/24773\">competent applicant rosters</a> (40 in total) in the DAO’s history despite just a $1,500-$2,500 monthly wage per signer.</li>\n<li>The proposal is expected to save the DAO almost $400,000 per year.</li>\n<li>Entropy managed the application process, and will soon host a call with the winning applicants to go over multi-sig best practices.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Conducted <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-gas-fees-sequencer-revenue/24730\">research</a> into Arbitrum DAO’s sequencer margin / transaction fee mechanism, kicking off a conversation that aims to increase the DAO’s treasury value rather than deplete it of resources.\n<ul>\n<li>Attended/helped drive forward discussions related to DAO <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/call-to-discuss-the-creation-of-a-dao-budget/24802\">budgeting</a> and sequencer <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/call-to-discuss-arbitrums-fees-and-sequencer-revenue/24824\">revenue</a> through working group calls.</li>\n<li>Followed up with a formal <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adjusting-arbitrum-s-gas-fees/25002\">proposal</a> to increase the L2 minimum base fee on Arbitrum One, with plans to establish a more long-term solution that includes service providers.</li>\n<li><strong>This proposal, if passed, could bring the DAO an extra $5-15M per year of profit.</strong></li>\n<li>We also <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-support-creation-of-an-arbitrum-dao-budget/23802\">tapped</a> on the ARDC to conduct research into these areas, thereby utilizing existing resources at the DAO’s disposal rather than wasting additional resources.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22498645709460639498013508413205734891453964526622655693207250687057651118730\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Moved quickly</a> to get Hack Humanity, the entity behind GovHack, ample funding to throw an event in Brussels at ETH CC for the Arbitrum community. These events require a substantial amount of lead time to plan, and the event would not have been possible if a few extra weeks had passed prior to getting the event funded.\n<ul>\n<li>This is a great example of Entropy Advisors helping 3rd party service providers navigate the DAO while also combatting the collective inactive problem mentioned above. Everyone wanted Arbitrum DAO representation in Brussels and Entropy stepped in to get it done.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Introduced a <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/improving-predictability-in-arbitrum-dao-s-operations/25136\">governance calendar</a> that encourages proposals to start and finish Snapshot and Tally voting on the same day each week, requires some support from delegates before proposals move to Snapshot from the Forum, and a holiday break at the turn of the new year.\n<ul>\n<li>The goal of this proposal was to reduce delegate fatigue by incorporating a more predictable structure, and ensuring things only go to Snapshot once they have been thoroughly reviewed by the broader community.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>As mentioned above, Entropy has bi-weekly meetings with active delegates, members from OCL, and the Foundation in an effort to streamline communication throughout the DAO. This has helped ensure no two entities are working on the same thing in silos and will become more important in the future as we define the DAO’s long-term strategic vision.</li>\n<li>By leveraging our existing network, we have kicked off discussions with potential major partners for the DAO. We will always be representing Arbitrum DAO in a high-value context, even though sometimes it won’t be visible to the broader DAO until the end of the negotiations’ lifecycle.</li>\n<li>We are also working on numerous initiatives in tandem that are not yet ready for the forum:\n<ul>\n<li>Stylus Sprint - essentially a grants program for early adopters of Stylus to improve dev tooling and infra, and display the power of Stylus on mainnet.</li>\n<li>Events RFP - a group of events providers who can organize events on behalf of the DAO for a fair price.</li>\n<li>[Redacted] Gaming Project Looking at Deploying on Arbitrum - small concessions need to be agreed upon by the DAO, but a top-tier gaming project wants to build on Arbitrum if these terms can be met.</li>\n<li>Pursuing the acceleration of a treasury management strategy so that the DAO is better prepared for the next bear market.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<p>If this proposal passes, Entropy Advisors will sign a 1-year exclusivity agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation. The partnership will begin on the first of the month after this proposal passes. During this time, Entropy will service no other clients in any capacity. We will achieve the aforementioned goals through the following deliverables:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposals-as-a-service-paas-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposals-as-a-service-paas-7\"></a><strong>Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Neutral Proposal Broker\n<ul>\n<li>Hold introductory strategy meetings with key Arbitrum stakeholders and partners to help them navigate the DAO. Facilitate introductions between delegates, contributors, DAO leaders, and key strategic partners.</li>\n<li>Assist with drafting and delivering proposals from select third parties to the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Proposal Incubation\n<ul>\n<li>Facilitate the oversight and creation of neutral DAO frameworks and initiatives that do not benefit Entropy and only have the DAO’s best interests in mind.</li>\n<li>The idea behind Entropy is to assemble a team composed of highly capable DAO contributors with differing perspectives and expertises—we will use our collective brain power to create proposals that benefit Arbitrum over the long term and are aligned with community priorities.</li>\n<li>Enable the DAO to expedite and refine proposals more precisely, addressing the recurring issue of proposals being approved without sufficient details on execution and long-term planning.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"strategy-and-ecosystem-alignment-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#strategy-and-ecosystem-alignment-8\"></a><strong>Strategy and Ecosystem Alignment</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Serve as the liaison between Arbitrum’s key stakeholders\n<ul>\n<li>Host meetings with key stakeholders and report needs and updates between the relevant parties.

We will serve as an extra set of eyes to highlight emerging technologies and trends within crypto, aiding Arbitrum parties when we can be helpful.</li>\n<li>Generally speaking, ensure that the Arbitrum DAO is on track to becoming a sustainable entity with sensible spending and a focus on profit generation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data and Brand Building</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build up a high-value brand through various mediums, such as X/Twitter with educational content and research, YouTube/Apple/Spotify through a podcast, and email through weekly newsletters.\n<ul>\n<li>Bring visibility into DAO initiatives and RFPs.</li>\n<li>Represent the DAO professionally and with a demeanor that the community can be proud of.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Aid DAO-funded organizations like the ARDC and OBL in conducting research and analytics to inform proposal development.\n<ul>\n<li>Utilize data analytics to help the DAO with accountability and transparency around its initiatives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"vision-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vision-9\"></a>Vision</h1>\n<p>Our vision for working with the Arbitrum DAO is structured in three key phases, each building upon the success of the previous one to ensure a thriving partnership.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"complete-phase-1-establishing-the-foundation-for-entropyarbitrum-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#complete-phase-1-establishing-the-foundation-for-entropyarbitrum-10\"></a>[Complete] Phase 1: Establishing The Foundation For Entropy&lt;&gt;Arbitrum</h3>\n<p>In the initial phase, our focus was on establishing a solid foundation by identifying and addressing key pain points within the DAO. This involved acting as a neutral party to broker proposals, aligning stakeholders, attracting talent, and improving strategic partner onboarding and stakeholder relations. Our initial efforts have already demonstrated notable progress in a short time period, setting the stage for a more capable DAO.</p>\n<p>During Phase 1 we identified how Entropy fits into the broader DAO, and how we can be most useful. This involved lessons learned in passing proposals, project management, and working with new and existing partners. Additionally, we took this time to start building relationships with all of the DAO’s most active stakeholders including many delegates, members of the foundation, protocol teams, and key individuals at Offchain Labs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"this-proposal-phase-2-passing-a-dao-proposal-for-one-year-of-continued-work-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#this-proposal-phase-2-passing-a-dao-proposal-for-one-year-of-continued-work-11\"></a>[This Proposal] Phase 2: Passing a DAO Proposal For One Year of Continued Work.</h3>\n<p>Over the next year, we will build on the foundations we have established, aiming to make the Arbitrum DAO an efficient and effective community dedicated to long-term sustainability through the points brought up in the Motivation &amp; Rationale section.</p>\n<p>We will enhance governance processes by ensuring the initiatives we develop and implement focus on accountability. By fostering stronger relationships between key stakeholders we will ensure more cohesive collaboration. Through data, quantitative, and qualitative analysis we will begin to analyze active initiatives and propose clawbacks and other mechanisms to decrease DAO spend to focus its budget on high ROI initiatives.</p>\n<p>Leveraging our extensive network, we will secure partnerships that bring value to the DAO, enhancing the overall ecosystem. Additionally, we will pick up small lift brand and marketing campaigns to help bring awareness to DAO initiatives. We will continue to attract and retain high-quality contributors by offering competitive compensation, professional development opportunities, and a collaborative work environment.</p>\n<p>Through strategic projects, such as well-thought-out economic stimulation, we will support the DAO in generating sustainable revenue streams. Our proposal includes an agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation so that if the OpCo is stood up in the next year, we can easily port our agreement to fall under its purview instead of the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"phase-3-a-well-oiled-machine-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#phase-3-a-well-oiled-machine-12\"></a>Phase 3: A Well-Oiled Machine</h3>\n<p>In Phase 3, we envision Entropy Advisors as a well-oiled machine, seamlessly servicing the Arbitrum DAO. Entropy will grow together with the ecosystem, continuing to perfect the deliverables mentioned earlier while looking for areas where we can add value. By this stage, we will have employed and retained top talent, creating an environment where the DAO operates at peak efficiency. Our efforts will help position Arbitrum as the clear-cut leader in the rollup ecosystem, driving innovation, growth, and success.</p>\n<p>At this point OpCo should be well underway and Entropy Advisors will continue to serve as a service provider to OpCo, if viewed as beneficial. The DAO will be able to retain a second year of Entropy’s services under the same terms stipulated in this proposal, if it desires to do so. For this second-year engagement clause to be executed in the future, the DAO will also need to vote in favor of the future bonus proposal discussed below. If the OpCo is stood up, this entity can be responsible for the potential renewal in place of a DAO vote. This structure would come into effect at the end of our initial 1-year term.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"cost-budget-breakdown-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#cost-budget-breakdown-13\"></a>Cost &amp; Budget Breakdown</h1>\n<p><strong>Salaries: $1.96M</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: According to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGkU4uF_Lz5Y_qiOaimLAVxYdy9JfEn3DfIraJCUY0E/edit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Delphi</a>, a VC analyst (the lowest level employee) makes $85,000-$160,000 + a carry with more senior positions making significantly more. Employees cost an employer substantially more than base salary due to benefits, taxes, and other assorted costs. This ensures competitive compensation to attract and retain top talent, with our goal being to hire up to 10 employees. Additionally, we will be able to hire independent contractors and service providers on a project-by-project basis as needed. We are doing highly specialized work, and obtaining experienced individuals in the middle of a bull market with extensive experience in operations, project management, finance, and governance that are also crypto native will be expensive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Legal, Insurance, and Accounting: $90K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Covers necessary legal, insurance, and accounting services to ensure compliance and protect the organization. As a company operating in a forward-facing role in the governance space, a sufficient budget is necessary to protect against changing tides in the regulatory environment. Costs include setting up a Cayman Entity, D&amp;O + E&amp;O insurance, accountant’s hours, ESOP, employee agreement reviews, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conference Travel, Offsites, and Small Events: $105K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: It is important that Entropy represent Arbitrum DAO at industry leading events. Hosting our own small events is important for brand building. Offsites and conferences can cost as much as $5,000 per employee in attendance. Even throwing a small “Happy Hour” type event can cost between $5,000 and $15,000. This enables Entropy members to attend industry conferences, conduct 1-2 offsites per year, and host 1-2 small events to foster team collaboration and engagement with the community. All while representing Arbitrum DAO in a professional manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Assorted Software: $21K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Enterprise Dune, Gusto, QuickBooks, Replit, Google Suite, Web Hosting, Laevitas, Token Terminal, Open AI API, Slack, etc. Provides essential tools and platforms for data analysis, development, operations, and communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Brand and Marketing: $80K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Invests in brand building and marketing efforts to enhance the visibility and reach of the Arbitrum DAO. Though it is a small budget and the DAO should still explore other avenues for marketing, it will allow us to do the bare minimum of promoting Twitter/X threads, building websites, and other brand building mechanisms of this nature. Launching a high-quality podcast can also incur significant costs. Our existing familiarity with Arbitrum’s methods of information dispersion allow us to lean into brand and marketing in an optimal manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Office / Misc: $70K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Covers expenses for coworking spaces, office equipment (laptops, podcast materials, office stipend), dinner stipend for late nights, and other miscellaneous costs to support a productive work environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Operating Budget Subtotal: $2.326M</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Margin / Contingency (~20%): $465K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Provides a buffer for unforeseen expenses and ensures the project’s smooth progression and some potential profit for the company over year 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"total-budget-2791m-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#total-budget-2791m-14\"></a>Total Budget: $2.791M</h3>\n<h2><a name=\"payment-details-and-clawback-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#payment-details-and-clawback-15\"></a>Payment Details and Clawback</h2>\n<p>While the Entropy team scales, they will draw a reduced $100,000 per month and after crossing the threshold of 7 employees dedicated to Arbitrum, will start receiving regular monthly payments ($2,791,000/12 = $232583) for the remainder of the 12 month term.</p>\n<p>A total of 6 million ARB will be sent to the Foundation, for them to monetize at their discretion to secure at least $2,791,000. Any Excess ARB not monetized (or stored for the potential bonus below) and excess stables from lower payments during the initial scaling of Entropy will be sent back to the DAO by the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"termination-and-clawback-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#termination-and-clawback-16\"></a>Termination and Clawback</h3>\n<p>The DAO may vote via Snapshot to terminate Arbitrum’s relationship with Entropy Advisors at any time. Quorum for this proposal will be set at the same level as ongoing non-constitutional onchain proposals, with quorum defined as total votes for termination+abstention, and the proposal must have more voting power in favor of termination than against or abstaining. If the Snapshot proposal passes, the DAO can terminate the agreement with Entropy Advisors, effective on the last day of the month in which the Snapshot passes, effectively stopping any future payment at that moment. In this scenario, all funds earmarked for Entropy Advisors will be returned to the DAO by the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-15m-arb-bonus-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-15m-arb-bonus-17\"></a>1.5M ARB Bonus</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will hold 1.5 million ARB allocated to potential performance bonuses. As the 1-year period comes to a close, Entropy will post a Snapshot vote so that the DAO may decide if the bonus should be distributed. The DAO will have the options of no bonus, 500k ARB bonus, 1M ARB bonus, or full 1.5M ARB allocation. If the proposal passes, the Foundation will send the X (TBD number) ARB to a 3-year vesting smart contract that pays out to Entropy Advisors in monthly streams. This ensures Entropy Advisors remains aligned with the DAO and ARB token even after this agreement has expired and as we move into Phase 3 and onward.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"return-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#return-18\"></a>Return</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will send all funds in excess of – $2,791,000 + 1.5 million ARB – back to the DAO. At the end of the year, any additional dollars resulting from months where Entropy receives $100,000 instead of the full allocation, and remainder from 1.5M ARB if the full bonus is not allocated, will also be returned.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"our-vision-is-to-turn-arbitrum-into-a-sustainable-entity-with-durable-operations-in-place-entropy-will-be-the-spearhead-of-catalyzing-operational-change-and-leave-long-lasting-structure-in-its-wake-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#our-vision-is-to-turn-arbitrum-into-a-sustainable-entity-with-durable-operations-in-place-entropy-will-be-the-spearhead-of-catalyzing-operational-change-and-leave-long-lasting-structure-in-its-wake-19\"></a>Our vision is to turn Arbitrum into a sustainable entity with durable operations in place.

So far, the weekly amounts of ARB being distributed amount to less than the total budget. This is on purpose:</p>\n<p>As highlighted in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-gains-network-stip-addendum/23398/1\">Addendum</a>, Gains Network will utilize a large part of its LP incentives budget to bootstrap more (sticky) liquidity for the <a href=\"https://gains.trade/vaults/gUSDC\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gUSDC</a> vault as it’s anticipating more USDC-collateral usage over the coming months. Initially, the focus will be on building liquidity on third-party DEXs for gUSDC/USDC pools. This strategy aims to unlock various partnership opportunities, creating an ecosystem around gUSDC through lending markets, LP-strategy protocols, and more.</p>\n<p>Once the necessary requirements for these DEX pools are met and gUSDC price feeds are established, there will be potential for new partnerships. These new pools and contracts will be incentivized using the current surplus. Any new partnerships and corresponding incentives will be detailed in future bi-weekly reports.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GCGP Program [total budget = 112.5k for the entire program]</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-gains-network-stip-addendum/23398/1\">Addendum</a>, Gains Network is also organizing a “<a href=\"https://x.com/GainsNetwork_io/status/1803472036603502853\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gains Community Grants Program (GCGP)</a>” using 5% of its STIP.B budget to incentivize projects and builders to build on top gTrade contracts.</p>\n<p>This is a first step to Gains Network transitioning into a DAO where GNS voters will decide how the ARB budget for the GCGP should be allocated. A committee of selected Gains Network team members, community members and contributors was formed to provide applicants with constructive feedback, ensuring their proposals align with STIP guidelines and GCGP rules.

Consequently, Radiant will adjust the incentive distribution from an 80-20 split to a 75-25 split between lenders and borrowers. This adjustment should enhance borrowing incentives without penalizing or discouraging deposits.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Radpie wstETH vault (104,166 ARB)</strong></p>\n<p>The wstETH market incentives have been running for the past week, initially supported solely by Radiant’s incentives. Thanks to an upcoming collaboration with Lido, who will match Radiant’s incentives for the market, Radiant expects a substantial increase in market participation.</p>\n<p>This wstETH initiative is carried out on Radpie due to its unique ability to create vaults with automatic 3.46x looping, which was desired by Lido to co-incentivize the market.</p>\n<p>Since the introduction of these incentives, there has been a clear increase in TVL, bolstering our confidence that the market will perform exceptionally well once the total planned incentives from both Radiant and Lido are in full effect. Prior to the initiative, the TVL stood at approximately $408k, and as of now, it has surged to $2.4M, marking an impressive growth of 490%.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/71c0c8f2ca5a37af3ba60a7fe4138685ed8c4bbb.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/geiZD15Sg4OyspN0GCnzmmWNjS3.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71c0c8f2ca5a37af3ba60a7fe4138685ed8c4bbb_2_690x257.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"geiZD15Sg4OyspN0GCnzmmWNjS3\" width=\"690\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71c0c8f2ca5a37af3ba60a7fe4138685ed8c4bbb_2_690x257.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71c0c8f2ca5a37af3ba60a7fe4138685ed8c4bbb_2_1035x385.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71c0c8f2ca5a37af3ba60a7fe4138685ed8c4bbb_2_1380x514.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F5F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source:<a href=\"https://dune.com/radiant/arbitrum-stip-bridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> https://dune.com/radiant/arbitrum-stip-bridge</a></p>\n<p>Radiant and Lido will assess the campaign’s results after 30 days and determine whether to continue as planned or make adjustments.</p>\n<p><strong>3.

Therefore, a space on the X social network has been coordinated for Monday, July 1st. Radiant protocol will provide additional incentives before the event to gauge market reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Radpie USDC lenders (120,000 ARB)</strong></p>\n<p>The recent bull market has led to Radiant users choosing to de-prioritize holding stablecoins such as USDC, preferring leverage and volatile assets. This stance has led to a decrease in USDC lenders, causing USDC borrow rates to spike.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the need to stabilize these rates, Radiant is prioritizing efforts to enhance the native USDC market, in alignment with the goals of Arbitrum, Gauntlet, and Circle to foster greater adoption of this asset.</p>\n<p>This effort is being carried out through Radpie, leveraging previous STIP initiatives that incentivized stablecoin pools and yielded favorable outcomes. The initiative has already shown outstanding results within the first two days, with an initial TVL of 2.9M growing to 5.3M, reflecting an 82.75% increase. These promising outcomes reinforce Radiant’s confidence in enhancing market stability and promoting broader adoption of native USDC on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1atxDO6VkhzSn0Zo2aIrQQ5Svyr.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_690x449.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"1atxDO6VkhzSn0Zo2aIrQQ5Svyr\" width=\"690\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_690x449.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_1035x673.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_1380x898.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"98E8FB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>5.

The structure of the STIP Bridge incentive program is very different than the original STIP grant.</p>\n<p>30% of the STIP B grant will be given as incentives to LPs by the same mechanism as the STIP. This time around though, we will be focusing liquidity incentives on a smaller number of tokens.</p>\n<p>70% of the STIP B grant will be given to other kinds of users on Notional through the use of an off-chain points program. Total ARB incentives distributed through the points program will be 175,000 ARB over three 4-week seasons. Points are accrued during the season and then ARB distributions are made at the end of each season.</p>\n<p>This points program allows us significantly more flexibility in incentivizing different kinds of Notional users. In particular, we are focusing on borrowers and leveraged vault users. This focus is reflected by high point multipliers for borrowing (4x) and using a leveraged vault (8x), vs. lending (1x-2x).</p>\n<p>Full details of the points program on our dedicated dashboard:</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://notional.finance/points-dashboard/arbitrum\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://notional.finance/favicon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"23\" height=\"22\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://notional.finance/points-dashboard/arbitrum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">notional.finance</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/925b3655c761414db3867390b0994c19b38a3a5a_2_690x362.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"053845\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://notional.finance/points-dashboard/arbitrum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Notional Finance - DeFi lending and leveraged yield</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Lend, Borrow, and Earn Leveraged Yield with Fixed or Variable Rates</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Liquidity rewarder contracts:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Currency</th>\n<th>Contract Address</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ETH</td>\n<td>0x3987F211d4BA25B6FF163B56051651bF6c6c5e54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>0xE5b58DE62b71477aE4e10074fee48232DD7A2350</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>0xFc24ACF5BD2aFEe3efBd589F87B6610C9D162645</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wBTC</td>\n<td>0x8BC5600582c6c17194e4478C311d3133cf9361D2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wstETH</td>\n<td>0xd2Da21d240F093A38A143426D3cd62326FC496cc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FRAX</td>\n<td>0xA8cA4FA84933106a92D4fec68C8B5A057703e862</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rETH</td>\n<td>0xda99cd202bCac9f9c945fF2954e08EAec63B067d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>0xe670942CE88d0ac8E655d30E5EF0229e969de26C</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Contract address label <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2AYnjAaQjVOLtvemZpsWoN5sTJEJ8dLqdRDExTBQv_SUeug/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Form 20</a> completed for all addresses: Yes</p>\n<p>ARB left over: 0</p>\n<p>Plan for leftover ARB: Distribute over following periods</p>\n<p>Summary of incentives: LPs in the following currencies are currently being incentivized at the following weekly rates.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Currency</th>\n<th>Weekly ARB Emission Rate</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ETH</td>\n<td>2,083</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>2,083</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wBTC</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wstETH</td>\n<td>416</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FRAX</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rETH</td>\n<td>416</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>1250</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"stats-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stats-3\"></a>STATS</h2>\n<p>Average daily TVL: $6.93M</p>\n<p>Average daily transactions: 133</p>\n<p>Average daily volumes: $6.9M (average open debt)</p>\n<p>Number of unique user addresses: 4,349</p>\n<p>Transaction fees: $387</p>\n<p>Link to Dashboard showing metrics: <a href=\"https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-finance-v3-arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-finance-v3-arbitrum</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"plan-for-the-next-two-weeks-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#plan-for-the-next-two-weeks-4\"></a>Plan For the Next Two Weeks</h2>\n<p>Amount of ARB to be distributed: No change</p>\n<p>Contracts that will be incentivized: No change</p>\n<p>Contract address label <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2AYnjAaQjVOLtvemZpsWoN5sTJEJ8dLqdRDExTBQv_SUeug/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Form 20</a> completed for all addresses: Yes</p>\n<p>Mechanism for distribution incentives: No change</p>\n<p>Summary of incentives plan: No change</p>\n<p>Summary of changes to the original plan:</p>\n<p>The original plan involved a fixed allocation between lenders, borrowers, and leveraged vault users. However, this is very hard to achieve in practice without constantly tweaking point multipliers for each different product type given that points earned between different product types are fungible with one another.</p>\n<p>To ensure a fixed allocation between different product types, we would have needed to create three different kinds of points. We felt that this was impractical and have instead decided to focus on leveraged vault users and borrowers as we have found those users to be the most important in driving growth. Depending on the results in Season One, we may tweak point multipliers for the next season to respond to any issues we see in Season One.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1

Yes</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism for distribution incentives:</strong> Distributed via an Airdrop</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives plan:</strong></p>\n<p>As part of the liquidity incentives, we intend to distribute approximately $200,000 ARB during epoch 2 and an additional $200,000 ARB in epoch 3. As for the Trading Incentives program, we plan to allocate around $200,000 ARB initially, followed by another $200,000 ARB one week later.</p>\n<p>Currently, our focus is on assisting accepted grantees in achieving their milestones more efficiently before the conclusion of the STIP Bridge program. Once the grantee’s milestones are successfully completed, we anticipate disbursing approximately $100,000 ARB.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of changes to the original plan:</strong> N/A</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gmx-stip-b-bi-weekly-update/25219\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gmx-stip-b-bi-weekly-update/25219","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 17:19:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25219"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gmx-stip-b-bi-weekly-update/25219.rss","#text":"[GMX] STIP.
