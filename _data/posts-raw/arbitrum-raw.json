Our research examines best practices, methods for measuring program success, and the development of a maturity framework for grant programs in this space. Additionally, we outline key impact metrics based on insights from a range of Web3 grant programs. Another aim of this study is to identify opportunities to improve reputation systems within these programs.</p>\n<p>To inform our analysis, we conducted interviews with grant program operators, engaged with forums across the ecosystem, and revisited key findings from the Grant Innovation Lab’s State of Web3 Grants report, along with other retrospective studies. Drawing from this data, we developed several tools: a framework to evaluate program effectiveness, a maturity model to assess different stages of grant programs, and a set of metrics to gauge impact. We advise operators to use these tools in combination for a more comprehensive assessment of program outcomes.</p>\n<p>It’s important to acknowledge that grant programs in the Web3 space are still experimental by nature. The entire industry is in a state of evolution, and grant programs have had to adapt accordingly. Even the most advanced programs, often in their 5th or 6th iteration, are still relatively young. Therefore, we don’t recommend directly comparing them with long-established grant initiatives and programs outside of Web3.</p>\n<p>Finally, this study is empirical, shaped by the realities of a fast-evolving industry, but it is also data-driven, incorporating our deep dives and analysis from a wide range of grant programs. Our hope is that the insights provided here will be valuable to the wider ecosystem, supporting the continued development of effective and impactful grant programs in Web3.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59401-team-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-team-3\"></a>Team</h3>\n<p>ZER8: Solo managed grant programs for Thankarb Milestone 1 and distributed over 500k $, Ex- eligibility team lead at Gitcoin DAO: reviewed over 3000 grant applications and helped save over 1m$.

Aave Grants DAO (AGD) is a good example where they share overall metrics such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Total Grant Applications Received</li>\n<li>Total Applications Approved</li>\n<li>Acceptance Rate</li>\n<li>Percentage of projects that make it to the written stage and video call stage</li>\n<li>Total Amount Disbursed</li>\n<li>Percentage of Complete Grant Payments</li>\n<li>Percentage of In-progress/Incomplete Grant Payments:</li>\n<li>Status of all grants (percentage of complete, in-progress, and inactive or sunset)</li>\n<li>Amount and Quantity Approved by Category</li>\n<li>A summary of the grantees each month, along with how much they were awarded, and a brief description of their grant.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The transparency in the evaluation process and criteria helps limit duplicate proposals and help applicants know what they need to improve in order to receive a grant in the first place.</li>\n<li>Having different grants formats and flavors for different types of grants is an effective way to deploy capital and to run grants experiments.</li>\n<li>Being adaptable and flexible with changing needs of the program and of the industry is a good practice that prevents the program from being outdated and ineffective.</li>\n<li>A way to improve the quality of applications is to outline the nature of the application process, making it easier for grantees to apply. An example of this is Uniswap Foundation, whose website includes a checklist for potential applicants as well as tips and considerations to help applicants strengthen their submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59401-learnings-from-grants-programs-operators-and-l2s-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-learnings-from-grants-programs-operators-and-l2s-8\"></a>Learnings from Grants Programs, Operators, and L2s</h2>\n<p>The following insights were derived from a variety of ecosystems by combing through governance forum retrospectives and insights, as well as direct interviews with several operators and grants tools, and leadership from these projects.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59401-learnings-from-agd-aave-grants-dao-grants-program-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-learnings-from-agd-aave-grants-dao-grants-program-9\"></a>Learnings from AGD (Aave Grants DAO) Grants Program</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"p-59401-program-overview-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-program-overview-10\"></a>Program Overview</h4>\n<p>Aave Grants DAO (AGD) was a community-led grants program that fosters community growth and innovation in the Aave ecosystem by serving as a gateway for teams building on top of Aave Pools or with GHO. It was started in 2021 and announced winding down in 2024.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-59401-insights-from-the-agd-forum-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-insights-from-the-agd-forum-11\"></a>Insights from the AGD forum</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Establishing a legal entity allows a DAO to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with traditional industries.</li>\n<li>“Introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers allows for further involvement of the community while also bringing expertise from different community members.”</li>\n<li>“A well functioning grants team only works well if the team is nimble, can move fast, and act independently”.</li>\n<li>“Term elections for choosing capital allocators from the community is a well-established norm in various reputed ecosystems such as ENS DAO, Gitcoin etc. By implementing a more rigorous and clearly defined set of criteria for selection, an election process would offer a fair and unbiased chance for community members, including those who are new contributors and proposers, to join the AGD team and contribute meaningfully to the DAO”.</li>\n<li>“A transparent process empowers the community to keep on oversight on what proposals are getting accepted, rejected, funded and get a deeper insight into the review parameters and process…A transparent process will empower the community to ask the right questions and allow for constructive feedback, thus improving further iterations of AGD. Additional deliberation and community participation is better than having none.”</li>\n<li>Grantee growth parameters should be objective and tied to tangible value creation to better evaluate the performance of the grants program.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-59401-insights-from-the-agd-operations-team-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-insights-from-the-agd-operations-team-12\"></a>Insights from the AGD Operations Team</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The ecosystem: stage of protocol, contributor maturity, developer interest/awareness - are really important factors for structuring and setting up a grants program. Giving one size fits all advice for grants programs is difficult. Grants programs should start with their mission/goals/values and then work backwards to design and implement a program to best serve that</li>\n<li>Rotating committee: This is also something AGD explored. Reviewers need to be trusted and recognized by the community is crucial - unless the program is set up with direct community involvement it’s pretty necessary for a community to trust a grants team.</li>\n<li>A well functioning grants team…: Being able to grow and evolve as a grants program alongside the respective ecosystem is key. Grants programs should complement the other stakeholders, not be a totally independent island.</li>\n<li>Elections: This was actually brought up to the community and was shut down because it’s hard not to make something like elections a popularity contest. It’s tough though because the surface level appeal is clear, however there’s skepticism on whether it would result in getting the <em>best</em> people in the role. To the point above, especially having people who are independent seems difficult if elections are heavily leaned on. A (main?) priority of reviewers becomes reelection in cases like this.</li>\n<li>“Additional deliberation and community participation is better than none”: The program mission and even on a per grant basis has a huge influence on this. If the goal is contributor growth and the ecosystem is relatively unknown then taking long times to review and engage the community on each grant doesn’t scale and the process does more harm than good. Additionally, there may not be much of a community to engage early on.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59401-learnings-from-thankarbitrum-arbitrum-dao-grants-program-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-learnings-from-thankarbitrum-arbitrum-dao-grants-program-13\"></a>Learnings from ThankArbitrum (Arbitrum DAO) Grants Program</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"p-59401-program-overview-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-program-overview-14\"></a>Program Overview</h4>\n<p>Thank Arbitrum is the first pluralist grants program under Arbitrum and has committed to allocating $3.2M in ARB through 10 grants programs to the top crypto builders and contributors.

Problems as identified by delegates and Plurality Labs (acquired by Thrive Protocol) were given a grant to do the initial catherding and research that is required to kickstart action.</p>\n<p>Expected Outcomes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly and effectively address urgent needs resulting in high-quality resolutions.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate the ability to create fast and fair outcomes that benefit the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Frameworks for service providers to build a scalable foundation for Arbitrum growth.</li>\n<li>High quality resolution of key, immediate needs. better, more fair outcomes for the ecosystem, more fair frameworks for service providers speed and fairness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This program was well received and has significant positive impact because it directly addressed needs the community recognized.</li>\n<li>Firestarters need a clear next step rather than expecting indefinite continuation. The need for on-chain tools to assign roles for igniting and holding firestarters accountable stood out.</li>\n<li>While giving someone like Disruption Joe decision-making power worked, it’s worth exploring other models that would function well without relying on a single individual.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-59401-h-3-thank-arbitrum-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-h-3-thank-arbitrum-19\"></a>3. Thank Arbitrum</h4>\n<p>Program Description: This program introduced a novel way for the community to connect with the DAO. It provided a foundation for the community to continually sense and respond to the fast-paced crypto environment. Its aim was to provide a place for DAO members to learn about what is happening, to voice their opinions, and to learn about opportunities to offer their skills to Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Expected Outcomes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve how grant funding is distributed</li>\n<li>Increase delegate and community confidence that funds are allocated as intended based on a collaborative process.</li>\n<li>Assure the community that we can manage the grant process inclusively and efficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Despite efforts to remove sybils, they struggled with engagement from participants who weren’t genuinely invested in the DAO. Future efforts should focus more on engaging delegates and valuable contributors.</li>\n<li>While significant data was gathered on how token holders feel, it didn’t fully reflect the disengagement among delegates.</li>\n<li>The need to develop better interfaces tailored to DAO members’ needs.</li>\n<li>The initial attempt at a tARB reputation system didn’t work as planned. Discussions with Hats Protocol revealed that dynamic councils based on Thank ARB contributions could enhance decision-making, particularly for tasks requiring a high level of effort, similar to what’s needed in Optimism’s appeal system.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-59401-h-4-mev-miner-extractable-value-research-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-h-4-mev-miner-extractable-value-research-20\"></a>4. MEV (Miner Extractable Value) Research</h4>\n<p>Program Description: This grant was awarded to establish the Plural Research Society and build the first forum and plural voting tools needed to support it. As part of the grant, an experimental plural research workshop would be hosted where the participants – researchers from across the MEV space – would convene to present their research proposals, discuss and debate using a variety of pluralistic tools, then ultimately vote to decide how to allocate 100,000 ARB in grant funding.</p>\n<p>Why the Program Was Funded</p>\n<p>This program was designed to :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a scalable platform to build upon a successful proof of concept built for Zuzalu</li>\n<li>Leverage the expertise of highly respected advisors to conduct novel research</li>\n<li>Discover if a better forum can drastically improve the quality of conversation</li>\n<li>Use the forum under-the-hood design to allocate funding on a niche, high-expertise topic</li>\n<li>To ensure platforming for a broad selection of researcher opinions in the gas fee optimization and MEV space which has incentives to platform only financially beneficial views</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Expected Outcomes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new forum dedicated to high expertise discussions, pushing the boundaries of decentralized governance and credibility.</li>\n<li>The forum will be a place where qualified voices and thought leaders stand out and the most important discussion gets attention in a decentralized way.</li>\n<li>Radically amplify new ideas and technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Takeaways</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having a dedicated, high-quality advisor who is truly invested in the project made a big difference in attracting top talent and ensuring adherence to specs.</li>\n<li>Some viewed the program as merely a “forum” or “conference,” but it’s actually a critical experiment aimed at improving our understanding of gas fee optimization and information sharing in the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Due to delays in compliance, assembling the right team, and coordinating schedules for researchers, this program has taken longer than others, with more insights expected as it progresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-59401-h-5-arbitrum-colab-by-rndao-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-h-5-arbitrum-colab-by-rndao-21\"></a>5.

Plurality Gov Boost</h4>\n<p>Program Description</p>\n<p>This program included direct grants funded to increase Arbitrum DAO ability to effectively govern its resources.</p>\n<p>Why the Program Was Funded</p>\n<p>This program was designed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Utilize PL delegated decision-making freedom to use different decision making modalities to fund needed work</li>\n<li>Fund research and milestone based work using milestone based payouts.</li>\n<li>Anticipate future needs of the DAO and build, processes, procedures, and programs which may have substantial impact on the DAO but lack other ways of being funded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The program highlighted the need for clearer decision-making pathways and transparency, especially for specialized requirements.</li>\n<li>Some decisions were made based on expert input that wasn’t widely understood by others. For example, Helika Gaming’s data was crucial for analyzing acquisition costs across different verticals, which will save the DAO significant funds over time, even if these choices weren’t always clear to everyone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-59401-h-7-questbook-rounds-on-gitcoin-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-h-7-questbook-rounds-on-gitcoin-23\"></a>7. Questbook Rounds on Gitcoin</h4>\n<p>Program Description</p>\n<p>This program started with two unique governance experiments. A “domain allocation” governance experiment allowed the community to direct funds to four matching pools based on Questbook program domains. Then 4 quadratic funding rounds sourced grants to assist their domain allocators in sourcing grants.</p>\n<p>Why the Program Was Funded</p>\n<p>This program was designed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support Questbook program success based on them answering that the “reason they would not succeed if they didn’t”</li>\n<li>Show how pluralist programs can be complementary to each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The disparity between votes in the domain round and funding round, especially in categories like Gaming, suggests that Quadratic Funding might not be the best method for all cases.</li>\n<li>The true success of this program will be evident in how many projects receive additional funding after it ends. This will be most telling if the initial allocation isn’t fully used.</li>\n<li>Offering a small ARB incentive for donations over $10 could nearly double the average donation amount on the Thank ARB platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-59401-h-8-arbitrum-citizens-retro-funding-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-h-8-arbitrum-citizens-retro-funding-24\"></a>8. Arbitrum Citizens Retro Funding</h4>\n<p>Program Description</p>\n<p>The goal of this program was to distribute 100k $ARB to best Arbinauts and citizens that have proactively worked and truly impacted the Arbitrum DAO since its launch. They aimed to reward work that helped kickstart the DAO and/or contributed directly to Arbitrums strategic goals.</p>\n<p>Why the Program was Funded</p>\n<p>This program was designed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reward DAO contributors who had stepped up to contribute without reward since the DAO started</li>\n<li>Encourage future participation by setting a precedent for retroactive rewards</li>\n<li>Experiment with using Quadratic Funding retroactively</li>\n<li>Market the Arbitrum community in a highly visible way</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By focusing only on individuals, certain organizations that have made significant contributions were not able to participate.

These grants foster innovation, infrastructure, and ecosystem growth through decentralized decision-making.</p>\n<p>ThankArb functions as a learning machine, iterating and improving with each funding round. Its focus on adaptability allows it to identify and expand successful mechanisms, decentralizing decision-making by empowering competent individuals.</p>\n<p>The future of Web3 grants also involves refining decentralized funding mechanisms, such as quadratic funding (QF) possibly paired together with other onchain allocation mechanisms eg:conviction voting (CV), but even more important is applying tailored solutions that address crucial ecosystem needs., eg: direct funding, councils, etc . Experimentation with off and on-chain resource allocation remains critical.</p>\n<p>Notable programs include ThankArb and ThankApe (ApeCoin community), both of which emphasize strong community-building before allocating grants. Iterative learning and adaptability make these programs stand out.</p>\n<p>A natural comparison would be to look at RPGF vs ThankARB as they both serve as the main allocators for L2 ecosystems(Optimism and Arbitrum), but in reality ThankArb and Optimism RPGF1 serve distinct roles, with ThankArb focusing on decentralized allocation and RPGF1 on centralized decision-making. Success in both can be measured through ecosystem impact and milestone achievement</p>\n<p>Key best practices include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ecosystem Needs: Tailoring grants to the ecosystem’s specific requirements.</li>\n<li>Multiple Pathways: Offering diverse funding mechanisms for different projects, protocols, etc</li>\n<li>Iterative Learning: Running experiments to refine grant strategies and address evolving needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Grant program effectiveness can be assessed through metrics such as milestone achievements, impact on ecosystem needs, and efficiency in resource distribution. Allocators must play a proactive role in managing and growing projects.</p>\n<p>While Web3 aims for decentralization, most grant programs are still centralized in decision-making. Programs like ThankArb are pushing the boundaries by experimenting with on-chain mechanisms to distribute decision-making power more effectively.</p>\n<p>Learnings from Karma GAP</p>\n<p>About GAP:</p>\n<p>The Grantee Accountability Protocol (GAP) is a tool designed to address grants funding challenges by aiding grantees in building their reputation, assisting communities in maintaining grantee accountability, and enabling third parties to develop applications using this protocol.</p>\n<p>Takeaways</p>\n<p>Effective grant programs should have clear goals, transparent evaluation rubrics, and involve the community in decision-making. A maturity index can rate programs based on factors like financial sustainability and community support. Feedback and marketing assistance are also important for successful grant programs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Articulating what an operator wants out of the grants program is crucial.

Retro Quadratic Funding (QF) rounds also stand out for their ability to involve the community and simultaneously provide financial support and marketing exposure to projects that have already made significant contributions.</p>\n<p>RetroPGF is an interesting model because its post-completion funding model ensures that projects have already delivered value before receiving grants. This reduces the pressure to meet predefined milestones and offers projects more freedom to adapt to the fast-moving industry landscape. The Optimism program’s simplicity, large funding rounds, and low overhead make it highly efficient for both projects and the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59401-learnings-from-gitcoin-grants-rounds-28\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-learnings-from-gitcoin-grants-rounds-28\"></a>Learnings from Gitcoin Grants Rounds</h2>\n<p>Grants in Web3 are funds provided without an expectation of return or equity stake. Their historical purpose is to support public goods, infrastructure, or research that can advance human progress. In the crypto space, grants are often funded through token generation events (TGEs) and are meant to drive ecosystem growth by funding various initiatives.</p>\n<p>The purpose of grants is to ignite growth within ecosystems by using incentives. They aim to foster innovation and development in the Web3 space, although many grants have become part of marketing strategies rather than solely focusing on growth.</p>\n<p>Gitcoin’s grants are funded by the Ethereum community and the wider Web3 community, rather than through Gitcoin’s own treasury. This is different from many crypto grant programs that use funds generated through TGEs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gitcoin employs a novel funding mechanism called quadratic funding, which is designed to enhance capital efficiency and support digital public goods.</li>\n<li>Gitcoin has its own treasury that funds development but does not run grant programs at scale. The grants are primarily for digital public goods and open-source software.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gitcoin is developing systems for better capital efficiency and allocation, with the goal of influencing broader grant programs and ecosystems. There’s a trend towards grants that can be converted into equity, which could provide a return on investment for grantors and enhance sustainability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The future may include more automated incentive structures based on on-chain network metrics, reducing reliance on human decision-making. Projects like Gitcoin’s work with Optimism on direct-to-contract incentives are examples of this trend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Noted for its mature evaluation process and comprehensive review system. RPGF program is well-structured with multiple stages of evaluation and metrics review.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recognized for its strong ecosystem and effective use of its treasury. ENS manages its grant programs creatively, balancing impact and capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Praised for its diverse programs and innovative approaches, including convertible grants to equity. The Solana foundation has demonstrated significant growth and effectiveness in its grant strategies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each program excels in different areas, making direct comparisons challenging. Optimism is noted for its evaluation maturity, ENS for its effective ecosystem management and creative grant use, and Silvana for its innovative approaches and recent growth. The best program depends on specific criteria and goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clearly define the desired outcomes and return on investment (ROI). It’s crucial to understand how funding will translate into impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strong eligibility criteria are essential for efficient allocation of funds. Protocol Guild’s success is attributed to its well-defined criteria.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Know your builders and provide additional support beyond funding. Implement milestones and accountability measures to ensure progress and alignment with goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Effectiveness is best measured by defining clear outcomes, ROI, and using appropriate metrics and accountability controls. Tools alone are not enough; understanding the underlying questions and processes is key.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The potential of decentralized grant programs lies in creating reputation systems that can track and evaluate the effectiveness of both programs and grantees. Open systems and public ledgers offer opportunities for developing these systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Building a comprehensive map of grant programs, their impact, and connections can improve the efficiency of the grant process. This includes understanding how programs and grantees interact and contribute to the ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gitcoin’s approach when it comes to grant funding: the ecosystem has a vision and the grant program derives its mission from it. Next, there’s granular objectives derived from the mission followed by key results for each and followed by leading indicators.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Gitcoin leadership strongly believes in the e<a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-2024-strategy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">volutionary approach</a>, no metric is good because it becomes redundant over time-people learn how to “hack it”. This is aligned with other thought leaders in the ecosystem such as Metrics Garden.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Incorporating feedback from participants is invaluable. Gitcoins products have evolved significantly since their inception due to feedback. They put emphasis on streamlining the application process and introduced more robust support systems to assist grantees. As a result, there was an 80% grantee satisfaction rate in GG20, the highest they’ve seen in at least the past year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gitcoin is pioneering allocation mechanisms with Allo and growing the EVM grant pie as more and more L2s are supported by GrantsStack(the permissionless platform to manage grant programs).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59401-learnings-from-octant-29\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-learnings-from-octant-29\"></a>Learnings from Octant</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>One big takeaway is people don’t often read and pay attention to details. This observation applies to communities and users across the board from grantees to donors. Unless there’s repeated, consistent emphasis on communication and strong emphasis on any detail worth nothing, people are likely to ignore key pieces of information. A learning here has been to make it easier for people to understand and double down on communicating often and across channels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59401-h-30\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-h-30\"></a></h3>\n<p>Learnings from Giveth</p>\n<p>Grants in Web3 are decentralized financial mechanisms aimed at stimulating ecosystem growth by supporting projects that contribute to public goods, open-source infrastructure, and innovation. Unlike traditional grants, they should emphasize decentralized decision-making and often align with token economies, enabling project sustainability through economic models, rather than direct funding alone and community/ecosystem alignment</p>\n<p>Giveth challenges the traditional grant model, viewing grants as inefficient and unsustainable. Instead, Giveth will soon propose a more innovative approach by enabling projects to tokenize and create self-sustaining economic models, allowing for long-term growth and a better alignment of incentives. This approach shifts from one-time grants to fostering ecosystems where projects can generate value through bonding curves and tokenized economies.</p>\n<p>The future of Web3 grants is seen as pluralistic, with a mix of decentralized governance models and council-led decisions. While grants might not ever be fully on-chain, the importance of efficiency, decentralized governance, and community involvement is clear. Retroactive funding mechanisms like RetroPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) are predicted to become more prominent, reducing the bureaucratic burden on startups and fostering entrepreneurial freedom.</p>\n<p>Tips for improving grant programs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eligibility clarity: Clear eligibility criteria and streamlined processes reduce wasted time for applicants.</li>\n<li>Community involvement: Programs that incorporate community feedback, such as Quadratic Funding rounds, can foster broader project support.</li>\n<li>Multiple program types: A pluralistic approach to funding (e.g., growth grants, builder grants, mission proposals) can cater to various ecosystem needs</li>\n<li>Growing the ETH Pie: Giveth diverse grant programs are running on multiple chains and ecosystems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evaluating the net value of grant programs to the ecosystem is more relevant than individual project outcomes. A tolerance for failures, especially with small grants, and highlights the importance of viewing programs in aggregate. Decentralized impact measurement can help to avoid bureaucracy, especially for smaller grants, advocating for metrics that reflect broader ecosystem health.</p>\n<p>Decentralized governance in grant programs is seen as difficult to implement efficiently. While decentralized decision-making can bring greater community participation, the complexity of ensuring effective, scalable governance remains a significant challenge.</p>\n<p>The primary issue lies in the misalignment of incentives within traditional grant structures. Grantees may only meet the minimum requirements for receiving funds, creating inefficiencies. However, the ecosystem as a whole, particularly the reliance on grants without long-term sustainability models, is a bigger problem. By enabling projects to create their own token economies, the incentive structure can shift toward long-term value creation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59401-h-2-program-effectiveness-31\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-h-2-program-effectiveness-31\"></a>2. Program Effectiveness</h2>\n<p>Evaluating a grant program effectiveness should, in theory, be coupled with the alignment with the ecosystem it is funded by and program’s objectives should be derived from it.</p>\n<p>Ideally the ecosystem has an overarching strategy already available during the inception of a grant program, but it is also true that grant programs are growth tools that can also shape the ecosystem’s strategy itself. We could assume there is a a certain degree of interdependency here, but usually this becomes a reality only after a couple of iterations of grant programs</p>\n<p>While we recognize that every grant program is different(in approach and objective), some are highly experimental, some are mature, some are more transparent, some more opaque etc, we believe that the only way to evaluate a grant programs effectiveness, in the decentralized context of web 3, is in a way that enables covering the whole spectrum of possibilities. Our recommendation is to consider a mix of the following approaches:</p>\n<p>a) Diverse metrics, outcomes and KPIs (Quantitative and qualitative)</p>\n<p>A comprehensive evaluation of a grant program’s effectiveness requires incorporating a broad range of metrics, both quantitative and qualitative. Utilizing multiple KPIs and clearly defined outcomes ensures a more holistic assessment. It is also true that limiting the evaluation to a only one set of metrics can ignore other aspects of the program and can also introduce vulnerabilities, particularly for ongoing programs, as it may fail to capture the full scope of impact and long-term sustainability. Allowing the community to co-propose part of these metrics would be a solution towards a more optimal pool of metrics.</p>\n<p>b) Prioritizing key accomplishments to reduce signal-to-noise ratio</p>\n<p>By isolating and emphasizing the most significant achievements of a grant program, stakeholders can better assess the program’s overall value. This approach allows for a clearer understanding of whether the program’s outcomes justify the allocated resources. A fundamental principle is that a grant program demonstrating multiple high-value successes may signal continued funding and support.</p>\n<p>c) Assessing program effectiveness relative to maturity</p>\n<p>As a grant program matures, the complexity and depth of its evaluations should increase accordingly. More mature programs should have more complex metrics and also undergo more sophisticated reviews to accurately assess their long-term effectiveness and sustainability, accounting for their growth and evolving impact over time. The implications of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Goodhart’s law</a> need to be considered when attempting to define the leading metrics of evaluating a grant program’s effectiveness, especially if the program is not at its first iteration.</p>\n<p>d) Independent audits by neutral third parties</p>\n<p>Given the capital-intensive nature of grant programs, neutral third-party audits, alongside ecosystem evaluations, are crucial to determining whether funds are being deployed efficiently and equitably. These audits help ensure that the distribution of resources aligns with the goals of fostering growth and inclusivity across the potential applicant pool.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of this study we have considered three main areas that cover the spectrum of the quantifiable information about a grant program in a large proportion, while also enabling a more direct and neutral approach of assessing a grant program’s effectiveness. The three aspects we will explore are: Alignment with ecosystem goals and strategic impact, Ecosystem growth, community development and sustainable impact, Innovation and value creation. Each section will contain metrics and formulas for how to assess these areas in a grant program. Milestone achievements are not covered in this study, but they are prerequisites.</p>\n<p>The metrics and formulas explored in detail in the sections below should be seen as one relevant subset of the total number of possible relevant metrics that can measure program effectiveness, the main goal being to both equip and inspire grant program managers and ecosystems with a more advanced and neutral set of formulas that can be used to determine a grant program’s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>It is important to mention this is an exploratory approach that attempts to evolve the current metrics and formulas used in the present, not exact science. The formulas presented below can be applied per grant and averaged per total number of grantees or per program. All the possible scoring options are not explored in the section below, but some formats are suggested.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59401-h-1-alignment-with-ecosystem-goals-and-strategic-impact-32\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-h-1-alignment-with-ecosystem-goals-and-strategic-impact-32\"></a>1.

After scoring, this subsheet can be used to retrospect on the program and used to create an action plan for improving the program.</p>\n<p>We caution against a “vanity” score which results in bias to score high despite a lower-level indicator score in actuality. To reduce bias, we recommend the scoring with the same indicator weights to be done by a few different stakeholders in the program including trusted grantees, operators, core team, and the community. Compare the scores and average the score, with analysis of the reasoning behind scoring.</p>\n<p>To improve the indicator scores, we recommend creating an action plan that tackles the root cause of the lower score.

Impact Metrics</h2>\n<p>Tackling impact and understanding and finalizing the right impact metrics is one of the toughest tasks a grant operator can undertake. No one has cracked the answer to this, but in this study we’ve attempted to tackle this in a holistic way. Solely relying on quantitative or qualitative data is going to lead to one-dimensional reporting and will be a very limited view on the impact of the program and on end-user beneficiaries (i.e. people and projects benefiting from the grantee’s work). A challenge with quantitative metrics is the ability to game metrics through measures that include sybil, bots, and fraud. A project that is aiming to tackle this is Impact Garden by Metrics Garden (Impact Garden’s mission is standardized data generation specifically for qualitative data.)</p>\n<p>A challenge with qualitative data is lack of reliability and lack of standards in collecting, reporting, and verifying this data.</p>\n<p>There is a further issue with vanity metrics, i.e. metrics that don’t serve any purpose other than to paint the program in a positive light, to give the illusion of progress or impact. This can be severely harmful to a program’s growth.</p>\n<p>With that said, below we’ve listed a comprehensive list of metrics in different categories and areas that can be useful to grant programs.</p>\n<p>We’d like to point out the need for a standard for metrics that can be used at large by all programs, that would allow for the best comparisons.</p>\n<p>Another important consideration is that grant programs can also have extremely positive sum side-effects (accomplishments) that are directly/indirectly created by the grant program which cannot be accurately quantified solely by impact metrics.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59401-layer-2s-blockchain-metrics-56\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-layer-2s-blockchain-metrics-56\"></a>Layer-2s

Integration, Refinement &amp; Implementation</h2>\n<p>Our proposition for integration with RFP1 is to solve for reputation and ranking from a grantee and grants program perspective. For example, tiered ranking where grantees who’ve received grants are given categorized questions, to give feedback on different components of the grants program.</p>\n<p>The feedback and answers can be used to score the program on a scale, and can be comparatively used keeping the Maturity Framework in mind.</p>\n<p>An example of this would be to have a survey with questions around resources given to grantees for e.g. marketing and amplification support, partnership support, and questions assessing the level of support. Conversely grant program managers can attempt to assess certain qualities of their grantees via surveys, proof of work or other feedback gathering mechanisms.</p>\n<p>This could comparatively be used for ranking grant programs across industries, on one index.</p>\n<p>Note: This section is not final as we are researching multiple implementation options.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59401-acknowledgments-63\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59401-acknowledgments-63\"></a>Acknowledgments</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We would like to extend our deepest gratitude to the following interviewees who’ve been graciously generous with their time and contributions to enhance the study.

If enacted, the proposal will publish a daoURI on the Arbitrum One network, creating a single source of truth for all the information about the DAO. No existing contracts will be modified and there will be no transfers of funds from the treasury.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59397-overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59397-overview-1\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>DAOs often have a large and growing amount of information surrounding them. This information is constantly changing as a result of the proposal process. Consequently, the information is often scattered and quickly becomes out-of-date as time goes on. <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4824\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-4824</a> has proposed a common standard to create a single source of truth for all information about a given DAO. This information will be on-chain and publicly verifiable, and shall contain the latest aggregation of all data about the DAO.</p>\n<p>The API standard proposed by EIP-4824 defines a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) called the <code>daoURI</code>. It contains a variety of information on the DAO as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">{\n    \"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n    \"type\": \"DAO\",\n    \"name\": \"&lt;name of the DAO&gt;\",\n    \"description\": \"&lt;description&gt;\",\n    \"membersURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n    \"proposalsURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n    \"activityLogURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n    \"governanceURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n    \"contractsURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This information is stored fully on-chain as a string in the JSON format as shown above. Any user can verify the information independently without relying on a third party to accurately report the latest information. Updates to this URI can be performed by permissioned actors after discussions with the community. Furthermore, community members can monitor event emissions for any changes to the URI, so any invalid or unauthorized changes can be easily identified.</p>\n<p>This URI contains references to other URIs which, in turn, contain information regarding DAO members, proposals, activity, governance, and the various contracts in the system. The format of these subcomponents follows a similar structure and is detailed below. Not all of the provided fields have to be used and some can be removed from the URI if they are not needed for a specific application.</p>\n<p>The URI can also hold arbitrary information beyond what has been shown above. For example, the standard can be extended by including links to specific proposal discussions or dashboards containing additional information about the DAO. These links can be stored on IPFS as well, thereby minimizing the centralization risk arising from a provider going offline.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59397-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59397-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The primary motivation for this proposal is to create a single source of truth for the Arbitrum DAO. Currently, the information about the DAO is scattered across multiple locations and is difficult to find for newcomers or casual participants. This information is also constantly growing and evolving, so any third-party collections of this data quickly become out of date. In addition, relying on third parties to organize and report information on the Arbitrum DAO introduces centralization risk that can result in censorship or misinformation. Changes to this reported information can also be difficult to track or contest when it is stored off-chain.</p>\n<p>By storing this information on-chain, a single, up-to-date source of truth is established. This cannot be altered by any third party and can be managed by existing governance with any changes transparently reported. This initiative will lower the barrier of entry to getting involved with the Arbitrum DAO for newcomers by organizing all of the relevant information in a single location. It will also increase accountability since the information is now freely available. Given that the information is stored and published in a single point, the overhead and maintenance efforts associated with publishing and consuming data will also be reduced. All in all, these changes are aligned with the community values of Arbitrum and make the DAO more open, accessible, and inclusive to participants.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59397-technical-details-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59397-technical-details-3\"></a>Technical Details</h3>\n<p>No changes have been proposed to existing contracts, nor has any additional spending been requested from the treasury. A new registration contract would be deployed by making a simple contract call to the EIP-4824 Registration Factory. This contact is currently deployed at <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x2dac5dbbf1d024c1e0d9c92d3aeda7618e15add7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x2Dac5DBbF1D024c1E0D9c92D3AeDa7618e15aDd7</a> and has previously been utilized by other DAOs such as <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/88514909609252335816460489315313822288366112768901791852399180053604763902892\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Unlock protocol</a>, <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/treasuregaming.eth/proposal/0x957349f6d60f07e95d6e426536996af96ca63f0b9e0495ee8e73554207cb2381\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Treasure</a>, and <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xc25a02d6520fd69ae98ef10b72f3024db2e710d00d51fbc7c03581710e0b8b7b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1inch</a>.</p>\n<p>The registration will be done on the Arbitrum One network instead of the Ethereum mainnet. Moreover, the DAO’s governor timelock will be set as the admin which is in charge of setting the trusted managers. The managers are the permissioned entities in charge of updating the URI, and these trusted parties can be determined by discussions with the community.  Beyond this contract deployment, the <code>daoURI</code> would need to be created. While a specific implementation has not yet been proposed, it is safe to assume that it would include a description of the DAO, a list of all DAO voters, a list of all proposals (with title, timestamp, status, and discussion links), a link to governance documents, a list of all contracts owned/managed by the DAO, as well as links to various dashboards containing protocol information. All the links will be stored on IPFS.  In order to have the <code>daoURI</code> always report the latest information, governance could fully manage it, in which case an on-chain vote would proceed for each upgrade. However, as this may not be feasible, the Arbitrum Foundation could serve as a trusted manager for all future upgrades. DAOstar can also commit to maintaining the <code>daoURI</code> for a year, given an additional cost.</p>\n<p>There are inherent trust assumptions behind this proposal as the managers are to be trusted to perform timely and accurate updates to the <code>daoURI</code>. This trust is important since the indexers rely on the data returned by the URI, and in case executable code is returned, the indexers could be tricked into running unrelated tasks. Given the nature of the <code>daoURI</code> for this specific application, the users will only be expecting a particular, fixed response from the URI. The detailed specification for the format and structure of the URI are shown below and the subcomponent URIs have also been included. Not all of the fields are necessary and extensions to this existing data can also be made if desired. The primary security concern pertains to the length of the stored URI. Given that the URI can grow to an arbitrary length, the number of storage slots necessary to read/write or update will continue to grow as time passes. Thus, the gas costs are technically unbounded, resulting in the operation failing if more gas is consumed than what is available within a block. One possible solution is to store each article on IPFS and save the corresponding hash on the blockchain.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"p-59397-daouri-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59397-daouri-4\"></a>daoURI</h5>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">{\n    \"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n    \"type\": \"DAO\",\n    \"name\": \"&lt;name of the DAO&gt;\",\n    \"description\": \"&lt;description&gt;\",\n    \"membersURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n    \"proposalsURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n    \"activityLogURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n    \"governanceURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n    \"contractsURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h5><a name=\"p-59397-membersuri-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59397-membersuri-5\"></a>membersURI</h5>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">{\n    \"@context\": \"https://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n    \"type\": \"DAO\",\n    \"members\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"&lt;CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier&gt;\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"&lt;CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier&gt;\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h5><a name=\"p-59397-proposalsuri-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59397-proposalsuri-6\"></a>proposalsURI</h5>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">{\n    \"@context\": \"https://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n    \"proposals\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"proposal\",\n            \"id\": \"&lt;proposal ID&gt;\",\n            \"name\": \"&lt;name or title of proposal&gt;\",\n            \"contentURI\": \"&lt;URI to content/text of the proposal&gt;\",\n            \"discussionURI\": \"&lt;URI to discussion or thread for the proposal&gt;\",\n            \"status\": \"&lt;status of proposal&gt;\",\n            \"calls\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"CallDataEVM\",\n                    \"operation\": \"&lt;call or delegate call&gt;\",\n                    \"from\": \"&lt;EthereumAddress&gt;\",\n                    \"to\": \"&lt;EthereumAddress&gt;\",\n                    \"value\": \"&lt;value&gt;\",\n                    \"data\": \"&lt;call data&gt;\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h5><a name=\"p-59397-activityloguri-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59397-activityloguri-7\"></a>activityLogURI</h5>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">{\n    \"@context\": \"https://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n    \"activities\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"&lt;activity ID&gt;\",\n            \"type\": \"activity\",\n            \"proposal\": {\n                \"type\": \"proposal\"\n                \"id\": \"&lt;proposal ID&gt;\",\n            },\n            \"member\": {\n                \"id\": \"&lt;CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier&gt;\"\n            }\n        } \n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h5><a name=\"p-59397-contractsuri-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59397-contractsuri-8\"></a>contractsURI</h5>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">{\n    \"@context\": \"https://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n    \"contracts\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"&lt;CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier&gt;\"\n            \"name\": \"&lt;name, e.g. Treasury&gt;\",\n            \"description\": \"&lt;description, e.g. Primary operating treasury for the DAO&gt;\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"&lt;CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier&gt;\"\n            \"name\": \"&lt;name, e.g. Governance Token&gt;\",\n            \"description\": \"&lt;description, e.g. ERC20 governance token contract&gt;\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"&lt;CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier&gt;\"\n            \"name\": \"&lt;name, e.g. Registration Contract&gt;\",\n            \"description\": \"&lt;description, e.g. ERC-4824 registration contract&gt;\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59397-conclusion-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59397-conclusion-9\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We found the DAO URI proposal to be a reasonable step towards greater alignment with the community values of Arbitrum. No existing functionality is modified and no additional spend is incurred from the treasury. Additionally, the proposal will organize all the relevant information around the DAO in a single location that can be reliably verified on-chain. This will lower the barrier of entry to getting involved with the Arbitrum DAO for newcomers and casual users, while also increasing accountability as more information about the DAO will be made freely available and accessible. An exact specification has not been proposed for the contents of the URI, though this can be determined through further discussions with the community. In addition to this, the trusted managers in charge of maintaining the URI can also be designated by community discussions at a later date.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-daouri-proposal-security-review/26938\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-daouri-proposal-security-review/26938","pubDate":"Wed, 25 Sep 2024 14:09:44 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26938"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-daouri-proposal-security-review/26938.rss","#text":"Arbitrum daoURI Proposal Security Review"}},{"title":"Hacken — Candidate for Security Council (September '24 Elections)","dc:creator":"vc.h","category":"Security Council Elections","description":"<p>Greetings, Arbitrum Forum crowd,</p>\n<p>Hacken is here, one of the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/announcement-whitelisted-providers-for-the-adpc-security-services-panel/26544\">Whitelisted Security Providers, Cohort I</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong><br>\nWe started running a blockchain CyberSecurity business in 2017, when smart contract audits were not ‘a thing’, leaving them aside as a primary requirement it is today.

In this report’s second half, the insights are used to assess the utility of DAO token swaps for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the Thank ARB Firestarters Program powered by Thrive Protocol, which made this research possible, and everyone who provided input for this report through calls or written contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>5 Point Summary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Token Swaps are ecosystem enablers allowing DAOs to form alliances, share upside and costs, align governance, and hedge exposure through treasury diversification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Every token swap consists of three acts: the pre-swap (exploration), the execution (ratification), and the post-swap (relationship management).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product integrations, high talent retention rates, healthy onchain treasuries on both sides, active utility of the tokens being swapped, and clearly defined milestones are the ingredients of successful token swaps. L2 blockchains swapping with dapps should have follow-on programs to make the most of token swap initiatives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After removing outliers, the value of executed token swaps considered for analysis was $89.2 million. 10 DAOs accounted for 81% of the value, with Olympus DAO executing the highest volume of swaps at 21.8%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO has an opportunity to engage with select grantees from LTIPP and STIP (111 possible candidates) through a 10 million ARB pilot program to gain insights on integrating token swaps as ecosystem enablers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mFBMftBvJbfPOkJMbZ_3ubNq0YA3TF5H/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">You can read the full report here ← </a></p>\n<p>The report also provides a foundation for our draft Pilot Proposal: Arbitrum Token Swap Program.

It was coined ‘Arbitrum’s Biggest Mini-Grant Series Ever’ with 32 winners, each winning 2500 ARB (equivalent of $5k at the time).</p>\n<p>Each week, contest applicants and winners were highlighted on social media, and winners were excited about their winnings and added to a TG group with the other winners. We were told by the program manager that this is where we would stay in touch for our payouts.</p>\n<p>Timeline and Sequence of Events<br>\nHere is what I could find on X about the contest on JokeRace (week 4): <a href=\"https://jokerace.io/contest/arbitrumone/0x9548b518c4103f13c6c3bb32af4a61d1ee14192c\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">arbitrumdao minigrants round 4</a></p>\n<p>February 7th<br>\nLooking back through dates in the Telegram group, as a week 3 winner I was added to the TG group as a winner on February 7th. On this same date, we were told that Diana, the program manager, had initiated the request for payouts to Arbitrum for all four of us week 3 winners.</p>\n<p>February 14th<br>\nDiana shares in the TG group that she has requested payouts from Arbitrum Foundation for week 1-4 winners.</p>\n<p>February 27th<br>\nDiana messages that 7 projects have been KYC approved and will receive their payouts.** to note: KYC statuses of people are being shared openly within a TG group of over 30 people. If they are failing and have not passed, this is also publicly shared.</p>\n<p>March 2nd<br>\nWinners inquire about their payout status, and Diana mentions that payouts from a week of winners can’t be paid out until all 4 winners KYC checks have been approved from the week. It is not clear the logic from Arbitrum why this would be.</p>\n<p>Diana mentions not to DM her as she has hundreds of DMs waiting for her to respond and asks us to message the whole group with our questions, and that she will respond after ETHDenver. I saw that one winner from my same week was paid out, but I wasnt, so I inquired about that because it wasnt clear based on the message she had shared, and then Diana responds she is not sure why either.</p>\n<p>Winners noticed that payouts were sent in this first batch to some winners within the grant council and/or Arbitrum partners.</p>\n<p>March 12th<br>\nA winner shares he is concerned about the upcoming ARB 70% token unlock, and delays in payout timing affecting the value of what he receives with likely impending ARB value drop.</p>\n<p>March 19th<br>\nConfusion and concern begin, with winners seeing daily messages about the status updates of all rounds, KYC checks, payout timings, needing the funds for development, and suggestions to post on the Arbitrum Forum for answers. Concerns arise about this being a scam contest, and people share they have been now waiting for over two months for payouts. Projects now begin sharing they wont be able to execute due to the large drop in ARB value.</p>\n<p>March 20th<br>\nMultiple winners including myself share we received 625 ARB, but not the full 2500 ARB. This is a one-time payout with no milestones, so there is no reason why winners should receive partial payouts, especially as other winners received 2500. Two people received 1875.</p>\n<p>March 28th<br>\nA winner asks for a status update from Diana on why they (and others) received 625 instead of 2500. Diana said she asked Arbitrum but it is not clear why.</p>\n<p>April 1st<br>\nWinners start trying to track down who the parties are involved in this grant, trying to message Plurality Labs on X but DMs are off. One winner posts (along with others questions about Arbitrum’s integrity and credibility):</p>\n<p>“With each passing day, I believe less and less in the Arbitrum project. Bureaucrats.” $ARBGhost</p>\n<p>Another message from a winner:</p>\n<p>“It’s common knowledge that Arbitrum’s dispersal times are slow, but this is on another level.”</p>\n<p>April 9th<br>\nDiana shares that by EOW, KYC checks for all winners should be done so then payouts can continue/complete.</p>\n<p>April 16th<br>\nMore winners receive payouts, but some share they received none or partial. One winner received 168 ARB.</p>\n<p>April 24th<br>\nOne winner inquires about her KYC check issue.</p>\n<p>May 14th<br>\nDiana shares Arbitrum has approved KYC checks for 8 more projects, but there are still 11 projects still waiting for approval. I was one of these, which is confusing as I also received a 625 ARB payout, but I guess even without KYC approval.</p>\n<p>May 17th<br>\n8 projects receive their payouts.</p>\n<p>May 31st<br>\nAfter 4 months of chaos, confusion, lack of communication, and disjointed/haphazard distribution of funds, I decided that I would try to take action by bringing together all the parties I was aware of involved in this grant process, from Arbitrum, to Plurality Labs/Thrive Protocol, to Fractal. I emailed and contacted the Arbitrum team, and wasn’t familiar with Plurality/Thrive Protocol, but found contacts there as well as the Fractal team I had messaged on Telegram. I initiated a TG group with these parties, and a few of the winners that were open to sharing their voices and experiences (multiple shared they were nervous about sharing their voices if it would cause problems with them receiving grants from the parties involved in the future).</p>\n<p>June 5th<br>\nThrive Protocol hosts JokeRace intervention calls with winners so we can voice our issues and finally be heard. We and others receive our payments, after a total or a four month delay.</p>\n<p>June 19th<br>\nThe remaining 11 winners are confirmed now paid (four months post-contest).</p>\n<p>In summary, these are the major points of concern:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Due to major delays on payout timings and resulting ARB value drop, multiple projects were not able to be executed and many half-executed, yet our X handles were leveraged as a part of ArbitrumDAO’s ‘Biggest Minigrants Round Ever’:</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"onebox twitterstatus\" data-onebox-src=\"https://x.com/ThankArbitrum/status/1754940584182284655?t=DpGJkAYreHE2G_R7J0ikDg&amp;s=19\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://x.com/ThankArbitrum/status/1754940584182284655?t=DpGJkAYreHE2G_R7J0ikDg&amp;s=19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">x.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/16beb7f56e4d98e84ae710cdae1e3dcd229ae72f.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"7A97AC\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n<h4><a href=\"https://x.com/ThankArbitrum/status/1754940584182284655?t=DpGJkAYreHE2G_R7J0ikDg&amp;s=19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Thank ARB (@ThankArbitrum) on X</a></h4>\n<div class=\"twitter-screen-name\"><a href=\"https://x.com/ThankArbitrum/status/1754940584182284655?t=DpGJkAYreHE2G_R7J0ikDg&amp;s=19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@ThankArbitrum</a></div>\n\n<div class=\"tweet\">\n  <span class=\"tweet-description\">@arbitrum We're 1 day into Round 4 of \"Our Biggest Minigrants Yet\" and have 4 solid applications so far in the \"Scaling DeFi for the Masses\" category\n\n@LocaleDao \n@arbitrumafrica \n@BitsaveProtocol \n@ReFiParamaribo</span>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"date\">\n  <a href=\"https://x.com/ThankArbitrum/status/1754940584182284655?t=DpGJkAYreHE2G_R7J0ikDg&amp;s=19\" class=\"timestamp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a>\n\n\n</div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our KYC statuses were shared publicly in a TG group with 35 people.

Therefore the plan for incentivizing the most productive and valuable yield bearing liquidity on Balancer will not be carried out using ARB going forward. Balancer’s core pool cycle will continue however, meaning fee redirection will incentivize veBAL holders to vote for high performing pools on Arbitrum as part of our continuous flywheel.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives:</strong> Balancer’s ARB incentive strategy aims to direct BAL tokens toward established gauges on Arbitrum, thereby boosting the most lucrative liquidity pools in terms of both returns and fees for liquidity providers. By leveraging Balancer’s core pool mechanisms along with the STIP Addendum boost settings, this approach seeks to create a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem for the most valuable asset classes on Arbitrum within Balancer. The goal is to optimize the capital efficiency of ARB incentives, benefiting both the Arbitrum ecosystem and the Balancer DAO. For a comprehensive overview of the incentive structure, please check our <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-balancer-stip-addendum/23288\">Addendum</a> post.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Balancer has formed several partner integrations that have enhanced the flow of ARB through our collaborating teams. This includes strong collaborations with Aave and Gyroscope, which enabled Gyroscope’s Rehype pools to tap into the yields from Aave’s lending markets, including GHO, resulting in increased net ARB for Balancer LPs. The Galaxe team has been able to leverage quests for Balancer and Arbitrum to draw in more new users and is concluding soon. This type of new engagement is invaluable to both of our ecosystems,</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sjx8CuUfwDGWnjdhUQfrG4sDATs.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Balancer x Galaxe Arbitrum Quests\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"Balancer x Galaxe Arbitrum Quests\" data-base62-sha1=\"sjx8CuUfwDGWnjdhUQfrG4sDATs\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"34383A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Check out the quest board <a href=\"https://app.galxe.com/quest/Balancer/GCskLtvDZi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The fight for the top interest bearing stablecoins and ETH derivatives has come to a conclusion in terms of the STIP but the BAL and AURA saga is far from over.</p>\n<p>Across this week we have seen a 13% decrease in daily average fees, TVL has stayed relatively flat, and we noticed a rotation of capital towards stablecoins with the only upward TVL metric of 4.6% in USD terms.</p>\n<p>The full distribution with quantities can be seen in this <a href=\"https://app.onchainden.com/safes/arb1:0xb6BfF54589f269E248f99D5956f1fDD5b014D50e/transactions/0xdd198b5380a6845e1813647374482eb6c286ceb9ad2463f48440bc6f1db565e3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">transaction</a> and will be repeated in one week to have the same ratio of rewards distributed for a full two week epoch.

Being a member of the security council would align with our team’s mission, having already been part of the zkSync security council and having worked for various stakeholders in the Arbitrum and greater Ethereum community. You can find further information about our application below:</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-59050-motivation-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59050-motivation-1\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>At Dedaub, our fundamental mission is to enhance the security and resilience of the Web3 ecosystem. We are committed to safeguarding decentralized platforms and building trust within the community. Joining the Arbitrum Security Council represents an opportunity for us to extend our positive impact by collaborating with like-minded professionals dedicated to safeguarding a major ecosystem. Our previous initiatives, such as being a founding member of the Security Alliance (<a href=\"https://securityalliance.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://securityalliance.org</a>), memberships in other security councils, and security vulnerability disclosures on 3rd party protocols such as Uniswap reflect our commitment to this cause.</p>\n<p>A secondary motivation is that we have a number of our partners (e.g. the Arbitrum DAO procurement committee) and clients such as GMX and Pendle rely on the security of the Arbitrum network, further aligning us with this role. Therefore, we believe that by contributing our expertise to the Arbitrum Security Council, we can help fortify the platform, ensuring a safer environment for its users and stakeholders.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-59050-relevant-experience-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59050-relevant-experience-2\"></a>Relevant Experience</h1>\n<p>Dedaub brings a wealth of experience in blockchain security and smart contract auditing. Our team has conducted security audits and security impact studies for the Ethereum Foundation, ensuring the Ethereum ecosystem evolves in a secure manner. Additionally, we are a member of the security council for zkSync, which presents similar challenges to being a security council member on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Our experience extends to auditing important projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem, such as GMX. We have also actively participated in high-stakes bug bounty programs and emergency response scenarios. One such example is our security disclosure on the Multichain bridge, whereby we helped move $1B in various tokens that were immediately at risk. There are many other examples of ecosystem threats whereby the Dedaub team was roped in to help in a war room scenario. Experiences like this demonstrate our ability to perform under pressure and deliver effective solutions.</p>\n<p>Being a founding member of the Security Alliance underscores our collaborative approach to industry-wide security challenges. Additionally, our role as a security advisor to the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) has allowed us to influence procurement strategies with a security-first mindset. This diverse experience equips us with the insights and skills necessary to contribute meaningfully to the Arbitrum Security Council.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-59050-other-legal-considerations-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59050-other-legal-considerations-3\"></a>Other Legal Considerations</h1>\n<p>Dedaub is Domiciled and Resident in Malta, a crypto-friendly jurisdiction.

The change only involves a modification of an existing configuration parameter and does not introduce any new functionality.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-overview-2\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has a governance process whereby the community can vote on proposals fully on-chain. Two distinct kinds of proposals can be passed: those that spend funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s ETH treasury and those that perform upgrades to the contracts governing the system. In either case, there is currently a 3-day delay between the time a proposal has passed and when it is executed. While the same delay applies for both types of proposal, the former is governed by the L2 Treasury Time Lock while the latter is governed by the L2 Core Time Lock. As such, the delays for each proposal type are independent and any changes made to one will not necessarily impact the other.</p>\n<p>While these delays are in place, the Security Council can always step in to stop malicious proposals. However, the delay gives the Security Council the time to act in the event that a malicious proposal is indeed passed. In addition, it provides users the opportunity to withdraw their assets in the event that they are dissatisfied with the changes that would result from a proposal. The proposal would increase the delay applied to the L2 Core Time Lock from 3 days to 8 days. All proposals regarding spending funds from the ArbitrumDAO ETH treasury would still maintain a delay of 3 days. Only constitutional proposals related to smart contract upgrades would be affected.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The primary motivation for this change is to increase the aforementioned security benefits. Namely, an increased delay will give the Security Council more time to review and stop malicious proposals (which is already a technical and lengthy process), while also providing users more time to make an informed decision. Furthermore, the proposal mentions a <a href=\"https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">framework developed by L2BEAT</a> as part of the motivation behind it. More specifically, it will change the color of <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum’s ‘Exit Window’ slice</a> on <a href=\"https://gov.l2beat.com/t/the-risk-rosette-framework/292\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2BEAT’s Risk Rosette</a> from red to yellow.</p>\n<p>By only increasing the delay on the L2 Core Time Lock, a compromise is achieved between security and speed. Since constitutional proposals are much more complex in nature, the Security Council requires more time to review these proposals than those directed towards the treasury. This timelock delay increase would provide the necessary time to review these potentially complex proposals while the traditional proposals regarding treasury spending adhere to the existing process. The downside of increasing this delay is that constitutional proposals will now take an extra 5 days to execute. No additional costs or security risks are introduced to the system as the proposed changes only modify one configuration parameter.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-technical-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-technical-details-4\"></a>Technical Details</h3>\n<p>No new functionality needs to be introduced for this change. The value of the existing <code>_minDelay</code> parameter would be changed from 259200 to 691200 in the <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0#readProxyContract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2 Timelock</a> contract. Note that the units of this parameter are in seconds, so the change is from 3 days to 8 days as explained earlier. The <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">action contract</a> has already been implemented and is pending an audit. It consists of a <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306/files#diff-aa7423831f93d30e4ebfa2052f0b1e3a90b2d90cd1e76ee2d074d47c6b17a82c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">contract</a> that has a function called <code>perform</code> which:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Calls the <code>L2AddressRegistry</code> contract deployed on Arbitrum at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x56C4E9Eb6c63aCDD19AeC2b1a00e4f0d7aBda9d3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x56C4E9Eb6c63aCDD19AeC2b1a00e4f0d7aBda9d3</a> to get the value of the <code>coreGovTimelock</code> state variable. Currently, the value of this variable is the address of the contract deployed at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0</a>.</li>\n<li>Calls the <code>updateDelay()</code> function of the stored <code>coreGovTimelock</code> contract with the new value of <code>86400 * 8</code>. Note that 86400 is 24 hours in seconds, so this would effectively update the delay to 8 days as described. This function, in turn, sets the <code>_arbMinDelay</code> to this new value and emits an event. No other changes occur.\n<ul>\n<li>Using the same <code>coreGovTimelock</code> contract, the <code>getMinDelay()</code> function is called to ensure that the new value of <code>_arbMinDelay</code> reflects the proposed change.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Calls the <code>L2Registry</code> contract once again, this time retrieving the value of the <code>arbitrumDAOConstitution</code> state variable. Currently, the value of this variable is the address of the contract deployed at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1D62fFeB72e4c360CcBbacf7c965153b00260417\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x1D62fFeB72e4c360CcBbacf7c965153b00260417</a>.</li>\n<li>Calls the <code>setConstitutionHash</code> function with the new value of <code>0x28faf2acba9b3ff80ec484e3d5646931eeef40568b1b7c38dbe52b890bfd7938</code>. This reflects the changes made to the constitution text which are discussed further below. This function, in turn, sets the <code>constitutionHash</code> state variable and emits an event. No other changes occur.\n<ul>\n<li>Using the same <code>arbitrumDAOConstitution</code> contract, the <code>constitutionHash()</code> getter for this state variable is called to ensure that the new value of <code>constitutionHash</code> reflects this change.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <code>CoreGovTimelockUpdateDelayEightDayAction</code> contract already seems to have been deployed on the Arbitrum network at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5B947D8bF197467be7ef381b7cAfEE0A7B35737A#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x5B947D8bF197467be7ef381b7cAfEE0A7B35737A</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">current constitution</a> of the Arbitrum DAO has been modified with the following changes:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"diff\"><code class=\"lang-diff\">- Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, a 3 day waiting period occurs. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.\n+ Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 or 8 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, there is a 3 day waiting period for actions related to the DAO Treasury and an 8 day waiting period for an L2-to-L1 Message. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.\n\n- Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the 3 day waiting period in Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.\n+ Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the waiting period for Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.\n</code></pre>\n<p>A <code>keccak256</code> hash of the full constitution text was used to generate the value mentioned above. Based on independent review from the ARDC, these changes have been verified to produce the same hash as mentioned by the team. This can be verified by following the same <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#constitution-hash\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">instructions for generating the hash</a> as outlined by the team, with the new changes to the constitution reflected. Note that the <code>CoreGovTimelockUpdateDelayEightDayAction</code> contract has not been directly audited and any calls are not guaranteed to succeed. However, the functionality would only execute if the changes are successfully performed. In addition, no other changes are proposed beyond those explicitly mentioned in the proposal.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We found the timelock delay increase proposal to be a reasonable compromise between increased security and maintaining the existing benefits of speedy treasury proposals. This will enable Arbitrum to transition into a more mature rollup that operates independently of any centralized actors, as outlined by the L2BEAT framework. Moreover, the proposal provides added security to reduce the possibility of malicious contract upgrades being executed, while also increasing the amount of time a user has to act on a proposal. The changes described in the proposal have been verified and exactly match those that are currently pending execution on-chain.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-l2-time-lock-delay-proposal-security-review/26837\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-l2-time-lock-delay-proposal-security-review/26837","pubDate":"Wed, 18 Sep 2024 10:11:54 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26837"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-l2-time-lock-delay-proposal-security-review/26837.rss","#text":"Arbitrum L2 Time Lock Delay Proposal Security Review"}}]}}}
