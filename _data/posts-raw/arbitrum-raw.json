This post drafted by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/sid_areta\">@sid_areta</a>  and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/thedevanshmehta\">@thedevanshmehta</a> lays out the next steps for its continuation.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>With the successful conclusion of the first edition of the STEP program, we are planning to form a Steering Committee to take this initiative forward and outline Arbitrum’s broader RWA strategy. Our goal is to ensure at least 1% diversification of ArbitrumDAO’s treasury into RWAs every year for 5 years, cementing Arbitrum’s position as the leading RWA chain. The predictability of STEP diversification occurring each year is important for influencing RWA projects to build on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, the Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP) <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">diversified</a> $30M worth of ARB into stable, liquid real-world assets (RWAs) to generate yield, diversify our treasury, and grow the RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum. A comprehensive RFP process was undertaken, where the DAO received 33 applications from RWA issuers, of which 16 were shortlisted and 6 were finally selected for allocations: Securitize BUIDL ($9.57 million), Ondo USDY ($5.22 million), Superstate USTB ($5.22 million), Mountain USDM ($3.48 million), OpenEden TBill (3.48 million), and Backed Finance bIB01 ($3.48 million). These allocations help us diversify the treasury into dollar denominated assets, get selected providers onto Arbitrum and are expected to generate yield of roughly $1-1.5 million per year.</p>\n<p><strong>Formation of the Steering Committee</strong></p>\n<p>The initial leads forming the Steering Committee are Sid from Areta and Devansh from the Treasury and Sustainability (T&amp;S) Working Group. We are also receiving support from RWA expert and former STEP committee member Paper Imperium from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/gfxlabs\">@GFXlabs</a> in finding other suitable members for the steering committee. Since RWAs are a nuanced, subject-matter heavy topic that require specific expertise, it is our current working hypothesis that the Steering Committee will require members with the following backgrounds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RWA Issuers</li>\n<li>Treasury Managers</li>\n<li>Crypto-Native Funds (i.e., funds that would buy RWAs and deploy them in yield-generating strategies)</li>\n<li>Crypto-Native Financial Advisors</li>\n<li>Legal Firms</li>\n<li>RWA Infrastructure</li>\n<li>CFA, CPA and tradfi knowledge of deep capital markets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to staffing the Steering Committee with members, Arbitrum delegates and stakeholders with an interest in the future of RWAs on Arbitrum can play a role as advisors.</p>\n<p><strong>Role of the Steering Committee</strong></p>\n<p><em>Identification of Topics to Research for STEP II &amp; Definition of Broader Arbitrum RWA Strategy</em></p>\n<p>The first and primary aim of the Steering Committee is to (i) incorporate feedback and learnings from the first STEP program and (ii) define future STEP programs and Arbitrum’s wider RWA strategy.</p>\n<p>As our working hypothesis, we believe that we will need to work on some of the following topics (not exhaustive) that will feed into the definition of future STEP programs and Arbitrum’s wider RWA strategy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ARB liquidation strategy in STEP such as limit orders and price target determination</li>\n<li>Asset types to include as part of diversification and rationale for the same</li>\n<li>Methods of productively deploying purchased STEP assets through identifying use cases for RWAs across DeFi (i.e., making assets productive after investing in them)</li>\n<li>Assess priority of the STEP program for Arbitrum in terms of RWA ecosystem growth vs treasury diversification, yield generation and principal protection</li>\n<li>Define targets for aggregate treasury diversification and yield brought in from RWAs</li>\n<li>Propose split between existing and new allocations to service providers, target number of service providers to select in the program</li>\n<li>Comprehensive proposal for STEP II and future iterations of the program</li>\n<li>Identifying challenges faced by existing protocols on Arbitrum in integrating RWAs and defining a plan to mitigate the challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Steering Committee will be responsible for identifying the specific topics to tackle from the above list (and beyond) and identifying the appropriate individuals to work on these topics. Based on the findings from the chosen topics, we will deliver the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Comprehensive proposal for STEP II;</li>\n<li>Definition of and (high-level and flexible) plan for future STEP programs;</li>\n<li>Definition of Arbitrum’s RWA Strategy, including both treasury diversification and ecosystem growth initiatives.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Selection of the STEP Committee</em></p>\n<p>In the first iteration of the STEP program, the STEP Committee that selected the STEP fund recipients consisted of the following members: Karpatkey, GFX Labs, Steakhouse Financial, Nethermind, and Northlakes Legal, alongside the T&amp;S Working Group led by Devansh. For the second iteration of STEP, the Steering Committee will be responsible for staffing the STEP Committee.</p>\n<p>Please note that the STEP Committee will likely also contain Steering Committee members (i.e., some members of the Steering Committee may also be part of the STEP Committee). Where additional expertise is required for the STEP Committee (e.g., technical expertise, legal expertise), the Steering Committee will be responsible for identifying and procuring that expertise.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/fdcb92c0c866a78f29de9df4282536ef18d7cdad.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/AdaX83zEUsiJm08V0K9talbaOWp.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/fdcb92c0c866a78f29de9df4282536ef18d7cdad.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"AdaX83zEUsiJm08V0K9talbaOWp\" width=\"624\" height=\"484\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"151C19\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>\n<p>We do not intend to request a budget for the formation and operation of the Steering Committee and, accordingly, the participation as a member or advisor will not be remunerated at this point of time.

As such, similar to the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/start-of-arbitrum-m-a-working-group/22520\">M&amp;A Working Group</a> model run by Areta, we will have bi-weekly meetings where we will keep the community abreast of our progress and incorporate their feedback.

The RWAIG is complementary to STEP and is squarely aimed at exploring and growing RWA areas outside of the STEP program on Arbitrum. The RWAIG aims at enabling ecosystem growth for RWAs on Arbitrum while STEP is aimed at treasury diversification for Arbitrum DAO by means of investment into RWAs.</p>\n<p>Once the RWAIG ends, any plans for its extension will be in alignment with the Steering Committee since one of the intended goals of the Steering Committee is to define Arbitrum’s broader RWA strategy.</p>\n<p>The Treasury and Sustainability Working Group has got renewed Firestarter funding from <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/21881347407562908848280051025758535553780110598432331587570488445729767071232\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Thrivecoin / Plurality Labs</a>.

The proposal outlines various options, ranging from maintaining the status quo to enforcing strict self-voting policies. A Snapshot vote to gauge the DAO’s sentiment will be posted on Thursday, August 15th. Please note, this is an <strong>actual temperature check</strong>, just to gauge the DAO’s opinion on the subject. Based on the results, certain policies may be included in a future delegate of code of conduct as part of an effort to professionalize the DAO’s operations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-55715-background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55715-background-2\"></a>Background</h2>\n<p>Strict policies regarding conflicts of interest (COI) and self-dealing are standard practices in traditional corporate industries. However, with crypto just now emerging from an early stage, entirely avoiding conflict of interests is challenging. Many individuals are either investors, employees, or contributors across multiple companies/protocols on not only Arbitrum, but other L1/L2 chains.</p>\n<p>Several other DAOs have established a code of conduct in an attempt to address these issues. Examples range from being opt-in recommendations (<a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-delegate-code-of-conduct/20913\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap</a>), simple pledges (<a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Maker</a>, <a href=\"https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/code-of-conduct\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-delegate-code-of-conduct/12981\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aave</a>), and strict no self-dealing policies &amp; expectations enforced by a council and violations resulting in suspension from the DAO’s platforms (Optimism: <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Code of Conduct Committee</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimist Expectations</a>).</p>\n<p>While Arbitrum has standard <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807\">rules of engagement</a> for the forums, it currently lacks a delegate code of conduct in addition to an official policy on conflicts of interest. The only mention of the term in the Arbitrum <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Constitution</a> is in relation to candidate eligibility for the Security Council.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/39445c8484609014f56b292b10ae79603d0403a8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8aBG7JYDsZygXYbHIOiOztyJFWw.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/39445c8484609014f56b292b10ae79603d0403a8.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"8aBG7JYDsZygXYbHIOiOztyJFWw\" width=\"624\" height=\"83\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"E8E8E8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Creating a self-voting policy was first <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/self-voting-policy-discussion-arbitrumdao-constitution/20886/8\">raised</a> by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer\">@Immutablelawyer</a> at the beginning of 2024 following the LTIPP council elections. While the post resulted in a good discussion, many delegates at the time indicated a strong preference to not move forward with any policy that restricted a delegate’s ability to vote. Thus a temperature check to gather the larger DAO’s sentiment on this issue never occurred.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, the topic has reemerged in conversations, and as part of a series of proposals focusing on professionalizing the Arbitrum DAO’s operations, Entropy Advisors is looking to restart the conversation on a proposed self-voting and COI policy in order to reach a definite consensus. Policies that are voted are favored by the DAO will be included in a future delegate code of conduct proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-55715-rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55715-rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>We would argue that within a DAO’s operations, the majority of instances involving COI are the result of an individual/company using their delegated voting power to engage in self-voting or “self-enrichment”. This can exist when a delegate votes for themselves to get elected to a committee, thereby receiving financial gain, or a delegate votes in favor of a proposal that directly benefits themselves or their company. There are certainly other situations where COI can arise such as oversight, but for the purposes of this proposal, the focus is centered on the practice of self-voting.</p>\n<p>For clarity and the purposes of this conversation we will lean on the definitions that <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer\">@Immutablelawyer</a> established back when the topic of self-voting was previously <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/self-voting-policy-discussion-arbitrumdao-constitution/20886\">discussed</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conflicts of Interest:</strong> A situation where a token-holder or their close-associates stand to directly benefit from the outcome of a proposal.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-Voting:</strong> The practice of where token holders use their voting power to vote on proposals that involve or benefit themselves.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-Enrichment (Self-Dealing):</strong> The act of increasing or enhancing one’s own personal financial wealth as a result of one’s own vote.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As mentioned above, the majority of comments indicated that it was unwise to restrict a delegate’s ability to vote in any manner. To paraphrase the discussion, hesitation to implement a self-voting policy boiled down to primarily two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Philosophical Objections:</strong> Delegates are entrusted by token holders to best represent their own values and interests. Forcing a delegate to abstain from a vote due to COI concerns prevents the delegate from truly representing their base’s interests and thus disenfranchises the token holders delegating.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Enforceability:</strong> Even if self-voting was monitored manually by contributors or a committee, it is quite easy to circumvent self-voting policies onchain by simply transferring voting power to anonymous wallets. To quote <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/disruptionjoe\">@DisruptionJoe</a>, in general, “unenforceable rules create situations where bad actors have an advantage over good actors’'.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While both are strong objections, there are positives to implementing COI and self-voting policies. First, they help establish the “rules of the game”, so that every participant in Arbitrum governance is operating under the same set of expectations. Furthermore, disclosure requirements can help lead to greater transparency while also incentivizing participants to act in an ethical manner. Most importantly, with such policies standard practice in other industries, Arbitrum DAO can improve its image as a professional organization by holding its actors to similar standards.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-55715-specifications-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55715-specifications-4\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>Below are a few policy options the DAO can adopt to help address and mitigate COI and self-voting. The options are presented from least restrictive (do nothing) to what we view as the most restrictive.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep the Status Quo:</strong> Arbitrum DAO can continue to operate as it has been. A delegate code of conduct does not need to include specific policies on disclosure or self-voting.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure and Transparency Policy:</strong> If a potential COI exists, it is expected that proposal authors or delegates disclose the nature and extent of the interest. While it may not always be clear if an individual stands to gain “directly” or “indirectly”, it is recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency. Delegates are not expected to abstain or alter their voting preferences in any way, but are free to choose to abstain.</p>\n<p><strong>“Responsible Voting” Policy in Elections:</strong> In an election with multiple seats, candidates may vote for themselves as long as they also cast votes to fill the remaining positions. Put more simply, a candidate should not cast a vote solely for themselves in an election.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Example: I am running in the GCP council election, which has 3 open seats. I can vote for my own candidacy, but must also cast 2 additional votes for other candidates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a policy that has worked well in other DAOs and helps address the natural incentive to withhold votes for competing candidates in an election while also making sure token-holders are not disenfranchised.</p>\n<p>Credit to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo\">@JoJo</a> for the term “Responsible Voting”.</p>\n<p><strong>Strict Self-Voting Policy:</strong> In the event of a conflict of interest, under the simple definitions stated in the Rationale above, it is expected that a delegate or proposal author abstains during the voting process. This would include candidates being prevented from self-voting in elections and delegates from voting on proposals that directly benefit oneself, company, or interests.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-55715-enforcement-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55715-enforcement-5\"></a>Enforcement</h3>\n<p>To date, the primary deterrent to egregious breaches of an adopted code of conduct is the potential for reputational damage. Other DAOs have experimented with various enforcement mechanisms in regards to upholding a COI or self-voting policy. One of the best examples is Optimism DAO, which created a delegate code of conduct in 2021 with enforcement carried out by its foundation. In its Season 5 (September, 2023), Optimism created a Code of Conduct Council that took over responsibility for overseeing and enforcing breaches. However, recently this council has been <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">scaled back</a> and its Token House self-dealing policies have returned to being enforced “via the free market for delegation.”</p>\n<p>This journey highlights the difficulty of enforcing any type of self-voting policies and the likely ineffectiveness of simply creating another committee to provide oversight. To our knowledge, no major DAO has taken the steps to actually bar an individual from voting at the contract level (not that this is recommended). Enforcement is an area in which Entropy is actively <strong>seeking input</strong> and encouraging delegates to share opinions and ideas.</p>\n<p>Currently, our team is leaning towards making the future delegate code of conduct <strong>opt-in</strong>, following in Uniswap DAO’s footsteps by creating a document that serves simply as a form of guidance. We envision soft-enforcement can be applied through the Delegate Incentive Program by requiring participating delegates to abide by the ratified code of conduct in order to be eligible for rewards. Further UI changes on Tally could also be applied to help token holders discover which delegates have publicly committed to following the agreed upon code of conduct.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-55715-voting-choices-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55715-voting-choices-6\"></a>Voting Choices</h3>\n<p>The temperature check on Snapshot will use <a href=\"https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">approval voting</a>. Each delegate can select any number of choices, each selected choice will receive equal voting power. So for example, if a delegate wishes to see the DAO adopt both a disclosure policy and responsible voting, then they should select both options on the Snapshot vote.</p>\n<p>Since this is a proposal that changes the DAO’s current status quo, the following choices have been worded in a manner that each “FOR” vote indicates desire to adopt a certain policy.</p>\n<p><strong>FOR: Disclosure Policy</strong><br>\n<strong>FOR: Responsible Voting Policy</strong><br>\n<strong>FOR: Strict Self-Voting Policy</strong><br>\n<strong>AGAINST: Maintain Status Quo</strong><br>\n<strong>ABSTAIN</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-55715-timeline-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55715-timeline-7\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<p>A Snapshot poll will be posted on <strong>August 15th</strong> to gauge the DAO’s overall sentiment. This will allow for ample conversation and input from delegates beforehand.</p>\n<p>This proposal is part of a series of temperature checks to further improve and professionalize the DAO’s operations. Others include the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/improving-predictability-in-arbitrum-dao-s-operations/25136\">Improving Predictability</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-default-to-using-shielded-voting-for-snapshot-votes/25884\">Adopting Shielded Voting</a> proposals. Depending on the outcome of this vote, COI and self dealing policies will be included in a delegate code of conduct. As mentioned <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-default-to-using-shielded-voting-for-snapshot-votes/25884\">previously</a>, a future, more comprehensive proposal will look to combine all of the DAO’s new processes into a trial period, with the successful ideas eventually implemented into the Constitution.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-55715-cost-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55715-cost-8\"></a>Cost</h2>\n<p>This proposal carries no cost to the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts -

A significant amount of ARB has been unlocked over the past few months, resulting in a YTD performance of approximately -50%. In today’s landscape, investors expect to see some form of value accrual – whether it is direct (revenue share) or indirect (buyback and burn).</p>\n<p>L1 PoS chains have a fairly simple path to value accrual – nodes stake tokens and validate blocks on the chain, and in return receive block rewards and transaction fees from user actions. L2s are extensions of L1s, and thus cannot implement the exact same value accrual mechanisms. For L2s, the most clear-cut revenue generation path is via sequencer fees i.e. the delta between the cost of running the sequencer + cost of posting data to L1, and transaction fees collected from L2 users. This proposal seeks to use this sequencer revenue to create financial value for ARB – admirably, with the express goal of improving voter turnout in the Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<p>A lack of financial value, and the perception of being “just another governance token” plagues all L2s today. This would likely be the first instance of an L2 attempting to bake revenue sharing into the native L2 token.</p>\n<p>While on the whole a thoughtful proposal, we believe there is nuance to this argument – and thus, there are considerations for delegates to take into account here.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-55661-understanding-the-sequencer-figures-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55661-understanding-the-sequencer-figures-2\"></a>Understanding the Sequencer Figures</h2>\n<p>Pre-Dencun, L2s like Arbitrum enjoyed high on-chain profits from sequencer operations. Note that we are only able to consider on-chain costs (posting data to L1) and not off-chain costs (compute to operate the sequencer). But things have fallen off considerably in a post-Dencun Ethereum.</p>\n<p>In the 30 days before the Dencun upgrade, the Arbitrum sequencer’s on-chain net profit was 835 ETH. In the 30 days after, that figure fell to 588 ETH – still a significant figure, but a 30% drop.

Even though fee collections on that front are not significant today, there does seem to be a strong BD push to attract more builders to spin up their own Orbit L3s. Between existing Orbit chains like Sanko Gamecorp and Xai, to initiatives like the Gaming Catalyst Program whose KPIs include overseeing the creation of new Orbit chains, there is scope for Arbitrum-native revenue generation stemming from here.</p>\n<p>We recognize that initiatives around Orbit chains are still in their infancy, but this is a conversation worth having as sequencer revenue plateaus at a lower run-rate than what was set in 2023.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-55661-impact-assessment-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55661-impact-assessment-3\"></a>Impact Assessment</h2>\n<p><strong>Delegate Incentive Program</strong></p>\n<p>Trying to evaluate the impact of a program that hasn’t been piloted or implemented yet is a difficult task that yields speculative results. The proposed staking program’s main goal is improving voter turnout in Arbitrum and getting a larger share of circulating supply to delegate their ARB.</p>\n<p>The Delegate Incentive Program by SEEDGov provides us some basis for where to start, having been implemented with the same end-goal of improving governance participation. SEEDGov published their <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives/25671\">analysis</a> of the Delegate Incentive Program. You can read the entire analysis here, but to summarize:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delegate participation rate improved by 12% on Tally and 13% on Snapshot compared to three months prior. Tally votes tend to be more important as they are binding and execute protocol upgrades.</li>\n<li>Total participating voter power decreased by 10M ARB compared to the previous year.</li>\n<li>The DAO must be cautious of increasing quorum requirements as ARB circulating increases. More ARB will be required to pass quorum as unlocks steepen, necessitating measures to incentivize more delegation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The incentive program shows that there is an appetite to participate with more fervor when there is money on the table. The maximum incentive applicable is roughly 5,000 ARB per month per delegate, which at current prices ($0.70 per ARB) is about $3500. However, one should note that participating entities are the largest delegates in the Arbitrum DAO and not smaller fry. The program required delegates to have 50k+ of ARB voting power and a 60%+ total participation rate for eligibility. Over 97% of all ARB voting power is with delegates/voters in this cohort.</p>\n<p>Of course, it’s not entirely apples to apples. A staking program with intrinsic delegation would be an incentive for non-participating ARB holders to allow their tokens to be used in governance. The Delegate Incentive program stands to encourage existing delegates to be more active; this proposal tries to get ARB on the sidelines to enter the arena.</p>\n<p>However, a staking program where a commission model is implemented could hit 2 birds with one stone. For example, if 5-10% of total yield went to delegates and the remaining 90-95% went to delegators, this could act as a more organic form of the delegate incentive program – and one that is open to delegates of all sizes.</p>\n<p>All in all, the staking proposal and Delegate Incentive program are synergistic and attempt to reach a similar end-goal by targeting different holder cohorts.</p>\n<p><strong>Compound Governance Attack</strong></p>\n<p>Just this week, Compound Finance fell prey to a governance attack orchestrated by Humpy and the Golden Boys. The <a href=\"https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/289\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposal</a> sought 499k COMP – or 5% of the DAO treasury – that the Compound DAO would allegedly still own, but would be deployed to the Golden Boys’ goldCOMP product and could potentially be used to vote in the Golden Boys’ interest. This would have given Humpy and the Golden Boys control over a large majority of delegated tokens.</p>\n<p>There was a lot of outrage over this, but the proposal was ultimately canceled after reaching an agreement. Ironically, the <a href=\"https://x.com/0xngmi/status/1818061316713759136\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">agreement</a> was for COMP to become a value accretive asset. Compound’s Growth Program has agreed to build out a staking program that rewards holders with 30% of market reserves (DAO’s portion of interest generated for protocol reserves) in exchange for Humpy canceling their proposal.</p>\n<p>The incident raised concerns over governance apathy and a lack of stakeholder alignment in DAOs – something that is very relevant to the ARB staking discussion. It’s now clear that governance apathy can have a serious detrimental effect for DAOs. Compounds’ proposal 289, which is Humpy’s initial proposal, saw a total of 42 addresses vote; 23 for and 19 against.</p>\n<p>Approximately 1.315m COMP was used to vote on the proposal, representing about 13% of total supply or 16% of circulating supply (per CoinGecko). A total of 2.64m COMP has been delegated per Tally as of the time of writing. This number likely reflects a significant increase in the aftermath of prop 289.</p>\n<p>13% of total supply voting is not a bad turnout per crypto governance standards in DeFi. However, there were many larger delegates who didn’t vote – which is the real issue here.</p>\n<p>One reason some of the larger delegates did not vote is because Humpy spread out their total tokens across a number of addresses. The tokens were used to vote and achieve quorum at the last minute, which minimized the DAO’s ability to launch a counter. However, if these delegates were still active and voted no, Humpy would not have been able to get the proposal passed.</p>\n<p>Efforts to incentivize delegates to be more active definitely look like the need of the hour. And growing the delegation pie is also important, which is why pairing delegate incentives with “delegation incentives” (for ARB holders that are inactive in governance) seems sound.</p>\n<p><strong>The ENS Solution</strong></p>\n<p>In April 2024, researchers that are part of the ENS DAO identified governance attack vectors similar to the one carried out against Compound. Their <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">mitigation response</a> included setting up a new delegate that could only vote “no” on governance proposals. This delegate address is backed by ENS tokens owned by ENS Labs and affiliated people.</p>\n<p>It’s a simple solution to the problem – use tokens in the DAO treasury only to ensure malicious proposals are stopped in their tracks. However, this does not address larger issues around governance tokens. Such as the apathy around the entire process and finding a long-term solution to grow a stimulated community base that is active in protocol governance.</p>\n<p>The veto delegate could also take decisions that are subjective, in the case of contentious proposals that some may consider malicious and some may consider genuine. How do you objectively ascertain malicious intent or DAO detriment before casting a vote? The ENS veto delegate was set up to be controlled by a multi-sig of at least two people, which makes it prone to bias. While currently the veto delegate has 3.99m ENS of voting power, the plan is to build a more robust system where the DAO’s entire 10m ENS can be put to use in governance.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/700b2b7b8e2432a1d4a49902bc5893645a2057bd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fZbpijYk3FMFpZ6Izb1d5sRGpFH.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 12.58.46 PM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/700b2b7b8e2432a1d4a49902bc5893645a2057bd_2_690x316.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 12.58.46 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"fZbpijYk3FMFpZ6Izb1d5sRGpFH\" width=\"690\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/700b2b7b8e2432a1d4a49902bc5893645a2057bd_2_690x316.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/700b2b7b8e2432a1d4a49902bc5893645a2057bd.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/700b2b7b8e2432a1d4a49902bc5893645a2057bd.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F6F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>If there is significant concern over something similar happening with Arbitrum, the DAO should consider the viability of implementing something similar to provide near-term relief from the idea of a governance-based treasury raid.</p>\n<p><strong>Constitutional Provisions</strong></p>\n<p>One thing to note is that the existence of the Security Council, and the rights conferred to the council by the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Constitution</a>, can also prevent meaningful governance exploits.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/44a531f036c708790232bb606650cc892e7f3b3f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9NgoBim8qZKhoJAmxdoMj2Qibsr.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-08-01 at 7.15.10 PM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/44a531f036c708790232bb606650cc892e7f3b3f_2_690x181.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-01 at 7.15.10 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"9NgoBim8qZKhoJAmxdoMj2Qibsr\" width=\"690\" height=\"181\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/44a531f036c708790232bb606650cc892e7f3b3f_2_690x181.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/44a531f036c708790232bb606650cc892e7f3b3f_2_1035x271.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/44a531f036c708790232bb606650cc892e7f3b3f_2_1380x362.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEBEB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>If the Security Council has the ability to use the $2b of ARB in the treasury to thwart objectively malicious proposals with no real community approval, then situations like what happened at Compound can be averted.</p>\n<p>Relying on the Security Council is not a long-term solution either. In an ideal situation, there is robust governance participation and these situations are organically quashed. We want the system to be naturally resilient to the highest degree possible, without the Security Council having to intervene. So the idea of delegate and delegation incentives are still relevant.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-55661-porting-insights-for-arbitrum-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55661-porting-insights-for-arbitrum-4\"></a>Porting Insights for Arbitrum</h2>\n<p>In reality, the cost of a governance attack is directly related to participation in the system. If quorum is 4% and only 6% of tokens are active in governance, then the cost of an attack is – at most – slightly above 6% of token supply. If tokens are liquid and can be easily purchased and sold, or even borrowed, then it exacerbates the situation by making the attack more accessible.</p>\n<p>Another factor to consider is the sheer size of the Treasury. If Compound with approx. $480m in the treasury was subjected to such an incident, Arbitrum with $2b+ definitely is. Arbitrum requires 103m ARB (treasury) or 172m ARB (core) to hit quorum for proposals on Tally. 312m ARB have been delegated in total, resulting in a delegation/quorum ratio of 3 and 1.8 for treasury and core proposal respectively.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/ba51009c530c204bb58b52b723ed7bf4d6e0c72e.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 12.59.38 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"qAem5FwJjxKnk9UuHBa2aIFI8EK\" width=\"666\" height=\"496\"></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, ARB’s lengthy unlocks will increase circulating supply and thus quorum requirements as well.</p>\n<p>Over the last 30 governance proposals on Tally, Arbitrum has had a mean of 164m votes and a median of 160m. Since the majority were treasury proposals, the average deviation of the median over required quorum is 55%. This is not terrible, but it is cause for some concern given the expectation that quorum will continuously increase.</p>\n<p>There are two separate realities here. The first is that governance apathy does not come to be in isolation. It happens when there is apathy for the product too. Compound’s TVL never recovered after the blow off in 2022, while competitors like Aave have forged ahead. Arbitrum is very much in the crypto zeitgeist, and it’s difficult to see how even large ARB holders who are not active in governance could sit on the sidelines when a $2b+ treasury is potentially under attack.</p>\n<p>The second reality is that you don’t want to play with smaller margins, especially when we know the voting quorum is going to increase. Growing the pool of delegated ARB is definitely a matter of concern. And while there are band-aids that can help mitigate these risk factors, more long-term oriented solutions are required.</p>\n<p>We believe the substance and reasoning behind the staking proposal is valid and legitimate. We also think the call for staked ARB to exist in LST form is valid, as keeping token liquidity hostage in the name of governance only stands to birth protocols like Convex that manage duration. However, there are still open questions around implementation. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementing a commission model for delegates could act as delegate incentive + delegation incentive. What is the right split to ensure adequate incentivization?</li>\n<li>What is a sustainable yield that can be promised given the tapering off in sequencer revenues? Would ARB emissions be on the table?</li>\n<li>What other revenue sources can be tapped into for future incentivization? Orbit chain fees?</li>\n<li>Does the Arbitrum DAO have the ability and appetite to set aside ARB to delegate across the top delegators to vote on behalf of the Foundation/DAO’s mandate?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While staking could be lucrative for DAO governance, ARB holders, and the general perception around ARB and L2 tokens, there needs to be a clear-cut economic roadmap to ensure this isn’t done in a haphazard manner.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/response-to-arbitrum-staking-proposal-ardc-research-deliverable/26048\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/response-to-arbitrum-staking-proposal-ardc-research-deliverable/26048","pubDate":"Fri, 02 Aug 2024 07:51:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26048"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/response-to-arbitrum-staking-proposal-ardc-research-deliverable/26048.rss","#text":"Response to Arbitrum Staking Proposal (ARDC Research Deliverable)"}},{"title":"[non-constitutional] Arbitrum Culture Council","dc:creator":"Thistle","category":"Proposals","description":"<p><strong>ARBITRUM CULTURE COUNCIL</strong></p>\n<p>NON-CONSTITUTIONAL</p>\n<p>This proposal is the culmination of many conversations concerning the state of play on Arbitrum. From grass root degens to Arbitrum delegates, we have spent time discussing the best ways to move forward concerning the growth of memes on Arbitrum. We understand that many are hesitant to accept memes on Arbitrum, and ask that you read this proposal with an open mind. Viewing memes as exclusively devices for speculation misses the bigger picture.</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n<p>It is undeniable at this stage that speculation is the primary vector for attracting attention to blockchain ecosystems, overcoming the inertia holding new participants back from learning about and taking steps toward actively utilising these novel technologies.</p>\n<p>With uncertain regulatory conditions weighing on the investment thesis for established infrastructure, and the majority of institutional funding raised towards “earliest stage” projects, the speculative meta has shied away from utility and looked towards participation in memecoin ecosystems.The space is dominated with enthusiasm for memes, which provide downstream adoption across the native chain infrastructure, boosting metrics, including revenues, and fostering ecosystem-wide growth.</p>\n<p>For these reasons we suggest that the Arbitrum DAO creates a culture council to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Support and collaborate with Arbitrum native infrastructure to drive the development of a vibrant meme and culture coin ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Leverage the attention flywheel of a thriving meme and culture coin ecosystem to spread awareness of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Establish an organic community of engaged Arbitrum supporters across social media and on-chain, accelerating Arbitrum’s overall growth.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>All past crypto cycles have been catalysed by a speculation driven attention flywheel, and memecoin ecosystems manifest exactly these conditions. It is no secret that Solana and Base have gained lots of traction across these past few months on this basis, with memes having played a paramount role in their meteoric growth</p>\n<p>The memecoin ecosystem native to Solana, warming up for some time prior, hit a fever pitch in the first week of December around the time of the Jito airdrop as substantial capital was injected into the hitherto beaten down blockchain. Many reading this will have remembered bridging over at this time, if they had yet to do so, as finally there was fun to be had on-chain again outside of farming incentives after a deep and brutal bear market. Subsequently, memecoining began to be adopted as a legitimate use case for the Solana blockchain, with support from all sides of the community. As of December 7th, the day of the Jito airdrop, the Solana ecosystem enjoyed <a href=\"https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/solana\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1.9m monthly active users</a> and <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chain/Solana\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">supported 700m USD in total value locked</a>. Memecoining remains overwhelmingly the primary use case for the Solana blockchain today, and this activity, largely on its own, has catalysed its growth to 17.5m monthly active users and in excess of 5 billion in ecosystem-wide TVL.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8558e778e7abb59e18c07b1976eb9d1d8de4398e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/j1DYKNgCshqRcw03ouXhFW2We6i.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8558e778e7abb59e18c07b1976eb9d1d8de4398e_2_624x201.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"j1DYKNgCshqRcw03ouXhFW2We6i\" width=\"624\" height=\"201\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8558e778e7abb59e18c07b1976eb9d1d8de4398e_2_624x201.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8558e778e7abb59e18c07b1976eb9d1d8de4398e_2_936x301.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8558e778e7abb59e18c07b1976eb9d1d8de4398e_2_1248x402.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DFF5EE\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Solana Network user growth - ~15,000 to ~750,000 daily active</em><p></p>\n<p>Similarly, memecoining has accelerated the growth of the Base ecosystem, where a single meme represents ~25% of the natively minted value and <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/base/tvl-breakdown\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">~17% of the total value on the chain</a>.

Note the outsized impact on daily active users of the micro meme season led by Boop in March of this year, which was able to catalyse as much dex activity as the ARB airdrop itself. Moreover, weekly update posts from the official Arbitrum account with the adoption of the Boop logo have received markedly outsized engagement metrics in comparison to the same posts previously, which radically improves the potential reach and subsequent impact of such information campaigns across the platform. <a href=\"https://x.com/arbitrum/status/1796630328045425148\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbinaut Weekly 51</a> has received 117k views to date, and <a href=\"https://x.com/arbitrum/status/1789040707358818527\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbinaut Weekly 49</a> has received 256k views to date, while the Arbinaut Weekly posts which don’t feature a meme community have each averaged approximately 30k views over the last 3 months.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/arbitrum/status/1774850217340293312\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The April Fool’s post with many Arbitrum memes at a poker table</a> is one of the single most viewed posts on the official twitter account, competing with the announcement later in April that <a href=\"https://x.com/arbitrum/status/1779936743476633798\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BoLD was going live on testnet</a>, a development at the forefront of innovation and of industry-wide significance. There is no denying that memes are loci for attention and engagement.</p>\n<p>Speculative investment into an ecosystem naturally manifests the motivation to publicly support that host ecosystem in its goals and ideals.If we actually want to see a trustless, permissionless internet, we need the chains building that future to actively meet the public where they are, and take advantage of available mechanisms for attention to support bringing these ideals to fruition.</p>\n<p>Toward these ends, we can further the latent partnership established between Arbitrum and Robinhood to everyone’s benefit by meeting the market demand of Robinhood traders for highly speculative, socially engaging, memetic plays. We have an ideal opportunity not just to tell but to actually show this highly engaged and engaging investment community the benefits of permissionless markets, at a time when they are collectively yearning for structural fairness in the wake of alleged manipulations by traditional market incumbents against their interests.</p>\n<p>Further, as an example of how readily memes could potentially benefit the broader DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum, we note at the time of writing that Bonk and Wif each have open interest <a href=\"https://metrics.drift.trade/d/be302407-4616-4174-8982-30df9ae666eb/perp-market-open-interest?orgId=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">exceeding 3m notional</a> on the top five Solana perps protocol Drift. Each of these memes see <a href=\"https://app.gmx.io/#/dashboard\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">equivalent open interest to ARB</a> on Arbitrum’s leading perp dex.</p>\n<p>We, the Arbitrum community, have every motivation to employ a small portion of our massive warchest to court attention for our industry-leading ecosystem, just like everyone else. In order to onboard the next billion users, we need to be willing to meet the market where the demand exists.</p>\n<p>Let’s work together to make Arbitrum great again.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>The establishment of a culture council is a suitable method to provide DAO support to this crucial sub-component of our industry which remains as-yet nascent on Arbitrum. We, the Arbitrum community, need a small group of dedicated community members to source and provide the DAO with information concerning the efficacy of funding and support for memes as a vector for ecosystem growth.</p>\n<p>One of the most impressive emergent features of the Arbitrum ecosystem has been the deep cooperation and collaboration between DeFi protocols, we believe that this Arbitrum spirit could also be effectively fostered between meme communities, and between meme communities and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. This would be encapsulated in a new narrative: MemeFi.</p>\n<p>With proper incentivisation, an abundance of exceptional DeFi and SocialFi infrastructure already built on Arbitrum could be effectively leveraged as the best-in-class memecoin and community-building tooling in the industry. Such a collaborative effort could facilitate onboarding, contract development, competitive pre-sales, liquidity provision, collateralisation and socials, using existing infrastructure, while accelerating on-chain adoption and supporting Arbitrum native builders all at once.</p>\n<p>We would like to provide small grants to existing DeFi to further encourage meme integration, and we would like to provide incentives to use this memeFi infrastructure. This would address all our attention and Arbitrum user growth goals whilst also supporting the existing DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We anticipate that this proposal on its own will bring a lot of activity back to Arbitrum; if accepted this will be a green light to many that the Arbitrum DAO is interested in bringing in more new users.The community is in a broad chorus of agreement that this is exactly the sort of action we need to propel Arbitrum towards the growth goals it deserves to achieve, so, shall we begin?</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<p>We propose to establish a culture council composed of 5 members elected from the Arbitrum community by DAO vote for a 6 month term subsequent to the approval of this proposal.

We believe that these KPIs should be evaluated during the council’s first term in order to get a better gauge of what our target metrics should be. The data scientist of the first council will determine these KPIs. We believe that KPIs should be determined down the road because many of these metrics are easily faked or inflated by unrelated activity. We would like to build out a dashboard that is specific and able to filter for the data that the council influences.</p>\n<p>Example KPIs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social media engagement</li>\n<li>TVL within integrated platforms</li>\n<li>Number of Integrations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These examples are data points that are easily measurable with certainty.

While we provided each fellowship with a structure (e.g, post recurring calls to the Arbitrum DAO calendar) and broad goals (e.g, publish a proposal to the forum), our approach was hands-off.</p>\n<p>Some parts of our solution were successful, while other parts could be improved.

Therefore a hub is likely not a sustainable solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Quantitative KPIs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Number of people joining onboarding calls and showing interest in joining the DAO.</li>\n<li><strong>Placement:</strong> Percentage of participants who join a working group in the DAO after the onboarding program concludes.<br>\n<strong>Retention:</strong> Percentage of program participants who remain active contributors in the DAO for at least 3 months after the onboarding program concludes.

We sourced new participants to the DAO and created a structured environment with Fellowships where newcomers could meet one another, ideate on DAO problems, and learn about Arbitrum DAO’s governance process.</p>\n<p><strong>Only a small percentage of participants (~20%) meaningfully contributed to their Fellowship, but this was expected.</strong> Some participants left the program early because of other commitments while others expressed a disinterest in the program because of misaligned expectations. For example, one participant told us that she expected the fellowship would be less demanding on her time and energy.</p>\n<p>DAOs are not for everyone, and that’s okay, but one thing we may want to consider is <strong>providing participants with retroactive compensation for successfully completing the program.</strong></p>\n<p>As far as challenges, there were several notable ones.</p>\n<p>The Fellowship program was designed to be challenging. But we didn’t expect that participants would struggle in the earliest stage of the process, when they were tasked with identifying a DAO need.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this problem, we could have done a better job of communicating the necessary DAO context to participants.</p>\n<p>How could we have done this?</p>\n<p>Although context is acquired with experience, there are several things that upon reflection we could have done to help transfer context.</p>\n<p>For example, we could have held <strong>workshops</strong> and invited working group leads to present on their area of expertise. We could have also assigned a <strong>mentor</strong>, a <strong>high-context DAO participant</strong>, to each fellowship.  And we could have held <strong>office hours</strong> where one person from our team answers questions and provides feedback, helping to unblock participants.</p>\n<p><strong>These solutions would have been possible only if we re-assessed our directive to be hands-off, something that we would like to change in the next phase of the Program.</strong></p>\n<p>Furthermore, we realized that <strong>writing a proposal may not be the most effective final deliverable for Fellowships.</strong></p>\n<p>Writing a meaningful proposal that passes a vote is a rigorous endeavor that can take several months — even for existing DAO contributors. Therefore it’s likely unreasonable to expect that newcomers, with very little context, will be able to write a quality proposal in only three months.</p>\n<p>As we work on designing the next phase of the Onboarding Program, we will likely <strong>double down on the Educational component</strong>, focusing on helping newcomers to acquire the necessary context through workshops and mentorship.</p>\n<p><strong>Our North Star remains unwavering: to help newcomers navigate the DAO and contribute meaningfully.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-55657-program-retrospective-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-55657-program-retrospective-6\"></a>Program Retrospective</h2>\n<p>We conducted a team retrospective to discuss what went well, what didn’t go well, and what we can do better in the future.

It was also difficult to find the bandwidth to update and maintain it.<br>\n<em>Insight: Consider not continuing to work on the Hub in the next phase of the program.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fellowships inefficiently spent time “planning to plan”,</strong> rather than focusing on the task at hand which was to identify a DAO need and propose a solution.<br>\n<em>Insight: Consider adding mentors to each fellowship and also hosting workshops with working group leads as guest speakers.

It’s a huge opportunity, so <strong>we conducted a Pilot Phase to explore the value upside for Arbitrum, identify strategic target areas for M&amp;A, and expand on the M&amp;A structure.</strong> The outcome is a detailed report, but more importantly, it includes the underlying analyses from the Areta team and alignments with key stakeholders across the DAO, the foundation, and OCL.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"background-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#background-4\"></a>Background</h3>\n<p>Our initial thesis involved setting up a &gt;$100M M&amp;A fund to capitalize on the M&amp;A opportunity for Arbitrum. While we still believe this has significant merit as outlined in the core proposal, and we are now much more informed about which assets to acquire and how to do so, we also delved deeply into Arbitrum’s current situation as a DAO, both strategically and financially to test the thesis. This involved understanding the overall trajectory, the state of the treasury and token, and the engagement of involved stakeholders.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"outcomes-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#outcomes-5\"></a>Outcomes</h3>\n<p>The pilot phase further cemented our view that <strong>M&amp;A is a strategic lever for Arbitrum DAO</strong> for growth and stabilizing its operations while addressing the challenges of current capital allocation initiatives. <strong>However, now is not the right time for a large M&amp;A fund</strong>, <strong>as several</strong> <strong>fundamental building blocks need to be in place before large capital outlays should be approved.</strong></p>\n<p>Thus, as a way forward, we want to simultaneously <strong>(1) address fundamental gaps in the DAO via a DAO Development function</strong> and <strong>(2) drive the tech roadmap through M&amp;A over the medium term</strong> in close collaboration with OCL and key DAO stakeholders.</p>\n<p><em>Find the detailed report below.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"thank-you-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#thank-you-6\"></a>Thank you</h3>\n<p>Lastly, we want to thank the DAO again for trusting us to conduct this pilot phase and for allowing us to apply our skills where they are best used. The support and feedback we’ve received along the journey have been invaluable. We couldn’t be more excited and feel privileged to conduct this work as Areta and are eager to take the next steps to further these outcomes <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12\" title=\":handshake:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":handshake:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"outcome-report-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#outcome-report-7\"></a>Outcome Report</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<h2><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blue_book.png?v=12\" title=\":blue_book:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":blue_book:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <a href=\"https://docsend.com/v/r8fnh/arbitrum_ma_pilot\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Please find the full M&amp;A Pilot Phase report here</a>.</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this report, we evaluated the potential of M&amp;A for Arbitrum DAO and placed it in the context of the current developments of the DAO and its treasury.</p>\n<p>We challenged our initial thesis to establish a larger M&amp;A buy-out fund for the DAO, with a mandate to acquire projects. This resulted in an outcome that we feel confident will significantly advance the DAO while limiting the risk associated with larger capital allocation initiatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Key parts of the report include the value upside for Arbitrum, strategic target areas for M&amp;A, and an expansion on the M&amp;A structure.</strong></p>\n<p><em>PS: To align with the typical information consumption in the DAO, we have highlighted some of the report’s key points as an executive summary in the thread below.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"content-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#content-8\"></a>Content</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>I.

Additionally, there is a unique, DAO-native approach to M&amp;A.<br>\n<strong>(b) The fundamental lack of structure in the DAO hampers the value of an M&amp;A fund at this stage.</strong> Significant strategic uncertainties, missing foundational elements (OpCo, CapCo), and an increasing budget gap with no resolution plan suggest that capital allocation initiatives should be deferred for now.</p>\n<p>These insights have guided us to a practical way forward, in collaboration with delegates and stakeholders of other initiatives. Together, we have identified steps to drive M&amp;A benefits for the DAO while significantly reducing risks.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"way-forward-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#way-forward-11\"></a>Way Forward</h3>\n<p>Thus, as a way forward, we propose to simultaneously address fundamental gaps in the DAO and scale the tech roadmap through M&amp;A over the medium term.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Build Out the DAO Structure via a Development Function (Short-term)</strong></p>\n<p>We propose establishing a DAO Development function to fill operational gaps. This will:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide recommendations on the best methods to build out the DAO (Hiring vs. Partnering vs. Acquiring) and feed into the OpCo as an execution arm once its structure is defined.</li>\n<li>Execute engagement recommendations after alignment with the DAO, including hiring, partnering, or acquiring specific functions.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Drive the Tech Roadmap via Buy-Side M&amp;A (OCL) (Medium-term)</strong></p>\n<p>We support setting the agenda and acting as the buy-side function for the DAO to advance Arbitrum’s tech roadmap. This includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Aligning with OCL and DAO stakeholders on acquisition verticals.</li>\n<li>Proposing acquisition targets to the DAO and operating as a light M&amp;A unit with a dedicated acquisition mandate.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By following these parallel paths, we aim to build out the fundamental gaps in the DAO immediately while scaling the tech roadmap through strategic M&amp;A over the medium term.</p>\n<p>Find details in the slide(s) below:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/ccb9d9959ec088d3b03e3a7589f3022d469934eb.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/td5Aja3azWhgLSNgu4HjuoBDUwP.png?dl=1\" title=\"Key Takeaways &amp; Way Forward\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/ccb9d9959ec088d3b03e3a7589f3022d469934eb_2_690x387.png\" alt=\"Key Takeaways &amp; Way Forward\" data-base62-sha1=\"td5Aja3azWhgLSNgu4HjuoBDUwP\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/ccb9d9959ec088d3b03e3a7589f3022d469934eb_2_690x387.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/ccb9d9959ec088d3b03e3a7589f3022d469934eb_2_1035x580.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/ccb9d9959ec088d3b03e3a7589f3022d469934eb.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"BEC2E9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"treasury-situation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#treasury-situation-12\"></a>Treasury Situation</h3>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO’s Treasury is at a crossroads with an unsustainable financial outlook and many capital-intensive initiatives.

Including RnDAO, EVM Capital, Elixir, Areta. This effort is also being built on top of that of key delegates who have been proponents of ventures in Arbitrum, such as Coinflip and Krzstf and on efforts by the GCP and the Arbitrum Foundation. The DAO’s best interest is also being represented by Alex Lumley who has been a key contributor since the beginning of the initiative during GovHack Denver.</p>\n<p>If you would like to get more involved or consulted as part of the discovery interviews and delegate conversations, which are currently ongoing, please reach out via a DM or reply on the forum here.</p>\n<p><strong>And bookmark this thread for fortnightly updates.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"market-consultation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#market-consultation-5\"></a>Market Consultation</h2>\n<p>We are also in the process of recruiting the participants for the Market Consultation which is a key part of the first phase.

If enacted, the proposal execution will activate Stylus, Alternate Signature Verification, and Automatic Treasury Deposits using seven on-chain governance action contracts (GACs) that alter the ecosystem in the ways described in the proposal description. The new, on-chain contracts match their audited versions with the exception of the contracts in the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/compare/61f4f60384e2ecba8250287dfb2778ce30bd82b0...v1.0.1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts</a> for fund distribution which we read but did not audit.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overview-3\"></a>Overview</h2>\n<p>This proposal does three separate things.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"stylus-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stylus-4\"></a>Stylus</h3>\n<p>Smart contracts are computer programs. They execute the code they store and the code that Arbitrum has used until now has been Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code. Different computer languages like Solidity and Vyper can be stored as EVM code but more popular languages like Rust or C++ cannot. They can, however, be stored as Web Assembly (WASM) code. This proposal will upgrade the on-chain contracts to allow not only EVM but also WASM code to be executed on Arbitrum One and Nova chains. Allowing WASM would mean that these more popular languages can be used by the developers who know them and don’t want to learn an EVM language.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"alternate-signature-verification-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#alternate-signature-verification-5\"></a>Alternate Signature Verification</h3>\n<p>Ethereum and Arbitrum are secured by cryptography. Because a user’s keys are effectively impossible to figure out, they can use these keys to “sign” transactions and everyone knows that only they could be the ones that signed it. There are many different key-signature schemes including the popular <code>secp256r1</code>. This scheme is widely used by numerous web services and most notably by Apple and Android devices. To be able to easily use this scheme on-chain would make dApps easier to integrate into these platforms. This proposal cuts the cost of using <code>secp256r1</code> signatures down drastically (up to 99%) by creating a “precompile” or special program that will perform the signature verification in the node and not in the EVM. This node software is the <strong>ArbOS</strong> referred to in the proposal.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"automatic-treasury-deposits-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#automatic-treasury-deposits-6\"></a>Automatic Treasury Deposits</h3>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO collects fees for transactions on the Arbitrum networks. Currently the fees are sent to the L1 Timelock on Ethereum mainnet. The DAO’s treasury, however, sits on the Arbitrum One network. To collect the fees that come from Arbitrum Nova, a full vote must take place which requires at least two weeks to fully conduct. This proposal removes the need for these votes by creating fee routers which will transfer the funds across the networks to the DAO’s treasury automatically.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"technical-details-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#technical-details-7\"></a>Technical Details</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"scope-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#scope-8\"></a>Scope</h3>\n<p>We reviewed the <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/52c0865f597de35413bc29609a775d943a1b83f2/scripts/proposals/ArbOS31AIP/ArbOS31AIP.json\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">calldata</a> as of <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/tree/52c0865f597de35413bc29609a775d943a1b83f2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commit 52c086</a> in <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/298\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pull Request #298</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposal of ArbOS 31 “Bianca”</a> that was recently <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x645155e4ded2888f43c3d8d170bf4bdecbc46260010e365c02bcf7090f7159d1#eventlog\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposed to the Arbitrum Core Governor</a>.</p>\n<p>Our review included determining the proposed execution, what contracts are involved, and if the contracts have demonstrated credibility.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposal-execution-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposal-execution-9\"></a>Proposal Execution</h3>\n<p>The proposal stores a call to the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/reference#arbsys\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbSys <code>sendTxToL1</code></a> precompile which sends a transaction to L1.

The fundamental pool mechanisms of Balancer, along with the STIP Addendum boost settings, will create a robust and sustainable environment for the most advantageous asset classes on Arbitrum to thrive on Balancer. This approach aims to maximize capital efficiency of ARB incentives for both the Arbitrum ecosystem and Balancer DAO.
