[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>Even if the program allowed us to grow (1) the Angle TVL on Arbitrum with peak 1798% increase now stabilizing at a 542% increased compared to the begining of the program, and (2) DEX liquidity, the remaining stEUR holders after the program did not necessarily leave their liquidity in the pools created, they keep holding the EURA and stEUR stablecoins but out the pools.  In summary, new holders of the EURA stablecoin remained after the end of the program and a considerable part of them (approx. 50%) kept staking their EURA stablecoin into stEUR to gain the RWA yield associated with it. Indeed Around 1m of EURA are currently staked in the stEUR savings product. However, most of these people pulled their liquidity out the Camelot pools that were set up.</p>\n<p>The integration of stEUR with Silo allowed the onboarding of new EURA and stEUR holders. Integrations and sigle-sided liquidity incentivization on Silo appears to be a good continuation path for this STIP Bridge.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7.

[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>Angle has launched a new USD stablecoin, USDA. USDA has a yield-bearing product associated called stUSD.</p>\n<p>Currently stUSD yields 20%. <strong>Why is it the the yield so high?</strong> The current yield is at 20% for stUSD thanks to the multiplier effect that Angle’s savings solution benefits from. The yield that the protocol distributes to stUSD holders comes from the backing of USDA. Currently, only 27% of the USDA is staked into stUSD, this means that the savings contract utilization rate is low and it allows stUSD holders to earn more. <strong>Why is the utilization rate low?</strong> The current utilization rates on the stUSD and stEUR are low due to competing DeFi integrations that incentivize USDA and EURA holders to deposit their stablecoins in pools rather than staking them with Angle. For example, USDA supply is largely used on Aerodrome (Base Chain DEX) and Morpho rather than being staked.</p>\n<p>A larger target and user base that the Euro stablecoin: USDA has been launched two weeks ago and currently has a 10m TVL. More generally, USD stablecoins havelarger use cases and adoption in Defi, hence the plan to direct the potential STIP bridge funds to the development of use cases around USDA and stUSD.</p>\n<p>After the initial STIP program, an event if Angle registered solid growth numbers in user count, volume, and TVL, it appears that favoring lending and/or perpetual DEX inregrations may be better long term spending for networks effects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The new plan would be to allocate the funds as follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step 1 - 250,000 ARB dedicated to single sided USDA liquidity providers on lending markets including at least Silo,</li>\n<li>Step 2 - 100,000 ARB dedicated to (1) launching the onboarding of stUSD as collateral on Arbitrum native a perpetual exchange (Vela Exchange pending completion) integration, or (2) pursuing money market integration depending on results observed in Step 1</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10.

[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the STIP, we decided to repurpose 100k set aside for partnerships to extend out the juiced vaults for another month. We were not able to find a proper set of partners that were capable to deploy options liquidity mining given the time constraints and resource requirement from the receiving team. If we had to do it again, we would get some commitment prior to the STIP period to lock-in the partnerships. However, given the amount of new projects moving over with LTIPP, it’s doubtful we will run into that problem again.<br>\nWe were also able to develop some new vault types we have not deployed yet as well as a new algo strategy that a few groups are interested in utilizing that should result in some newer exotic options vaults for tokens that do not have a mature spot market yet, which we are excited to deploy soon. We started the cross protocol initiatives to move over liquidity from other chains (SOL) and soon (OP) and with more to come, however the we kind of stink at doing the cross-protocol marketing and end up releasing piecemeal, we could definitely do a better job coordinating between project teams. So if STIP Bridge does get over the line, the items addressed here are what we would course correct this time around to continue to develop our relationships with other projects across the ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h1>\n<p><strong>7.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</h3>\n<p>TrueFi tfBILL helps Arbitrum to achieve its objectives of managing treasury into high-quality, highly liquid assets by providing on-chain access to short-term U.S. Treasury Bill yields.</p>\n<p>Through STEP, Arbitrum and TrueFi can establish a model for successful investment of DAO treasury into “real world assets” using a crypto-native stack that integrates processes of leading off-chain asset managers (Adapt3r Digital) into open, on-chain financial infrastructure (TrueFi).</p>\n<p>As the RWA ecosystem evolves, TrueFi is positioned to facilitate additional RWA activity beyond tokenized T-bills. TrueFi has originated nearly $2B in onchain credit to date (source: <a href=\"http://rwa.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">rwa.xyz</a>), and built generalized credit infrastructure that suits our needs as the asset manager of tfBILL.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic Compliance and Regulatory Leadership</strong></p>\n<p>Consistent with our belief that a tokenized asset is only as strong as the regulatory compliance of its issuer, Adapt3r Digital has crafted tfBILL with a foundational emphasis on compliance. We aim to set the gold standard within the DeFi space for regulatory adherence. This approach not only aligns with stringent financial regulations that come with being a US-domiciled asset manager, but also the investor protections that come with a Professional Mutual Fund registered with the BVI Financial Services Commission. Adapt3r has taken a measured approach to integrations to date, focusing on KYC’d and permissioned ecosystems. By adhering strictly and conservatively to global securities regulation, tfBILL is best positioned to scale with the growth of Arbitrum without interruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Commitment to Decentralization</strong></p>\n<p>With the launch of tfBILL, Adapt3r Digital leverages the TrueFi protocol’s proven track record of nearly $2 billion in loan volume, which is by far the highest volume as well as one of the longest-lasting RWA ecosystems in DeFi. Consistent with Arbitrum’s vision, TrueFi is the only RWA platform managed exclusively by a decentralized community. The integration of tfBILL on Arbitrum also brings TrueFi’s core private credit marketplace, which is relaunching <a href=\"https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-11-rebuilding-a-risk-managed-crypto-native-lending-vertical-on-truefi/1602\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">professionally underwritten pools</a>, as well as a soon-to-debut <a href=\"https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-12-truefi-trinity-a-new-vision-and-roadmap/1620\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">treasury-backed stablecoin </a>to every user in the Arbitrum ecosystem. By offering an entire ecosystem rather than a single asset, TrueFi’s tfBILL is a logical choice for growing Arbitrum without compromising on quality or overall mission of the endowment.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasury Diversification and Composability</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the immediate benefit of investing in US treasury bills, the most liquid and low risk asset globally, the broader TrueFi ecosystem also offers Arbitrum’s treasury a strategic diversification option by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@cicadapartners/cicada-partners-secures-approval-from-truefi-dao-to-serve-as-credit-risk-manager-4d1e3b81fba8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">providing access to alternative credit products</a>, which contain higher yielding opportunities with established managers. This diversification allows the treasury to tap into an alternative asset class that is not only stable and profitable but also managed through robust risk controls and compliance measures, enhancing the overall security and yield potential of treasury assets.</p>\n<p>For more information on the general benefits of tfBILL, please see <a href=\"https://docs.adapt3r.com/adapt3r-digital-docs/qualified-access-products/adapt3r-short-term-us-treasury-fund/us-treasury-bill-yield-now-on-chain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our docs</a> and also find TrueFi docs <a href=\"https://docs.truefi.io/faq\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-6\"></a>2.

Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</h3>\n<p>Our risk management, across both operations and investment activity, centers on the simplicity of our investment approach and product structuring. This simplicity is by design – we believe that complexity breeds fragility.</p>\n<p>tfBILL was built in response to compliance and complexity concerns we continually heard from DAOs and on-chain investors about existing treasury bill offerings. Specifically, many DeFi entities and users expressed difficulty evaluating existing options due to contrived and opaque legal structures with uncertain investor recourse, hidden layers of fees, and aggressive operation in regulatory grey areas.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning, our primary goal has been to build an on-chain treasury instrument that is simple, transparent, and secure for all users.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational Risk Management</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s operations are safeguarded by robust internal controls, including consensus-based approval mechanisms and role-based governance protocols.</p>\n<p>For example, by limiting disbursement of funds from the contract to <a href=\"https://github.com/TrueFi-Protocol/contracts-fluorine/blob/main/docs/interfaces/IStructuredAssetVault.md#disburse-1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>onlyAllowedBorrowers</code></a> that are assigned the <code>BORROWER_ROLE</code> by TrueFi governance, tfBILL can ensure that USDC can only be disbursed to approved addresses at Coinbase Prime.</p>\n<p>These measures are bolstered by multi-layered physical and digital security protections. On-chain assets are safeguarded by multi-sig operations and leading custodial providers. Off-chain assets are held in custody with a regulated institutional custodian and a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer.</p>\n<p>Our operational controls are supported by technology solutions including real-time monitoring and alerts, ensuring that any unauthorized access or deviations from established procedures are quickly identified and addressed. Additionally, we engage a reputable fund administrator to oversee daily Net Asset Value calculations as well as an AML Reportig Officer to enforce meticulous KYC, KYB, and AML protocols, further reinforcing our commitment to regulatory compliance and operational integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Investment Risk Management</strong></p>\n<p>The cornerstone of our Investment Risk Management centers ADAPT I LP focuses on maintaining a conservative and strategic approach to portfolio management, investing only in short-term U.S. Treasury bills. Our investment strategy employs a ladder approach by diversifying across different maturities to effectively manage duration and liquidity risks.</p>\n<p>This strategy is supplemented by active internal reviews and monitoring, ensuring alignment with our risk appetite and investment goals. We also conduct extensive research and leverage independent expertise to inform our investment decisions, ensuring that each investment is well-positioned to meet our stringent criteria for risk and return.</p>\n<p>By maintaining rigorous operational controls and a prudent investment strategy, we ensure the safety and performance of our fund.

How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</h3>\n<p><em>Trust-minimized:</em> Full transparency into flow of funds and real time on-chain monitoring. On-chain assets are segregated in cold storage and held by a Qualified Custodian. Off-chain assets are segregated and custodied by a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer. Investors can monitor the manager’s portfolio, yield generation, fees and expenses, and ongoing maturity profile in real-time. Streamlined investor reporting statements are provided by Archblock. Further, investors have real-time visibility of the off-chain U.S. Treasury Bills held by the manager as well as deposits and withdrawals to the Fund. The primary activity that requires trust from our investors is within the subscription/redemption process, whereby Adapt3r withdraws USDC to Coinbase Prime. Adapt3r controls the TrueFi Asset Vault using multi-sig technology, and access is limited to key management personnel. Every other aspect of the flow of funds is trustless and/or highly regulated.</p>\n<p><em>Audits &amp; Attestations:</em> Independent third-party fund administrator NAV Consulting releases daily NAV reports (which are available to investors on Archblock’s frontend), detailing the Net Asset Value of the backing tfBILL’s underlying holdings. ADAPT I LP is subject to annual audits, conducted by Wolf &amp; Company, a recognized fund auditor with deep experience in blockchain fund audit and accounting services. This ensures that ADAPT I LP maintains the highest accounting standards and third party oversight.</p>\n<p><em>Administrator:</em> NAV Fund Administration Group serves as the Administrator for the Fund. The Administrator provides certain accounting, operations and other administrative support for the Fund as preparing quarterly reports, calculating the Fund’s Net Asset Value, providing the registrar and transfer agency services in connection with the issuance and transfer of Interests, performing the required acts relating to the redemption and/or subscription for the Interests and performing certain other administrative and clerical services in connection with the administration of the Fund as agreed among the Fund and the Administrator.</p>\n<p><em>Custodian:</em> The Fund has appointed TradeStation Securities, Inc. as its custodian to custody the U.S. Treasury Bills and may have a separate custodian for the custody of USDC and other consideration paid by Limited Partners. Such custodians have developed security systems to maintain confidential access to private keys that have been generated and which control movement of the Tokens, as applicable. The Investment Manager may not be able to obtain control of the private keys generated by the exchanges utilized by the Fund, because each exchange may use different methodologies and security systems. The Investment Manager seeks to employ a comprehensive due diligence process to select custodians that it determines have developed sophisticated security systems and will continue to reevaluate the due diligence process and security systems of the various custodians.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-6-is-there-any-custom-logic-required-for-your-rwa-token-if-so-please-give-any-details-51\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-6-is-there-any-custom-logic-required-for-your-rwa-token-if-so-please-give-any-details-51\"></a>6.

Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>We found that the incentive campaign brought in many wash traders, where our intention was to promote real users. We will change the campaign in the bridge version to remove the risk of wash trading by targeting developers and adjusting the economics when targeting end users. This will be beneficial not only for the end user, but the developers and protocols that integrate our API/SDK as well. This is therefore not just a benefit for us, but also all the protocols that build with us in terms of lowering development costs, improved security, better incentives and economic models, and improving their product by offering more features and functions that would otherwise not be available.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7. How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>350,000 ARB</p>\n<p>8.Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>9.How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>It is our intention in this version to promote the use of Protocolink by our partners and developers. If a protocol or developer utilizes Protocolink API/SDK to route transactions, a portion of the overall volume will be incentivized and rewarded. This is different from our previous campaign because we will not only be incentivizing retail users, but builders as well.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, the first change we want to make is to include an incentive to builders who build using our public API/SDK. Protocolink, our API/SDK, is one of the most robust SDK’s in the industry today. Through the composability of Furucombo, Protocolink allows developers to take advantage of the functions and features available through Furucombo, such as advanced position management, zap in/out of lending positions, multi-send, and more. Additionally, by a developer or protocol utilizing Protocolink, we can significantly reduce the cost of development for developers, as well as reducing security risks. Through our studies, we have calculated that developers can save approximately 77% development costs by utilizing Protocolink for their Lending SDK needs. This can be demonstrated by our collaboration with Radiant protocol who is utilizing our API/SDK to unwind positions directly on their interface. We believe that this can help to strengthen the developer community on Arbitrum and act as an incentive to develop more outstanding dapps to deploy on chain due to the developer friendly environment.</p>\n<p>The second change will be to focus on how we can avoid wash trades on Furucombo, and to promote real users. This began to happen once the $ARB token saw a big price swing and it was profitable to perform trades to earn tokens. We still want to provide incentives to users, but we noticed that a volume based approach for all functions on the Lending Dashboard caused the back and forth trades from occurring. Therefore we will focus again on the advanced features, such as Collateral Swaps, Debt Swaps, Leverage, and Deleverage. Additionally, we will adjust the rewards based on the token amount (instead of price), to target a specific percentage of rewards. Furthermore, we will provide users with gas incentives. Because of the complex transactions when performing position management, gas fees can vary anywhere from a few dollars to as high as over five dollars. By providing gas incentives, it will allow users to be able to manage their positions without having to worry about the cost of performing the transactions on the network. With these changes, we believe this will greatly reduce the back and forth swaps and will focus more attention on real users attempting to adjust their positions.</p>\n<p>The final details will be determined upon the creation of this campaign including recommendations from the community and Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>10.Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisig Address\n<ul>\n<li>0x99D40438543041e3CC53ac1fE8FF2B8f68996C79</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>11.Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<p>Overall the experience was good. It would be nice to be able to assign incentives based on our own schedule, as opposed to staying static to an overall schedule. We believe that we could have run the previous round of rewards for a longer period of time, and therefore could have provided incentives for longer.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong><br>\nAt Fortunafi we fundamentally believe that in order to successfully scale an RWA ecosystem, composability with DeFi is a critical ingredient. Given Arbitrum’s success in scaling DeFi we believe that Arbitrum is extremely well positioned to be the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> chain for RWA. Fortunafi has been working closely with Arbitrum on implementing a best in class solution for native RWAs on Arbitrum. We believe Fortunafi is the only offering that enables all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Native Minting &amp; Redemption on ARB</li>\n<li>Fully Compliant Composability with DeFi\n<ul>\n<li>Fortunafi is in discussions with leading protocols on Arbitrum including but not limited to: Jones DAO, Isekai, Gammaswap, Silo, IPOR, and Radiant.</li>\n<li>Transferability enabled for all whitelisted users &amp; protocols</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Open to US &amp; Non US</li>\n<li>Open to individuals &amp; entities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fortunafi’s wealth of experience in both traditional finance and DeFi grants us the expertise to bring compliant products onchain that facilitate great composability with many existing protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem. We have been actively collaborating with Arbitrum native protocols for over a year to develop novel yield strategies, new collateral types for lending, and exposure to off-chain yields and other traditional products. Members of the team are highly invested in the Arbitrum ecosystem, greatly align with the vision of creating a composable decentralized financial ecosystem, and are highly motivated to provide the highest quality collateral to the protocols and users of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4c1aaf396b6a2186cd497dd1c440d6f0232baf78.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/aRfssgJVPpA8P5yi7SiuFPQU5x6.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4c1aaf396b6a2186cd497dd1c440d6f0232baf78_2_624x361.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"aRfssgJVPpA8P5yi7SiuFPQU5x6\" width=\"624\" height=\"361\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4c1aaf396b6a2186cd497dd1c440d6f0232baf78_2_624x361.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4c1aaf396b6a2186cd497dd1c440d6f0232baf78.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4c1aaf396b6a2186cd497dd1c440d6f0232baf78.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E2E6E2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>2.

As a company, Fortunafi was the 2nd ever protocol to receive approval from MakerDAO to use RWAs as collateral for minting DAI, was an early user of Centrifuge launching two separate pools backed by a variety of private credit assets, and worked closely with key contributors at Canto to pass governance proposals to use $fBILL and $ifBILL tokens to back their native stablecoin.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What is your entity’s current assets under management, assets held in trust, total value locked, or equivalent metric for your legal structuring?</strong><br>\n$7.2 million</p>\n<p><strong>11. How many of these assets held are present on Arbitrum One, if any?</strong><br>\nCurrently $500,000 of tokenized treasury bills ($fBILL) are held on Arbitrum One.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"plan-design-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#plan-design-5\"></a><strong>Plan design</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>1. Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Structure</strong><br>\nThe product uses a “master-feeder” fund structure. The Master Fund, Fortunafi Capital LP, is a British Virgin Islands limited partnership. Non-U.S. investors are able to subscribe to interests in Fortunafi Capital International LP, a BVI limited partnership (the “Offshore Fund”), and U.S. investors may subscribe to interests in Fortunafi Capital US LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Onshore Fund” and together with the Offshore Fund the “Feeder Funds”, and together with the Master Fund the “Funds”). The Feeder Funds invest substantially all of their assets through the Master Fund.</p>\n<p>The Funds are not registered, in reliance on Section 3(c)7 of the Investment Company Act. Interests in the Funds will not be registered with the SEC in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.</p>\n<p>The Funds are operated by Fortunafi Capital GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as General Partner. The Investment Manager of the Funds is Fortunafi Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong><br>\nInvestors are able to subscribe to the Feeder Funds using Fortunafi’s Tokenized Asset Protocol (“TAP”). To do so, investors must undergo an onboarding process. Once the onboarding process is completed, investors can use TAP to purchase interests in the Fund’s Class T-Bill, which will be represented by token units named fBILL for the Onshore Fund, and ifBILL for the Offshore Fund (together the “fTokens”).</p>\n<p>Onboarding process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>KYC/AML and Checks: user connects wallet to TAP and undergoes a process of identification and other checks. U.S. users also undergo an accreditation check.</li>\n<li>Subscription Documents: users that pass Step 1 receive subscription documents to complete.</li>\n<li>Whitelisting: Once Steps 1 and 2 are complete and approved, the user’s address is whitelisted.</li>\n<li>Chain Selection: user is now able to select from various chains and invest in Class T-Bill interests, minting fBILL or ifBILL tokens directly on the selected chain. Currently, available chains on TAP are Arbitrum, Blast, and Canto.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Funds’ net asset value is calculated daily and the value of the fBILL and ifBILL tokens will change with the net asset value of the Class T-Bill interests.</p>\n<p>Subscriptions are processed and tokens minted on the same business day they are requested through TAP, with a 2:00pm ET cut-off. After the cut-off, subscriptions are processed the following business day.</p>\n<p>Redemptions may also be requested by using TAP, with same business day processing done before the 2:00pm ET cutoff, if there is available liquidity in the Funds. Otherwise, redemptions are expected to be processed the following business day. Subscriptions and redemptions may be done in USDC or USD.</p>\n<p><strong>Underlying Assets</strong><br>\nThe Class T-Bill invests primarily in debt and fixed income securities issued by the United States Department of the Treasury (“Treasury Bills”) with up to 12 month maturity. It may also invest in exchange-traded funds that primarily pursue or track investments in Treasury Bills.</p>\n<p>Current holdings of the Class T-Bill portfolio:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>CUSIP</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Maturity Date</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>912797JV0</td>\n<td>US Treasury Bill</td>\n<td>5/07/2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>912797JX6</td>\n<td>US Treasury Bill</td>\n<td>5/21/2024</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>2. Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor or similar rights?</strong><br>\nInvestors own limited partnership interests in Feeder Funds, and are therefore owners of the Funds. The Feeder Funds in turn hold limited partnership interests in the Master Fund. All bank accounts and brokerage accounts are in the name of the Master Fund. The Funds are the counterparty to the service providers, which act in the interest of the Funds.</p>\n<p>The fund structure is bankruptcy remote from the Investment Manager. In the event the General Partner is dissolved or declares bankruptcy, the Funds would be dissolved and liquidated, with each investor receiving their respective interests in USDC or USD.</p>\n<p><strong>3.

Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong><br>\nThe underlying assets are U.S. Treasury Bills, the most liquid asset in financial markets. Treasury Bills are also considered the safest and most stable asset class in the market. The short duration of the assets also minimizes interest rate risk.</p>\n<p>The Funds are often able to settle redemptions as quickly as the same day, though that depends on timing as well as the conversion and transfer speed of service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong><br>\nThe minting and redemption process is fully automated by smart contracts.

A reverse repo refers to the seller side of a repurchase agreement (RRP), or repo. At present moment, iSDYF’s portfolio is made up 100% of RRPs. Reverse repo is largely considered the safest way to keep cash in traditional finance, more safe than direct purchase of treasury bills.</p>\n<p>iSDYF may also purchase short-dated U.S. Treasury securities. iSDYF may also hold stablecoins or cash for liquidity management.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum/Maximum transaction size</strong></p>\n<p>Hashnote can exit or enter a position with billions of dollars without incurring slippage costs.

Hashnote’s principals are professionals with a combined 50+ years in traditional finance/banking, options trading, software engineering, and blockchain technology at global trading and investment companies. Hashnote’s team has been an active participant and pioneer in the institutional digital asset markets. Our mission is to build what finance will look like in ten years.</p>\n<p>We adhere to strict regulations set by the CFTC and CIMA, ensuring our operations meet institutional investment standards. Assets are protected through segregated custodial accounts at BNY Mellon. This straightforward and secure approach gives investors the confidence to focus on their investment goals. Trust and transparency are the pillars of our service, making us a dependable partner for the Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>USYC has been designed to be a money-market-like product for capital efficiency and trading. Not only is it a fully compliant token governed under strict regulatory regimes, and available globally, it will be available widely in centralized finance in digital assets. As Arbitrum looks to position itself as the hub on onchain DeFi, housing USYC as a flagship asset only adds value to the ecosystem. USYC will be used in the onchain and offchain financial ecosystem alike. Engaging USYC is a staple of an onchain DeFi ecosystem competitive with traditional finance as Arbitrum looks to become.</p>\n<p>The stated goal of the STEP program is for the DAO to diversify its treasury and deploy into assets that are uncorrelated with the broader digital asset ecosystem. Hashnote believes in fully tokenized products being composable with the broader DeFi ecosystem which we are committed to doing with Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Hashnote plans to launch additional products in the coming months with different underlying investment strategies and asset classes that benefit from the advantages. Our team has deep experience in traditional finance, and is committed to bringing more RWAs and investment strategies to the ecosystem, ensuring Arbitrum One is a top destination for tokenized assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is able to be bridged between Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum One through its integration with Chainlink CCIP. By allocating part of STEP to STBT, the amount can be kept on Arbitrum chain’s TVL. It also serves as an excellent example of RWA tokens that are secured on Ethereum mainnet through minting and redeeming, but interoperable with Arbitrum to have greater transactional efficiency with cheaper gas.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the inclusion of STBT can expand the user reach of Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem to a larger audience, especially in the Asia Pacific region where Matrixdock has a strong presence and is well-connected to institutional clients. This will also demonstrate the composability of T-bill tokens on Arbitrum, where more protocols will be encouraged to incorporate yield-generating RWA tokens as part of their strategies or underlying collateral for DeFi operations.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Identify key management personnel and individual experience. Also include third parties utilized for managing assets and their qualifications.</strong></p>\n<p>Eva Meng, Head of RWA</p>\n<p>As Head of RWA, Eva oversees Matrixdock, an RWA tokenization brand owned by Matrixport. Eva is passionate about bridging digital assets and traditional finance and is focused on leading the team to build cutting-edge technology in the tokenization space. Prior to Matrixport, Eva spent over 6 years in the digital asset mining industry.</p>\n<p>Rohit Apte, Head of Trading</p>\n<p>As Head of Trading, Rohit leads the trade desk with focus on Matrixport’s tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills (T-Bills) offering – the Short-term Treasury Bill Token (STBT). Rohit has over 18 years of experience in trading across traditional and cryptocurrency markets. Prior to venturing into crypto, Rohit was co-head of trade desk at HSBC.</p>\n<p>Kyle Wang, Technical Lead</p>\n<p>Dr. Wang leads Matrixport’s Blockchain research, bringing extensive experience in blockchain development. He also acts as the lead developer for SmartBCH, a sidechain of Bitcoin Cash. He held key roles at Bitmain (2016-2019) and CoinEx Chain (2019-2020). He got a Ph.D. degree in Computer Architecture from Peking University in 2009.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe any previous work by the entity or its officers/key contributors similar to that requested. References are encouraged.</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock is a digital asset platform that provides access to Real World Assets (RWA) through tokenization. It is a brand fully owned by Matrixport, an all-in-one crypto financial service platform that offers custody, asset management, brokerage and RWA tokenization services. Matrixport currently custodies and manages approximately USD 4 billion of crypto assets. Its client base includes more than 5000+ miners, high-networth individuals, family offices, hedge funds, ventures, protocols and foundations across Asia, Europe, Australia and offshore countries. With its vast product portfolio and geographic reach, Matrixport can help bootstrap the adoption of STBT by providing support including custody, DeFi asset management products with respect to STBT, trading liquidity and lending etc.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Has your entity or its officers/key contributors been subject to an enforcement action, criminal action, or defaulted on legal or financial obligations? Please describe the circumstances if so.</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Describe any conflicts of interest for your entity and key personnel.</strong></p>\n<p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Insurance coverages, guarantees, and backstops</strong></p>\n<p>STBT currently does not have any additional insurance coverage. However, our stringent choice of trusted custodians ensures that client securities are segregated, and cannot be commingled by law. Additionally, our bankruptcy remoteness structure provides a strong safeguard of funds in the unlikely event of incidents.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Historical tracking error in your proposed product, or similar to that being proposed product</strong></p>\n<p>There is no historical tracking error between STBT and the underlying assets, as the increase in NAV is directly reflected in the increase in total STBT supply during business days. STBT is crypto-native and distributes yield during non-business days using an automated formula. The STBT supply is reconciled with the NAV of underlying assets on the next business day, ensuring the accuracy of yield.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Brief reason for above tracking error</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable</p>\n<p><strong>9. Please describe any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organizational structures</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock has strong involvement in the DeFi ecosystem, and some dApps that we work with have a DAO structure such as T-protocol. We are continuously engaging with partners, many of which are in various stages of decentralization. Additionally, our Transparency Panel consists of several key industry players, some of whom had past and current experiences working in DAO structures.</p>\n<p><strong>10.

Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>Short-term Treasury Bill Token (STBT) is designed for accredited investors seeking US treasury yields with their stablecoin holdings. STBT currently yields approximately 4.8-4.9% APY on average (as of Apr 2024). Each STBT is pegged to 1 USD and backed by US treasury securities with maturities within 6 months, reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by US treasury securities and cash not exceeding 5% of NAV.</p>\n<p>T-bills will be bought with the highest yield in tranches, laddering maturity dates such that there will be access to potential liquidity to support any redemptions without selling any T-bills.</p>\n<p>Matrixdock will distribute yield daily through the rebase of STBT in holders token balances. The total STBT supply is equivalent to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying asset portfolio, which equates to the sum of the market value of US T-bills, Repos (overnight loans fully-backed by T-bills) and cash.</p>\n<p><strong>Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor or similar rights?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

Given that the STBT entities are special purpose vehicles that only conduct the STBT program, these entities incur no liabilities other than those obligations toward the STBT token holders, which are the only obligations of the STBT entities. As described above, the number of STBT tokens issued will always be less than the dollar value of the underlying reserves held by the STBT entities. With these factors combined, the STBT entities are bankruptcy remote. Details of the entities can be shared via email.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the Issuer issue more than one asset?

Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p>Upon redeeming STBT tokens, USDC can usually be received by the user within 4 business days. The sale of underlying T-Bill assets can be executed within T+0 or T+1 days, and conversion of fiat USD to USDC will be processed next T+1 day. Once the USDC is received, we will be able to proceed with the trade of USDC into ARB either via our trading desk or any agreed channel.</p>\n<p>STBT holders on Ethereum can also easily access instant liquidity with low slippage on <a href=\"http://Curve.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Curve.fi</a> by using the <a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-279/deposit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">STBT/3CRV pool</a>.

If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>STBT mitigates contract and operational risks through the implementation of a whitelist mechanism, time-lock contracts, and an independent real-time monitoring system, ensuring the highest level of safety and security.</p>\n<p>In order to further prevent operational and hacking risks, Matrixdock has implemented two separated sets of monitoring systems:</p>\n<p>A. The first system monitors the difference between the business order data and the contract activity data to detect any unauthorized minting of STBT tokens. Any suspicious activity can be immediately canceled, and emergency plans activated.</p>\n<p>B. The second system monitors the difference between the confirmation fiat wiring amount and the contract activity data. This monitoring service is independently maintained and monitored to identify any anomaly.</p>\n<p>The STBT minter contract only allows whitelisted wallets to call this contract directly and mint/redeem STBT. In this way, all key actions initiated through the minter contract, such as Mint, Burn, Settle, will be transparently tracked on-chain, ensuring full transparency and allowing for the tracking of all capital flows and information related to the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps, OTC agreements)?</strong></p>\n<p>No, STBT does not rely on any derivative products.</p>\n<p><strong>8. List all the third party counterparties linked to your assets including and not restricted to prime broker if any, custodian, reporting agent, banks for derivatives or loans and provide primary contact details for the third party counterparties</strong></p>\n<p>Please refer to the email.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock team strictly adheres to standard operating procedures (SOPs) for daily operations and ensures that the net asset value (NAV) of underlying assets is always no less than the total supply of STBT. These reports are uploaded on-chain daily, which allows for complete transparency and minimizes operational risks. The STBT contract has included Chainlink PoR verification logic to ensure STBT underlying reserve is greater than or equal to the total supply at all time.(<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xad4A9bED9a5E2c1c9a6E43D35Db53c83873dd901#readContract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chainlink Onchain Verification</a> )</p>\n<p>STBT is issued under an orphan SPV structure commonly adopted in asset-backed securities issuance by traditional financial organizations, which has the highest degree of credit enhancement.

Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>STBT has been used in various DeFi protocols in several functions, including being the underlying assets for stablecoins, yield-generating products and collateral for loans.</p>\n<p>At Verified USD foundation, USDV stablecoin is minted using STBT as the underlying RWA token, providing yield to ecosystem participants. At T-Protocol and Term Finance, STBT has also been used in collateralized loans, enabling capital efficiency through its strong composability with lending platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>The permission framework of the STBT contract is broadly classified into three distinct roles: ControllerRole, IssuerRole, ModeratorRole. The proposal is to designate a single smart contract with a timelock function as the controller contract for all three roles. All STBT administrator activities are carried out via this controller contract, with each operation subject to two stages of proposing and executing, and the execution must conform to the delay specified by the timelock. The overall structure is as follows:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1a97c86bf83b32575e9d59c095ab122f9f5779e8.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3NfBFzEv0NkcyzGcJuIL3CbJD6g.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a97c86bf83b32575e9d59c095ab122f9f5779e8_2_465x219.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"3NfBFzEv0NkcyzGcJuIL3CbJD6g\" width=\"465\" height=\"219\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a97c86bf83b32575e9d59c095ab122f9f5779e8_2_465x219.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a97c86bf83b32575e9d59c095ab122f9f5779e8_2_697x328.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a97c86bf83b32575e9d59c095ab122f9f5779e8_2_930x438.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DDE5EE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Timelock contract: There is a single external control smart contract with a timelock function as the controller contract, through which all STBT administrator activities are carried out. Each operation must go through two stages of proposing and executing, with execution conforming to the 4-hour delay specified by the timelock.</p>\n<p>The timelock contract is the only admin, and the security of the STBT contract is normalized to the security of each role involved in the timelock controller: proposer, executor, and canceller. The canceller is one self-hosted hardware wallet that is authorized to cancel an operation scheduled during the timelock period by calling the timelock controller.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<p>ERC1400 standard is split into several modular sub-standards：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>ERC1410 defines partially fungible tokens where balances of tokens can have an associated metadata</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ERC1594 defines transfer restrictions and core security token functionality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ERC1643 defines document management functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ERC1644 defines controller operation functionality</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular, the STBT token contract implements the ERC1594 transfer restrictions specs, and the ERC1644 controller operations specs. STBT utilizes the whitelist mechanism to determine whether transmission and reception of addresses are authorized.</p>\n<p><strong>Supplementary</strong></p>\n<p>Transparency Panel of STBT is the first in the industry to leverage on recognized third-party independent oversight to enhance greater transparency. The panel consists of reputable members from Verified USD Foundation, LayerZero Labs and Curve Finance. Panel members provide third-party verification of off-chain assets through direct view-only access of STBT’s bank and broker accounts. Monthly updates are published on the STBT website transparency page.</p>\n<p>Should STBT be a successful inclusion to STEP, it would be possible for an appointed member of Arbitrum DAO or STEP’s program manager to potentially join the Transparency Panel.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/matrixdock-stbt-step-application/23584\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/matrixdock-stbt-step-application/23584","pubDate":"Thu, 02 May 2024 02:09:08 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23584"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/matrixdock-stbt-step-application/23584.rss","#text":"Matrixdock STBT - STEP Application"}},{"title":"Revest (Resonate) STEP Application","dc:creator":"Scooter","category":"STEP Applications","description":"<p>Questionnaire - May 1st.

What would we change with oARB if Dolomite is granted STIP.B?<br>\nThe primary complaint we heard from users with significant capital deposited was that completing tasks from the XP program is not feasible from such high-value wallets. In exchange for the capital they’re providing, they really wanted Dolomite to implement a threshold number (like $100,000+ in net equity across their deposits/positions) that allows them to receive the 3.75% preferential discount per week. This way we can still encourage high net worth users to participate who, for various reasons, feel like they cannot utilize the XP program.

We propose the inclusion of StakeUp’s stTBY, a stable asset backed by corporate debt overcollateralized by US Treasury Bills (T-Bills)–a scalable asset.</p>\n<p>Below I will describe why TBY and stTBY products are a suitable fit for DeFi and Arbitrums vision for STEP framework and could potentially offer a lower-risk profile compared to other stablecoins and on-chain US T-bills:</p>\n<p><strong>What is a TBY?</strong></p>\n<p>TBY, or Term Bound Yield, is a token issued by the Bloom protocol. It represents a fixed-income loan asset that is freely transferable and operates entirely on-chain. TBYs are designed to produce yields comparable to a 6-month U.S. Treasury Bill. They are unique because they offer accessibility to DeFi markets (permissionless) while maintaining a yield close or the same to traditional financial benchmarks. The yield is derived by commercial loan arrangements in which users lend USDC in a closed loop peer-to-pool model to a KYC borrower that is 102% overcollateralized with tokenized US treasuries. All collateral is held verifiably on-chain and debt is always repaid before the borrower realizes any return. Therefore, the TBYs have a similar economic risk profile to the underlying collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>Supporting Docs</strong><br>\nBloom: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation\">https://docs.bloom.garden/</a><br>\nTBY: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation\">https://docsend.com/view/ywukpt8kbqpg5m76/d/3kc3thbyrx48ku3z</a><br>\n<strong>Product Details</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gW4KSgml7oEKBsyO4SCD5Xt6EPK.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.22.16\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28_2_690x191.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.22.16\" data-base62-sha1=\"gW4KSgml7oEKBsyO4SCD5Xt6EPK\" width=\"690\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28_2_690x191.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28_2_1035x286.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ACACAC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b4e9e690793f32dab9cfb2ff7244d7f94cd30c2d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pOr4CmgOqEaU6JHC3z0wA6dxn7n.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.23.18\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b4e9e690793f32dab9cfb2ff7244d7f94cd30c2d.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.23.18\" data-base62-sha1=\"pOr4CmgOqEaU6JHC3z0wA6dxn7n\" width=\"690\" height=\"148\" data-dominant-color=\"A8A8A8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>The Underlying</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8a48e00c2ecd0f15cd2f719c4be3762800120363.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/jJk1zcL2xkTkB5ulB7PKr58S35N.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.24.00\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8a48e00c2ecd0f15cd2f719c4be3762800120363.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.24.00\" data-base62-sha1=\"jJk1zcL2xkTkB5ulB7PKr58S35N\" width=\"690\" height=\"152\" data-dominant-color=\"B0B0B0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>What is stTBY?</strong></p>\n<p>Staked TBY (stTBY) is a liquid yield vault for USDC, or a USDC LST, offered by the StakeUp protocol, and is pegged 1:1 to USDC.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Arbitrum is seeking to diversify its treasury into stable, liquid and yield earning assets. Chateau’s Reverse Repo product (CRR.D) checks all of these boxes by providing a 5.24% yield and offering T+0 redemption. Furthermore, CRR.D has a minimum investment size of $1, and is freely tradable and composable once minted.</p>\n<p>CRR.D is a debt product launched by the Chateau Capital team, an Arbitrum-native RWA platform that seeks to bring institutional-grade debt and equity instruments on-chain. We focus heavily on compliance and DeFi composability, to ensure that we are building a platform that is in line with Arbitrum’s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We are working directly with Hashnote which is a leader in the institutional DeFi space, with over 50 years of TradFi experience and tens of millions of $ in AUM. By bringing this product to the Arbitrum ecosystem, we also open the door for a deeper relationship between Hashnote and Arbitrum (currently they are focused on mainnet).</p>\n<p>There’s also 2 key aspects that we believe are worth emphasizing:</p>\n<p><strong>(i) Chateau is an Arbitrum-first platform.</strong> Unlike other projects that have chosen to prioritize other blockchains, the Chateau team is unapologetically focused on Arbitrum DeFi. Choosing Chateau as a service provider would send a strong signal to teams as to why they should focus on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>(ii) Chateau has a wider range of products than any other service providers.</strong> To truly drive more TVL via RWAs, Arbitrum must eventually expand beyond basic debt products. We have already launched Chateau Alternative Debt (CHAD.D) in partnership with Wall Street firm Covenant Venture Capital BVI. The product has a preferred return of 15% (averaging 18-21% since 2011) with no principal drawdown.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we will soon be launching private equity products including: OpenAI, Anthropic, MenloMicro, etc. We believe these RWA equity products will unlock massive demand that the current set of debt products cannot drive.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>Chateau Reverse Repo product (CRR.D) provides access to Hashnote’s Short Duration Yield Fund (USYC).</p>\n<p>Hashnote Short Duration Yield Fund invests in short-term U.S. Treasury Bills and performs repo / reverse repo activity as the underlying asset of the USYC token.</p>\n<p>USYC earns short-term risk-free rate returns. The fund benefits from the transaction speed, transparency, and composability of tokenization while eliminating virtually all of the protocol, custody, regulatory, and credit risks associated with other token projects.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(i) Segregated Accounts:</strong></p>\n<p>Hashnote ensures that all assets invested in the USYC product are held in segregated accounts. This means that Arbitrum’s assets are kept separate from the assets of Hashnote and other investors, thereby safeguarding your investment in the event of a bankruptcy of the brokerage or financial institution.</p>\n<p><strong>(ii) Custodial Arrangements:</strong></p>\n<p>Hashnote partners with highly reputable custodians, such as BNY Mellon, to manage the custody of the assets. Additionally, Komainu provides custody support for USYC, offering elevated capital efficiency for institutions. These institutions are well-regulated and adhere to stringent financial standards, further reducing the risk of financial failure.</p>\n<p>Custodial Oversight: The custodians are subject to regular audits and regulatory oversight, ensuring that they maintain high levels of financial health and operational integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset?

Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>The exact tax consequences depend on the tax jurisdiction of Arbitrum DAO and the legal entity making this investment</p>\n<p>When transacting in Hashnote’s USYC product and receiving yield, the anticipated tax consequences are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong>: If USYC tokens are sold at a profit, the gain may be subject to capital gains tax. The tax rate depends on the holding period: gains on tokens held for less than a year are taxed as short-term gains at ordinary income rates, while those held for longer are taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates, which range from 0% to 20% depending on your income.</p>\n<p><strong>Income from Yield:</strong> The yield generated from USYC, derived from investments in U.S. Treasury Bills and repo agreements, is treated as interest income, which is taxable at the federal level as ordinary income. However, interest from U.S. Treasury Bills is exempt from state and local taxes.</p>\n<p>Hashnote will generate the necessary tax forms for Arbitrum at the end of the year.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>Liquidation of CRR.D tokens into USDC can occur same day, or T+1 if the redemption request happens past 2pm EST cut off time.</p>\n<p><strong>10.

Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p>Reverse Repos are the most liquid yield bearing asset in the world, as they represent overnight lending accounts at the Federal Reserve, and can be withdrawn daily unlike T-bills which carry a duration risk. They have essentially 0 stability risk, due to the Fed’s ability to issue currency infinitely. Please review Hashnote’s USYC application for more information on settlement and redemption.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>The main risks are:</p>\n<p>Smart Contract Risk for the ERC7540 CRR.D issuance contract and Hashnote USYC contracts.</p>\n<p>Chateau’s mitigations:<br>\ni. Audits with reputable firms for the contracts.<br>\nii. Using multisig wallets to custody funds and interact with the contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>13.

As with any direct to consumer grants program, a number of factors can affect the results of the applied incentives. Guided by our KPIs and the overarching KPIs, we modified the allocation of the STIP rewards almost each epoch.</p>\n<p>The STIP program coincided with the launch of Perennial’s V2. This offered an opportunity to see its new mechanism in action. We saw makers take advantage of native leverage over the length of the program with Total Available Liquidity peaking at a multiple of 4.9x the TVL in the protocol. This efficiency is key to providing traders the best liquidity to trade with &amp; offer sophisticated makers greater capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>We found that applying incentives on newer markets helped de-risk them for makers and allowed us to experiment with new payoffs and price feeds. We’ll aim to continue this approach in the STIP bridge as it helps bring diversity to the Arbitrum perps landscape. Another learning was that OI rewards are a fickle tool that can attract mercenary capital. We experimented for two weeks and then removed them in favor of more sustainable mechanisms or subsidies.</p>\n<p>A key outcome was de-risking the unique protocol design of Perennial V2 to building inside and outside the ecosystem. We aimed to bring dev teams to Arbitrum and the STIP has helped us secure a number of key partnerships with teams like Kwenta (Optimism).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-7\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: In parallel to this STIP Bridge proposal, Perennial has a stand alone proposal to the DAO with Kwenta to build an incentives package to best support their launch on Arbitrum.

Its permissionless fashion allows its holders to trade and utilize the coin without restrictions, besides interacting with US holders and other sanctioned jurisdictions (see <a href=\"https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Terms and Conditions</a>). Mountain Protocol Limited is a prudentially regulated entity by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (License <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#202302512</span>), safeguarding holders rights.</p>\n<p>All USDM is backed by short-term Treasury Bills, with an average maturity of 60 days, and with an overcollateralization rate of ~5%. USDM has 1:1 mint and redemption capacity for USDC and USD. There are no mint nor redemption fees. All these imply a very low market and protocol risk, securing a coin pegged to $1 with costs reduced to minimum.</p>\n<p>USDM supports Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem by providing a very low risk building block that can be composed easily by virtue of being a permissionless ERC20. Examples of this are the existing USDM/USDC Curve pools and the upcoming USDM/hnUSD, wUSDM/wstETH, and wUSDM/Grai pools, as well as the usage of USDM for SOFR interest rate swaps (by IPOR) and the usage of USDM as collateral on derivative protocols (by HMX and AARK).</p>\n<p>USDM has also been approved by the BMA, the largest global reinsurance regulator, for usage as collateral for insurance policies via Nayms for a Florida Hurricane policy. This is a case example of USDM enabling real world use cases of crypto in regulated industries.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

This resulted in a scenario where the increase in TVL to the Jones protocol was greater than the ARB amount distributed for the vast amount of time during the campaign.</p>\n<p>Alongside new deposits, incentivized Jones strategies such as jGLP grew in market value. For users, this was a great outcome as they received rewards from one of the most simple campaigns around, while being able to capture the effects of an upward-trending market, which provided them an incredible STIP experience!</p>\n<p><strong>6. [Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the lessons we learned from STIP is that, to amplify success, we need to foster more cooperation and collaboration with partners ahead of STIP campaign launch. One of the campaigns we wished had a stronger presence was our campaign for wjAURA. While the rewards for wjAURA on Arbitrum were great, we did not see as much composability &amp; cooperation from partners as we would have liked, and the utility of this product on the new chain (the result of a migration from ETH Mainnet to Arbitrum) didn’t grow as much as we wanted. This resulted in the lion’s share of rewards being absorbed by whales with a large wjAURA presence on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We were not unhappy with the campaign, since the overall number of users and TVL of the jAURA strategy increased, but we want to make sure people are staying with the protocol and more importantly, staying on Arbitrum. This is why we think that downsizing the relative % amount of rewards, plus targeting Arbitrum ecosystem integrations over the product itself, could be a way to have more capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Another lesson would be to focus more on retention after the conclusion of our campaign.</p>\n<p>For jGLP, we experienced a decrease in TVL after the STIP campaign concluded. By studying the top wallets holding jGLP, and by interviewing some of our user base, we can confidently assert that the new tokens stayed within the Arbitrum ecosystem, and specifically stayed in the GMX ecosystem, where they migrated to GMX V2 after rewards ceased. We hope that by launching a brand new incentives campaign centered around our new GMX V2 vault strategy, we will bring many of those users back to Jones and keep them satisfied for the long term, increasing the retention rate. Better performance in retaining TVL after the end of this iteration of the program would mean a marked improvement in the performance of our campaign.</p>\n<p>Finally, in our initial STIP campaign, we wanted to deploy a portion of the incentives towards our new product, jLP. jLP is a concentrated liquidity manager that is highly composable, with specific innovations that give it the Jones ‘touch’. We effectively released jLP in a beta state (labeled under “Jones Lab”) to gather initial feedback from users in terms of overall experience. After gathering this feedback and gathering data, we were not satisfied that the results produced were suitable for a STIP campaign that would provide enough value to users. As a consequence, we have been working for the last 4 months on the underlying infrastructure to be able to achieve the functionalities mentioned above as well as others beyond that scope. This time, we plan to utilize a portion of the STIP rewards to bootstrap this new revamped product.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7. How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>1M ARB (50% of the original STIP amount)</p>\n<p><strong>8. Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal? [Y/N]</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>9. [Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>We plan to allocate as following:</p>\n<p><strong>Partners Building on wjAURA:</strong> 0% - 12.5% (target: 10%)</p>\n<p>Users will be incentivised towards locking their wjAURA with partners (Isekai for example), that will effectively indefinitely lock the deposited wjAURA on Arbitrum. This guarantees a constant utility &amp; presence on Arbitrum for a product born on Ethereum Mainnet.</p>\n<p><strong>New Tokenomics:</strong> 0% - 12.5% (target: 10%)</p>\n<p>Jones will release a new token format with a gamified mechanism for locking and redeeming tokens, alongside the ability to participate in strategic token purchases derived from protocol revenue. ARB rewards will be used to incentivise the conversion and locking of JONES tokens. This product is currently in audit and should be released during May.</p>\n<p><strong>For the jGM/jUSDC Ecosystem:</strong> 30% - 80% (target: 45%)</p>\n<p>ARB tokens for the jGM/jUSDC ecosystem are expected to be distributed in three parts. On one side to incentivise deposits and boost jUSDC APR, on another to bootstrap and boost jGM APR, and the last for partners who could offer integrations such as lending &amp; borrowing markets on top of these strategies (ie: Dolomite for example).</p>\n<p>The split between jGM, jUSDC, and partners will be established on a week to week basis, since these strategies may receive yield boosts that will potentially be subject to other incentives placed on top by integrators. jGM will allow people to enjoy a product similar in structure to jGLP, in which a basket of GM tokens (gmETH, gmBTC, gmARB, gmSOL, among others) will be leveraged and algorithmically balanced against the borrowed USDC tokens provided by the jUSDC vault, which will enjoy a portion of the yield generated by jGM. jGM is currently in audit and should be released during May</p>\n<p><strong>For the jLP Ecosystem:</strong> 0% - 45% (target: 35%)</p>\n<p>As highlighted above in section 6, jLP will be the full iteration of our current Jones Labs automated V3 liquidity strategy offering, which is currently open to users. The vaults will have new innovations like: bull / bear / neutral strategies, limit / exit orders, and other functionalities that are not available in other products which will be announced on launch. The revamped infrastructure is currently going through audit and should be released during the first half of the STIP bridge.</p>\n<p>We will also attempt to coordinate with partners, especially lenders, to be able to spin up composable utility for the vault tokens right away. We plan to support of Uniswap and Camelot from day 1 (Camelot already publicly supported, Uniswap supported on our backend), and to open vaults specifically for blue chip pairs (ie: ARBETH, ETHUSDC) and other native arbitrum coins, with neutral(s), bull, and bear strategies available at launch.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution Strategy:</strong><br>\nOur strategy relies not only on products that we are confident will be released within the specified timeline, but also agreements with partners which may require development of some infrastructure. This is the reason why we have provided specific ranges and why, in general, we want to reserve the right to redirect any or all of the incentives outlined towards certain subsets of products to others. Accordingly, not only market conditions but also the agreements of aforementioned partners may have an impact.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>jUSDC: 0xB0BDE111812EAC913b392D80D51966eC977bE3A2 - This contract was recently re-deployed as a result of upgrades made to jUSDC that enabled the addition of the jGM strategy.</p>\n<p>jGM: TBD</p>\n<p>wjAURA OFT (Arbitrum): 0xcB9295ac65De60373A25C18d2044D517ed5da8A9</p>\n<p>jLP: TBD</p>\n<p><strong>11. Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<p>We think looking at ecosystems like Optimism &amp; Uniswap, with fleshed out governance models, would be great for the Arbitrum DAO team to take some notes from. Arbitrum is a different DAO: likely the most decentralized available and also the one with the highest amount of participation. For this reason, the goal is not to copy, but to iterate and improve on what they have already done.</p>\n<p>In terms of support via official tracking sites, it would be very attractive to see in-house versions of the 3rd-party information that was shared by the community during the lead up to STIP Round 1. These information spreadsheets and sites covered things such as: how much ARB each protocol was asking for, which protocols passed quorum, and which protocols were likely to receive their grants. A centralized hub for info on the incentive program, and if possible on all incentive programs, would be immensely helpful for transparency and project discovery.</p>\n<p>Learning from other ecosystems and implementing official tracking tools will make it easier for the DAO to help Arbitrum grow and create opportunities for protocols &amp; users to attract more attention to the chain by word-of-mouth or targeted marketing.</p>\n<p>Finally, having measurement metrics that take into account what has happened on Arbitrum, and more specifically protocols on Arbitrum, normalized for what has also happened in the market, would be a good way to properly understand the effectiveness of these programs.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/jones-stip-addendum/23570\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/jones-stip-addendum/23570","pubDate":"Wed, 01 May 2024 21:22:08 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23570"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/jones-stip-addendum/23570.rss","#text":"Jones STIP Addendum"}},{"title":"OpenEden $TBILL STEP Application","dc:creator":"OpenEdenLabs","category":"STEP Applications","description":"<h1><a name=\"applicant-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#applicant-information-1\"></a>Applicant information</h1>\n<p><strong>Name</strong>: OpenEden Group<br>\n<strong>Address (Headquarters)</strong>: 1 Kim Seng Promenade <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#11-01</span> Great World City<br>\n<strong>City, State, Postal Code</strong>: Singapore, 237994<br>\n<strong>Country</strong>: Singapore<br>\n<strong>Website</strong>: <a href=\"https://openeden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://openeden.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Primary contact</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Name</strong>: Jeremy Ng<br>\n<strong>Title</strong>: Co-Founder<br>\n<strong>Country</strong>: Singapore<br>\n<strong>Email</strong>: <a href=\"mailto:jeremy.ng@openeden.com\">jeremy.ng@openeden.com</a><br>\n<strong>Telegram</strong>: <span class=\"mention\">@ly3333</span><br>\n<strong>Forum</strong>: OpenEdenLabs</p>\n<h1><a name=\"executive-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#executive-summary-2\"></a>Executive Summary</h1>\n<p><em><strong>The First Native On-chain TBILL Vault with Arbitrum as a Core Focus</strong></em><br>\nThe OpenEden Tokenised U.S. Treasury Bill Fund (“TBILL Fund” or “Fund” or “Token Issuer”) is the first regulated U.S Treasury Bills Fund that is offered 24/7/365 on-chain through the <a href=\"https://app.openeden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenEden TBILL Vault</a> (“OE TBILL Vault”). The OETBILL Vault is deployed natively on Arbitrum and Ethereum offering a DeFI UI/UX while offering the most institutional-grade and compliant access to U.S. Treasury Bills (“T-Bills”) yield on-chain. Having launched the Fund in April 2023, The TBILL Fund has a 1 year live track record which ranks amongst the longest in the market. Being the only on-chain native vault that utilises smart-contract technologies for settlement, there is much resources and planning from the team to deploy on Arbitrum natively, thereby showcasing the clear commitment to the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p><em><strong>A Robust Regulatory-First Approach for a Global Audience</strong></em><br>\nOpenEden’s TBILL tokens (“$TBILL”) are issued by The TBILL Fund, which is a British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission (“BVIFSC”) regulated professional fund established under the British Virgin Islands Securities and Investment Business Act 2010. The bankruptcy-remote TBILL Fund is managed by OpenEden’s affiliated entity, which is a Registered Fund Management Company regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). The investment manager of the TBILL Fund operates under an investment mandate to invest in short-dated T-Bills. $TBILL tokens of the Fund can be offered to Non-U.S Professional Investors defined under BVI SIBA Act and to U.S Accredited Investors defined under U.S Securities Act of 1993 Rule 501a (the Fund had filed SEC Form D Notice to offer under Reg D 506c)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Truly Crypto-native, Transparent and 24/7/365 Real-time Access</strong></em><br>\n$TBILL tokens can be minted instantly 24/7/365 on-chain via the OETBILL Vault using USDC, and $TBILL tokens are held in the investor’s self-custodial wallet. The OE TBILL Vault is currently the market’s only platform that offers real-time, instant on-chain minting of T-Bill backed tokens, thus removing settlement risks and allowing investors to earn yield from the point of minting till the point of redemption, maximising capital efficiency.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Institutional-grade Foundation with Best-in-Class Partners</strong></em><br>\nThe TBILL Fund’s portfolio of T-Bills are bought, sold and custodised through the Fund’s licensed Prime Broker, UK FCA registered StoneX Financial Limited, and custodised in the Prime Broker’s licensed sub-custodian, being BNP Paribas Bank, New York in segregated accounts. As the Token Issuer is a regulated fund managed by a regulated fund manager, there are stringent regulatory requirements including the appointment of an independent fund administrator to (i) provide independent daily valuation of the $TBILL token’s NAV; and (ii) participate as an independent multi-sig party for all fund asset transfer transactions as an additional safeguard against fraud. The Fund has also appointed KPMG as its tax advisor and is subject to annual audits on its balance sheet and financials. Ernst &amp; Young has also recently completed an independent audit on the OE TBILL Vault’s critical processes and controls in relation to the TBILL Fund’s KYC procedures, valuation methodologies and the Fund’s asset transfer and custody procedures and controls. OpenEden is proud to have achieved a satisfactory audit report with no critical or high risk findings.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-information-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-information-3\"></a>Key Information</h1>\n<p><strong>1.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong><br>\nFrom a treasury management perspective, the investment into the TBILL Fund via the OE TBILL Vault will provide healthy asset diversification for the Arbitrum treasury which is currently primarily held in Arbitrum native tokens. U.S. T-Bills are considered one of the safest assets in global markets being backed by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. Federal Government, and will only default when the U.S. government defaults, and currently provide a risk-free yield of over 5%. U.S. Treasury Bills are one of the least volatile asset classes in the world and are uncorrelated to the ARB token’s price. This diversification reduces the volatility of the Arbitrum treasury’s portfolio and aligns with the goal of capital preservation and increasing risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>From an ecosystem perspective, investment into native RWA projects on the ecosystem, such as the OpenEden Arbitrum TBILL Vault, shows the Arbitrum foundation’s support and commitment towards driving the growth of the RWA sector on the Arbitrum network. This would instil confidence in the overall RWA sector on Arbitrum and boost participation in RWA projects from different groups of stakeholders on the network. Ultimately, OpenEden’s goal is for Arbitrum to become one of the leading blockchain ecosystems for RWA projects in terms of TVL, composability, utility and activity.</p>\n<p>OpenEden is committed to allocating incentives to users of its products launched natively on Arbitrum, aiding in evangelising and promoting greater adoption for the Arbitrum RWA ecosystem. We are already in several conversations with key projects and stakeholders of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. Even in our future product roadmap, we are already in deep discussions with some Arbitrum-native projects in partnering our second product. Further, from OpenEden’s network of partners, we are also promoting the alignment to Arbitrum and this gives us the potential to aid in cross-sell.</p>\n<p>We are truly Arbitrum-aligned given how we have selected Arbitrum ahead of several other blockchains because we firmly believe in what Arbitrum stands for (“Home for DeFi”) and in its superior traits over its current peers. The amount of resources being utilizied to build the first native on-chain vault on Arbitrum with smart contract technology for settlement cannot be understated.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Has your entity or its officers/key contributors been subject to an enforcement action, criminal action, or defaulted on legal or financial obligations? Please describe the circumstances if so.</strong><br>\nNo.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Describe any conflicts of interest for your entity and key personnel.</strong><br>\nThere are no unmitigated conflicts of interest. The Fund has engaged OpenEden Labs (“OEL”) and Adam Eve Capital (“AEC”), both of which are wholly owned Group entities, as technology service provider and investment manager respectively. There has been disclosure of such arrangements in the Fund’s offering documents and the relevant service contracts, investment management agreements and conflicts of interest policies in place. To mitigate operational risks of such conflicts, a third party fund administrator has been appointed by the Fund to serve as an independent multi-signature approver in relation to approving the whitelisting of addresses and transfers between whitelisted wallet addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Insurance coverages, guarantees, and backstops</strong><br>\nOpenEden has assessed the risks of loss in the context of its issuance of $TBILL and has determined that obtaining insurance coverage is not required due to the legal structuring and technical capabilities of the Fund, OE TBILL Vault and $TBILL.</p>\n<p>The Fund is a regulated BVI professional fund which is managed by AEC, a MAS regulated fund management company. AEC and the Fund are subject to strict requirements from their respective regulatory bodies with respect to the independent custody of the Fund’s assets, which underpin the $TBILL token. Ernst &amp; Young has also recently completed an independent audit on the OE TBILL Vault’s critical processes and controls in relation to the Fund’s KYC procedures, valuation methodologies and the Fund’s asset transfer and custody procedures and controls. OpenEden is proud to have achieved a satisfactory audit report with no critical or high risk findings, demonstrating that the Fund has in place good risk control against fraud and mishandling of assets which could potentially cause losses to the $TBILL holders.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s investment mandate also limits the Fund’s portfolio to containing only short-term US Government Treasuries (ie. less than 6 month maturity with the current portfolio’s weighted average maturity being less than 50 days), ensuring that the Fund’s assets are liquid. $TBILL holders also have priority over the Fund’s management shareholders in the event of a distribution of the Fund’s assets by way of a legally enforceable subordination deed.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s underlying US Government Treasury assets as well as a small amount of USD are also held in segregated accounts with regulated custodians appointed by the Fund, currently UK FCA registered StoneX Financial Limited, with sub-custody handled by BNP Paribas New York. This reduces the risk of loss of the Fund’s underlying assets which back the $TBILL’s NAV through blockchain related hacks or exploits.</p>\n<p>The $TBILL itself cannot be transferred to non-whitelisted wallets, the process of which is safeguarded by multi-signature approval process involving independent third party signatories. The OE TBILL Vault also has the technical capability to respond to potential hacks/losses suffered by $TBILL holders by cancelling stolen/misappropriated $TBILLs and re-issuing them to affected $TBILL holders.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Historical tracking error in your proposed product, or similar to that being proposed product</strong><br>\nNone. There is no tracking error because the $TBILL is backed by directly held U.S. Treasury Bills. OpenEden uses live market data provided by London Stock Exchange Group (“LSEG”) to provide 24/7 live price of the $TBILL, which is the reflection of the NAV of the Fund. Unlike some other tokenised RWA products that invest into ETFs which can exhibit tracking error to the underlying assets.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Brief reason for above tracking error</strong><br>\nNot applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Please describe any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organizational structures</strong><br>\nWhile the OpenEden team has not had prior experience working directly with decentralized organisational structures, we are strongly committed to support DAO communities and to provide high-quality treasury management services. Our Co-Founder Eugene has been investing and supporting crypto-native projects since 2017, and his HFT firm DWF Labs has since amassed more than 700 crypto projects with a number of DAO foundations. Through his extensive network of crypto-native connections, he would be able to bring much value and expertise in any formal DAO engagement. He was also a core member of a relatively small DAO called DAOvergence.</p>\n<p>OpenEden has onboarded multiple DAOs as users and thus is familiar and comfortable working with the often unique structures associated with DAOs.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What is your entity’s current assets under management, assets held in trust, total value locked, or equivalent metric for your legal structuring?</strong><br>\nThe total value locked (“TVL”) of the $TBILL is currently approximately US$30,971,129 (as of 30 April 2024).</p>\n<p><strong>11. How many of these assets held are present on Arbitrum One, if any?</strong><br>\nThe current TVL of the $TBILL held on Arbitrum is US$308,920 (as of 30 April 2024). The OpenEden Arbitrum TBILL Vault was officially launched in March 2024 and we expect TVL to increase on Arbitrum as we establish more partnerships with Defi Protocols within the ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"plan-design-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#plan-design-5\"></a>Plan design</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Product : OpenEden $TBILL</strong><br>\nAs previously explained above in this RFP, the issuer of the $TBILL, being the TBILL Fund, is a registered professional fund (“Fund”) established under the British Virgin Islands Securities and Investment Business Act 2010 (“SIBA”) and regulated by the BVIFSC. The TBILL Fund is managed by AEC (as defined above), a wholly owned subsidiary of the OpenEden Group, which operates as a registered fund management company under MAS supervision. The TBILL Fund operates the OE TBILL Vault, a smart contract vault that provides investors with direct exposure to a pool of short-dated U.S. T-Bills and overnight reverse repurchase agreements through the minting of the $TBILL. The $TBILL is backed 1:1 by short-dated U.S. T-Bills and a small portion of U.S. Dollar (“USD”) held in bankruptcy remote segregated accounts in the Fund’s name. $TBILLs can be minted instantly 24/7/365, allowing investors to earn yield backed by the U.S. government on their USDC subscription at the point-of-mint itself, rather than having to wait up to T+2 business days as compared to traditional funds.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault operates on a zero-trust protocol, ensuring that all transactions are fully atomic, automated, transparent and managed on-chain without manual intervention. The protocol smart contract dictates that $TBILL can only be minted in the presence of the underlying asset, USDC, thus ensuring each token is always backed by actual assets. This minimises reliance on trust, making our system more secure and transparent than traditional incumbents. The OE TBILL Vault does not have the capability to freely mint tokens, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised token creation.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault is a permissioned protocol, which means that an investor has to meet specific criteria before the investor is eligible to hold $TBILL issued by the Fund. The OE TBILL Vault is currently only accessible to “Professional Investors’’ as defined under SIBA and to U.S. “Accredited Investors’’ within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act. $TBILL can only be minted and redeemed via the OE TBILL Vault by whitelisted wallets that have been fully onboarded after completing the Fund’s KYC/KYB process. As a permissioned token, $TBILL are transferable between whitelisted wallets.</p>\n<p>The $TBILL is an EIP-20-compliant representation of an investor’s economic interest in the Fund. By depositing USDC and minting $TBILL, the investor will have legal rights to the redemption value of the net assets held by the Fund, proportional to the amount of $TBILL the investor holds relative to the total outstanding supply of $TBILL. The $TBILL minted by the investor are held in the investor’s whitelisted self custodial wallet.</p>\n<p>Whitelisted investors are also provided with access to the investor dashboard visible on the OE TBILL Vault dApp. The dashboard provides the investor with a real-time view of their $TBILL balance and their realised and unrealised P/L. Please find the sample screenshot of the investor dashboard displayed below.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/5833ea409ddfff4837a58a4f4a7fc1718dec618c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/cAhfbjg265O5W5LPRbyzZYuOasc.png?dl=1\" title=\"investor_dashboard\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/5833ea409ddfff4837a58a4f4a7fc1718dec618c_2_603x500.png\" alt=\"investor_dashboard\" data-base62-sha1=\"cAhfbjg265O5W5LPRbyzZYuOasc\" width=\"603\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/5833ea409ddfff4837a58a4f4a7fc1718dec618c_2_603x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/5833ea409ddfff4837a58a4f4a7fc1718dec618c_2_904x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/5833ea409ddfff4837a58a4f4a7fc1718dec618c_2_1206x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8FAF9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Investment strategy</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund aims to provide the highest possible level of income generation while maintaining liquidity and maximum safety of principal.

Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor or similar rights?</strong><br>\nInvestors who purchase $TBILL has legal rights governed by the terms of their subscription/purchase of $TBILL as set out in the Fund’s offering documents and T&amp;Cs.</p>\n<p>The primary rights of a $TBILL investor are the legal and contractual rights to the net redemption value of the underlying assets held by the Fund, and such rights/claims, including in the event of a distribution of the Fund’s assets where the Fund is being wound up, are ranked ahead of the management shareholders of the Fund via a legally enforceable subordination deed.</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, management shareholders do not have any economic participation rights to the assets of the Fund as management shares are no par value non-participating, non-redeemable, voting shares.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong><br>\nThe $TBILL issuer, being the TBILL Fund, is a registered professional fund incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and regulated by the BVIFSC. The Certificate of Recognition will be will be provided via private email.</p>\n<p>The investment manager of the Fund, being AEC, is a registered fund management company incorporated in Singapore and regulated by the MAS.</p>\n<p>As a regulatory requirement for registered professional funds, the Fund has to lodge a Private Placement Memorandum and Subscription/Redemption Agreement with the BVIFSC that documents all the contractual rights of $TBILL holders. The Fund also has to notify the BVIFSC of any appointments of service providers to the Fund.</p>\n<p>Every tokenholder has legal and contractual rights to the redemption value of the net assets held by the Fund, proportional to the amount of $TBILL the investor holds relative to the total outstanding supply of $TBILL.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong><br>\nYes, the Fund’s assets are segregated from the OpenEden Group companies, chiefly AEC (the investment manager), OEL (the technology service provider). . No operational capital of AEC or OEL are commingled with the Fund’s assets.</p>\n<p>As per relevant regulatory requirements, the Fund holds its assets with independent and regulated custodians and/or institutions in its own name and not in the name of any other OpenEden Group entity, ensuring proper segregation of assets from the operating accounts of the Fund Manager and Technology Service Provider. Digital wallet transfers from wallets held with licensed custodians are also subject to independent third-party multi-signatory approval from the Fund’s fund administrator to ensure additional control over the Fund’s assets.</p>\n<p>Each $TBILL holder’s rights are set out in the Fund’s offering documentation and they have legal and contractual rights to the net redemption value of the underlying assets held by the Fund, and such rights/claims are ranked ahead of the management shareholders of the Fund via a legally enforceable subordination deed. Management shareholders do not have economic participation rights to the underlying assets held by the Fund. All terms are documented in the Private Placement Memorandum (provided in Supplementary documents section).</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong><br>\nThe following excerpts are extracted from StoneX Financial Limited’s custody services contract with the Fund.</p>\n<p><em>Any securities which StoneX holds as safe custody assets for their clients will be deposited via their sub-custodian network. The sub-custodian(s) which StoneX use and their credit ratings are identified in the following table:</em></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Sub-custodian</th>\n<th>Standard &amp; Poor’s Rating</th>\n<th>Moody’s Rating</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>BNP Paribas S.A</td>\n<td>A+ as of 25th April 2022</td>\n<td>Aa3 as of 5th July 2022</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><em>Under the terms of the custody agreement(s) with StoneX’s sub-custodian(s), each sub-custodian will segregate in its books and registers any clients’ safe custody assets from their own securities. StoneX’s sub-custodian(s) will not have security or similar rights enabling it to dispose of clients’ safe custody assets except to satisfy obligations incurred by clients, or for payment for services related to the clients’ safe custody assets, meaning that clients’ safe custody assets will not be commingled with StoneX’s assets or exposed to the performance of StoneX’s assets.</em><br>\n<em>In providing the custody service, StoneX is subject to the oversight and supervision of its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. The arrangements which StoneX has put in place with its sub-custodian(s) give effect, in particular, to the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority’s CASS Sourcebook, under which StoneX has a regulatory obligation to ensure that any clients’ safe custody assets deposited with a sub-custodian are identifiable separately from its own assets and from the assets of its sub-custodian(s), for the purpose of ring-fencing clients’ assets in order to safeguard their ownership rights.</em></p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong><br>\nNo. The TBILL Fund Only issues $TBILL as a digital representation of the holder’s investment into the TBILL Fund. The TBILL Fund does not and will not be used to issue other products.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a detailed cash flow diagram that shows the flow of funds from ARB/Fiat conversion, investment in underlying asset, payment of expenses, sale of underlying asset, and repayment (Fiat/ARB conversion), including the counterparties and legal jurisdictions involved.</strong><br>\nIt is our understanding that the Arbitrum Foundation will be swapping ARB token into USDC (ARB) before depositing into OE TBILL Arbitrum Vault. Should the Foundation choose to deposit through the TBILL Ethereum Vault, the process is similar as well. The screenshot of the TBILL dAPP below shows how the Foundation can deposit USDC to mint $TBILL.

What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong><br>\nThere is no first-loss equity provided by the Issuer.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong><br>\nU.S. T-Bills trade more than $100 billion on a daily basis and is the world’s most liquid asset. It trades almost 24 hours a day on US business days from Tokyo 8am open to New York 5pm close. T-Bills can be traded (buy and sell) with same day settlement, therefore the Fund expects to process redemption within T+1 US business days.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong><br>\nIn managing blockchain-derived risks, OpenEden adheres to stringent security protocols, particularly concerning our smart contract operations. Prior to any deployment or upgrade of smart contracts, we mandate comprehensive audits conducted by third-party security firms. These audits are essential to identify and rectify vulnerabilities, ensuring the integrity and security of our blockchain transactions.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, OpenEden implements strict access controls to enhance the security of both on-chain and off-chain treasury management. We employ the dual control principle, which requires multiple authorizations for critical actions, thereby minimising the risk of unauthorised access or fraudulent activities. Additionally, we uphold the principle of segregation of duties across different operational roles to prevent conflicts of interest and promote accountability within our processes.</p>\n<p>OpenEden is also committed to strengthening our cybersecurity practices across all areas of operation. We are actively working towards achieving ISO 27001 security compliance, a widely recognized standard that will further fortify our cyber defence mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>13.

Can you explain how risk management (inv and operational) is being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Operational Risk Management</strong><br>\nAt OpenEden, we ensure operational security through a robust risk management approach that combines strict access controls with proactive monitoring. We utilise dual control and multi-signature protocols, requiring multiple authorizations for critical transactions and system accesses, supported by firm approval policies on platforms like Coinbase and Circle.</p>\n<p>Some key aspects of our risk management includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Strict Access Control: We enforce rigorous access requirements, utilising multi-factor authentication and role-based access controls to safeguard all system interactions.</li>\n<li>Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts: Our internal Slack channels are configured to instantly notify stakeholders of any unauthorised changes or price updates, enabling quick response and thorough investigation.</li>\n<li>On-Chain Price Guards: We deploy on-chain mechanisms to validate price updates before they affect oracles, with automatic halts in operations if discrepancies are detected to prevent erroneous data from impacting our operations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For detailed insights into our risk management strategies and protocols, a copy of our Technology Risk Management Policy will be provided via private email.</p>\n<p><strong>Investment Risk Management</strong><br>\nAEC, the investment manager of the Fund, has entered into an Investment Management Agreement with the Fund which dictates the investment strategy and mandate. There are also valuation policies that the investment manager adheres to. Both can be provided upon request.</p>\n<p>The manager takes a ladder approach when managing the underlying portfolio by diversifying across different maturities of the Treasury curve. The current weighted average maturity is ~41 days reflecting a very low duration risk and the portfolio is invested in the most liquid part of the curve.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that OpenEden has recently completed an independent audit by Ernst &amp; Young who performed a thorough review on the OE TBILL Vault and its processes which also included the investment manager’s handling of valuation and custody of the underlying assets of the Fund, covering the investment manager’s control over the purchase, sale, valuation and reconciliation of the underlying USD T-Bills and USD balances of the Fund.

Is the project permissioned? If so, how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong><br>\nYes, only users who have fully cleared KYC and satisfied the Fund’s onboarding requirements will be whitelisted. Only whitelisted addresses can interact with the TBILL Vault dapp and hold $TBILL. Transfers are only permissible between whitelisted addresses. Additionally, the vault has a blacklisting feature, where addresses identified as blacklisted are prohibited from transferring or interacting with the OE TBILL Vault, including subscribing for or redeeming $TBILL tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross chain interactions?</strong><br>\nThe product is available on Ethereum and Arbitrum networks. There are currently no cross-chain interactions between $TBILL on the two networks, though there may be plans for such integrations in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong><br>\n$TBILL tokens have been accepted as eligible collateral on Hidden Road Partners through a tri-party agreement between OpenEden, Zodia Custody and Hidden Road Partners. Discussions are currently ongoing for $TBILL to be used as collateral on lending/borrowing DeFi protocols, perpetual exchanges and others.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong><br>\nAll actions which require admin intervention (such as asset transfers between venues, modification of the USDC deposit address, etc) are protected by multi-sig or multi-approval mechanisms to prevent any single admin user from executing any actions individually. The Fund Administrator is also part of the list of multi-sig approvers to provide external third-party oversight over such actions.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the OE TBILL Vault operates with a strict protocol where $TBILL tokens can only be minted in the presence of the underlying asset, USDC. This process is entirely managed on-chain, distinguishing it from other systems where manual token issuance might occur. The vault does not possess the authority to freely mint tokens; it can only mint $TBILL tokens when equivalent USDC deposits are confirmed, ensuring that token creation is always backed by actual assets. This key feature minimises trust reliance, making our system inherently more secure and transparent compared to traditional incumbents in the space.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong><br>\nNo, the $TBILL is a standard ERC-20 token.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"supplementary-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#supplementary-9\"></a>Supplementary</h1>\n<p><strong>1.

Basics and background</h1>\n<p><strong>1. How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>KNOX is an RToken deployed with Reserve protocol. To help answer this question, let’s familiarize ourselves with Reserve.</p>\n<p>Reserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet (as well as Arbitrum and Base) to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming onchain. Figure 3 illustrates an RToken’s potential.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/bf388f1bddb0d66418f80a22dd1d037e6a49e30d.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"rhCnbDtUCZdNE8Jrrwiv2KLApQ1\" width=\"624\" height=\"273\" role=\"presentation\"><br>\n<em>Figure 3: What are RTokens?</em></p>\n<p>RTokens enjoy numerous advantages over holding naked tokenized assets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Responsible governance by stakers with capital at risk</li>\n<li>Overcollateralization shielding in case of depeg events</li>\n<li>Diversified backing</li>\n<li>Permissionless, free onchain deployment, minting and redeeming</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, Electronic Dollar (eUSD) was the first RToken and is a safety-first stablecoin (backed by Aave and Compound deposits) that brings together diversified, highly liquid backing with<a href=\"https://twitter.com/griffpeer/status/1766927506597114354\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> anti-bank run overcollateralization that currently exceeds more than the value of the TVL of the RToken itself</a>. eUSD has been chosen as the stablecoin for two retail user applications: 1)<a href=\"https://ugly.cash/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Ugly Cash 1</a> - an app that gives bank-like services to customers throughout LatAm, enabling them to receive USD remittance from the US at 0% fee and spend their eUSD with a debit card. 2)<a href=\"https://www.sentz.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Sentz 1</a> - an app built on the MobileCoin blockchain that enables users to send and receive payments globally from anyone you can text for (basically) free.</p>\n<p>So, how will this improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecoststem? <em>By deepening RWA liquidity on the network</em>.</p>\n<p>KNOX becomes a demonstration vehicle for additional RWA use cases within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Its promise lies both in its composition today but also its future potential integrations.</p>\n<p>KNOX is backed entirely by USDC, an onchain representation of a dollar in a bank account - an RWA. By minting KNOX, the Arbitrum Foundation will be deepening its RWA ecosystem as KNOX collateral is Aave and Compound USDC deposits - thereby deeping market liquidity and decreasing capital costs. Lower capital costs on Arbitrum may bring users from other networks to take advantage of network-specific protocols to maximize profitability and <a href=\"https://defillama.com/borrow?borrow=USD_STABLES&amp;incentives=true\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">in such a competitive market landscape every bit helps</a>.</p>\n<p>A STEP allocation could also encourage users familiar with Reserve to bridge to Arbitrum to take advantage of KNOX APY and may bring second order benefits for Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem such as deeper Compound / Aave liquidity and new users for Arbitrum protocols. This RToken mint could improve both Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem and Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Identify key management personnel and individual experience. Also include third parties utilized for managing assets and their qualifications.</strong></p>\n<p>The Reserve protocol and RTokens such as KNOX are governed onchain through smart contracts, transparently, by capital-risking, incentive-aligned RSR stakers. There are no middle-men involved in the operations of the Reserve protocol or KNOX.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, ABC Labs team members have been contributing to the Reserve protocol for the past 6 years.</p>\n<p>Thomas Mattimore, CEO of ABC Labs, previously led a team of 95 project managers, engineers, designers and data scientists automating the mortgage underwriting process as the company went through hypergrowth. His fintech experience informed his 6 year anon participation in DeFi and transition full-time into the space. He has overseen liquidity strategy at Reserve and has overseen protocol growth from $23M to ~$90M TVL in the past 7 months.</p>\n<p>Griffin Peer, liquidity lead at ABC Labs, has been working on crypto strategy since 2020 and was previously at <a href=\"https://www.dinara.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dinara</a>. He executes Reserve’s DeFi multichain liquidity strategy on a day to day basis and can be directly attributed to the previously mentioned liquidity growth.</p>\n<p>Taylor Brent, lead protocol engineer, started out at Google, working on distributed systems programming to handle data and run statistical analyses on natural-language processing data. He leads protocol design for Reserve and has been contributing to the ecosystem for as long as anyone.</p>\n<p>Meir Galimidi, ABC Labs’ lead researcher, previously worked bringing DTCC’s Trade Information Warehouse into Solidity with <a href=\"https://axoni.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Axoni.</a> He makes <a href=\"https://www.centerforllamas.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">granular research reports on how to best boost liquidity across ecosystems</a>, which has closely informed Griffin’s RToken growth success.</p>\n<p>River, the author of this proposal, cut his teeth on yield farms in downtime while running a dumpling restaurant.

Neither the KNOX creator nor ABC Labs have any control over the KNOX asset-backing which are transparently locked in smart contracts onchain and controlled by governance.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation’s assets are held in non-custodial smart contracts. Should KNOX collateral depeg, $RSR overcollateralization will go some distance to recapitalize Arbitrum’s KNOX. This mechanism has already been market stress tested during the<a href=\"https://blog.reserve.org/eusd-emerges-strong-the-resilience-of-reserve-protocol-during-usdc-depegging-e5a698a990c9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> USDC depeg of March 2023</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no formal issuer on the Reserve protocol given its fully onchain decentralized nature. Although ABC Labs does not deploy RTokens, the protocol has been used by others to deploy 1000+ RTokens assets accounting for ~$90M in TVL to date. Each RToken has independent governance, independent asset backing and independent overcollateralization. There is no priority between different RTokens or collateral.</p>\n<p>The KNOX RToken does have emergency collateral with different “diversity factors”, which represents the priority placed on each emergency collateral. KNOX’s emergency collateral is <a href=\"https://feature-arbitrum-support.reserve-register.pages.dev/arbitrum/token/0x0bbf664d46becc28593368c97236faa0fb397595/settings\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DAi, USDC and USDT</a> with a diversity factor of 2, which means 2 of the backup tokens are used to replace any single defaulting collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>Overcollateralization is provided by RSR stakers and driven by a combination of revenue distributed to stakers and risk profile of the RToken’s underlying collateral. Overcollateralization rates are set by the market. However, using other RTokens as yardsticks, somewhere between 11% overcollateralization <a href=\"https://app.reserve.org/ethereum/token/0xacdf0dba4b9839b96221a8487e9ca660a48212be/overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">(High Yield USD)</a> to 83% overcollateralization <a href=\"https://app.reserve.org/ethereum/token/0xa0d69e286b938e21cbf7e51d71f6a4c8918f482f/overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">($eUSD)</a> may be possible. With ~8% of $RSR’s circulating supply being staked, there is good evidence that this market mechanism functions as intended.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB</strong></p>\n<p>USDC is one of the most liquid assets onchain, with ~$10M Arbitrum liquidity and $100M mainnet liquidity (from <a href=\"http://defillama.com/liquidity\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">defillama.com/liquidity</a>). This is before considering the many hundreds of millions more on CEXs (the asset has a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usdc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$33B market capitalization</a>). Finally, if the The Arbitrum Foundation wishes to, it may access underlying USD through a redemption with Circle itself.

Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>ABC Labs has developed Reserve protocol smart contracts with risk management front and centre. Risk management is an ongoing process and monitoring tools such as <a href=\"https://www.hypernative.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hypernative alert the team</a> (located across all timezones) perpetually to important protocol activity. Aside from the 6 year development process, 8 (and counting) audits, $5M bug bounty previous stated, please see this addendum to ABC Labs risk management policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The protocol and collateral plugins are all heavily unit tested, with code coverage of 98% or above. They also have extensive integration tests, and exhaustive tests that test permutations of the most extreme configurations and states allowed by the protocol.</li>\n<li>Additionally, there are 3 separate echidna suites that fuzz the protocol. Every test must pass for a new release to make it to production</li>\n<li>No code is allowed to be used in production until it has been audited at least once with the majority of code in production being audited 3 or more times.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asset risk management for RToken collateral is conducted by RToken governors. Given that this is informal and decentralized, there is no codified risk management policy to attach. However, here is a brief insight into some of the considerations taken when discussing basket changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collateral asset: what is the underlying asset for the yield-bearing collateral? Does it have a <a href=\"http://bluechip.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bluechip.org</a> rating? What are its trust assumptions? How can it be redeemed? How deep is onchain liquidity? What are borrow rates on multiplier markets?</li>\n<li>Underlying protocols: how long have they held TVL? How many audits does the code have? Is there a bug bounty? How decentralized is parameter decision making? Is there a monolithic approach to risk management or is it more granular? Does it have an ITB Risk Radar rating? How have DeFiSafety scored it? How liquid is the collateral’s market? What is the RToken asset being supplied being borrowed collateralized with by borrowers?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://blog.reserve.org/comprehensive-risk-mitigation-at-reserve-protocol-68a724e9989e#a23f\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Comprehensive Risk Mitigation at Reserve protocol.</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-6-performance-reporting-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-6-performance-reporting-6\"></a>6. Performance reporting</h1>\n<p><strong>1. What are your proposed performance benchmarks? If this is substantially different from the underlying assets, please explain why.</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed performance benchmark is DAI Savings Rate. If KNOX provides sustained, higher comparable yield to its offering (currently 10%), then this treasury allocation is outperforming the benchmark DeFi rate and can be viewed as a success. KNOX is both diversified and enjoys an amount of overcollateralization, which presents advantages over a deposit into the DAI Savings Rate.</p>\n<p>Indeed, while KNOX’s current holder APY just meets that target, the revenue share structure (explained in supplementary) may more than compensate for that over the course of a year. It is also true that the market is in a minor downtrend at the moment, reducing Aave and Compound rates.</p>\n<p>Given that KNOX deposits collateral into lending markets, a utilization benchmark should also be pursued. One of the key value propositions of this treasury allocation by the Arbitrum Foundation is the second order benefits additional liquidity begets so these should be monitored.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the content, format, preparation process, and cadence of performance reports. This should include proof of reserves, if appropriate. Please include a sample report.</strong></p>\n<p>Performance reports would be placed in a thread on the Arbitrum forum and updated biweekly. They would include the following metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>KNOX APY for period</li>\n<li>Arbitrum Foundation Earnings for period (including both KNOX appreciation and 2.5% fee)</li>\n<li>KNOX collateral composition</li>\n<li>KNOX TVL</li>\n<li>KNOX overcollateralization ratios</li>\n<li>Aave and Compound USDC outstanding borrows</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lEPHYj8YG1oTgujN0IwRPxBlFJgFliFrQsC8Gs7xtxI/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">A sample comment can be viewed here. </a></p>\n<p><strong>3.

Nevertheless, these <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/usdp-oracle-manipulation-event-16th-april/17385\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">oracles are not flawless</a>.</li>\n<li><em>Governance risk</em>: it is not impossible that governance on each protocol may change parameters to allow unsafe loan-to-value ratios (for example) and accrue bad debt to the protocol. This is unlikely given the largely risk averse nature of contributors to both DAOs, as demonstrated by Aave delegates’ recent discussion on <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/aave-decides-to-reduce-makerdao-s-dai-collateral-after-proposal-to-completely-eliminate-it?ref=onepagecrypto.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DAI’s suitability as a collateral token. </a>\n<ul>\n<li>Indeed, should bad debt occur and Arbitrum’s deposits be irretrievable, both Aave (with its <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">safety module</a>) and Compound (with<a href=\"https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#total-reserves\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> its reserves</a>) offer additional capital to backstop this process. This exists before considerations about RToken overcollateralization come into play. This risk is measured.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, there is <em>custodian risk</em> from highly centralized Circle, with which USDC collateral is held. Circle is <a href=\"https://www.circle.com/en/transparency\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a highly transparent custodian</a>. Nevertheless, with DAOs holding ~$700M of the asset makes USDC the most popular way for DAOs to currently store value (outside of their own token / ETH).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Indeed, once more, as this DAO treasury mint is held in KNOX, it enjoys overcollateralization protection. <a href=\"https://blog.reserve.org/eusd-emerges-strong-the-resilience-of-reserve-protocol-during-usdc-depegging-e5a698a990c9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">This proved its worth during USDC’s depeg, with Electronic Dollar $eUSD being restored to peg the day after USDC depegged</a>, despite USDC holders not being made whole until days later.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is fair to say that the few trusted roles/admins managed in the system have had their potential impact minimized through the RToken system.

Indeed, an allocation now may turn into a self-sustaining form of revenue for the DAO. This directly aligns incentives between Reserve’s ecosystem and Arbitrum’s - which should mean a win for either is a win for both. A STEP allocation could kickstart this process.</p>\n<p><strong>2. KNOX’s age</strong></p>\n<p>As you can see, KNOX is a recent RToken. It was deployed less than a week before this application was submitted. As market participants know, there is no better endorsement than smart contracts holding funds for a long period of time.</p>\n<p>Given that Reserve contracts have been live now and crossed ~$90M in TVL across its deployments, it is not unreasonable to state that these assets have been proven. Even during the USDC depeg stress test, an <a href=\"https://blog.reserve.org/eusd-emerges-strong-the-resilience-of-reserve-protocol-during-usdc-depegging-e5a698a990c9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">internal RToken failsafe was triggered that further protected $eUSD holders.</a></p>\n<p>KNOX uses entirely the same code (with a small, audited modification to be compatible with Arbitrum’s faster blocktimes) as eUSD. The collateral is the same (there is a case to be made that it is safer with no USDT exposure), the KNOX RToken contract is (effectively) identical, the revenue handling is the same, the audits are on the same code, the testing has been done on the same code, the four risk types have been considered in the same way and the bug bounty is still the same $5M.</p>\n<p>ABC Labs contributors invested 6 years of rigorous system design and testing. KNOX inherits the provable resilience of the Reserve protocol’s other RTokens. KNOX is as safe as a mint into any other major RToken.</p>\n<p><strong>3. KNOX Governance</strong></p>\n<p>KNOX is a young asset but leverages tens of thousands of RSR holders and 18 months of live market governance experience with RSR stakers. The Reserve ecosystem may alternatively offer an interest-free loan to the Arbitrum Foundation if preferred so that the Foundation will have an influence on KNOX’s future. This staked RSR provides an additional revenue stream to the Arbitrum DAO in addition to governance influence.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"closing-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#closing-10\"></a>Closing</h1>\n<p>Thank you for your consideration and patience with these applications.

In the original STIP, the delegates were solely responsible for the full voting process, which placed a lot of strain on them, which was not fairly compensated for. The LTIPP’s solution of appointing and compensating council members was fair, although a suggestion is to provide payment on a per-proposal basis (rather than allocating a cost and having excessive demand, hence excessive work) to the council members. The bridge program further lifted off this load by implementing an optimistic voting approach, which is interesting</p>\n<p>Overall experience was pleasant as each team has the ability to
