This proposal intends to set up this subsidy fund, seeking $10 million worth of ARB to be administered and selected by the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ADPC’) to facilitate the selection of projects that will benefit from the whitelisted security audit service providers selected via the ADPC’s procurement framework. The ultimate decision will be made by the ADPC based on the Means Test and the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYCtfP_GqfjkKQafVr86hCpjEsQ2Ec4a/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Application Process Terms</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-request-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposal-request-3\"></a>Proposal Request</h1>\n<p>We propose the creation of a procurement subsidy fund allocating $10 million worth of ARB to provide financial assistance to both new and existing projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>These subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees. This approach eliminates the need for the ADPC to assess the reasonableness of funds requests.</p>\n<p>The aim of the subsidy fund is to incentivise participation and growth among smaller projects helping them to overcome barriers to entry, such as challenges to acquire funding to pay for the cost of robust security audits.</p>\n<p>The figure of $10 million worth of ARB has been determined via a benchmarking exercise conducted with various security audit service providers. This <a href=\"https://noteforms.com/forms/subsidy-fund-service-fee-consultation-mtg039\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">form</a> was shared with these service providers and based on the responses of 10 service providers (including the likes of Spearbit, Halborn, Nethermind, Three Sigma, Guardian, Zellic, etc.) on their scope of services and fees associated, we have estimated that each project will require a 2-month security audit at an average cost of $200K. This will enable the ADPC to potentially fund up to 50 projects; however, it should be noted that the average of $200K is an estimate and fees are usually specific to each project, each project requires a scoping exercise, and audit costs will vary based on the size of the codebase, complexity, etc.</p>\n<p>Any feedback on this proposal is encouraged via a public discussion on the community forum.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"subsidy-fund-design-approach-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#subsidy-fund-design-approach-4\"></a>Subsidy Fund Design &amp; Approach</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"exec-view-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#exec-view-5\"></a>Exec View</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>$10 million worth of ARB allocated across ~50 projects to spend on whitelisted security audit service providers, with an average amount of $200K worth of ARB allocated per project and a max cap of $500K per project.</li>\n<li>ADPC responsible for selection and oversight.</li>\n<li>Our aim is to distribute the Subsidy Fund in an 8-month period, in 4 cohorts of 8 weeks each.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"key-pillars-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-pillars-6\"></a>Key Pillars</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"a-subsidy-fund-principles-and-criteria-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#a-subsidy-fund-principles-and-criteria-7\"></a>(A) Subsidy Fund Principles and Criteria</h3>\n<p><strong>Core Principles Underlying the ADPC Subsidy Fund</strong></p>\n<p>Before considering a subsidy application, applicants should carefully evaluate the need for support. The purpose of these guidelines is to clarify the subsidy program and make the process as straightforward as possible.</p>\n<p>All applicants should keep in mind the following key principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Transparency &amp; integrity</strong> - Applicants must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and receipt of any prior funding.</li>\n<li><strong>Encouragement of investment</strong> - Subsidies should incentivise investment that would not otherwise occur without the subsidy. They should not cover costs that the beneficiary would have funded independently in the absence of any subsidy.</li>\n<li><strong>Proportionate and necessary</strong> - Subsidies should be proportionate to their intended objective and limited to what is necessary to achieve it.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic neutrality</strong> - The requested subsidy amount should not confer an economic advantage. It should be provided on fair terms, comparable to what could reasonably be obtained on the market.</li>\n<li><strong>Consideration of funding options</strong> - Applicants are expected to explore all available funding options and responsibly choose the option that best suits their needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement of beneficiary security</strong> - Subsidies should bring about changes that enhance the security of the beneficiary’s protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem</strong> - Subsidies should have a beneficial effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem, contributing to its growth and sustainability.</li>\n<li><strong>Value for Money</strong> - The evaluation method should ensure decisions maximize both financial and non-financial value to Arbitrum.</li>\n<li><strong>Probity</strong> - Subsidies should be issued in an environment that ensures fairness, impartiality, and compliance with established guidelines and rules. There will be an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and integrity throughout the procurement process, evidenced by the development of this publicly documented Means Test methodology. This focus on Probity will mitigate procurement risks and safeguard the integrity of the procurement process.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Management</strong> - Risk management policies will be implemented to identify and mitigate procurement risks.</li>\n<li><strong>Engagement with SMEs</strong> - We have invited a wide range of organisations to participate, all of whom will be subject to the eligibility criteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Cyclical Whitelist events</strong> - We will have clear rules for cyclical whitelist reviews to open a pathway for future applicants and new market entrants.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Means Test: Criteria for Evaluation</p>\n<p>The reason for this approach over a purely quantitative approach is that most projects, especially the smaller ones being targeted within this subsidy program do not possess obvious immediately measurable metrics.</p>\n<p>The development of this Means Test aims to provide a structured approach for the ADPC to evaluate applications for financial assistance. This tool is designed to identify applicants who would benefit most from support, ensuring equitable access to subsidies within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, particularly for smaller entities with valuable contributions.</p>\n<p>The intent is to allocate subsidies to those most in need, avoiding exploitation by larger players looking for a ‘free lunch/handout’. Such an event could give recipients an unfair advantage over their competitors or be an inefficient use of the DAO’s funds if they do not bring about a net positive change.</p>\n<p>The means test will include a scoring system ranging from 1 to 5, reflecting the merit of each application.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rating 1: Unsatisfactory</li>\n<li>Rating 2: Below expectations</li>\n<li>Rating 3: Meets expectations</li>\n<li>Rating 4: Above expectations</li>\n<li>Rating 5: Exceptional</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the sub-criteria in the means test have varying levels of importance, and they will each have a weighting attached. A weighting of 1 indicates low importance, 2 indicates neutral importance, and 3 indicates high importance.</p>\n<p>Each application will be scored by ADPC members, followed by a collective decision on the most deserving grant recipients, taking into account the rating against the eligibility criteria, a value-for-money evaluation and the funds available. The ADPC may make other decisions in relation to the operation of the fund and selection of applicants as further detailed in the Application Process Terms.</p>\n<p>After the applications have been reviewed and decisions taken as to the grant beneficiaries, the average score assigned to each project will be shared publicly, ensuring that transparency is maintained throughout the process. In the event that an applicant receives a high score but is not chosen as a grant recipient, explanatory feedback will be provided either on an individual or collective basis to the cohort.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Criteria</th>\n<th>Sub-Criteria</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Weight</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Arbitrum Ecosystem Contribution</strong><br><em>How aligned is the project with the Arbitrum ecosystem and how easy will it be to track the applicant’s use of the subsidy funds?</em></td>\n<td>Ecosystem Contribution</td>\n<td>How does the applicant’s project contribute towards the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Transparency Practices</td>\n<td>To what extent does the applicant demonstrate transparency in its operations?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Community Engagement</td>\n<td>How does the applicant engage with the DAO community and solicit feedback/input on its project, incorporating this into its decision-making?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Accountability Measures</td>\n<td>What mechanisms does the project have in place to ensure accountability and responsible stewardship of subsidy funds, including governance structures in place?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Business Model &amp; Need for the Subsidy</strong><br><em>How effectively does the applicant’s business model align with their need for the subsidy?</em></td>\n<td>Clarity of Business Model</td>\n<td>How well-defined and understandable is the applicant’s business model?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Team Experience</td>\n<td>What is the track record of the team on their ability to execute their plan?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Funding Gap Rationale</td>\n<td>Is there a clear explanation of the funding gap the applicant is facing, along with the rationale for why additional subsidy funding is necessary to achieve its objectives?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Reasonableness of Subsidy Amount Requested</td>\n<td>Does the requested subsidy amount make sense within the context of the project’s needs and potential impact?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Scalability Potential</td>\n<td>What is the scalability potential of the applicant’s business model following the support of the subsidy?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Financial Analysis</strong><br><em>How realistic and stress tested is the applicant’s financial status and projections and is their plan for the use of the subsidy funds clearly outlined?</em></td>\n<td>Accuracy of Projections</td>\n<td>How realistic and well-supported are the financial projections provided by the applicant, inclusive of revenue forecasts and cost analysis?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Sensitivity to Scenarios</td>\n<td>To what extent does the applicant’s financial analysis consider different scenarios, such as base, target and stress scenarios to assess the projects’ resilience and adaptability to changing market conditions?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>KPIs</td>\n<td>Are there clearly defined KPIs that will be used to track the project’s performance and measure progress towards achieving its goals?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Preferred Funding Distribution</td>\n<td>Does the applicant have a preferred distribution plan for the subsidy funds, and is there a rationale provided for this distribution approach, such as front-loading funds for critical start-up costs or phased funding based on project milestones?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Risk Analysis</strong><br><em>Is the applicant aware of risks with their project and what is their plan for mitigating these risks?</em></td>\n<td>Risk Identification</td>\n<td>How effectively does the applicant identify and assess potential risks and vulnerabilities that the project may have?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Security Requirements</td>\n<td>Does the applicant have a clear understanding of its security requirements and the measures needed to protect against security breaches, such as through the conducting of a security audit?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Mitigation Strategies</td>\n<td>What strategies does the applicant have in place or intend to implement to safeguard against the aforementioned risks?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Regarding the ‘Ecosystem Contribution’ metric above, we have conducted an initial assessment of the types of projects that are currently building in the Arbitrum ecosystem and identified a few verticals that the ecosystem would benefit from funding.

Each cohort will consist of an initial submission period of 2 weeks, followed by a 6-week review period. Moreover, a maximum cap of 25% of the total Subsidy Fund amount can be disbursed per cohort to ensure that the fund is structured to allow the door to be opened to new entrants over time. Each cohort will operate on a first-come-first-served basis for application reviews, and if the maximum capital has been allocated for the cohort, the remaining applicants will be rolled over to the next cohort.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Screening</strong></p>\n<p>To efficiently handle the anticipated surge in applications and to ensure that the highest quality and most relevant applicants are selected, the below 5 sub-criteria (with the highest weights as mentioned above in the Means Test) will first be applied to all applicants, with the top-scoring applicants moving forward in the evaluation process and being assessed in greater depth:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Funding Gap Rationale</li>\n<li>Reasonableness of Subsidy Amount Requested</li>\n<li>KPIs</li>\n<li>Ecosystem Contribution</li>\n<li>Accountability Measures</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The ADPC reserves the right to introduce Mandatory Requirements over time that operate as threshold tests and will publish those requirements if introduced.</p>\n<p><strong>In-Depth Review &amp; Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Projects that pass the initial screening will undergo a review due diligence (DD) by the ADPC, including interviews and constructive feedback (either individually or on a collective basis).</p>\n<p><strong>Award &amp; Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>Once approved, projects receive subsidies, with periodic check-ins and a concluding evaluation to measure impact and success.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"c-selection-process-reporting-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#c-selection-process-reporting-9\"></a>(C) Selection Process &amp; Reporting</h3>\n<p>Transparency and continuous dialogue form the backbone of our selection and reporting process, ensuring that each funded project remains aligned with program expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Bi-Monthly Reports</strong></p>\n<p>We will provide bi-monthly updates on our selections and updates on funded projects (i.e., in line with each Cohort). These updates will include general project trajectory and progress toward milestones. To create the reports we will set regular monthly check-in dates where projects fill a template/slide in order to give the key info about the project’s status, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Summary of Achievements for the Month</li>\n<li>Funds Utilized</li>\n<li>Milestones Reached</li>\n<li>Challenges Faced &amp; Plan of Action</li>\n<li>Feedback Integration, i.e., how projects have incorporated feedback provided.</li>\n<li>Next Steps &amp; Priorities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Output Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>With the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for meaningful output will look as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Number of Projects Funded:</strong> Number of projects funded during each cohort.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Funds Allocated:</strong> Cumulative sum of funds distributed in each cohort, showcasing the program’s financial impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Percentage of projects funded in target verticals:</strong> As outlined in the Means Test, the three key verticals we have identified are RWAs &amp; Tokenization, Gaming, and Collab Tech.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcome Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on the final portfolio of funded projects, we will gauge the success rate of awarded projects through specific outcome metrics. While these metrics can be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as market conditions and individual decisions on a project level, we are committed to supporting and funding the most promising projects to the best of our ability. Metrics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Percentage of funded projects successfully deployed on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Percentage of KPIs outlined in the application achieved by funded projects</li>\n<li>Percentage of projects successfully deployed as Orbit chains: One of the key aims of the Arbitrum DAO is to build and expand the Orbit ecosystem. Funding projects that grow the Orbit ecosystem is a net positive to the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"d-project-allocation-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#d-project-allocation-10\"></a>(D) Project Allocation</h3>\n<p>Our approach to subsidy fund allocation focuses on achieving high impact while ensuring that a de minimus number of projects obtain funding.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the subsidy is spread across a large number of projects rather than concentrated in several larger projects, the maximum subsidy to be granted will comprise 5% of the subsidy fund available. Therefore, given that the subsidy fund comprises $10 million, the maximum subsidy that a project can receive will comprise no more than $500K worth of ARB. This will ensure that the fund is designed to subsidize at least 20 projects, at a minimum.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"e-team-setup-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#e-team-setup-11\"></a>(E) Team Setup</h3>\n<p>The administration and selection process of these subsidies will be managed by the ADPC. Even though the ultimate decision will lie with the judgment of the ADPC, their assessment will be strongly guided by a means test that evaluates key metrics to determine deserving projects.</p>\n<p>The activation of the ADPC to manage the Subsidy Fund will hinge on extending the current 6-month mandate once the Subsidy Fund becomes operational. Should the DAO or the ADPC opt against a continuation of the ADPC, a Subsidy Fund Management Committee will need to be elected. The ADPC will allocate ample time for this process to ensure the Subsidy Fund operation is not reliant on the ADPC’s mandate extension.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"g-governance-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#g-governance-12\"></a>(G) Governance</h3>\n<p>The Subsidy Fund governance aims for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement. It outlines mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced decision-making for all stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Sig</strong></p>\n<p>All providers must undergo and successfully complete the standard Know-Your-Business (hereinafter referred to as the ‘KYB’) verification processes with the Arbitrum Foundation prior to receiving the service-subsidy.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the designated Multi-sig members, established at the inception of the ADPC and voted in favour of by the ArbitrumDAO, will take charge of disbursing funds to the selected beneficiaries, whereby the transactions will be streamed using Hedgey.</p>\n<p>In recognition of the additional responsibilities undertaken, each of the five multi-sig wallets is proposed to receive a supplementary compensation ranging from 500 ARB - 1,000 ARB monthly.</p>\n<p>It is also important to note, as per the ratified proposal which led to the formation of the ADPC, that the multi-sig committee grants the ArbitrumDAO the authority to claw back funds from the ADPC’s multi-sig wallet using the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-procurement-clawback-capability\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Zodiac Governor Module</a>, if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Checks &amp; Balances</strong></p>\n<p>Kindly note that the subsidy fund will be subject to the same checks and balances found within the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064\">procurement committee proposal</a>, regulated by an agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members, with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the agreement. These checks and balances include:</p>\n<p><strong>Conflict of Interest Provision:</strong> ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position &amp; disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Members’ involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.</p>\n<p>To sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Record-keeping and Reporting:</strong> Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress &amp; internal ADPC Administration.</p>\n<p><strong>Duty of Impartiality:</strong> ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks &amp; workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.</p>\n<p><strong>Obligation of Recusal:</strong> ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project and/or service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation &amp; administration of the applicable procurement process.</p>\n<p>P<strong>rohibition of Self-Dealing:</strong> Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethical Trading:</strong> Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Application Terms and Conditions can be found</strong> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYCtfP_GqfjkKQafVr86hCpjEsQ2Ec4a/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>CCing: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer\">@Immutablelawyer</a>; <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/pablo\">@Pablo</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/sid_areta\">@sid_areta</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cliffton.eth\">@cliffton.eth</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/raam\">@raam</a></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 20:58:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22958"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958.rss","#text":"[Non-constitutional] Subsidy Fund for Security Services"}},{"title":"# Thank ARB monthly report: February 2024","dc:creator":"BenWest","category":"Grants Discussions","description":"<p>Hi, this is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benwest\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ben West</a>, I will be working with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/disruptionjoe\">@DisruptionJoe</a> and the team to deliver the Thank ARB program.

Instead, it’s a compilation of knowledge and experience from existing participants that could be seen as ‘tips and tricks’ to submitting your proposal.</li>\n<li>You don’t necessarily have to follow every step word-for-word. Each individual and/or group as well as their proposal is unique and might need fewer or more steps based on the overall context.</li>\n<li>Making sure you’re an active part of Arbitrum DAO by participating in the forums, chats, and/or community calls before submitting a proposal can help you get off on the right foot with the community.</li>\n<li>Before submitting a proposal, seek to collect feedback in private from delegates.</li>\n<li>When publishing your proposal, make sure to adhere to the suggested format. Anticipate what questions delegates might ask and ensure you have adequate information for them not to.</li>\n<li>Be concise when explaining your proposal, but don’t overlook crucial information.</li>\n<li>If you do not have the necessary voting power to create a Snapshot or Tally vote, you can ask a delegate who does to create it on your behalf.</li>\n<li>The entire AIP voting process typically takes 37 days to complete for Constitutional AIPs or 27 days for Non-Constitutional AIPs</li>\n<li>If your proposal fails, you can always iterate based on delegate feedback and resubmit.</li>\n<li>This guide was published in April 2024 and is up-to-date until that time. The process might change as things evolve. We’ll come back and update the post as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"considerations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#considerations-2\"></a><strong>Considerations</strong></h2>\n<p>The first thing you need to ask yourself before attempting to go through the process of submitting a proposal to the DAO is whether the proposal results in a win-win scenario. Simply put, what is the benefit that you will bring to the DAO through the execution of your proposal, and what do you stand to gain if your proposal passes?</p>\n<p>If you have solid reasons to believe that the value created from your proposal justifies the organizational and/or monetary overhead created for the DAO, then you should proceed with the process as outlined below.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, it might be hard to assess your proposal in the context of the DAO. A good approach is to see whether there have been any similar proposals to the DAO in the past, or if there have been any similar proposals to other DAOs. Having a reference point can help put things into perspective both for you and also for the delegates when they are reviewing.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"frameworks-vs-direct-to-dao-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#frameworks-vs-direct-to-dao-3\"></a><strong>Frameworks vs Direct-to-DAO</strong></h2>\n<p>Once you’ve assessed your proposal, it’s time to see if it fits into any of the frameworks that already exist. As is the case with most DAOs, Arbitrum has frameworks in place to facilitate governance proposals. The 2 main categories of proposals are <strong>constitutional</strong> and <strong>non-constitutional</strong> Arbitrum Improvement Proposals, or AIPs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Constitutional AIPs</strong> are those that modify the text or procedures of the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Constitution</a> or AIP-1, install or modify the software on any chain, or take any action that requires “chain owner” permission on any chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-constitutional AIPs</strong> are all other AIPs, such as those that request funds/grants or provide general guidelines or information to the community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re reading this guide before proposing, chances are your proposal falls into the second category - and that’s where we’ll focus in this guide.</p>\n<p>Two easy questions to help you narrow down even further on how you’ll approach the DAO with your proposal are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Am I requesting a grant for something I’m building on Arbitrum?</li>\n<li>Is this something that would require a framework, or is it a one-off thing?\n<ol>\n<li>As a follow-up: if it does require a framework, does one already exist?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Requesting Grants</strong></p>\n<p>If you answered yes to the first question and you’re seeking a grant for something you’re building, then the choice you have to make is who you’ll request the grant from. There are several grant programs through which you can request funding without having to go through the governance process and a DAO-wide vote. You can find <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/9f7afd29c06f4f65ac637ae755546181?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">more information on different grant programs here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Different kinds of proposal</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re trying to make a different kind of proposal, or looking to fund a governance initiative, then you first need to assess whether what you’re requesting would open the floodgates for other individuals, teams, or projects to also request. For example, if you’re a service provider and want to offer your services to the DAO, or if you’re a protocol looking for liquidity incentives, then you need to understand that you probably aren’t the only one out there with that idea.</p>\n<p>When delegates evaluate these kinds of proposals, a factor they take into consideration is whether there needs to be a more holistic approach or a framework in place. If your proposal has a wide scope that could potentially be applied to others, then you should first seek to see whether a framework like that already exists.</p>\n<p>If you’re a service provider, you should contact the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064\">Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (ADPC)</a> and get whitelisted, and if you’re looking for liquidity incentives, you should be on the lookout for initiatives like <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131\">Short-Term Incentives Proposal (STIP)</a>, or <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223/41\">Long-Term Incentives Pilot Program (LTIPP)</a>.</p>\n<p>If a framework doesn’t exist for what you’re seeking to propose, then you should either discuss with delegates and see whether one is being worked on or, if you’re feeling brave, start working on one yourself.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pre-rfc-request-for-comment-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pre-rfc-request-for-comment-4\"></a>Pre-RFC (Request for Comment)</h2>\n<p>Before going to the forums and publishing your proposal as a ‘Request for Comment (RFC)’, you should first make sure that you’ve somehow established yourself in the Arbitrum DAO community. Ways to do that include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having been active in the governance forums</li>\n<li>Having attended open governance calls</li>\n<li>Having talked with delegates online or in person</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you haven’t done any of the above, you might need to either have someone who’s already in the DAO introduce you to the right people or have a strong and credible out-of-the-DAO presence and reputation.</p>\n<p>Although not explicitly required, having established yourself in the community will make it easier to attract attention to your proposal, and get the ball rolling in terms of discussion and feedback.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you want to share your proposal with a few delegates before you even publish. Given their high context and experience in the DAO, they’ll probably have feedback to offer which will make your proposal better before you publish it.</p>\n<p>While getting in direct touch with delegates might seem daunting at first, if you get a hold of one and ask them to connect you with others, the thread of contacts will start untangling pretty quickly.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"request-for-comment-rfc-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#request-for-comment-rfc-5\"></a>Request For Comment (RFC)</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, you need to format your proposal in a way that is familiar to the DAO and easy to navigate. There’s a proposal template in the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/how-tos/create-submit-dao-proposal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DAO’s governance docs here</a>. Drafting an easy-to-understand yet solid proposal is more art than science. Below we’ve compiled some advice that will save you the time and effort of going back and forth with delegates and other community members that review your proposal.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Include a TL;DR at the top.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The point of having a TL;DR of the proposal at the very top, similar to the one found at the start of this post, is so people can quickly get an overview and a refresh of the essence of the proposal without having to read through endless text. It doesn’t need to cover all the minor details, but it should include all the important ones.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Avoid using “sales” language.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’re excited that you want to build “the first in the world” or the “best-in-class” whatever, but the DAO is not a customer. The feedback you will receive will be based on the merit of the proposal rather than that of the pitch. If anything, you’re tiring both yourself and the delegates by adding unnecessary fluff. Be concise and to the point and it will be much better received.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Get specific and don’t leave things hanging</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>While you want to avoid unnecessary fluff language, you do not want to be brief with the things that matter. Important information that pertains to your proposal should be extensively covered.</p>\n<p>A non-exhaustive list of things that have been typically discussed in the past are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The total amount requested. You can denominate in either USD or ARB, but the funds you’ll receive will most likely be in ARB so keep that in mind.</li>\n<li>The timeline of your proposal</li>\n<li>A breakdown of how the money is going to be spent</li>\n<li>How will the funds be managed - will it be a multisig? If yes, who are going to be the signers?</li>\n<li>Will it be converted into stables or used as ARB?</li>\n<li>Is there going to be a milestone-based funding? If yes, what will the milestones be and how much money is it going to be unlocked at each?</li>\n<li>If there have to be some sort of elections relevant to your proposal, how will they be carried out? Who will manage the process?</li>\n<li>If there are smart contracts associated with your proposal, who is going to create them and audit them?</li>\n<li>If your proposal is meant to be a pilot or trial, what happens when it concludes?</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Contact info</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Feedback on your proposal will typically be given publicly under your forum post. However, you might want to give delegates a way to reach you in case they want to discuss your proposal in more detail. Telegram is most delegates’ app of choice, but any line of communication is welcome.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"temperature-check-on-snapshot-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#temperature-check-on-snapshot-6\"></a>Temperature Check on Snapshot</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve submitted an RFC to the forum, it’s generally a good practice to allow for some time (typically a week) before moving for a temperature check on Snapshot, unless the proposal is time-sensitive. If you’ve collected a lot of feedback under your forum post before the week is up, then you could move forward earlier so as not to waste time. If you haven’t collected enough feedback (or if you haven’t collected any feedback), worry not! Going to a temperature check on Snapshot is a sure way of getting delegates’ attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating a Snapshot vote</strong></p>\n<p>To submit a temperature check using Snapshot you must have an Ethereum wallet address that represents at least 0.01% of votable tokens (so 1,000,000 ARB). The Snapshot vote should run for 7 days and the outcome is decided by a simple majority with no required participation threshold. If you do not have that, you need to find a delegate who can post the proposal on your behalf.</p>\n<p>If you’ve followed the steps above, you should already have a line of communication with a few eligible delegates by now. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Updating your forum post</strong></p>\n<p>After creating your Snapshot vote, head back to your forum post and update it to include the link to the Snapshot. You can also add the link as a reply to “bump” your post to the top of the feed.</p>\n<p><strong>Discussing your proposal</strong></p>\n<p>There’s a bi-weekly call hosted by the Arbitrum Foundation where proposals are being discussed. You can <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Warsaw\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">find the calls on the Arbitrum Governance Calendar</a> and attend one of those to discuss your proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p>Doing a temperature check on Snapshot is an optional, but strongly recommended step in the governance process. If an AIP fails this temperature check, the original AIP author is encouraged to refrain from proceeding with an on-chain vote, and voters are encouraged to reject it if the author proceeds anyway. If an AIP proposer decides to skip temp-check, voters consider it as a factor when casting their vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"formal-vote-on-tally-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#formal-vote-on-tally-7\"></a>Formal Vote on Tally</h2>\n<p>After the temperature check, and given it was successful, the next step is to proceed with the on-chain vote on Tally. As with Snapshot, a Tally vote can only be initiated by $ARB token holders who hold (or represent) at least 0.01% of the votable supply. The Tally vote would run for 14 days and to be approved, more than 50% of the votable tokens that voted on the proposal must have voted in favor of the proposal; constitutional proposals must receive votes from at least 5% of all votable tokens in existence; non-constitutional proposal must receive votes from at least 3% of all votable tokens in existence.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparing up for an on-chain vote</strong></p>\n<p>The on-chain vote is executed permissionlessly after the vote concludes. For example, if you’re requesting funds from the DAO, successfully passing an on-chain vote doesn’t mean an entity will transfer the funds to you after the fact. You need to have the wallet that will receive the funds set up so the address can be used in the executable code associated with the proposal. The address and the requested amount will have to be a part of the on-chain proposal. If they’re not, <em>no funds</em> will be transferred, regardless of whether the proposal passes or not.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12\" title=\":bulb:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":bulb:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> If it’s a multi-sig wallet (e.g. Safe), make sure it’s deployed on Arbitrum. While EOA wallets like Metamask typically share the same address across different networks, multi-sig wallets do not work in the same fashion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Post-vote implementation</strong></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that if your proposal is successful, it won’t be executed for another 14 days after the on-chain vote has concluded.

The STIP journey has provided us with invaluable insights and experiences, greatly enhancing our understanding of incentive distribution and reward optimization at the network level. This knowledge will undoubtedly shape our future strategies and approach.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, Boost Studios is excited to further develop the partnerships and connections we’ve established with some of Arbitrum’s leading teams. Working closely with these protocols has not only deepened our understanding of the DAO’s priorities but also showcased the unique capabilities of Boost to meet various specific and complex business needs.</p>\n<p>As we reflect on the STIP program’s successes, we identified a few areas that we are eager to explore further in future grants and initiatives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Deeper user retention: We’d love to explore user retention by leveraging deep user segmentation, in-depth user profiling, and action-driven retention strategies to engage and retain users within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User Acquisition: Further optimizing customer acquisition costs (CAC) for both conquest campaigns, such as GMX, and more novel onchain use cases, such as Knights of the Ether, with the primary goal of driving natural user growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Asset-driven campaigns: We see great potential in supporting asset volume on platforms like Camelot and facilitating the bridging of specific assets to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes focusing on native assets, native-minted assets, and strategic assets such as stablecoins or LST/LRTs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minting and Creator Use Cases: The success of our Zora use case has inspired us to explore creator-focused verticals further. Boost Protocol can play a vital role in helping creators gain visibility for their art and empower them to reach new audiences through targeted incentive campaigns.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The STIP program has been a transformative experience for the Boost Protocol, and we’re incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead. Boost remains dedicated to <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-new-thesis-for-network-level-incentives-programs/20757\">pushing the boundaries</a> of what is possible with incentive distribution and optimization, and we look forward to continued collaboration with the Arbitrum DAO!</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rabbithole-retro-stip-analysis-4-1-2024/22955\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rabbithole-retro-stip-analysis-4-1-2024/22955","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 17:10:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22955"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rabbithole-retro-stip-analysis-4-1-2024/22955.rss","#text":"RabbitHole: Retro STIP Analysis (4/1/2024)"}},{"title":"Idea for a Direct User Rewards Program","dc:creator":"AJC","category":"Proposals","description":"<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> WIP to initiate a simple rewards program that directly airdrops ARB tokens to users. The goal is to create a long-lasting program that continuously reward both new and old Arbitrum users. This proposal is currently still in ideation, so exact details of how this will look is TBD. Please feel free to critique and make any suggestions.</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>\n25 million ARB tokens airdropped to users that complete the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Link Twitter Account</li>\n<li>Link Wallet Address</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ARB tokens will be distributed equally, so for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>250,000 users sign up, each user gets 100 ARB tokens,</li>\n<li>500,000 users sign up, each user gets 50 ARB tokens,</li>\n<li>1 million users sign up, each user gets 25 ARB tokens, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong><br>\nRecent Arbitrum DAO initiatives have been mainly geared to attracting capital/liquidity (STIP/LTIP) or assisting existing projects (GCP). However, these initiatives have done very little to onboard new users to Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Although not exactly a 1:1 proxy for users, weekly active addresses (WAA) on Arbitrum have largely stagnated over the past year. Solana’s WAA is currently ~5x Arbitrum, and Base’s WAA has eclipsed Arbitrum for the first time ever. New users are arriving to crypto every day, but the vast majority are not choosing Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The best way to onboard users is quite simple: Incentives. Complex farming mechanisms, ‘Build it and they will come,’ and other non-user focused mechanisms do not onboard users. If you want users, you need to directly incentivize the users.</p>\n<p>The DAO needs to take immediate action to reemedy this and make Arbitrum a top spot for users.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> -<br>\nOffchain Labs and the Arbitrum DAO has done the hard part of making Arbitrum the L2 with the best technology and most liquidity, but now it is time to begin the process of onboarding the next generation of crypto users onto Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The establishment of a rewards program that directly incentivizes users on Arbitrum is perfectly aligned with the Arbitrum community’s mission and values.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong><br>\nThe pilot program should be extremely basic. Ideally, we want users to take as few as steps as possible to be eligible for the pilot program. The more steps and requirements, the less likely Arbitrum is to onboard new users. To achieve this, I propose that the pilot program should only consist of two steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Link Twitter Account</li>\n<li>Link Wallet Address</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sybils are obviously a concern, so anti-sybil measures will need to be implemented. Twitter accounts that are (i) Bots or (ii) Less than 1 month old should not be included in the airdrop. Additional anti-sybil measures will likely be needed, so if you have expertise or knowledge on this, please make additional suggestions.</p>\n<p>Once sybils have been identified, 25 million ARB will be airdropped equally to the users that successfully attached. There are no strings attached with this ARB, users are free to do as they please with their tokens.</p>\n<p>However, being that this is just a pilot program, the goal is for the pilot program to be the first of many airdrop rounds. User behavior will be paramount for inclusion in future rounds. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>User A receives 100 ARB tokens from the pilot program. User A sells 100 ARB tokens for 150 USDC tokens and then sends the USDC to a centralized exchange. User A is value extractive and should not be eligible for future airdrops.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User B receives 100 ARB tokens from the pilot program. User B sells 50 ARB tokens for 75 USDC and then uses the ARB and USDC to provide liquidity on a decentralized exchange. User B is generating economic activity on Arbitrum and should be eligible for future airdrops.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Either the Arbitrum Foundation or a newly established committee should be tasked with collecting data related to the behaviors of users that participated in the pilot program. This data will be utilized to establish criteria for future airdrop rounds, if approved by the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong><br>\nBeing that this proposal in its current form is largely just an idea, significant work will be needed on it to make it a reality.

I think this would provide a very cool visual for new entrants and arb daoists.</p>\n<p>Not a dev,(yet) but in time I would create this. Maybe others can pull this off, here is a simple explanation of the design concept:</p>\n<p>Building the Visualization</p>\n<p>Data Collection and Preparation:<br>\nCollect Data: Use Arbitrum’s APIs or blockchain explorers to extract data on transactions, smart contracts, and interactions between them. Focus on identifying projects and their interactions.<br>\nPrepare Data: Process the data to highlight relationships between projects. This might involve mapping transactions to the projects initiating or receiving them and identifying smart contracts that facilitate these interactions.</p>\n<p>Network Analysis:<br>\nCreate a Graph Model: Treat each project as a node and each interaction (transactions, smart contract calls) as edges between these nodes. Use attributes to represent the volume or significance of the interactions.<br>\nAnalyze the Network: Use network analysis techniques to identify key projects (nodes with high connectivity), clusters of closely interacting projects, and the overall structure of the network.</p>\n<p>Visualization:<br>\nChoose a Visualization Tool: Options include graph visualization tools like Gephi, web-based libraries like D3.js, or programming libraries like NetworkX in Python.<br>\nDesign the Visualization: Represent the Arbitrum blockchain’s project ecosystem as a network diagram where nodes represent projects, and edges represent interactions. Customize node sizes and edge thicknesses based on metrics like transaction volume or interaction frequency. Use color coding to differentiate types of projects or activity levels.</p>\n<p>Interactive Features:<br>\nImplement Interactivity: Allow users to zoom in/out, click on nodes to get more information about projects, and filter by types of interactions or projects.<br>\nDynamic Updates: If possible, make the visualization dynamically update with new transactions and interactions to keep the overview current.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/birds-eye-view-explorer-a-network-perspective/22919\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/birds-eye-view-explorer-a-network-perspective/22919","pubDate":"Sat, 30 Mar 2024 23:35:23 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22919"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/birds-eye-view-explorer-a-network-perspective/22919.rss","#text":"Bird's Eye View Explorer: A Network Perspective"}},{"title":"Thetanuts Finance Bi-Weekly Update (29 March 2024)","dc:creator":"Thetanuts_Finance","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p>In December 2023, Thetanuts Finance saw the launch of its v3 Upgrade – entailing a major architecture revamp and brand new Trading Interface, where users could go long or short on on-chain options. While Thetanuts Finance is a multi-chain protocol, Arbitrum network is the only instance where Thetanuts Finance v3 is integrated.</p>\n<p>Thetanuts Finance began distributing $ARB rewards from Arbitrum STIP on January 29, where 200,000 $ARB was distributed equally over 8 weeks.

While these products will first be on Ethereum Mainnet, we intend to integrate them onto Arbitrum shortly – and to incentivize them using Arbitrum STIP Bridge rewards.</p>\n<p>The roadmap for the Leveraged LRT Strategy Vault includes asset coverage of other leading LRTs on Pendle – including $pufETH, $ezETH, $rsETH, and $swETH.

In the context of those elections, Ant Federation and L2BEAT joined forces and together we were elected in the role of the DAO Advocate. The mandate of the DAO Advocate is to represent the DAO and direct the ARDC’s efforts. It essentially functions as the bridge between the Arbitrum DAO and the ARDC.</p>\n<p>As the DAO Advocate, we’re committed to transparency and we’ll use this communication thread to regularly provide upgrades on what we, as well as all the other members of the ARDC, are working on.</p>\n<p>Following our election, we hit the ground running by first establishing a direct line of communication between us and all the members of the ARDC. We’ve also already had 2 calls so we can coordinate among all members of the ARDC to discuss the next steps and operational procedures going forward.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ardc-public-notion-page-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ardc-public-notion-page-2\"></a>ARDC Public Notion Page</h3>\n<p>For transparency’s sake, we’ve set up a publicly viewable Notion page that contains all information relevant to the ARDC’s operations. Specifically, there’s a section that will have meeting minutes from all the ARDC calls, and a kanban board that will contain all the tasks the ARDC will work on, is working on, and has worked on.</p>\n<p>Additional sections and subpages will be added if and as needed.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/ARDC-Homepage-955753d44ff74dc985d498c10cb361b0?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">find the Notion page here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"communication-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#communication-3\"></a>Communication</h3>\n<p>Given the role, communication between the DAO and the DAO Advocate is essential. To that end, we want to make our communication channels known so you can reach out to us at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>1) This communication thread.</strong> You can use this thread to publicly bring up topics in which our involvement in our capacity as DAO Advocate is needed.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Bi-weekly status update call.</strong> As per the mandate of the original proposal, we’ll be hosting 2 calls per month that will be open to the public to address any and all topics relevant to the ARDC. During those calls, both the DAO Advocate as well as representatives from all the members of the ARDC are going to be present.<br>\nThe calls are going to happen every other Monday at 1 pm UTC / 9 am EST starting on Monday 8th of April 2024. You’ll find the links to the calls in the <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y180MTU3OTg1ZDI0NTJkZmQ4YTkxYjZhMzZiY2NhYjM3ZGViOWJmZmU5MDUzYTRiOWJjYzRlOWZmZjllZjAyOTI0QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum DAO Governance Calendar</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3) ARDC Meeting Minutes.</strong> You’ll be able to find meeting minutes from each call (both private and public) of the ARDC in <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/26928aa0e45745f995ef83b7e4061958?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this Notion page we’ve set up.</a></p>\n<p><strong>5) L2BEAT Arbitrum Office Hours.</strong> We already host <a href=\"http://meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">weekly office hours</a> where stakeholders can discuss all things relevant to Arbitrum with us. We’re inviting people to freely use our office hours to discuss DAO Advocate matters. The call takes place every Thursday at 3 pm UTC.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Open Arbitrum Governance Call.</strong> The monthly open governance call is also a good place for discussions relevant to the whole ARDC. We’re always present at those calls and happy to discuss any topics relevant to the ARDC and DAO Advocate. The next call is happening on <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/13-arbitrum-open-governance-call-3-4-2024/22851\">Wednesday, 3rd of April at 3pm UTC / 11 am EST</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Telegram.</strong> For a quick and direct way to reach us, you can send a message to Krzysztof on <a href=\"https://t.me/kaereste\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Telegram</a>. Turnaround time will be within 24 hours on a business day.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#next-steps-4\"></a><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3>\n<p>Going forward, you can expect regular updates from our involvement in the DAO in our capacity as DAO Advocate in the form of written updates. Of course, you can find us to discuss anything in more detail in any of the communication channels mentioned above.</p>\n<p>From a process standpoint, all ARDC members are going through the KYC/KYB process to sign an agreement with the Foundation and have submitted the necessary documentation. Once that process is complete, we’ll be set to officially kick things off.</p>\n<p>Operationally, and in parallel with the KYC/KYB process, we’re working on identifying and deciding on key areas of interest in which the ARDC could already be of help, on top of establishing how we’ll collectively respond to the DAO’s needs as they arise.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"call-to-action-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#call-to-action-5\"></a>Call to action</h3>\n<p>We invite everyone to participate in our inaugural call on <strong>Monday 8th of April at 1 pm UTC</strong> to discuss all of the above and more relevant to both the ARDC, but also Ant Federation’s and L2BEAT’s role as DAO Advocates.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-dao-advocate-communication-thread/22865\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-dao-advocate-communication-thread/22865","pubDate":"Fri, 29 Mar 2024 13:44:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22865"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-dao-advocate-communication-thread/22865.rss","#text":"[ARDC] DAO Advocate Communication Thread"}},{"title":"Pendle Arbitrum STIP Summary","dc:creator":"EynSoph","category":"DAO Grant Programs","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/47abfaa28506ec826b96e2bc5e57ad4345fc84fe.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ae2myrUGV3gfr74Ct9sALM7HhN4.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/47abfaa28506ec826b96e2bc5e57ad4345fc84fe_2_690x390.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ae2myrUGV3gfr74Ct9sALM7HhN4\" width=\"690\" height=\"390\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/47abfaa28506ec826b96e2bc5e57ad4345fc84fe_2_690x390.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/47abfaa28506ec826b96e2bc5e57ad4345fc84fe_2_1035x585.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/47abfaa28506ec826b96e2bc5e57ad4345fc84fe_2_1380x780.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"193362\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Pendle has outperformed all KPI targets (i.e. TVL, daily trading volume, MAU) by significant margins</li>\n<li>We’re now the largest protocol on Arbitrum by TVL ($677M), up 1,153% since the start</li>\n<li>Pendle contributed ~69% of Arbitrum’s overall TVL growth (in USD terms) during the course of STIP</li>\n<li>30DMA trading volume is at $1.7B, up +11,233% since the start.

But like many DAOs, it faces challenges with contributor onboarding. Fragmented information, siloed resources, and private communication channels foster a culture of exclusivity that makes it difficult for newcomers to navigate the DAO and contribute meaningfully.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a lack of organized processes for managing work in the DAO creates complexity for existing contributors to effectively allocate newcomers to initiatives that need support. Consequently, many initiatives fizzle out after several weeks due to a lack of interest and slow progress.</p>\n<p>We propose a 3-month experiment to try to solve these problems. We will act akin to a small recruitment agency, making our best attempts to match people with opportunities in the DAO. We hope to find some learnings along the way and address the following three issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The lack of an outreach pipeline - how and where to find new contributors for the DAO outside of our typical “bubbles”.</li>\n<li>Scattered initiatives that pop up in the DAO - how to ensure that new initiatives get visibility and avoid getting lost in the DAO (as long as there are interested people).</li>\n<li>Initiatives that fizzle out - how to sustain initiatives in the long-term, including funding, organizational support, and operational support.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our solution consists of three key components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An onboarding hub where we consolidate and organize scattered information across the DAO.</li>\n<li>A dedicated team that actively works with the DAO and potential new contributors to determine effective methods for integrating new people into the DAO.</li>\n<li>Weekly onboarding calls and a dedicated Telegram account so new people can directly talk to us.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We believe that our approach to onboarding will not only drive increased quality participation in the DAO but also alleviate the workload of existing contributors. Our goal is to test an MVP during a three-month experiment. After this period, if it works out, we intend to turn this into a long-term initiative for the DAO.</p>\n<p>You can see an early version of the onboarding hub in Notion <a href=\"https://arbitrumdao.notion.site/Welcome-to-Arbitrum-DAO-51f0bc51cbc7459fab4c67987faa9a5d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"working-group-team-members-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#working-group-team-members-2\"></a>Working Group Team Members</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ocandocrypto\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Angela</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eugelikeeugenia\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Euge</a> from <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3citizenxyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Web3 Citizen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RikaGoldberg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Rika</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/404DAO\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">404 DAO</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Manugotsuka\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Manu</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEEDLatam\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SEEDLatam</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaereste\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Krzysztof </a>and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sinkas_\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sinkas</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/l2beat\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2Beat</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can find more details about each team member in our <a href=\"https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x650b4a0dc2aec18f55adb72f13c5d95631db04be&amp;role=builder&amp;chainId=10&amp;proposalId=65dec8513abac56c48f206c9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Questbook application</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"deliverables-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#deliverables-3\"></a>Deliverables</h3>\n<p>As discussed in the introduction, our solution has two key components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>An Onboarding Hub in Notion: This hub consolidates and organizes information scattered across the DAO, simplifying the ramp-up process for newcomers and facilitating their understanding of how to contribute meaningfully. We have completed an initial<a href=\"https://arbitrumdao.notion.site/Welcome-to-Arbitrum-DAO-51f0bc51cbc7459fab4c67987faa9a5d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> version (V1)</a> of the onboarding hub and are continuing to refine it to ensure it contains the most pertinent information for new members.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Weekly Onboarding Calls and a Dedicated Telegram Account: These provide newcomers with direct lines of communication with us, fostering a supportive and engaging environment. Two weekly onboarding calls have been scheduled (see <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y180MTU3OTg1ZDI0NTJkZmQ4YTkxYjZhMzZiY2NhYjM3ZGViOWJmZmU5MDUzYTRiOWJjYzRlOWZmZjllZjAyOTI0QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum DAO Calendar</a>) to accommodate different time zones and a dedicated <a href=\"https://t.me/ArbitrumDAOOnboarding\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Telegram account</a> has been created to facilitate ongoing interaction.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Moving forward, we plan to create the following deliverables to enhance the onboarding process and measure success:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>New Contributor List: The onboarding working group will provide a monthly list of potential new contributors to working group leads across the DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Monthly Reports: Each month we will deliver a report to the DAO assessing the performance of the working group based on the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) detailed in the subsequent section of this post.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"new-contributors-list-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-contributors-list-4\"></a>New Contributors List</h3>\n<p>We intend to maintain a list of people who expressed interest in actively contributing to the DAO. We will manually onboard each person on this list and collect basic information about their experience, areas of interest, desired involvement in the DAO, etc.</p>\n<p>For one month after onboarding, we will actively try to match these individuals with an initiative in the DAO, that they may consider joining, and we will stay in touch with them to provide support and monitor their progress. After one month, we will stop the support but will monitor their contributions to the DAO to see if they stayed active after the onboarding period.</p>\n<p>We will treat this one-month period as a deadline for us as well. Essentially, we have one month to identify a meaningful contribution pathway for any individual. After one month, we will evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. If necessary, we will introduce changes accordingly.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"expected-outcomeskpis-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#expected-outcomeskpis-5\"></a>Expected Outcomes/KPIs</h3>\n<p>Qualitatively, our expected outcomes are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Increased Participation and Contributions: We expect an uptick in engagement and meaningful contributions from new members who complete the onboarding program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Increased Understanding of Governance: By guiding newcomers through our onboarding process, we aim to enhance their comprehension of the Arbitrum DAO’s governance structure and mechanisms, empowering them to actively participate in the DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enhanced Community Bonds: Through targeted onboarding efforts and fostering direct communication channels, we anticipate a strengthening of community bonds and collaboration within the Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Better internal organization within the DAO: Since we’ll be working closely with new contributors to find meaningful ways for them to get involved, we need to know what activities are happening in the DAO, i.e,  which initiatives are thriving and which ones are struggling. We hypothesize that a positive side effect of our experiment will be better internal organization of the DAO.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quantitatively, we will measure against the following KPIs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Engagement Metrics: Track the number of people joining onboarding calls and showing interest in joining the DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Placement Rate: Track the percentage of participants who join a working group in the DAO after the onboarding program concludes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Retention Rate: Calculate the percentage of program participants who remain active contributors in the DAO for at least 3 months after the onboarding program concludes. Active contribution is measured by taking on a role in a working group.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"funding-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#funding-6\"></a>Funding</h3>\n<p>We have received a <a href=\"https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x650b4a0dc2aec18f55adb72f13c5d95631db04be&amp;role=builder&amp;chainId=10&amp;proposalId=65dec8513abac56c48f206c9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Questbook grant</a> to compensate the working group’s team members.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"reporting-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#reporting-7\"></a>Reporting</h3>\n<p>Within two weeks of the three-month program concluding, we will evaluate the onboarding hub and create a report to share with the DAO. The report will include completed deliverables, the program’s results tracked against KPIs, insights from the participant survey, areas for program improvement, and other relevant insights.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The first onboarding call is TODAY at 11pm UTC/7pm EST.

To do so, the Security Council members have to have at least some understanding of what’s going on, which is pretty difficult if they don’t know how to code. For example, in the case of an emergency action, they might have first to detect an exploit, figure out a patch, and then understand the proposed transaction to perform said patch + sign said transaction. So, they should have some technical skills necessary to ensure Arbitrum remains safe.</p>\n<p>Given the current electoral process, there’s a slight risk that some candidates might be elected based on their popularity, not necessarily their technical skills or the extent to which they understand source code, exploits, etc.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ensuring-a-technical-security-council-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ensuring-a-technical-security-council-3\"></a>Ensuring a technical Security Council</h3>\n<p>Based on the above, we believe that some measures could help ensure that the Security Council is only composed of individuals with a deep technical background.</p>\n<p>To achieve this objective, we propose an initial test so that candidates can demonstrate their technical skills (this could also be incorporated into the constitution, but it could just be required by the foundation?), i.e., at the time of initiating the election process mentioned in Section 4 of the Constitution, applicants in Stage 1 (Contender submission) be required to complete a challenge or simulation in which they must detect an error or vulnerability in an upgrade.</p>\n<p>Given that the DAO currently has a brand new security advisor at the ARDC (<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3d41ffb43e44e83d004505e362e70f703aed0e740322e8ebfbb390d54724ca91\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenZeppelin</a>), they could be in charge of defining this challenge and how to carry it out. Ideally, we would also like to work on this in collaboration with Offchain Labs since their feedback would be very valuable throughout this process.</p>\n<p>Requiring this challenge at the initial stage prevents delegates and other voters from casting votes at the Nominee Selection stage for candidates who do not meet the constitutional requirements for membership in the Security Council.</p>\n<p>The test or challenge should be simple enough to detect that at least the candidates are capable to detect and patch potential exploits.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"keep-arbitrum-safe-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#keep-arbitrum-safe-4\"></a>Keep Arbitrum safe</h3>\n<p>The idea behind this is to convey to all those who want to operate, trade, and build on Arbitrum that the chain is safe and that we take security seriously.</p>\n<p>We believe that establishing a pre-election filter helps delegates choose the best candidates and that we leverage the DAO’s best resources and talents.</p>\n<p>Remember that we currently have to keep $17B of TVL. Competition among L2s is also about safety, and if there’s something we should be picky about is safety.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#next-steps-5\"></a>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>Since this is just a request for comments, we are waiting for feedback from all delegates and community members to work on a more concrete proposal and move forward with the usual governance processes, looking forward to the next elections.</p>\n            <p><small>10 posts - 9 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-security-council-member-test/22809\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-security-council-member-test/22809","pubDate":"Mon, 25 Mar 2024 23:58:43 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22809"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-security-council-member-test/22809.rss","#text":"RFC - Security Council Member Test"}},{"title":"26 Mar 2024 - Open Discussion of Proposals Governance Call","dc:creator":"cliffton.eth","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n<p>The link to join the governance call to discuss the proposal pipeline and notable discussions is on the <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Warsaw\">governance calendar</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Date: 26 March 2024</strong><br>\n<strong>Time: 4:00 pm UTC</strong><br>\nLink to join: <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/kvr-bpnx-zix\">https://meet.google.com/kvr-bpnx-zix</a></p>\n<p>Here’s a fluid agenda I’ve put together.

as incentives to ETH (or ETH LST) markets</li>\n<li>30% of the grant allocated as incentives to other markets such as Pendle, Trader Joe, GMX, Plutus, etc. (will not be utilized to incentivize TIME token pools, if any)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some slight adjustments of the allocations, rerouting from the partner allocations to ARB and ETH markets, with these changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>20,000 ARB from ‘other markets’ to ARB markets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thereby giving the following final weightage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>50% of the grant allocated as incentives to ARB markets</li>\n<li>30% of the grant
