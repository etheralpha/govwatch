Most relevant to the STEP program, Steakhouse pioneered MakerDAO’s RWA program (which now totals over $2.5bn in asset value) and is responsible for monitoring and tracking the performance and cashflows of those assets.</p>\n<p>Each month, Steakhouse provides a high level monthly report on Maker’s RWA portfolio, the most recent of which can be found <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-asset-report-2024-03/24159\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to this summary report, Steakhouse performs in-depth reporting and analysis on each RWA deal, creating publicly available dashboards with complete cashflows wherever possible. Please reference the below examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HJDfe9hLA0_vTmdtyIqBoaHik68Imp6a-LzMtVDnH0/edit#gid=517022340\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Huntingdon Valley Bank</a> - A partnership with a Pennsylvania community bank to finance commercial and consumer loans, facilitated by a Delaware statutory trust.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/steakhouse/makerdao-clydesdale\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Clydesdale Dune Dashboard</a> - A transaction designated for the purchase of 0-6 month treasury bills, arranged by Monetalis and facilitated by a British Virgin Islands SPV.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Steakhouse creates a monthly economic report for the overall protocol, tracking the balance sheet, income, and other key metrics. The latest protocol economics report can be found <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/protocol-economics-report-2024-03/24229\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Underlying Asset Monitoring</em></p>\n<p>Similar to the cashflow and economics reporting mentioned above, Steakhouse also conducts monthly covenant and portfolio reviews to ensure that the RWA transactions in question are meeting the necessary portfolio concentrations and collateral quality requirements.</p>\n<p>Each deal requires a synthesis of off-chain and on-chain data and an active working relationship with the RWA issuer. For examples of this covenant monitoring, please see the monthly RWA report for MakerDAO, linked again for convenience <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-asset-report-2024-03/24159\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.

In New Silver’s case, the underlying portfolio is confidential, but summary characteristics are provided in the monthly report to show compliance with the stated covenants.</p>\n<p><em>Operations and Counterparty Monitoring</em></p>\n<p>Steakhouse has performed a series of in-depth reviews of RWA issuers and service providers. Some of these reviews have been performed in conjunction with MakerDAO transactions and some as public goods.</p>\n<p>Please see the below examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-002-new-silver-restructuring-risk-and-legal-assessment/21417\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">New Silver Restructuring Risk and Legal Assessment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JZG6sPetgbKoT-9ETeqb692n7lcXLYUI/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Overview of Blackrock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RP8MU45vx86hZpjdVO6MxVmmDdaHrxhV/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mountain Protocol (USDM) Economic and Legal Review</a></p>\n<p>In each case, Steakhouse performed thorough due-diligence to understand each point in the operational chain of the product and identify key risks and points of failure. Steakhouse continues to advise multiple real-world asset issuers on a daily basis, which further broadens Steakhouse’s expertise and exposure in the space.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"describe-any-conflicts-of-interest-your-entity-its-investors-or-key-personnel-may-have-with-any-potential-service-providers-selected-under-the-program-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#describe-any-conflicts-of-interest-your-entity-its-investors-or-key-personnel-may-have-with-any-potential-service-providers-selected-under-the-program-19\"></a>Describe any conflicts of interest your entity, its investors or key personnel may have with any potential service providers selected under the program</h4>\n<p>Steakhouse has a diverse client base and strong relationships in the RWA and DeFi space. As a result, there is some overlap between the STEP applicants and organizations with which we have an active engagement or economic interest. If selected as manager, Steakhouse is happy to publicly disclose any potential conflicts of interest in this regard.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"under-what-situations-would-you-make-a-recommendation-for-arbitrum-to-withdraw-its-assets-from-a-selected-service-provider-to-fulfill-each-aspect-of-the-outlined-scope-in-the-appendix-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#under-what-situations-would-you-make-a-recommendation-for-arbitrum-to-withdraw-its-assets-from-a-selected-service-provider-to-fulfill-each-aspect-of-the-outlined-scope-in-the-appendix-20\"></a>Under what situations would you make a recommendation for Arbitrum to withdraw its assets from a selected service provider to fulfill each aspect of the outlined scope in the appendix?</h4>\n<p>The scope specifically calls for assets that are stable, liquid, and provide a yield uncorrelated with crypto markets that is at least commensurate with US Treasuries. With this framework in mind, Steakhouse would monitor the following essential investment characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Capital Preservation: Minimizing credit risk to safeguard investment principal.</li>\n<li>Legal Risk: Assessing risks related to bankruptcy and regulatory changes to avoid legal entanglements.</li>\n<li>Liquidity and Salability: Ensuring that assets can be readily converted into cash without a significant loss in value.</li>\n<li>Yield and Relative Value: Striving for returns that are competitive with similar risk investments, particularly when benchmarked against U.S. Treasuries.</li>\n<li>Operational Processes: Valuing transparency and resilience in operational practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steakhouse proposes that a material and adverse change in any of these categories—should such changes prove irreparable in a timely manner—constitutes sufficient grounds to recommend the withdrawal or reduction of the investment allocation. Ultimately, many of these factors are subjective and require a deep understanding of traditional markets, institutional processes, and the broader crypto markets. Steakhouse is uniquely equipped to undertake this analysis, backed by our team’s extensive and diverse experience in these areas.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"please-list-any-experience-your-firm-has-in-working-with-decentralized-organizational-structures-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#please-list-any-experience-your-firm-has-in-working-with-decentralized-organizational-structures-21\"></a>Please list any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organizational structures</h4>\n<p>Please see the “past experience\" section above.

Similar to existing institutional processes, Steakhouse typically performs reviews annually, monthly, or more frequently as necessary, to assess changes to the asset characteristics or operational processes of each investment. A typical review cycle would be as follows:</p>\n<p><em>Daily</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor broad market events and changes, as well as disruptions to liquidity or general systemic function</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Monthly</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct a thorough review of underlying portfolio assets to assess market trends, price movements, and changes in credit risks.</li>\n<li>Certify covenant compliance to ensure all investment conditions are met, safeguarding against contractual breaches.</li>\n<li>Assess performance relative to any key benchmarks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Annually (or more frequently as necessary)</em></p>\n<p>Perform standard due diligence on each issuer through detailed questionnaires and direct calls to assess key changes, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ownership and organizational structure changes</li>\n<li>Shifts in executive or senior management</li>\n<li>Updates in accounting, technology, and custodial or other service providers</li>\n<li>Status of permits and licensing</li>\n<li>Material litigation or legal proceedings</li>\n<li>Any regulatory enforcement actions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These comprehensive checks and reviews are designed to capture a holistic view of each asset, ensuring all potential risks are managed proactively.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"describe-the-content-format-and-preparation-process-of-performance-reports-this-should-include-details-of-interest-earned-and-status-of-total-assets-provide-a-sample-if-available-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#describe-the-content-format-and-preparation-process-of-performance-reports-this-should-include-details-of-interest-earned-and-status-of-total-assets-provide-a-sample-if-available-24\"></a>Describe the content, format and preparation process of performance reports.

Currently, there is no plan to run any adjacent marketing campaigns at an ecosystem level to help drive awareness or discoverability. By failing to amplify these programs, Arbitrum DAO faces the risk of considerable spending without effective outcomes.</p>\n<p>In response to the need for marketing coordination and support at an ecosystem level for the upcoming incentive programs, we are seeking funding of 238,500 ARB from the DAO to create various short-term marketing initiatives.</p>\n<p>The key proposed initiatives include developing a <strong>discoverability page, creating a unified brand identity and messaging for the programs, and executing a comprehensive content strategy</strong>. These efforts will address immediate marketing gaps and set a foundation for long-term strategic improvements. The proposal also outlines roles and responsibilities for the campaign, including coordination by 404 DAO, execution by Rogue House, and oversight by an Advisory Council.</p>\n<p>We are seeking feedback, questions, and suggestions for improvements to refine this plan and ensure the successful rollout of the incentive programs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>A few weeks ago the 404 DAO team posted a <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-enhancing-incentive-program-discoverability/23295\">RFC</a> exploring the idea of a discoverability page for the upcoming LTIPP and STIP.B incentive programs. We presented delegates with a few initial ideas on how Arbitrum DAO could create a central base for users to discover the participating projects and opportunities. Overall, the RFC was well-received by delegates and a community call on April 19th helped sparked a period of further market research.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"insights-from-market-research-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#insights-from-market-research-3\"></a>Insights from Market Research</h3>\n<p>In total, our team conducted 16 interviews with relevant stakeholders, including the Arbitrum Foundation, Offchain Labs (OCL), STIP participants, LTIPP applicants, delegates, and marketing leaders within the Arbitrum ecosystem. From these discussions, we were able to validate marketing needs in the short term and also uncovered some additional key insights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better coordination amongst stakeholders:</strong> A top concern from delegates, Arbitrum marketing leaders, and incentive program participants was the need for better coordination between OCL, the Foundation, and the DAO in developing marketing campaigns.</li>\n<li><strong>Program Awareness:</strong> While the majority of protocols and users within Arbitrum are up to date on the DAO’s grant programs, those in other ecosystems barely know they are happening. The average user in other ecosystems is especially unaware of the upcoming incentive programs and the opportunities that will be present across Arbitrum this summer.</li>\n<li><strong>Program Branding:</strong> The current method of grant program naming and subsequent branding is not competitive with other ecosystems. Ex. Base’s Onchain Summer specifically appeals to users.</li>\n<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Arbitrum as a whole needs to build out new distribution channels to reach users. Ex. Increasing Farcaster presence</li>\n<li><strong>Retention:</strong> A lot of money is being spent on attracting users, but we should also focus on how we keep these users on Arbitrum once incentives run out.</li>\n<li><strong>Ecosystem Support:</strong> For smaller teams, extensive marketing is likely an afterthought or something they don’t have the resources for yet. Ideas explored included:\n<ul>\n<li>Discounted rates for service providers</li>\n<li>A marketing liaison between the DAO and projects to help with messaging/copy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>DAO Branding:</strong> Arbitrum DAO itself has a brand problem and it can improve its image by highlighting its success stories. Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>At an ecosystem level, generate more content (blogs, research, threads, videos, etc) on the emerging projects that are bringing new innovation.</li>\n<li>The DAO has a ton of data and reports from its grant programs that are being underutilized as it’s hidden in the forums. The ARDC is already working on creating these types of <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-research-deliverables/23438\">reports</a> which can then be marketed to a wider audience to help share success stories.</li>\n<li>DAO managed social channels to help with social media amplification</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"constraints-considered-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#constraints-considered-4\"></a>Constraints Considered</h3>\n<p>Several of these insights and problems will have to be addressed over the long term but are important for the DAO to begin thinking about. When considering what we can accomplish in the short term for the upcoming incentive programs we considered the following constraints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scope\n<ul>\n<li>What is the minimum we can accomplish in the short term to ensure the programs are successful?</li>\n<li>While there is a need and interest from stakeholders for a more comprehensive top-down marketing strategy for DAO grant programs, a campaign needs to be narrowly focused and truly short-term.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Time\n<ul>\n<li>Incentives will begin rolling out in the next couple of weeks. What actions can we reasonably accomplish in a condensed time frame to ensure we achieve the desired results?</li>\n<li>How can we design a program that can move quickly but also has proper oversight from the DAO?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Funding\n<ul>\n<li>How can we secure sufficient funding to produce a high quality campaign?</li>\n<li>Given the time restraints, several contributors or service providers would have to be paid retroactively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"proposed-initiatives-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-initiatives-5\"></a>Proposed Initiatives</h3>\n<p>From our conversations with the key stakeholders (applicants, Foundation, OCL, delegates) and input from Rogue, we have determined that the following initiatives are feasible despite a tight timeline, each of which will be explained in greater detail further below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discoverability page\n<ul>\n<li>Tags on the Arbitrum Portal</li>\n<li>Layer3 Ecosystem Map</li>\n<li>Notion Hub</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A program facelift and unified brand kit for participants</li>\n<li>Internal Content Strategy - Ex. Coordinated social posts from participants</li>\n<li>External Content Strategy - Ex. KOLs, PR push, long form blog posts, podcasts/spaces</li>\n<li>Building out and expanding official DAO social channels - Ex. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DAO_Arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@DAO_Arbitrum</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"alternatives-considered-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#alternatives-considered-6\"></a>Alternatives Considered</h3>\n<p>Originally, our team considered breaking these ideas into smaller requests that would be eligible for the Questbook or PL programs. However, when weighing all of the above constraints, our team decided the best approach was to bring this request directly to the DAO in order to have the necessary resources to produce a high-quality campaign.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-7\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Over the next 3 months, Arbitrum DAO will spend upwards of 60m ARB across the LTIPP and STIP Bridge incentives programs. Compared to other ecosystem campaigns like Base’s <a href=\"https://base.mirror.xyz/HoH9cZVi8CMdvxVUNjvOzceUPVQcVZvvkf8ZbCOVOco\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Onchain Summer II</a>, <a href=\"https://journey.mantle.xyz/en/nft\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Citizens of Mantle</a>, and even the Foundation’s <a href=\"https://portal.arbitrum.io/arcade\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum Arcade</a>, the DAO’s incentive programs are an order of magnitude larger in terms of funds being deployed, but there is currently no plan to rollout adjacent marketing support at an ecosystem level for either program. This proposal aims to address the current marketing/branding gap for the upcoming programs and help ensure that they achieve their intended purpose - to drive users, capital, attention and activity to Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>From the various stakeholder interviews conducted, the main concerns for short-term marketing revolved around driving initial awareness for the programs, ensuring attention lasted the entirety of the program, and exhausting all possible avenues for maximized distribution. The following proposed marketing plan attempts to address each of the 3 core pain points: Awareness, Discoverability and Distribution. More specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Attention at the ecosystem level. Do users know what is happening on Arbitrum? Are they familiar with the current programs and offerings orchestrated by the DAO?</li>\n<li><strong>Discoverability:</strong> Can users find the protocols offering incentives? Learn about the projects, what they do and how they can partake in their incentive campaigns.</li>\n<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Are we reaching new users, communities and ecosystems? Are we maximizing the potential of our incentive programs? Are we reaching the right users?</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-8\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<p>With this proposal, our first priority is to address the shortcomings of the incentive programs. While there are many initiatives we can undertake to improve the DAO’s marketing efforts, we see this program as a first step which provides the data and learnings necessary to make a more informed conversation on what a more robust long-term strategy is for the DAO.</p>\n<p>Our plan is to roll out a summer campaign with a targeted start date in mid June. While incentives for the LTIPP program are now expected to begin on June 3rd, we believe that this is a more realistic launch date for a coordinated campaign among participants and it is an acceptable tradeoff to have incentives begin a few weeks prior in return for a more complete campaign. Additionally, if this proposal is received positively on a Snapshot vote, some of the necessary planning work will begin. Below are the various initiatives that will be undertaken:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"discoverability-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#discoverability-9\"></a>Discoverability</h3>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum Portal</strong></p>\n<p>The official <a href=\"https://portal.arbitrum.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Abritrum Portal</a> is the current official ecosystem hub for Arbitrum. It serves as the discoverability page for all projects, Orbit chains, and specific campaigns like Arbitrum Arcade. We believe it is prudent to leverage this existing resource as much as possible, and our early conversations with OCL and the Foundation have been largely positive.

Building a DAO owned ecosystem hub for this purpose is not feasible in the short term, so to increase discoverability and overall program awareness, we propose utilizing Layer3, who has built ecosystem maps &amp; programs in the <a href=\"https://app.layer3.xyz/linea-park\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">past</a>.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/919e5e42dc94c69a14b5cb73bb4876e728da8313.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kMcxcB3SRDfRDxf01VgmRlPDGwj.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/919e5e42dc94c69a14b5cb73bb4876e728da8313_2_582x292.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"kMcxcB3SRDfRDxf01VgmRlPDGwj\" width=\"582\" height=\"292\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/919e5e42dc94c69a14b5cb73bb4876e728da8313_2_582x292.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/919e5e42dc94c69a14b5cb73bb4876e728da8313_2_873x438.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/919e5e42dc94c69a14b5cb73bb4876e728da8313_2_1164x584.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"373A44\"></a></div><br>\n*Linea Park Exploration Map<p></p>\n<p>After multiple discussions with Layer3’s team they have the ability to design and build an Arbitrum ecosystem map specifically for the LTIPP &amp; STIP.b programs free of charge. This initiative would be 100% opt-in by the participants as some protocols have baked in a questing component within their applications and thus maintaining their freedom of choice (whether participation entirely or utilizing another questing provider) is important. The only additional information required from incentive program participants is the action they want highlighted as a quest. Layer3 will manage campaign design, marketing, and execution end-to-end free of charge.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that selecting a specific questing provider upfront is not an ideal practice, the shortened time frame limits our ability to court offers from different providers. We are confident in Layer3’s wide reach and ability to execute and believe the value added from having a questing hub for the incentives hubs is substantial. Additionally, with no additional cost to the DAO and the expedited lift time this will enhance the effectiveness of the incentive programs while allowing protocols the optionality to be involved or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Notion Hub</strong></p>\n<p>When considering what is a minimally viable discoverability page that the DAO can create before incentives go live, a dedicated Notion Dashboard appears the most feasible. The dashboard can provide complete and thorough information of the projects and their respective incentive campaigns all within a central hub. Additionally, this option allows for the most flexibility in content while also catering to all projects across STIP and LTIPP.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8d7cff0a9500315867d6229cafa5ffd31760098d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kbF7Qyn8N7MWyMHjsdeKLls5r5P.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d7cff0a9500315867d6229cafa5ffd31760098d_2_624x308.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"kbF7Qyn8N7MWyMHjsdeKLls5r5P\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d7cff0a9500315867d6229cafa5ffd31760098d_2_624x308.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d7cff0a9500315867d6229cafa5ffd31760098d_2_936x462.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d7cff0a9500315867d6229cafa5ffd31760098d_2_1248x616.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0EEED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sample mock-up, design not final</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The obvious drawbacks are the limited visibility and professional look that comes with a notion page. However, given that the DAO currently only has a complete list of participants in the form of a spreadsheet, this dashboard is better than nothing.</p>\n<p>The 404 DAO team has experience with creating dashboard type pages in Notion and will be owning the creation of this hub. Our team will be responsible for collecting the necessary information from participants and preparing a version to be presented to the DAO before incentives go live.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"program-visual-identity-messaging-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-visual-identity-messaging-10\"></a>Program Visual Identity &amp; Messaging</h3>\n<p>Over the last year Arbitrum DAO has fallen into the habit of creating very literal program names ex. Short Term Marketing Program. While this is great for internal DAO programs and communications, this is far from the ideal messaging we should be presenting to the end user. In several of our interviews, individuals shared that the incentive programs lacked a unified “look and feel”, and we believe naming is one of the main contributing factors to these concerns.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we propose bringing the programs together under one name for a summer marketing campaign. Brand assets would be created by Rogue House with assistance from the Foundation and Marketing Council. Projects would have templates and graphics to use in social content and announcements. This will especially be beneficial for smaller teams who may lack a complete marketing team to properly communicate their incentive offerings. Additionally, we anticipate a unified brand to help raise more attention and awareness across social media channels.</p>\n<p>Rogue House will assist in creating the following brand assets:</p>\n<p><strong>Program Visual Identity</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program wordmark design\n<ul>\n<li>Ideally its own identity, but has connections to the overall Arbitrum brand)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Color exploration &amp; guidelines (cmyk &amp; rgb)</li>\n<li>Typography Exploration &amp; Guidelines</li>\n<li>Brand kit for delivery in form of pdf &amp; working files\n<ul>\n<li>Social templates for X</li>\n<li>Final program wordmark</li>\n<li>Final colorway and typography</li>\n<li>Placement and use guidelines</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Program Messaging</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>External program messaging playbook including:\n<ul>\n<li>Program naming</li>\n<li>Program positioning and key messaging pillars</li>\n<li>Cohesive Program announcement and roll out messaging for Arbitrum projects\n<ul>\n<li>Including Internal &amp; external messaging for the Arbitrum community and broader web3 ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A unified name and brand kit will specifically addresses the following problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program fragmentation</li>\n<li>Branding cohesion</li>\n<li>Alleviates some marketing/design burden for protocols</li>\n<li>Allows for more digestible and appealing content for average users</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"awareness-content-campaign-strategies-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#awareness-content-campaign-strategies-11\"></a>Awareness: Content Campaign &amp; Strategies</h3>\n<p>In order to bring consistent awareness to projects throughout the entire duration of the incentive programs there needs to be a full-fledged content strategy. The creation of this strategy will be led by Rogue House, and while exact details of campaign still need to be crafted, the following is a breakdown of expected responsibilities and potential deliverables:</p>\n<p><strong>Program Launch Strategy &amp; Campaign Activation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cohesive communication &amp; distribution strategy across selected social channels announcing the start of the incentive program.\n<ul>\n<li>Roll out with new program name &amp; branding</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Creation &amp; coordination of the launch moment with every project participating in the incentives program, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Providing every project with announcement assets for social</li>\n<li>Creating a unified front across projects with clear call to action aiding in program discoverability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ongoing Content Strategy &amp; Marketing Maintenance:</strong></p>\n<p>Program Content Calendar, Including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program Content Pillars</li>\n<li>Posting cadence for content pillars</li>\n<li>Design templates for specific channels (Farcaster, X, Discord, TG)</li>\n<li>Suggested copy per channel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Potential Creative Campaign Direction &amp; Development</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ex. Project led spotlight series\n<ul>\n<li>This could look like X Spaces 3 times a week where we can have 5-6 projects speak each time so that we can get through 100+ in a month</li>\n<li>Short &amp; Long Form Spotlights (Daily or weekly): blogs, threads</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ex. KOL led activation\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the Programs aligned parties and individuals willing to support the initiative and build an organic distribution channel for amplification first</li>\n<li>Explore paid KOLs as a secondary form of communication</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ex. Community driven content challenge (bounties)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"what-does-success-look-like-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-does-success-look-like-12\"></a>What does success look like</h3>\n<p>This is the first DAO led marketing campaign to be proposed to date for the incentives program. We are starting from ground zero. In order to be able to do this on a broader scale for the DAO as a whole, we need to take a first step forward. What we will learn from this initial program experiment will provide foundational data in support of building long term campaigns we can actually benchmark against.</p>\n<p>It’s important to remember that while there are many things we could and can do in the future to support the incentives program, our north star goal for this initial proposal is focused on presenting a united ecosystem front for the launch and ongoing communication.</p>\n<p>This will look like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Re-naming of the program to something that can resonate with the broader community</li>\n<li>MVP brand toolkit specific for the rollout of the incentives program</li>\n<li>Clear call-to-action for all participating projects to distribute across social channels using Program branded assets during the initial launch moment</li>\n<li>Consistent messaging across 1-2 key social channels for the entirety of the program</li>\n<li>Singular location community members can go to explore and discover projects participating in the Arbitrum Incentives Program</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we can achieve the above and get participating Arbitrum projects brought into the vision for this program specifically, what is possible by bringing the entire DAO together becomes easier to imagine. While only one program, this is an opportunity to begin to reshape and mold our brand towards who we want to be and where we want to go.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"roles-and-responsibilities-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#roles-and-responsibilities-13\"></a>Roles and Responsibilities</h1>\n<p>To build out this program we have divided responsibilities into 4 roles: Advisory Council, Marketing Agency, Project Manager, and the Multisig Signers. Normally, we would consider it best practice to fill the agency and council roles with a more complete RFP or election process.</p>\n<p>However, when considering the narrow mandate of this program and the previously mentioned time constraints, our team believes this initiative is not possible if pushed through these processes. Therefore to provide additional accountability, the following Advisory Council members and Rogue House will not be automatically grandfathered into any longer term programs without either a more complete RFP process or DAO approval.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"advisory-council-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#advisory-council-14\"></a>Advisory Council</h2>\n<p>We recognize that creating a public campaign on behalf of the DAO while also using the Arbitrum brand is a large responsibility. In order to provide oversight and insights as materials are being crafted, we will form a Marketing Advisory Council composed of key stakeholders and marketing leaders within Arbitrum. These members each have extensive marketing experience and several are long standing Arbitrum community members:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blue - Trader Joe</li>\n<li>Sam I Am - Gains Network</li>\n<li>Alex Lumley - Savvy DeFi</li>\n<li>Shreddy - JonesDAO &amp; Radiant DAO</li>\n<li>George Heath - WOOFi</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Their role is to provide insight and oversight to Rogue as they work through asset and content creation, strategy, and execution. They are in place to ensure the DAOs best interest are kept a priority during the entirety of the marketing rollout.</p>\n<p>We are in the process of potentially confirming 2 additional members for the Advisory Council. If interested please reach out to <a href=\"mailto:governance@404dao.io\">governance@404dao.io</a> with a short paragraph outlining qualifications.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"marketing-agency-rogue-house-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#marketing-agency-rogue-house-15\"></a>Marketing Agency - Rogue House</h2>\n<p>Rogue will be responsible for leading the program facelift and overall marketing strategy and execution.

Any excess funds will be returned to the DAO.</p>\n<p>We are in the process of confirming individuals to sit on the multisig and this information will be updated before a Snapshot vote.</p>\n<p>Multisig Signer 1: Frisson</p>\n<p>Mutlisig Signer 2: [TBD]</p>\n<p>Multisig Signer 3: [TBD]</p>\n<p>However, if the DAO does not wish to fund an additional multisig, we believe it is possible to utilize an existing program’s multisig, such as the LTIPP wallet, since there will likely be minimal transactions.

Describe any conflicts of interest your entity, its investors or key personnel may have with any potential service providers selected under the program</strong></em></p>\n<p>As part of our due diligence process and commitment to uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency, we have conducted a thorough review of potential conflicts of interest concerning our entity, its investors, and our key personnel in relation to any service providers considered under the program.</p>\n<p>Our investigation includes examining the personal and financial relationships that our staff, management and major investors might have with potential service providers. To date, our internal audits and declarations collected from relevant parties have not identified any conflicts of interest. All our team members and investors have confirmed that they do not hold any direct or indirect financial stakes, employment relationships or contractual engagements with the prospective service providers. We maintain rigorous policies to avoid any conflicts of interest, including routine disclosures and a strict ethical code that mandates reporting of any potential conflicts.</p>\n<p>We are prepared to provide affidavits and further documentary evidence to certify the absence of conflicts, ensuring full compliance and transparency in our engagement with selected service providers.</p>\n<p><em><strong>7. Under what situations would you make a recommendation for Arbitrum to withdraw its assets from a selected service provider to fulfill each aspect of the outlined scope in the appendix?</strong></em></p>\n<p>To ensure a robust and tailored recommendation for potentially withdrawing Arbitrum’s assets from a service provider, it is imperative to conduct a thorough and balanced analysis of the DAO’s investment objectives and requirements. This process involves developing a customized risk-return profile for the DAO, which will serve as a foundational element in setting customized red flag indicators and thresholds across the relevant areas outlined in the appendix.</p>\n<p>Drawing on industry standards and leveraging our Digital Asset Risk Rating Framework, we propose the following key considerations for decision-making:</p>\n<p><em><strong>1. Cashflow &amp; Accrual Monitoring</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Recommendation for Withdrawal:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Initial Capital Contribution and Redemption Tracking:</strong></em> Initiate an inquiry if discrepancies or delays exceed 7 business days and recommend withdrawal if no satisfactory resolution is reached within an additional 7 days, considering the impact on cash flow and operational needs.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Interest Accrual or Payment Tracking:</strong></em> Trigger an alert if deviations from expected payments exceed 3% and initiate a formal review at 5% deviations, considering both the frequency of these occurrences and their financial implications on the DAO’s treasury.</p>\n<p><strong>Interest Payment Frequencies:</strong> Recommend reassessment of the service provider if mismatches between actual and documented payment frequencies occur more than once in a fiscal quarter, taking into account the provider’s explanations and the consistency of their communication.</p>\n<p><em><strong>2. Underlying Asset Monitoring</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Recommendation for Withdrawal:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Asset Allocation Compliance:</strong></em> Alert if non standard assets exceed 5% of total portfolio and recommend withdrawal if the issue is not rectified within one month, considering the risk exposure and potential impact on the DAO’s investment strategy.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Portfolio Reporting:</strong></em> Implement quarterly reviews if reports are inaccurate or delayed by more than 10 days; recommend withdrawal if inaccuracies persist in subsequent reports or if the provider fails to meet the corrective actions agreed upon.</p>\n<p><em><strong>AuM Reporting:</strong></em> Conduct a review if the percentage of the product’s AUM pertaining to Arbitrum’s investment is inaccurately reported by more than 3% and recommend withdrawal if such inaccuracies occur twice within a year.</p>\n<p><em><strong>3. Operations &amp; Counterparty Monitoring</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Recommendation for Withdrawal:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Audit and Financial Reporting:</strong></em> Recommend withdrawal if financial and audit reports are not submitted within 15 days of the due date or if two consecutive reports fail to meet transparency standards, considering the operational risk and potential financial implications.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Service Provider Changes:</strong></em> Recommend an operational review if there are significant changes in key operational roles or management more than once in six months and consider withdrawal if these changes lead to a decrease in service quality or increased operational risk.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Material Changes in Terms:</strong></em> Recommend a strategic review if material changes are not communicated at least 30 days in advance or sooner if negative impacts on the DAO’s operations are anticipated.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Redemption Tests (Fire Drills):</strong></em> Recommend withdrawal if more than one test in a 12-month period fails to meet the agreed-upon timelines, especially if these delays could significantly impact liquidity.</p>\n<p><em><strong>4. Strategic Communication and Documentation Oversight</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Recommendation for Withdrawal:</em></p>\n<p>Governance Forum Communication: Recommend procedural adjustments if responses to significant inquiries take longer than 48 hours without adequate justification, considering the quality and effectiveness of communication in maintaining trust with stakeholders.</p>\n<p><em><strong>5. Additional Considerations for Potential Withdrawal:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Beyond the areas outlined in the appendix, it is crucial to consider further dimensions in any decision-making process concerning the potential withdrawal of allocated capital. The following areas are based on our practical experience, particularly important to evaluate, for which we as program managers can also provide additional quantified materiality thresholds in future collaboration.</p>\n<p><em>a) Regulatory Compliance:</em></p>\n<p>Continuously monitor the regulatory compliance status of the issuer in their home country, target markets and concerning investments by the DAO. Include an assessment of any emerging requirements such as new licenses or permits that may impact the viability of the investment.</p>\n<p><em>b) Market Presence and Reputation of the Service Provider:</em></p>\n<p>Assess the market presence, reputation and strategic orientation of the service provider. Consider the risks of reputational damage through detailed reviews of stakeholder engagement, transparency and the background of the corporate structure and its related entities.</p>\n<p><em>c) Risk Management and Internal Controls of the Service Provider:</em></p>\n<p>Review the robustness of the issuer’s existing risk management processes and the effectiveness of their internal controls. This should include an evaluation of how these processes integrate with the DAO’s risk management framework.</p>\n<p><em>d) Operational Resilience, Governance, and Security:</em></p>\n<p>Analyze the operational resilience, governance structures and security measures of service providers, especially regarding disaster recovery, business continuity plans and ongoing security protocols.</p>\n<p><em>e) Custody Solutions and Competitive Analysis:</em></p>\n<p>Evaluate existing custody solutions with a focus on license compliance, insurance coverage, asset segregation and technical security. Perform a competitive analysis to ensure these solutions meet the highest industry standards.</p>\n<p><em>f) Third-Party Interactions and Pricing Mechanisms:</em></p>\n<p>Scrutinize interactions with third parties, such as the use of external data (Oracle) for token pricing mechanisms and the implications of functionalities like rebasing on pricing stability. This should include comparisons with established public pricing resources.</p>\n<p><em>g) Code Integrity and Functionality:</em></p>\n<p>Assess code integrity risks, especially in terms of the roles assigned to internal and third-party functions within the token’s operational framework.</p>\n<p><em>h) Liquidity and Trading Patterns:</em></p>\n<p>Monitor liquidity and trading patterns for signs of bottlenecks or manipulated volumes, such as unexplained spikes or declines in trading activities, which can indicate underlying issues.</p>\n<p><em>i) Investor Structure and Concentration Risks:</em></p>\n<p>Analyze the distribution of token holders and wallet concentrations to identify clumping risks that could affect liquidity and market stability.</p>\n<p><em>j) Legal Liabilities and Challenges:</em></p>\n<p>Evaluate the exposure to potential legal liabilities that could arise from multinational legal interpretations or limitations within the service provider’s terms and conditions. This includes a review of jurisdictional risks and the legal structure of contracts.</p>\n<p><em>k) Ownership and Valuation of Assets:</em></p>\n<p>Verify ownership rights associated with tokens, particularly how they relate to underlying assets and their valuation. Perform correlation analyses to ensure the token’s value accurately reflects the underlying asset’s fair value.</p>\n<p><em>l) Performance Benchmarking:</em></p>\n<p>Develop and maintain an index for active benchmarking of service providers to identify performance deficiencies and guide strategic portfolio rebalancing.</p>\n<p><em><strong>8. Please list any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organizational structures</strong></em></p>\n<p>To date, there is no project-related experience in working with decentralized organizational structures.</p>\n<p><em><strong>9. What is the value of assets monitored by your entity?</strong></em></p>\n<p>As of 14 May 2024, our entity is responsible for monitoring tokens across more than 20 asset classes, with a total market capitalization of USD 7.7 billion.</p>\n<p><em><strong>10. Can you explain how risk management (investment and operational) is being done for assets under monitoring?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Our risk management process is designed to safeguard the integrity and enhance the value of assets under our monitoring, incorporating both automated systems and manual oversight to ensure comprehensive coverage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Automated Monitoring and Alerts:</strong></em></p>\n<p>We utilize sophisticated software systems to continuously monitor a wide range of on- and off-chain metrics across the assets and the service providers we are monitoring. Our sources include both public and private data - ranging from websites and third-party data providers to tracking transaction volumes, asset allocations and smart contract activities. Monitoring occurs event-based or in real-time. Automated alerts can be configured to notify management teams if certain predefined thresholds are breached. We also enforce predefined risk limits and controls, such as maximum exposure limits for specific asset classes or individual investments, to prevent excessive concentration risk. This automation enables the DAO to respond quickly to potential issues, reducing the latency between detection and action.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Manual Assessments and Reviews:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Alongside our automated systems, our risk management process relies on manual assessments conducted by our experienced analysts. These assessments include detailed reviews of financial and audit reports to verify accuracy and compliance with transparency standards. Scenario analysis and stress testing are also conducted to evaluate potential investments under various market conditions. Manual oversight extends to evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls at the issuer or service provider level, ensuring they align with our stringent requirements.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Compliance and Regulatory Monitoring:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Our risk management includes a strong focus on compliance and regulatory adherence. We regularly review the regulatory compliance status of all issuers and service providers in relation to their home countries and target markets. This process involves assessing any new licenses, permits or regulatory changes that might impact the viability of the investment or its operational framework. Our compliance efforts are strengthened by continuous monitoring of legal changes in 30+ countries, ensuring our information remains current with the latest regulatory developments.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Information Security:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Our information security, based on SOC 2 and ISO 27001 principles, emphasizes the implementation of comprehensive controls and policies to safeguard data and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. We’ve implemented access controls, encryption and regular monitoring, to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Strategic Reviews and Counterparty Analysis:</strong></em></p>\n<p>We conduct strategic reviews that encompass market presence, reputation, operational resilience, governance and security assessments of service providers. These reviews help us evaluate potential risks from changes in key operational roles or management within service providers that might affect service quality or increase operational risk.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Operational risk management also involves detailed planning and testing of disaster recovery and business continuity strategies. This process includes analyzing data from ‘fire drills’ conducted by the service provider to evaluate the efficacy of these plans. Such testing ensures robust data recovery capabilities and operational resilience under adverse conditions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Integration with Internal Controls and Adjustments:</strong></em></p>\n<p>The insights gained from both automated and manual monitoring are integrated with our internal control systems. This integration allows us to make informed decisions and adjust our risk management strategies dynamically. Regular internal audits are conducted to evaluate and enhance these processes, ensuring that our thresholds and triggers in our automated systems are appropriately set based on the requirements of the DAO, evolving risk landscapes and internal audit feedback.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Reporting and Documentation:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Detailed documentation is maintained for all risk management activities. This includes documenting the rationale behind each decision made in response to alerts, discrepancies or any other issues identified during monitoring. Regular reports are generated and disseminated to relevant stakeholders, providing transparency and facilitating ongoing evaluation of our risk management effectiveness.</p>\n<p>We refer to section 11 for further information on the preparation of reports.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Stakeholder Engagement and Communication:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Maintaining open channels of communication with all stakeholders, including timely responses to inquiries and concerns, is pivotal. This ensures that all parties are aligned and informed about the governance and risk management measures in place. The frequency and channels of communication can be individualized based on needs and requirements of the DAO. In addition Particula has implemented appropriate deputization rules for key personnel.</p>\n<p><em>A comprehensive flow chart for our risk management process can be found here:</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jdqF_uHc5bo9AbGuEoBVkLTegmB5b0Qv/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Proposal - Risk Management Process Flow<br>\n</a></p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the content, format and preparation process of performance reports. This should include details of interest earned and status of total assets. Provide a sample if available.</strong></p>\n<p>Performance reports are designed to provide comprehensive insights into the performance of investments, detailing interest earned and the status of total assets. The aim is to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are well-informed, enabling effective decision-making and ongoing management of the DAO’s investment portfolio. In this regard the reports can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the DAO, offering flexibility in both format and delivery method:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Content:</strong></em> Each report can include detailed breakdowns of interest earned over the reporting period and a current assessment of the total assets under management. This ensures stakeholders have a clear view of returns and asset growth or depreciation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Format:</strong></em> Reports can be provided in various formats to suit different stakeholder preferences, including interactive web applications, direct API feeds for real-time data integration or traditional PDF documents delivered via email.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Preparation Process:</strong></em> Data for these reports is meticulously gathered and verified through our established analytical processes. It is compiled from reliable on- and off-chain sources and calculated using both proprietary and industry-standard methods to ensure accuracy. To enhance the data integrity, we provide access to our partner portal for all service providers. This enables the direct supply and verification of data points from independent third-party sources as well as from the service providers themselves. Prior to dissemination, each report undergoes a rigorous review by our analytics team to confirm its integrity and relevance.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Delivery Frequency:</strong></em> Depending on the DAO’s needs, reports can be scheduled for delivery on a monthly, weekly or daily basis. This frequency can be adjusted as required to keep pace with the dynamic nature of the portfolio and the DAO’s operational tempo.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Customization:</strong></em> The scope and detail of reporting are customizable, allowing stakeholders to receive information that aligns closely with their investment objectives and requirements. For example, a Risk Rating Report from Ondo $OUSG, which we have attached as a reference, provides a model of such tailored financial reporting.</p>\n<p>Sample Report: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17wXvBUFxs-ZL9i9DPBpgYxBosTsmfhbx/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ondo - Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries ($OUSG)</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6f3c855bfbfffe85f8f4a7f5e4ce8bd1b6d8019a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fS2FdcvjgCqyar49i569xQQoNWa.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6f3c855bfbfffe85f8f4a7f5e4ce8bd1b6d8019a_2_446x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"fS2FdcvjgCqyar49i569xQQoNWa\" width=\"446\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6f3c855bfbfffe85f8f4a7f5e4ce8bd1b6d8019a_2_446x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6f3c855bfbfffe85f8f4a7f5e4ce8bd1b6d8019a.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6f3c855bfbfffe85f8f4a7f5e4ce8bd1b6d8019a.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"A3B3B7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>IV.

We built a new way that will allow users to earn ARB tokens on a regular basis by completing quests and collecting points. However, the feature development took longer than expected and was later impacted by the Hedgey hack. We are working hard to re-enable the feature so that users participating in Tide campaigns can receive ARB tokens on a daily or weekly basis.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The previous STIP round revealed some valuable lessons. Initially, our strategy for distributing rewards was cumbersome and slow to implement. We found that contacting projects and coordinating quest campaigns on Tide, with Tide rewarding users with ARB tokens, involved extensive back-and-forth communication before each campaign launch. However, as the program progressed, we refined our approach. We introduced a series of campaigns called “Tsunami”, organized entirely by Tide on behalf of partner projects. Each campaign would require on-chain actions on Arbitrum. This streamlined process proved to be highly successful, with over 11 thousand unique participants in just one week. We collaborated with 10 major projects in the ecosystem, distributing a total of 44k ARB tokens (<a href=\"https://www.tideprotocol.xyz/users/spaces/1881\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Join this Space on Tide</a>).</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>100K ARB</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal? [Y/N]</li>\n</ol>\n<p>N</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are going to use the incentive in a similar way as highlighted in section 3. We will organize a series of campaigns where multiple projects will have one campaign organized by Tide on our platform. An example of this is the Tide Tsunami campaign series. (<a href=\"https://www.tideprotocol.xyz/users/spaces/1881\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Join this Space on Tide</a>) . We would like to launch more series like the Tide Tsunami (two of 50k ARB distributed) with more protocols involved.</p>\n<p>We are planning to distribute the remaining tokens from the previous STIP (around 15k) together with this new STIP Addendum for completing the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>launch 2 series of Tsunami campaigns of around 40/50K ARB each with old and new partners that are building on Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The remaining ARB will be utilized to incentivize Tide community engagement via Tide’s innovative new feature, Cycles. Cycles enable projects to periodically distribute tokens based on users’ accumulated points. This engagement tool holds significant potential benefits for projects. Benefits include better and longer engagement as users are rewarded on a daily or weekly basis. Users are therefore incentivized to use protocols more often because the only way to be eligible to earn rewards is by completing quests every day/week to collect points. Points are then translated into ERC20 rewards.</p>\n<p>Moreover, projects that use Cycles distribute the rewards more efficiently and effectively during the campaign period. This allows projects to constantly improve their campaign strategy.</p>\n<p>Tide is also working on building sybil resistant campaigns using allow lists, the integration of Gitcoin Passport and the Humanode discord role verification task. Therefore, projects on Arbitrum will benefit from our sybil resistant solutions linked to Cycles</p>\n<p>So far the quest model is not flexible (do X get Y), Tide is making it more sophisticated combining actions with continuous rewards.</p>\n<p>Our sybil protection mechanisms also prevent bots and low quality users.</p>\n<p>Tide will utilize all remaining ARBs to reward users through Cycles. The STIP represents an opportunity for Tide to introduce a novel distribution method. Users will be able to claim daily or weekly ARB rewards from their favorite projects. Only users gaining points through quests completion and campaigns are eligible.</p>\n<p>Tide allows projects to launch campaigns and simple quests that ask users to complete social (Twitter and Discord) and on-chain tasks such as verifying swaps, liquidity providing, NFT holding, minimum balance, minimum number of transactions and more. Every task completion rewards users with points that add up on a leaderboard. Tide’s leaderboard, therefore, is now not only a gamification and competition tool but also a way to reward users that participate in campaigns and quests. All of this is possible with Cycles and this STIP addendum plays a fundamental role in allowing the testing of this feature with ARB rewards.</p>\n<p>Example of Cycle campaign tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily swap with project X on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Hold TVL on Arbitrum for n days</li>\n<li>Bridge to Arbitrum every day</li>\n<li>Deposit on a landing protocol on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Mint NFTs on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Hold Gitcoin passpord/Humanode credential</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Grant Breakdown: Using the funds to launch acquisition and retention campaigns on Tide</p>\n<p>Funding Address: arb1:0xe199d0CA24306cFA5BAee371b821fE5B1edF3456</p>\n<p>From the funding address we would send part of the funds to projects that would then distribute the funds as rewards to users.

We’d like to have some reference people that are responsible for keeping contact with companies that received the STIP and are available in case of doubts or questions.</p>\n<p>Incentive programs for web3 marketing platforms like Tide are very useful as they promote activity on projects working on Arbitrum while rewarding many participating users with small rewards. For example, the series of the Tide Tsunami campaigns was able to reward more than 11k users with chunks of 100ARB each. This was done in one week, however if the campaign would have lasted longer we believe numbers would also be higher. This spreads the ARB tokens to many users instead of just a few.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tide-protocol-stip-addendum/23804\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tide-protocol-stip-addendum/23804","pubDate":"Tue, 14 May 2024 15:03:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23804"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tide-protocol-stip-addendum/23804.rss","#text":"Tide Protocol STIP Addendum"}},{"title":"[Request for Support] Creation of An Arbitrum DAO Budget","dc:creator":"Entropy","category":"Arbitrum Research & Development Committee (ARDC)","description":"<p>We propose an ARDC-led creation of a comprehensive budget for the Arbitrum DAO, recognizing its long-term vision of Arbitrum enduring not just for decades, but for centuries. The DAO’s treasury management should reflect this commitment to both sustainability and growth. While we can likely all agree taking big swings is a good idea at this point in the rollup race, we should do so without spending frivolously and taking on too much risk.</p>\n<p>Given the DAO’s significant financial resources, a few of the topics we think the DAO should seek guidance on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much can the DAO allocate annually to ensure treasury longevity?</li>\n<li>Should the DAO focus on establishing recurring revenue streams or other types of spends?</li>\n<li>How can Arbitrum optimize the existing ETH in the treasury to generate returns?</li>\n<li>Which revenue streams should be prioritized for use, and which should be preserved for future growth? Should Arbitrum DAO be spending the ARB in the treasury, or prioritize spending sequencer revenue and soon the other revenue streams? What is the best way to think about Timeboost/MEV extraction in this context?</li>\n<li>More questions of this nature that will help Arbitrum DAO allocate appropriately to both growth and maintenance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our goal is to position the DAO for robust financial health, believing it is possible for the DAO to have hundreds of millions in annual revenue within three years. We seek the expertise of the Arbitrum Research and Development Collective to create a strategic, sustainable budget that aligns with the DAO’s long-term vision. We believe a collaboration between the risk and research arms could make sense in this endeavor. It could potentially make sense to pull r3gen and/or steakhouse in to help with this if we can find a quick way to budget them to do so.</p>\n<p>We are hopeful for your support and collaboration in this vital initiative.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-support-creation-of-an-arbitrum-dao-budget/23802\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-support-creation-of-an-arbitrum-dao-budget/23802","pubDate":"Tue, 14 May 2024 12:55:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23802"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-support-creation-of-an-arbitrum-dao-budget/23802.rss","#text":"[Request for Support] Creation of An Arbitrum DAO Budget"}},{"title":"[FINAL] KyberSwap STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"Maxax","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<p><strong>KyberSwap STIP Addendum</strong></p>\n<p>Applicant Name: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xMaxax\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Maxax</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hugo05558945\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hugho</a></p>\n<p>Project Name: KyberSwap (Kyber Network)</p>\n<p>Project Description: KyberSwap is a Multi-chain DEX Aggregator &amp; Limit Order, available on 17 different chains.</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://kyberswap.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://kyberswap.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>1.

evolution of DEX aggregator market share on Arbitrum since 2021</em></p>\n<p>Data source:<a href=\"https://dune.com/hugho/arbitrum-data-aggregator\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> https://dune.com/hugho/arbitrum-data-aggregator</a></p>\n<p>Data compiled from <span class=\"mention\">@sixdegree</span>’s DEX Aggregators Comparison: <a href=\"https://dune.com/sixdegree/dex-aggregators-comparison\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dune.com/sixdegree/dex-aggregators-comparison</a>\"</p>\n<p>We believe that KyberSwap can achieve significant KPIs and continue to grow exponentially with the help of the STIP:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Increase the volume of our DEX aggregator by 50% on Arbitrum(1.3B in 2024),<br>\nwhich will also have a significant impact on trading volume on Arbitrum through our integration with 48 different DEXs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Increase the number of users onboarding on Arbitrum via KyberSwap by 20% (73,636 in 2024) .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Increase the number of transactions by 20% (522k in 2024).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consolidate our presence on Arbitrum with a 15% market share.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Justification for the size of the grant:</strong></p>\n<p>KyberSwap is the top 3 Aggregator on Arbitrum based on Volume. It helped facilitate 2.2B$ volume since inception and 1.3B$ volume in 2024 up to today, 10th May 2024.</p>\n<p>We are committed to the long term success of Arbitrum by providing the most efficient solution of on-chain trading with KyberSwap Aggregator &amp; Limit-Order. From the beginning, the team deployed KyberSwap Elastic, an innovative concentrated liquidity protocol that helped sustain Arbitrum Liquidity for 15 months. Despite Elastic exploit in November 2023, the Team decided to offer a grant, up to 100% to impacted Arbitrum users. KyberSwap ethos has been proven for many years and supporting the DeFi ecosystem remains our priority.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum remains the 2nd most active chain for KyberSwap Aggregator. With many API integrations like Pendle, Dexscreener, Ramses, Defillama, DeFiSaver, Beefy… KyberSwap is a first-class solution for many projects!</p>\n<p><strong>Execution Strategy:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Trading Incentives Program (70%)</strong></p>\n<p>This “Trading Incentives Program” intends to reward all users swapping with the KyberSwap API from any supported clients (<a href=\"http://Kyberswap.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kyberswap.com</a>, Defillama, Pendle, Ramses, Dexscreener…).<br>\nEach month, 33,33% of the allocated funds in this category will be distributed to users based on the volume generated. Distribution of ARB will be proportionate to (User Volume/Total Monthly Volume) X ARB allocated over the period.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Referral Program (10%)</strong></p>\n<p>The “Referral Program” will incite KOLs and other users to bring volume activity to Arbitrum through referral links. This solution is widely used in the crypto ecosystem as an incentive to discover and try new products. We believe this is a good opportunity to bring new users to Arbitrum in a simple and efficient way. The Referrer will receive 20% of the referee allocation, on the other side, the referee will have a 10% bonus on his initial allocation.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Limit-Order Farming (20%)</strong></p>\n<p>Limit-Orders are not widely used in DeFi despite being a competitive solution to Spot Trading. With this Program, we intend to make Limit-Orders Great Again. Users which will provide liquidity (also called Makers), will receive a passive farming APR while having open orders. In order to provide efficient liquidity on the market, we will provide a bigger ARB allocation to participants that create Limit Orders near the market price of an asset.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>Multisig to receive funds - 0x5785DB8178619EAAa9429ea5e7651Fef526eEbf2</p>\n<p>Contracts for distribution (subject to change) - 0x6a4c79289FB5B7a7dDb71F7Eff6A2CBE59bE5E60</p>\n<p><strong>11. Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<p>We are unable to share any feedback for the reasons mentioned above.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We would like to share a special thanks to Castle and GMX for reminding us of our eligibility to apply for this STIP allocation.Any community and delegate feedback is welcome.

This will help create a faster-moving selection system with more accountability, allowing the DAO to gather more insights into the results of the incentive campaigns.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The LTIPP proposal included up to 200,000 ARB available for research on STIP, the Backfund, and the LTIP Pilot Program. The bounties guarantee the DAO will have multiple teams working on providing meaningful conclusions regarding the incentive programs. These conclusions will be essential to allow the DAO to possess all the information necessary to create the best possible long-term incentive framework.</p>\n<p>However, in its current format, it will take multiple months and many DAO votes to decide who will complete each bounty. This proposal aims to streamline that process so that more teams can research Arbitrum Incentives programs in a timely manner. By allowing the LTIPP council more freedom in using the bounty funds, we can move faster to start the bounties the same week as the start incentives.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>This new process not only speeds things up but also creates more accountability and can lead to more teams applying to fulfill bounties.</p>\n<p>DAO-wide votes to select who completes each bounty can become a popularity contest. This discourages less well-connected or busy researchers from applying, as they don’t want to deal with the struggle of lobbying every delegate.</p>\n<p>However, allowing the elected LTIPP council to choose the most qualified teams without the researchers worrying about lobbying and DAO politics will encourage more bounty applications. This will lead to more options to choose from and result in better overall research being done.</p>\n<p>This new process for selecting bounties also adds accountability, as the decision is made by a small group instead of the entire DAO. The DAO delegates might not want to take the time or have the expertise to read and understand each application. Additionally, it is hard to assign accountability for decisions when they are made by large groups like DAOs.</p>\n<p>However, with a smaller group making the decisions, more accountability and expertise will be placed in each decision, leading to better outcomes for the DAO. The LTIPP council comprises strong teams and individuals elected by the community who have the DAOs’ best interests in mind. The council has intimate knowledge of the incentives programs and understands what needs to be studied to create a new and improved incentives program.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-4\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<p>The LTIPP proposal allocated a maximum of 200k ARB for research bounties. To streamline the process, this proposal allows the council to choose who fulfills each bounty. The proposed new bounty format is as follows.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"bounty-submission-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#bounty-submission-5\"></a>Bounty Submission</h4>\n<p>Starting May 20th, researchers can apply for bounties by submitting applications on the forum. By Friday, May 17th, the council will put out a list of bounties they would like researched but researchers can also submit their own ideas for bounties.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"bounty-feedback-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#bounty-feedback-6\"></a>Bounty Feedback</h4>\n<p>Applications for research bounties will be due May 31st. The council and delegates will give feedback on the forum up until the 31st to give feedback and allow people to alter their applications.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"bounty-selection-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#bounty-selection-7\"></a>Bounty Selection</h4>\n<p>The LTIPP council will then select which bounties to fund on June 7th.

Our experience during this phase was intense and filled with learning opportunities. Although the program officially kicked off in March, we conducted several tests throughout <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/experimental-delegate-incentive-test-1/20944\">January</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/experimental-delegate-incentive-test-2/21172\">February</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/experimental-delegate-incentive-test-3/22219\">March</a>. We dedicated a considerable amount of time in the program, managing data, gathering feedback, addressing delegate concerns, and striving for clear and concise communication.</p>\n<p>Many of our initial assumptions turned out differently, and there were aspects we hadn’t anticipated, which evolved alongside the DAO’s dynamics. Looking back, we were right to label this program as experimental. Ultimately, being administrators of the program doesn’t imply ownership; it belongs to the DAO, and this is an invitation to collective improvement.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-developments-key-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-developments-key-1\"></a>Key Developments <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/key.png?v=12\" title=\":key:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":key:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h1>\n<p>Throughout implementation, we recognized the program’s potential for change. Collaborating with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/mmurthy\">@mmurthy</a> and the Karma team, we continuously enhanced existing aspects, particularly with the delegate dashboard. Some of the job done so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding relevant information about the parameters measured by the program.</li>\n<li>Updating data for delegates who have reached +50K ARB delegations</li>\n<li>Pushing constant fixes</li>\n<li>Developing automation for the Communication Rationale parameter. Improving significantly and giving a clear breakdown of both onchain and offchain communication rationale.</li>\n<li>Automating the Commenting Proposals parameter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In that process, we also fine-tuned the scoring parameters and established direct communication channels with the delegates. The program facilitated daily interaction with stakeholders committed to the Arbitrum ecosystem, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Additionally, we received unwavering support from the Tally team, and we are grateful for their assistance at all times. Last but not least, we must recognize the invaluable feedback and comments provided by the delegates, which served as the cornerstone for the changes we intend to propose.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"learning-mistakes-improvements-mag-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#learning-mistakes-improvements-mag-2\"></a>Learning, Mistakes, Improvements <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mag.png?v=12\" title=\":mag:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":mag:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h1>\n<p>During the process, we encountered scenarios where it was necessary to make unilateral decisions, responding to the circumstances in order to efficiently resolve the situations as they arose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LTIPP: We faced the challenge of addressing 77 proposals within a short timeframe. Considering the large volume of proposals, <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/about-ltipp-in-aprils-delegate-incentive-program/23103\">we communicated that it wasn’t necessary to comment on each one</a> to avoid excessive spam and overload for delegates. We prioritized ensuring delegates had sufficient time to vote, given the sheer volume of proposals during that week.</li>\n<li>The same approach was taken with the 17 proposals labeled ‘Post Council Feedback’, as highlighted by Bob-Rossi in his <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/about-ltipp-in-aprils-delegate-incentive-program/23103/4\">comment</a>.</li>\n<li>ARDC Elections: During the ARDC elections in March, we decided it wasn’t necessary to comment on each individual election. Since there were no forum posts for each vote and it didn’t add much value, we solely considered the voting rationale.</li>\n<li>Council Elections: Initially, we were unsure how to incorporate the work of delegates who dedicated time to selecting the best Security Council members. Due to the sensitive nature and voting dynamics of this election, to avoid confusion among delegates, we chose not to include it in this first iteration of the program. We are working on how to include it for the next Security Council election.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our decisions were made with the following considerations in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoiding unnecessary noise and spam</li>\n<li>Minimizing additional workloads</li>\n<li>Preventing gameability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to expand the discussion to include you all, so together we can devise a mechanism to prevent arbitrariness when addressing ongoing issues. Arbitrum DAO is incredibly dynamic, and new challenges will continue to arise… We aim to enhance the program experience based on the feedback we’ve received and ensure that the best possible decision emerges from the consensus of the DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"looking-ahead-eyes-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#looking-ahead-eyes-3\"></a>Looking Ahead <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=12\" title=\":eyes:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":eyes:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h1>\n<p>During the past few weeks, we’ve been actively seeking feedback from some delegates with the aim of swiftly improving and iterating the program. As a result, we would like to implement some minor changes that we believe can enhance the program:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ceasing the requirement for Commenting Proposals (CP) and Communication Rationale (CR) in technical proposals: We’ve noticed that unless delegates have a high level of technical knowledge, it’s challenging for them to provide valuable input on these types of proposals. To avoid forced comments, we propose discontinuing the inclusion of CP and possibly CR for technical proposals, which are typically driven by the Arbitrum Foundation.</li>\n<li>Adjusting the Participation Rate parameter: Instead of considering the entire historical data, we propose considering the last 90 days. This change, inspired by feedback from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cp0x\">@cp0x</a> , would be fairer to users actively engaging in the DAO’s day-to-day operations.</li>\n<li>Lowering the token delegation threshold for program participation from 50k to 25k ARB: Inspired by feedback from the Arbitrum Foundation, we believe this adjustment would enable more delegates to participate in the program.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"executing-changes-test_tube-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#executing-changes-test_tube-4\"></a>Executing Changes <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/test_tube.png?v=12\" title=\":test_tube:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":test_tube:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h1>\n<p>Our plan is to discuss these proposals with delegates and vote on them via Snapshot to ensure consensus within the community. In addition to the various individual conversations we’ve had with delegates, we aim to continue seeking feedback so that each decision is thoroughly deliberated and achieved through consensus. We want to hear from you, which is why we will host a public call to discuss the proposed changes to the incentive program on Friday, the 17th at 12:00 UTC.

PV01’s non-custodial platform Pivio allows issuers and institutional investors access to the primary and secondary bond markets in a transparent and efficient manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Product:</strong></p>\n<p>PV01’s digital bonds are the world’s first blockchain native debt secured by assets in a bankruptcy-remote SPV under English law - the gold standard for bond issuance. Our stable RWA backed product, a digital bond represented by a fully transferable bearer ERC-20 token called a ‘TBL’ token, is collateralized (secured) by a direct, 1-for-1 exposure to a single, underlying US Treasury Bill having the same maturity and same face amount. TBLs are denominated in USDC, and issued on the Ethereum blockchain in bearer (dematerialised) form represented by the ERC-20 bond tokens.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"chcklst-box checked fa fa-check-square-o fa-fw\"></span> <strong>Our product is a new “composable” primitive</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our TBLs are as proximate as possible on-chain with the fewest steps to owning a T-Bill in the fiat system. As modular, building block-like financial instruments, they can be reused to build other financial products on-chain.</p>\n<p>As building blocks, they are easily transferable with very few restrictions. They have the potential to be used as collateral in CeFi and DeFi. Their non-rebasing form makes it easy to compose with other dApps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"chcklst-box checked fa fa-check-square-o fa-fw\"></span> <strong>Fit for corporate debt</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first iteration of PV01’s product are tokens representing US T-Bills. However, the legal structure lends itself naturally to corporate bond issuances. PV01 will soon issue corporate bonds directly on-chain for crypto companies. The crypto credit market exceeded $30bn at its peak and has the potential to be even bigger in this new cycle. Having the ability to invest in the debt of major crypto-native companies on-chain would increase the attractiveness of Arbitrum as a blockchain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"chcklst-box checked fa fa-check-square-o fa-fw\"></span> <strong>PV01’s Network</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The team at PV01, having been operating in crypto as early as 2013 for some, has deep and personal connections with major exchanges and market makers, essential components of any new ecosystem. Market makers will deploy trading capital to Arbitrum should there be significant issuance of TBLs there. One large exchange is committed to accepting TBLs as collateral. Arbitrum will benefit from the cascading effect of involving volume-driven participants, not only TVL-driven participants.

This proposal is effectively a grant request for front-end work to allow users to submit transactions directly to L1 when the Arbitrum Sequencer experiences downtime. The proposal makes use of Hedgey’s <code>BatchPlanner</code> contract to distribute the payment through a vesting plan. We were asked to review the on-chain proposal to be executed and share any security concerns we had.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>The proposal is made up of three different calls to be made from the L2 Treasury Timelock:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It transfers $ARB 42,500 out of the DAO treasury to itself</li>\n<li>It then <code>approve</code>s Hedgey’s <code>BatchPlanner</code> contract for the same amount</li>\n<li>Finally, it calls Hedgey’s BatchPlanner contract which transfers the tokens to itself and then finally to a “locker” contract which stores and administers the vesting plan.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our simulation of this proposal was successful (i.e. did not revert) and our review of the contracts and their simulated behavior showed that the proposal provides two key features critical for the proposal’s success:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the proposer had access to funds which vested according to the specified schedule</li>\n<li>the security council had the ability at all times to revoke any unvested tokens</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Overall, we believe the proposal will execute successfully and meets the security expectations of the proposer and delegates.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"prepatory-calls-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#prepatory-calls-3\"></a>Prepatory Calls</h2>\n<p>The first two calls of the proposal entirely involve Arbitrum contracts that should be well known to the community and have done these sort of transactions before.

The compromised contract is not used by the contracts in this proposal and does not interact with the proposal contracts in any way. The issue it exhibited was <a href=\"https://github.com/hedgey-finance/Locked_VestingTokenPlans/blob/6a5ff58c2e83015b83c8de15f1cc61e9ac58f2c7/contracts/Periphery/ClaimCampaigns.sol#L193\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">giving approval privileges to an unsanitized address</a>. This specific issue is not present in the proposal contracts.</p>\n<p>The first contract, <code>BatchPlanner</code>, is used simply as an entry point for creating the vesting schedule. It performs some sanitation checks on the data, transfers the entire grant amount to itself, approves the other Hedgey contract (<code>VotingTokenVestingPlans</code>) to later take those tokens, and then calls the other contract’s <code>createPlan</code> method with the vesting schedule data.</p>\n<p>The second contract, <code>VotingTokenVestingPlans</code>, is the real work-horse of the vesting schedule and is referred to as the “locker” contract. It takes the grant tokens and starting from 1 Apr 2024 @ 12am UTC will vest $ARB 0.00323 per second (or roughly $ARB 1956.16 per week) until the final grant amount is entirely vested on 31 Aug 2024 @ 2am UTC. There is an initial cliff on 1 May 2024 @ 12am UTC where not tokens will be officially vest before then, but afterward all of the accrued, vesting tokens will become available. Below is a chart to show the total vested amount over time. Note that the on-chain vesting amounts don’t exactly match the numbers in the description of the proposal. These discrepancies are due to the authors rounding numbers to make the description more readable for the audience. They are, however, generally accurate.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e39517af8e3c86132f8e2774fdf501ab26510dd1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wthOx2OyxRfL8iAsfHlqjQzcv9n.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e39517af8e3c86132f8e2774fdf501ab26510dd1.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"wthOx2OyxRfL8iAsfHlqjQzcv9n\" width=\"690\" height=\"260\" data-dominant-color=\"EEEEEE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>With the grant transferred to the “locker” contract, some new functionality becomes available. It exposes a <code>redeemPlans</code> method which the proposer’s multi-sig can call to transfer vested grant tokens. It also exposes methods <code>revokePlans</code> and <code>futureRevokePlans</code> which the Arbitrum 7 of 12 Security Council contract can call to end the vesting schedule at either the time of call or a future, specified time and receive the tokens that will no longer vest. The Security Council contract can also call the <code>transferFrom</code> method to replace the proposer’s multi-sig as the owner of the grant. This is intended to be used in case the grant proposers lose access to their own multi-sig.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, while the tokens themselves are not able to be transferred out of the locker except as scheduled, the locker does allow the  proposer’s multi-sig to immediately gain the ability to delegate the <em>entire</em> grant’s voting power to another contract using its <code>delegate*</code> methods. In this way, the proposal will grant voting power to the proposers more than their actual ownership entails.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We looked for all sorts of ways in which the expected behaviors could fail or be frustrated.

During this analysis, concerns have arisen regarding the usage of ARB incentives by Synapse.</p>\n<p>As part of STIP Round 2, Synapse received an incentive allocation of 2M ARB, which was streamed to the project’s dedicated Funding Address (0xd31d3a2c19123b8ff48560c20a08ffb16ad62dfe) between January and March 2024. Following the STIP’s conclusion on March 29th, 2024, 750K ARB from the Funding Address was sent to three separate wallets on April 12th, 2024:</p>\n<p>0x95aAA6B27D6001dAb496c9FB229dE4CBd443C648 (~360K ARB)<br>\n0x7db3441406C34aF060eC64C31c4943A0234d8b36 (~150K ARB)<br>\n0xf6a3928F8E6820d78465Ef2675a8ad2438dd2a83 (~240K ARB)</p>\n<p>These wallets still hold all of the transferred ARB and have received small amounts of ETH from a wallet connected to the ENS socrates0x.eth (0xfc7A6e0b80b2cfcABBa789ef1565Af9BC5d00aa0), who is the co-founder of Synapse Labs. All of the ARB across the three wallets is currently delegated to socrates0x.eth, as can be seen in <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3725526/6266044\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this Dune query</a>. Moreover, ARB from the Funding Address was sent to a Distribution Address (0x48Fa1EBDa1AF925898c826c566F5Bb015E125EAd) before tokens were distributed to users. This Distribution Address still holds ~3.3K ARB.</p>\n<p>These actions raise questions about compliance with the rules established by the STIP, which stipulate that protocols receiving incentives should return any unused ARB to the DAO and prohibit the use of the grant in governance.

This is in line with the compensation structures of recently approved committees within Arbitrum DAO with similar workloads (e.g., LTIPP). Additionally, the SSSF Sub-committee will be tasked with administering $2.5 million worth of ARB and selecting the security service providers most deserving of a subsidy fund based on the Means Test outlined in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958\">Subsidy Fund Proposal</a>.</p>\n<p>TL;DR</p>\n<p>Proposal Overview:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish the Security Services Subsidy Fund (SSSF) Sub-committee with 5 elected members.</li>\n<li>Members will be compensated 100 ARB per hour, up to 15 hours per week, for 8 weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Funding and Structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The SSSF Sub-committee will manage $2.5 million in ARB to subsidize security service providers.</li>\n<li>Members are elected through a Snapshot voting process using a weighted voting system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Operational Details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Sub-committee will use the Means Test from the Subsidy Fund Proposal to select deserving security service providers.</li>\n<li>The Sub-committee aims to maintain transparency and efficiency in the allocation of the subsidy fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Member Criteria and Selection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Candidates should possess expertise in security, legal, procurement, operational management, and financial management.</li>\n<li>They are expected to have strong communication skills, technical knowledge, and a track record of ethical conduct.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Election and Onboarding Process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Election involves a 7-day application period and a 7-day voting period, followed by KYB/KYC checks and a 3-week onboarding period.</li>\n<li>The total process from election to subsidy disbursement adds approximately 6 weeks to the initial timeline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Application and Review Process.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A two-week submission period followed by a 6-week review period using the Means Test to evaluate applications.</li>\n<li>Initial screening based on key sub-criteria like funding gap rationale and KPIs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reporting and Accountability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Sub-committee will provide monthly updates on project progress and fund utilization.</li>\n<li>Outcome metrics include the percentage of projects successfully deployed on Arbitrum and achievements of outlined KPIs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Budget and Allocation Constraints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The maximum subsidy for any single project is capped at 10% of the total fund, or $250,000 in ARB.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h3>\n<p>Following discussions on the Subsidy Fund Proposal from the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (‘ADPC’), which can be found <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958\">here</a>, the administration and selection process for these subsidies will be overseen by the SSSF Sub-committee, rather than the ADPC as originally proposed. The ADPC would also like to clarify that the applications for the Subsidy Fund will only be accepted after vendors are whitelisted in accordance with the Procurement Framework for security-oriented service providers, by the ADPC.</p>\n<p>The original intention behind the inclusion of this task under the remit of the ADPC at no additional cost to the DAO was in part based on the fact that during the elections for the ADPC, there was a low number of applicants with a procurement background.</p>\n<p>While the ADPC wishes to remain responsive to the wishes of the DAO, we should note the adverse impacts and risks associated with the requested approach. These include (i) the creation of a new workstream that was not part of the original mandate and distracts from the core functions of the ADPC (ii) the natural delays associated with teams getting voted in, fully briefed on the procurement strategy and developing the necessary understanding of the legalities of the framework agreement. They will also need to establish working relationships, work allocation and deal-flow, get up to speed on the state of negotiations, tools, processes, etc.</p>\n<p>This will require at minimum a 3-4 week onboarding period, which will delay the disbursement of the subsidies by several weeks. We hope the current proposal of setting aside 3 weeks as the expectation for completion of this process represents an acceptable middle ground for the community.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to establish the SSSF Sub-committee, which will be composed of five [5] members. These members will be selected through an open election process using Snapshot’s weighted voting system, with the five [5] highest-ranked candidates being elected to the Committee. The committee’s term will last for 8 weeks.</p>\n<p>While the final decision will rest with the SSSF Sub-committee, their evaluations will be strongly guided by the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958\">Means Test from the ADPC’s Subsidy Fund proposal</a> that assesses key metrics to identify deserving projects.</p>\n<p>Albeit not legally binding, both delegates and token holders are encouraged to adhere to the specified selection criteria when voting for the SSSF Sub-committee members. This will ensure that the committee is adequately equipped to effectively carry out its duties and responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Note: The ADPC members will not be applying for any sub-committee positions unless this is explicitly requested by the community.</p>\n<p><strong>[1] Selection Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>In order for the committee to effectively fulfill its duties and responsibilities, it should ideally be comprised of individuals who possess the following attributes:</p>\n<p><strong>[i] Core Attributes</strong></p>\n<p><em>Security Knowledge</em></p>\n<p>Experience with digital asset security services (on the client or service provider side) and familiar with concepts such as static analysis bug detection, visualising the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, etc.</p>\n<p><em>Legal Knowledge</em></p>\n<p>A solid background and understanding of legal frameworks and core legal aspects, particularly those relating to contract law. Legal professionals can identify and mitigate legal risks associated with the operations of subsidy fund as facilitated by the legal agreements underpinning this process as developed by the ADPC. This aims to safeguard the committee, ensure an airtight legal workflow for the procurement framework, and aids in ensuring that all agreements are legally sound and thus.</p>\n<p><em>Procurement Expertise</em></p>\n<p>Prior experience in leading and managing a strategic sourcing process, in particular relating to project planning, strategic execution and thorough performance evaluation. This skill set supports the effective oversight of deadlines, optimal allocation of resources, and management of the strategic sourcing deliverables with precision, all while ensuring that transparency and fairness are maintained.</p>\n<p><em>Operational Expertise</em></p>\n<p>Prior operational experience relating to the managing, administration and selection of prospective applicants, particularly in managing IT and security services.</p>\n<p><strong>[ii] Other relevant attributes</strong></p>\n<p><em>Proven Track Record in Collaborative Environments</em></p>\n<p>Strong communication skills and proven ability to work well in team settings, especially in other DAO Communities. This encompasses skills that enhance collaboration with other fellow committee members, stakeholders, and service providers. It also includes a readiness to entertain different perspectives and achieve consensus.</p>\n<p><em>Financial Acumen</em></p>\n<p>A solid grasp of financial management, including budgeting, cost analysis, and understanding financial impacts is essential. This knowledge will aid in evaluating the financial health of subsidy applicants and ensure efficient distributions of subsidies, helping to maximize the ROI of the subsidy fund for the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p><em>Technical Knowledge &amp; Analytical Skills</em></p>\n<p>This includes robust analytical capabilities for reviewing subsidy fund proposals and performance indicators. Practical knowledge of security services is advantageous, as it enables the committee to identify and evaluate technical gaps associated with subsidy fund proposals, leading to a more thorough evaluation of technical proposals.</p>\n<p><em>Ethical Conduct &amp; Integrity</em></p>\n<p>Candidates must have a clear professional record and remain free from any conflicts of interest related to potential subsidy recipients. They must disclose any existing or potential conflicts that could compromise their ability to make decisions impartially and independently. Additionally, candidates are expected to commit to the highest standards of integrity and confidentiality in their roles, ensuring transparency and fairness in the selection of security service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>[2] Election Timeline</strong></p>\n<p>The following process will be overseen by the ADPC.</p>\n<p><em>[i] Application Submission Period (7 days):</em></p>\n<p>Candidates can apply on this dedicated page on the ArbitrumDAO Forums, adhering to the stipulated application template. Should the ArbitrumDAO vote in favor of this proposal on Snapshot, the submission period will be initiated for a period of 7 days.</p>\n<p><em>[ii] Member Election (7-day period following the end of Application Submission Period):</em></p>\n<p>A Snapshot with weighted voting will be included, including the list of all eligible candidates. The five [5] highest-voted candidates will be elected to the Security Services Subsidy Fund Sub-committee.</p>\n<p><em>[iii] KYB/KYC &amp; Delegate Review Period (7-day period following the end of member election):</em></p>\n<p>Applicants who have been elected will then be required to undergo KYB/KYC processes. The Arbitrum Foundation will oversee this compliance process, disqualifying any candidates who fail to meet KYB/KYC standards.</p>\n<p><em>[iv] Elected Members Onboarding &amp; Organisation (21-day period following the end of KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period):</em></p>\n<p>Following the elections, the five [5] highest-voted candidates will be briefed by the ADPC and given 3-weeks to familiarize themselves with the procurement strategy, legal frameworks, negotiation states, tools, processes, etc. Following this, the elected committee members will be responsible for executing the Application Process described in the Subsidy Fund Proposal.</p>\n<p>As determined by the Snapshot proposal, the Subsidy Fund will take place over 1 cohort consisting of a period of 8 weeks. Subsequently, the process underlying the election of the SSSF Sub-committee will add 6 weeks to the previously expected timeframes relating to this proposal. Therefore, this will result in a total timeframe of around 14 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>[3] Election Application Timeline</strong></p>\n<p>Kindly refer to the Selection Criteria outlined above when completing the election application template.

To create the reports the SSSF Sub-committee will set two monthly check-ins where projects fill a template/slide in order to give the key info about the project’s status, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Summary of Achievements for the Month</li>\n<li>Funds Utilized</li>\n<li>Milestones Reached</li>\n<li>Challenges Faced &amp; Plan of Action</li>\n<li>Feedback Integration, i.e., how projects have incorporated feedback provided.</li>\n<li>Next Steps &amp; Priorities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Output Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>With the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for meaningful output will look as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of Projects Funded: Total number of projects that have been funded.</li>\n<li>Total Funds Allocated: Cumulative sum of funds distributed, showcasing the program’s financial impact.</li>\n<li>Percentage of projects funded in target verticals: As outlined in the Means Test, the three key verticals identified are RWAs &amp; Tokenization, Gaming, and Collab Tech.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcome Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on the final portfolio of funded projects, the SSSF Sub-committee will gauge the success rate of awarded projects through specific outcome metrics. While these metrics can be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as market conditions and individual decisions on a project level, the sub-committee will be committed to supporting and funding the most promising projects to the best of their ability. Metrics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Percentage of funded projects successfully deployed on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Percentage of KPIs outlined in the application achieved by funded projects</li>\n<li>Percentage of projects successfully deployed as Orbit chains: One of the key aims of the Arbitrum DAO is to build and expand the Orbit ecosystem. Funding projects that grow the Orbit ecosystem is a net positive for the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the results of the grants will naturally incur a time lag, the SSSF sub-committee is required to report on the outcome metrics no later than 6 months post the end of the first 8-week cohort.</p>\n<p><strong>[vi] Project Allocation</strong></p>\n<p>The allocation of the subsidy fund focuses on achieving high impact while ensuring that a de minimus number of projects obtain funding.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the subsidy is spread across a large number of projects rather than concentrated in several larger projects, the maximum subsidy to be granted will comprise 10% of the subsidy fund available. Therefore, given that the subsidy fund amounts up to $2.5 million, the maximum subsidy that a project can receive will comprise no more than $250K worth of ARB.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-set-up-a-sub-committee-for-the-security-services-subsidy-fund/23766\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-set-up-a-sub-committee-for-the-security-services-subsidy-fund/23766","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 10:03:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23766"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-set-up-a-sub-committee-for-the-security-services-subsidy-fund/23766.rss","#text":"Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Set up a Sub-Committee for the Security Services Subsidy Fund"}},{"title":"Sanko GameCorp STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"SankoGameCorp","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h4><a name=\"information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\"></a>Information about STIP/STIP Backfund</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Can you provide a link to your previous STIP proposal (round 1 or backfund)?</li>\n</ol>\n<aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"17486\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/sankogamecorp/48/4100_2.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/sanko-gamecorp-final-stip-round-1/17486\">[Sanko GameCorp] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]</a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/incentive-framework/14\"><span data-category-id=\"14\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #000000; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF; --parent-category-badge-color: #25AAE2;\" data-parent-category-id=\"16\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category --has-parent\"><span class=\"badge-category__name\">Incentive Framework (Round 1)</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    <a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/5dd74792ff172770899afaad6dab86577ff015dd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/do9DCQKWlziz7zDhRb2wdSLgeQt.png?dl=1\" title=\"sanko_logo_white_copy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[sanko_logo_white_copy]</a> \n<a name=\"section-1-applicant-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#section-1-applicant-information-1\"></a>SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\nApplicant Name: Sanko GameCorp \nProject Name: Sanko Dream Machine \nProject Description: The Sanko Dream Machine is a multimedia-focused infrastructure protocol and suite of games hosted natively on Arbitrum.

cumulative volume and earnings during the STIP incentivization period. ARB incentives were distributed to users at the end of two seasons – 200K ARB was distributed to users at the end of Season 1 on February 2, 2024; 300K ARB was distributed at the end of Season 2 on March 29, 2024. Users accumulated points during each by interacting with Sanko TV in meaningful ways by tipping streamers, trading Passes, and hosting popular streams. Following the ARB disbursement at the end of Season 1, Sanko TV experienced a noticeable uptick in volume, earnings, and TVL; this also coincided with the addition of UX-enhancing features to Sanko TV, including stream VODs and boosted streams.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An interesting lesson learned relates to airdropping incentives in seasons rather than via drip. Sanko GameCorp distributed points to users at the end of each week based on their activity on Sanko TV. At the end of each season, the portion of a user’s points relative to the total number of points distributed determined their share of the rewards pool. Distributing ARB this way allowed us to ensure that user rewards corresponded with enduring Sanko TV and that rewards would last for the entire duration of the incentive period. The delayed gratification for users in this strategy may not have motivated potential users on the fence of joining Sanko TV until after the ARB allocated for Season 1 was airdropped. Presumably, some of this segment realized the opportunity once this occurred and converted to Sanko TV users.</p>\n<p>Overall, we were very satisfied with the results of the STIP program and believe it delivered measurable growth for the project, which has been sustained.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>250K ARB</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

One suggestion would be to equitably distribute grant funding across projects of all sizes – while established projects certainly deserve support, in the initial STIP the largest projects took the lion’s share of the grant to the preclusion of smaller projects that may produce a higher relative impact on Arbitrum’s adoption through programs like this.</p>\n<p>In addition, the timeline for disbursement - where every project has to release funds under the same timeline - hinders the flexibility of individual projects in a way that diminishes the effect of the program. More flexibility should be given to projects individually for their disbursement timeline. This would produce greater results.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/sanko-gamecorp-stip-addendum/23765\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/sanko-gamecorp-stip-addendum/23765","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 06:22:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23765"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/sanko-gamecorp-stip-addendum/23765.rss","#text":"Sanko GameCorp STIP Addendum"}},{"title":"Solv Protocol STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"Ray","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h4><a name=\"information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\"></a>Information about STIP/STIP Backfund</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Can you provide a link to your previous STIP proposal (round 1 or backfund)?</li>\n</ol>\n<aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"17236\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/r/e9a140/48.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/solv-protocol-final-stip-round-1/17236\">[Solv Protocol] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]</a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/incentive-framework/14\"><span data-category-id=\"14\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #000000; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF; --parent-category-badge-color: #25AAE2;\" data-parent-category-id=\"16\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category --has-parent\"><span class=\"badge-category__name\">Incentive Framework (Round 1)</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    <a name=\"section-1-applicant-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#section-1-applicant-information-1\"></a>SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\nProvide personal or organizational details, including applicant name, contact information, and any associated organization.

This would attract more institutional investors who seek secure, compliant, and scalable investment opportunities, and allow existing companies and users to take advantage of these RWA-backed yield products without ever having to off-ramp USDC or move to a different chain.</li>\n<li>Diversification of Investment Portfolios: The introduction of RWA-backed yield products allows investors to build diversified portfolios directly within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This diversification is crucial for risk management and provides more options for yield-seeking behavior, broadening the appeal of Arbitrum to a wider investor base.</li>\n<li>Innovation in Collateral and Financial Markets: Providing builders with new forms of composable digital collateral can lead to the creation of innovative financial instruments and markets. This development supports Arbitrum’s positioning as a cutting-edge platform for financial technology.</li>\n<li>Robust Legal and Regulatory Framework: The secure, time-tested, bankruptcy-remote legal and regulatory framework that OpenTrade operates under, managed by regulated investment firms, adds a layer of security and trust.

However, given the aforementioned learnings from the last STIP cycle we are now proposing a more unique incentive mechanism which should provide higher value to the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p>Our proposed incentive distribution breakdown is as follows:</p>\n<p>50% (375,000) of the requested funds used to incentivise the growth of Stargate’s native USDC pool on Arbitrum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stargate is about to launch its V2 which, <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x1c55529c8df43cc97591696a135a7b82af27fb8c58a09cf0bdc80aa29310d27d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">among many improvements</a>, facilitates the bridging of native USDC alongside ETH and USDT (whereas V1 only supported USDC.e). The more native USDC liquidity available on Stargate, the easier it is for users to access this asset when bridging into the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Stargate’s pool is currently the 3rd largest holder of USDC.e on Arbitrum, and these incentives would help to essentially eliminate that, while significantly ramping up liquidity for native USDC.</li>\n<li>It’s a substantial challenge to migrate from USDC.e to native USDC, and therefore it’s a significant value proposition for those who bridge through Stargate to onboard directly into native USDC, supporting Arbitrum’s migration efforts.</li>\n<li>Whilst we are aware of previous feedback indicating a preference from some in the DAO to turn attention away from incentivising liquidity we are confident that incentivising liquidity for native USDC on Arbitrum is the lowest friction and most impactful way to grow native USDC on Arbitrum whilst also providing better costs for users and a resulting improved UX.</li>\n<li>With the requested funds allocated we should be able to maintain an APY of 14% for the relevant period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>25% (187,500) of the requested funds used for gas rebates when bridging of OFTs (<a href=\"https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">omnichain fungible tokens</a>) into the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stargate is uniquely positioned as the sole interface for most OFTs in the ecosystem. This includes some of the largest projects in DeFi, as well as many other STIP participants. For example: $RDNT, $USDe ($sUSDe and $ENA), $JOE, $rsETH. This also includes assets that have been permissionlessly expanded to Arbitrum as OFTs via several governance votes, such as <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gmx.eth/proposal/0xd1b6a1b2b3341d87caae34bb29817513a2108cc9de943556d46f8eed5e4790e0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$WBNB</a> and <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gmx.eth/proposal/0x7d70cb94128482bcae66e8815ad2cfd04126b702931504c58bdc88e11163c7a4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$OP</a> used in GMX markets.</li>\n<li>Incentivising the bridging of these tokens is something we view as very valuable to the underlying protocols, and could drive greater trading volume on (Perps) DEXes, staking, and governance participation on the Arbitrum Network.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>15% (112,500) of the requested funds used for gas rebates on native USDC bridging.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On top of incentivising the growth of Stargate’s native USDC pool we propose using 15% of the requested funds to rebate the fees incurred by users bridging USDC into Arbitrum over this STIP period.</li>\n<li>Users will indirectly be incentivised to bridge native USDC into Arbitrum given the lower cost. This will again contribute to the growth of native USDC on Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>10% (75,000) of the requested funds used for gas rebates on native ETH bridging.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stargate is uniquely placed in offering deep liquidity when bridging ETH into Arbitrum. For example, at time of writing, you can bridge &gt;1500ETH (~$4.5M) from Optimism to Arbitrum in a single transaction, in ~25 seconds.</li>\n<li>By rebating gas fees Stargate will be supporting the flow of native ETH into Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With regards to the amounts, the average gas cost for bridging into Arbitrum over the past 30D has been $0.38 (or 0.00012ETH). This applies to both the native ETH/USDC.e and OFT bridging. Stargate has 488,000 transactions into Arbitrum in this period (30D). The proposed amount would therefore rebate roughly 30-days worth of transactions at current $ARB price ($1.01).</p>\n<p>With the launch of Stargate V2, we’re expecting these costs to come down by 60-80%, and so could rebate roughly 3x more transactions, for a total of 1.2-1.4M. This also aligns with what our extrapolated 90D volume would be, at 1.46M transactions. We therefore expect that the proposed amount would be sufficient for native ETH/USDC bridging transactions.</p>\n<p>OFT flow into Arbitrum sees more variation depending on initiatives run by the underlying projects themselves. We will be working with our partners to support any initiatives they have on Arbitrum over this period.</p>\n<p>Given the newly proposed incentive mechanism outlined in this proposal we think the following KPIs will be relevant to track going forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Total Supply of OFT assets on Arbitrum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Current state: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/token/0x5d3a1ff2b6bab83b63cd9ad0787074081a52ef34\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USDe</a> - 15.4M\n<ul>\n<li>Milestone 1: 17M</li>\n<li>Milestone 2: 19M</li>\n<li>Milestone 3: 21M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Target state: 23.1M</li>\n<li>Current state: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/token/0x58538e6a46e07434d7e7375bc268d3cb839c0133\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ENA</a> - 3.9K\n<ul>\n<li>Milestone 1:6K</li>\n<li>Milestone 2:10K</li>\n<li>Milestone 3: 14K</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Target state: 19.5K</li>\n<li>Current state: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/token/0x371c7ec6d8039ff7933a2aa28eb827ffe1f52f07\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">JOE</a> - 35.3M\n<ul>\n<li>Milestone 1: 37M</li>\n<li>Milestone 2: 39M</li>\n<li>Milestone 3: 41M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Target state: 44.125M</li>\n<li>Current state: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/token/0x3082cc23568ea640225c2467653db90e9250aaa0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RDNT</a> - 829M\n<ul>\n<li>Milestone 1: 831M</li>\n<li>Milestone 2: 835M</li>\n<li>Milestone 3: 837M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Target state: 840M</li>\n<li>Current state: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/token/0x4186bfc76e2e237523cbc30fd220fe055156b41f\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">rsETH</a> - 37.3K\n<ul>\n<li>Milestone 1: 39K</li>\n<li>Milestone 2: 41K</li>\n<li>Milestone 3: 43K</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Target state: 45K</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Native Ethereum volume flowing into Arbitrum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Current State: $18M 7-day volume.</li>\n<li>Target State: $50M 7-day volume on average over the 12-week period.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Native USDC volume flowing into Arbitrum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Current State: $0 7-day volume</li>\n<li>Target State: $50M 7-day volume on average over the 12-week period.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Native USDC liquidity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Current State: $0\n<ul>\n<li>Milestone 1: $5M</li>\n<li>Milestone 2: $10M</li>\n<li>Milestone 3: $15M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Target State: $20M</li>\n<li>Target APR: 14%</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reduction in USDC.e liquidity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Current State: $15M\n<ul>\n<li>Milestone 1: $12M</li>\n<li>Milestone 2: $10M</li>\n<li>Milestone 3: $7M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Target State: &lt;$5M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(To note: 1.

The aggregate budgeted cost across these programs for signers stands at 158,000 ARB, with an annualized total expenditure, based on estimations, of 470,000 ARB or $627,840 at an ARB price of $1.34. This is a high cost for the DAO to pay on a purely operational function, especially <strong>considering that these operational costs will likely rise as more programs are funded.</strong></p>\n<p>We propose creating a “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS) to unlock significant cost-saving opportunities, lessen committee fragmentation, ensure signers are competent with multi-sigs, and reduce friction for contributors creating proposals. The MSS will comprise 12 elected individuals to all DAO-funded multi-sigs. They will be compensated a base USD amount, paid in ARB, for performing these services across the DAO.</p>\n<p>This proposal also includes the optional steps to fund the implementation of r3gen monthly Token Flow reporting on inflows (revenue) and outflows (spend) across the DAO as well as providing detailed information and analysis on spending from MSS multisigs. Together, this proposal will help create a “backroom finance” function within the DAO that can be used across different initiatives.</p>\n<p>The proposed changes offer the potential to generate substantial cost savings, estimated to be ~$315,000 per annum, while increasing efficiency, transparency, and security of DAO spending.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO oversees six programs which pay multi-sig signers. Each multi-sig typically has five signers, except for the STIP and STIP backfund programs, which share the same multi-sig and have nine signers budgeted for. The table below outlines these programs, including the amount funded, duration (in months), and annualized figures to project a forecasted amount if future programs were to continue in the same manner.</p>\n<p>Here’s a breakdown of the programs:<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/n3ksB1H6usGNluKRMreNWZ3avqs.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 9.46.01 AM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_689x263.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 9.46.01 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"n3ksB1H6usGNluKRMreNWZ3avqs\" width=\"689\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_689x263.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_1033x394.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B6C3CF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The analysis underscores the operational unsustainability of the current expenditure level, with an annualised cost totalling $627,840 USD based on the average ARB price of $1.34 between August 7, 2023 and April 30, 2024, the period starting when Arbitrum DAO’s first multisig was funded.</p>\n<p>The cost per transaction appears excessive when comparing these figures against the volume of unique transactions sent from each multi-sig. While analysis for all multi-sig wallets is included for completeness, the STIP/Backfund multi-sig provides the clearest picture of the “cost per transaction” due to its proximity to completion.</p>\n<p>This analysis highlights the urgent need for restructuring and cost optimization within the Arbitrum DAO to ensure financial sustainability and operational efficiency in the long term.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/33h0Gzlv7Hg02RZJtnAyPjyWKsS.png?dl=1\" title=\"UTS\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_689x226.png\" alt=\"UTS\" data-base62-sha1=\"33h0Gzlv7Hg02RZJtnAyPjyWKsS\" width=\"689\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_689x226.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_1033x339.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ADBCCA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/y00Ac7P8UG4yzGSIRNKGSaP1med.png?dl=1\" title=\"AS CpT\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_690x253.png\" alt=\"AS CpT\" data-base62-sha1=\"y00Ac7P8UG4yzGSIRNKGSaP1med\" width=\"690\" height=\"253\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_690x253.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_1035x379.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"97B0C6\"></a></div><br>\nIt is also worth highlighting that the current structure has individuals appearing across multiple different multi-sigs, drawing income from each.<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7pnTF8JLQ90HZvpubC2WdySyn9b.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5_2_602x343.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"7pnTF8JLQ90HZvpubC2WdySyn9b\" width=\"602\" height=\"343\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5_2_602x343.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E1E6E8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Currently, the DAO experiences a significant dispersion in its structure, where each funded program operates its own multi-sig. This fragmentation not only leads to redundancy but also elevates the overall cost of operations. Through the “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS), we can eliminate these inefficiencies and significantly reduce unnecessary expenditure.</p>\n<p>Additionally, individuals on multi-sigs are generally not elected, posing a challenge in consistently ensuring that only the most trusted and competent members manage these critical roles. By shifting to an elected model within the MSS, we can enhance transparency, accountability, and professionalism, ensuring that every signer meets a high standard of trust and competency.</p>\n<p>Finally, contributors currently face friction in advancing proposals due to the need to wrangle signers, which can delay or deter the proposal process. The MSS aims to streamline this process by providing a reliable and consistent team of signers to be included in proposals, thereby reducing the time and effort of contributors, and accelerating the pace at which the DAO can execute its initiatives.</p>\n<p>By creating a structured multisig committee, process, and reporting cadence around spending, the DAO will be better equipped to service its plethora of proposals that require payments and maintain transparency around the programs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-solution-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-6\"></a>Proposed solution</h2>\n<p>The proposed framework for the Arbitrum DAO aims to address these issues by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO elects 12 signers via Snapshot weighted voting, shielded with Shutter\n<ul>\n<li>Signers, when submitting their application to join the MSS, may opt in to be an MSS Chair, who will be responsible for communicating to the DAO on the MSS’s behalf. The three opted-in signers with the highest weight according to Snapshot will be allocated MSS Chairs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For each new DAO initiative requiring a multisig, a new 12 signer multisig is set up.\n<ul>\n<li>The signing threshold will be dependent on the total dollar denominated value of the wallet<br>\ni. 5/12: &lt;$1M<br>\nii. 6/12: $1M-$5M<br>\niii. 7/12: $5M-$10m<br>\niiii. 8/12 $10M-$50M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Signers are paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB using spot price at the time of payment. The MSS Chairs will be paid $2500 per month in ARB using the spot price.\n<ul>\n<li>We feel denominating the payment in a $ value is important to ensure the DAO pays a fair price for service rendered without the risk of ARB price movement leading to a series of overpayment or underpayment to signers for their duty.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This will be paid out monthly from the MSS multi-sig, which will be a 6/12 including the entirety of the MSS.\n<ul>\n<li>Payment for multisig signers will only start once the first new multisig is onboarded under the Multisig Support Service MSS structure.</li>\n<li>Existing multi-sigs have the option to “opt in” to the MSS structure. If they do so any existing ring-fenced budget for multisig signing should be sent directly to a new MSS multisig. An MSS Chair will coordinate with the Program to manage the transition process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The same process is repeated to onboard new MSS members 12 months after the first is complete (starting the process 4 months before the term is up to allow for ample time)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We suggest the program is capped at initiatives seeking funding of $50M or less. This will help ensure that the program is not bottlenecked by one single initiative. For programs seeking more than $50M in funding, we suggest inspiration in design be taken from this model while creating a dedicated multisig committee and process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"mss-mechanics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#mss-mechanics-7\"></a>MSS Mechanics</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"who-would-be-a-suitable-multi-sig-signer-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#who-would-be-a-suitable-multi-sig-signer-8\"></a>Who would be a suitable multi-sig signer?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Actively involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem</li>\n<li>Prior experience being on multi-sigs.

(i.e. hack someone’s Telegram and tell the grants program to queue a payment up to the hacker’s wallet).</p>\n<p>An example of this structure</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Disruption Joe, Shawn and Ben can request a msig payment.</li>\n<li>Request made in “PL Payment” Telegram group”</li>\n<li>Supporting evidence of the payment will need to be produced to be reviewed by the signers (a forum post, an invoice, a milestone sign off etc)</li>\n<li>One written approval as indicated by “<img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12\" title=\":+1:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":+1:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">” on the payment message required from Joe, Shawn or Ben. “payment approver” cannot also be by “payment requestor”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the abstraction of responsibility from multisig signers and program operators, this step is important to ensure the security and integrity of fund transfers.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment request: format</strong></p>\n<p>Payment requests should be structured as follows by the “payment requestor”</p>\n<p>Name of supplier | Category | nature of the payment | supporting evidence</p>\n<p>This will allow for multisig approvers to better understand the details of the payment they are being asked to process. Moreover, by ensuring clear supplier name and categorization a more efficient reporting flow can be maintained. The category of payment is to be defined by the program itself (i.e. “Tooling”, “Contributor payment”, “legal fees”). If the DAO wishes to move ahead with Token Flow reporting, r3gen finance will also conduct discovery with each program team to help them define and confirm program reporting categorization at the outset of their program.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"payment-signing-den-implementation-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#payment-signing-den-implementation-11\"></a>Payment signing: Den implementation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>To aid in the efficiency and security of multisig programs at Arbitrum, we propose the implementation of <a href=\"https://www.onchainden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Den</a> across all MSS multisigs.\n<ul>\n<li>Efficiency: Den will automatically notify Arbitrum multisig signers when there is a transaction to sign. It will allow them to see exactly what you’re signing at a glance and cut through the noise by auto-tagging and DMing signers</li>\n<li>Security: Den helps you know what you’re executing and identify malicious transactions. It allows Arbitrum multisig signers to: Simulate and decode transactions before they execute them and see the outcomes of transactions before they are signed. It also helps signers easily understand complex transaction inputs and automatically see what’s behind any address.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"conflict-of-interest-policy-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conflict-of-interest-policy-12\"></a>Conflict of Interest Policy</h4>\n<p>In order to maintain the integrity and impartiality of the MSS, signers must adhere to a strict Conflict of Interest Policy. This policy ensures that all decisions made by MSS signers are in the best interest of the DAO and free from personal gain or undue influence.</p>\n<p>A conflict of interest occurs when an individual’s personal interests interfere, or appear to interfere, with their responsibilities to the DAO. Conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Being directly compensated by the Multi-sig: Receiving payments, reimbursements, or any form of financial benefit directly from the multi-sig for which the signer is responsible (Exclusion for the MSS multisig itself which will be paying it’s signers directly for their services)</li>\n<li>Authoring a Proposal that Funded the Multi-sig: Proposals a signer has authored or co-authored, which directly results in funding or operational changes to the multi-sig.</li>\n<li>Personal or Financial Relationships: Having financial relationships with any parties that stand to benefit directly from the signer’s decisions in relation to the multi-sig operations.</li>\n<li>Other Conflicts: Any other circumstances where the signer’s ability to act in the best interest of the DAO may be compromised.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Procedure in the Event of a Conflict: If a conflict of interest arises, or if a situation arises that could be perceived as a conflict, the signer must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide Disclosure: Promptly disclose the conflict to the other members of the multi-sig committee.</li>\n<li>Recusal: Abstain from participating in discussions and decision-making processes related to the conflict.</li>\n<li>Reduced Signer Multisig: In the scenario that there is a situation deemed a COI, a multisig should be created without this signer(s) included. A new threshold &gt;50% of the total remaining signers should be included. For example, if there are 3 signers with a COI for an initiative, the new multisig for this initiative would maintain 5/9 threshold and total signers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All COI executions must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"removal-of-mss-members-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#removal-of-mss-members-13\"></a>Removal of MSS members</h4>\n<p>There are 2 paths to the removal of an MSS member:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DAO Snapshot: Any DAO member can propose a Snapshot vote to remove an MSS signer. The proposal should clearly state the reasons for removal and provide evidence supporting the claims. A simple majority of votes cast by the DAO members is required for the removal to be approved with an 80M ARB Quorum (defined as total ARB votes).</li>\n<li>MSS Member Agreement: If at least 50% of MSS members (6 out of 12 members) agree that a signer should be removed due to breach of duties or conflict of interest, they can initiate the removal process internally. The agreement must be documented and publicly disclosed to maintain transparency. Analytics on signer activity from Den may be used as supporting evidence.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a member is removed via the DAO Snapshot or MSS Member Agreement the member will immediately lose further compensation. Once a member is removed, the following steps will be taken to ensure continuity and maintain the governance structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interim Measures: The MSS may appoint an interim member to serve temporarily until a new member is officially elected. The 3 chairs will collaborate and decide how to select the new member.</li>\n<li>Subsequent Snapshot: A subsequent Snapshot vote will be held to elect a new MSS member. This ensures that the DAO participates in selecting a new signer, maintaining democratic and transparent governance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All removal proceedings, details around the new signer, and the reasons for the removal must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"expectations-of-mss-members-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#expectations-of-mss-members-14\"></a>Expectations of MSS members</h4>\n<p>Transactions are expected to be promptly (within 24 hours) reviewed by all signers, and if approved through the process outlined above, signed. While we realise that there will be times when a signer may not have internet access or some other deterrent to signing, these are expected to be few and far between. If there are more than 3 lapses in expectations over the course of a 2 month period, chairs are expected to communicate that to the DAO and potentially remove the signer.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"clawback-capability-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#clawback-capability-15\"></a>Clawback Capability</h4>\n<p>We believe each multisig should be set up with the DAO maintaining the ability to clawback funds. In order to execute this, multisigs should be set up using the same model as the security council, by making upgradeexecutor as a module so that DAO maintains full authoritative power.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox githubblob\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/06039ce92be07d448838e4ab1e2e29c3985356f0/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol#L76-L95\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/06039ce92be07d448838e4ab1e2e29c3985356f0/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol#L76-L95\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <h4><a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/06039ce92be07d448838e4ab1e2e29c3985356f0/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol#L76-L95\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/06039ce92be07d448838e4ab1e2e29c3985356f0/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol#L76-L95</a></h4>\n\n\n\n    <pre class=\"onebox\"><code class=\"lang-sol\">\n      <ol class=\"start lines\" start=\"76\" style=\"counter-reset: li-counter 75 ;\">\n          <li>function _addMember(IGnosisSafe securityCouncil, address _member, uint256 _threshold)</li>\n          <li>    internal</li>\n          <li>{</li>\n          <li>    _execFromModule(</li>\n          <li>        securityCouncil,</li>\n          <li>        abi.encodeWithSelector(IGnosisSafe.addOwnerWithThreshold.selector, _member, _threshold)</li>\n          <li>    );</li>\n          <li>}</li>\n          <li></li>\n          <li>function _removeMember(IGnosisSafe securityCouncil, address _member, uint256 _threshold)</li>\n          <li>    internal</li>\n          <li>{</li>\n          <li>    address previousOwner = getPrevOwner(securityCouncil, _member);</li>\n          <li>    _execFromModule(</li>\n          <li>        securityCouncil,</li>\n          <li>        abi.encodeWithSelector(</li>\n          <li>            IGnosisSafe.removeOwner.selector, previousOwner, _member, _threshold</li>\n          <li>        )</li>\n          <li>    );</li>\n          <li>}</li>\n      </ol>\n    </code></pre>\n\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>This same mechanism will be used to transfer ownership of the multisigs to new members when new elections take place in 12 months. <em>This might require a slight technical change, awaiting confirmation from the Foundation.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"optional-extra-token-flow-reporting-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#optional-extra-token-flow-reporting-16\"></a>Optional Extra - Token Flow Reporting</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"r3gen-reporting-on-token-flow-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#r3gen-reporting-on-token-flow-17\"></a>r3gen Reporting on Token Flow</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>To aid in the transparency and clarity of reporting within the DAO we are also proposing the publication of a monthly “Token Flow Report” which will illustrate expenditure amounts and breakdowns for all Arbitrum MSS managed multisigs.</li>\n<li>To generate a holistic picture of token flows across the DAO, r3gen finance will also provide insights on inflows from Sequencer Flows and a high-level summary of other direct outflows from the Arbitrum Treasury to programs not coordinated under the MSS framework.</li>\n<li>Within this role, r3gen finance will also be available upon request to conduct deeper on-chain analysis on spend. A form will be made available for community members to submit requests for specific on-chain spend analysis. The outputs of these requests will be shared publicly with the DAO.
