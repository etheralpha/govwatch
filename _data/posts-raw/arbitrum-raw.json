And ideally, making this discovery simple and accessible for users.</p>\n<p>In a span of a couple months, there will be 100+ protocols that will distribute upwards of $60-80 million of ARB in incentives. Throughout the Arbitrum ecosystem, there will be an abundance of new engagement opportunities, but how do we ensure the right users can effectively discover what is happening?</p>\n<p>With STIP, little to no adjacent marketing or communication was administered to supplement the incentive rollout, let alone a central base for users to know where incentives are being offered and how to earn them. Compared to other ecosystems, this is a major gap in Arbitrum’s overall execution strategy and we believe there needs to be action taken to ensure successful engagement of the programs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"potential-solutions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#potential-solutions-2\"></a>Potential Solutions</h2>\n<p>At bare minimum, there needs to be some sort of incentive hub, a home base of sorts (ex. <a href=\"https://onchainsummer.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Base’s Onchain Summer</a>), for users to discover the protocols offering incentives.</p>\n<p>Some potential ideas on what this could look like:</p>\n<p><strong>A.

In return, the new Orbit chain is expected to share 10% of their chain’s profit back to the wider Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes 8% for the ArbitrumDAO and 2% for a new Arbitrum Developer Guild.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"support-chains-other-than-ethereum-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#support-chains-other-than-ethereum-1\"></a>Support chains other than Ethereum?</h1>\n<p>One restriction of the Arbitrum Expansion Program is that a new Orbit chain must be deployed on any chain that derives security from Ethereum.</p>\n<p>More specifically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The “<strong>Arbitrum Expansion Program</strong>” is a suite of tools and services maintained and provided by the Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Foundation Company (the “Foundation”) designed to enable you to deploy and operate a trust-minimized network that has its security depend on the security of the Ethereum blockchain, which by way of example, is intended to include optimistic rollups, zk-rollups, optimiums and validiums that settle to Ethereum (each, an “Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the past few weeks, the Arbitrum Foundation has received inbound interest from projects that want to deploy their own Orbit chain on other networks including, but not limited to: Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Cosmos, and others. We expect this type of interest to increase over time as the Arbitrum Tech Stack gains popularity on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>This leads to the following question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should the Arbitrum Expansion Program be changed to allow Orbit chains to be deployed on blockchain networks other than Ethereum?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation is requesting the ArbitrumDAO to decide on whether the Arbitrum Expansion Program should further expand and allow new Orbit chains to be deployed on chains other than Ethereum (and its derivatives).</p>\n<p>There are a few points to consider when evaluating the above question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue share. Allowing widespread deployment of Orbit could potentially increase the revenue generated for the ArbitrumDAO simply due to the increased number of deployments.</li>\n<li>EVM dominance. It can be argued that the EVM and Solidity has become dominant across the industry as it was easily adoptable by blockchain projects including rollups like Arbitrum. Accordingly, allowing widespread deployment of Orbit can further bolster EVM and Stylus (EVM+) dominance across the industry.</li>\n<li>Ethereum’s competitive advantage. Restricting Orbit chains to only Ethereum can potentially act as a competitive advantage for the Ethereum ecosystem, but there is a potential tragedy of the commons if the Arbitrum Tech Stack is only restricted to Ethereum while other rollups can be freely deployed elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Alleviate confusion on definitions. There are increasingly blurry lines on what it means to settle on a particular chain as projects adopt different data availability layers, host chains, and bridge configurations. It may even be possible for a single rollup to have multiple validating bridges across different blockchains. Changing the license can alleviate the need to resolve these blurry lines and allow projects greater certainty when deciding to deploy an Orbit chain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, the above is not an exhaustive list, and there are other points the community may want to consider when making their decision.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"implementation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#implementation-2\"></a>Implementation</h1>\n<p>Assuming the ArbitrumDAO approves Orbit chains to be deployed on any chain, then the Arbiturm Foundation will be responsible for collecting the 10% chain profit revenue share on the new chain and eventually migrating the funds into the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury and the Arbitrum Protocol Guild.</p>\n<p>The only requirement a project should consider before deploying on a chain is to check whether the Arbitrum Foundation has deployed a multisig to collect the revenue share. A multisig will be required to help the Arbitrum Foundation collect the fees and periodically bridge it to the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Arbitrum Expansion Program’s description will be updated with the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum Expansion Program</strong><br>\nThe “Arbitrum Expansion Program” is a suite of tools and services maintained and provided by The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company (the “Foundation”) designed to enable you to deploy and operate a trust-minimized scaling solution on a public blockchain network (each, an “Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation”). Subject to the terms of, and your compliance with, this Arbitrum Expansion Program Agreement (“Agreement”), the Foundation hereby agrees to make the Arbitrum Expansion Program available to you to develop and launch an Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation.

The examples here are not exhaustive, but should give you a sense of the definition. A quality grant program has:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A purpose</p>\n<p>Ex 1 - To fund entrepreneurs building on Arbitrum in a specific geography<br>\nEx 2 - To learn best practices for funding specific critical functions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A success metric (or multiple)</p>\n<p>Ex 1 - Leading Indicators - Number of grants sourced, accepted, and validated<br>\nEx 2 - North Star Metrics - Transactions generated, new wallets, TVL growth, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A funding mechanism (or multiple)</p>\n<p>Ex 1 - Quadratic funding, delegated domain authority, conviction voting<br>\nEx 2 - Retro vs Proactive, how eligibility criteria are enforced, sybil defense</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A program manager</p>\n<p>Ex 1 - A community leader matched with a grant program idea<br>\nEx 2 - A founder recommended driver of a novel on-chain granting mechanism</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"experimenting-with-funding-mechanisms-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#experimenting-with-funding-mechanisms-1\"></a>Experimenting with Funding Mechanisms</h1>\n<p><em><strong>For continuing experimentation with novel funding mechanisms to better allocate funds based on the ecosystem function being funded.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Understanding the intricacies of various funding mechanisms is crucial to the success of any grant program. Our RFP process is designed to not only match programs with known funding models but also to explore and experiment with these mechanisms. This includes experimenting with different organizational structures, such as centralized and crowdsourced assessments, as well as comparing pre-planned evaluation processes with challenge bounties.</p>\n<p>This exploration will help us grasp which models best support different types of initiatives, ensuring that our future funding strategies are as effective and impactful as possible.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"seeking-a-diversity-of-perspectives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#seeking-a-diversity-of-perspectives-2\"></a>Seeking a Diversity of Perspectives</h1>\n<p><em>For matching strong community leaders around the world to proven funding mechanisms, coaching, runbooks, and support network.</em></p>\n<p>One of our primary objectives is to identify and engage program managers from a wide range of perspectives. These may include unique contextual perspectives, technical capabilities, and geographical regions. We believe that local insights and experiences are invaluable assets that can drive the success of grant programs. By matching these diverse talents with suitable funding mechanisms, we aim to cultivate a global network of innovators who can bring unique perspectives and solutions to the table.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"addressing-immediate-needs-of-the-arbitrum-dao-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#addressing-immediate-needs-of-the-arbitrum-dao-3\"></a>Addressing Immediate Needs of the Arbitrum DAO</h1>\n<p><em><strong>For immediately providing support to the current biggest needs of Arbitrum DAO.</strong></em></p>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO faces its unique set of challenges and opportunities. Part of our RFP process is dedicated to identifying grant programs that can address these immediate needs. By solving these pressing issues, we aim to demonstrate the power of community-driven innovation and the potential for rapid, effective change within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Examples of the types of needs that might be addressed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The onboarding working group needs funds to allocate to start a bounty board</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A group of delegates want a previously not provided data analysis about an ongoing incentive program</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A community member recognizes people contributing to the ecosystem that are not being fairly rewarded</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An orbit adoption education materials creation contest idea needs to be matched with a program manager and funds to become a reality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Funding:</strong> Approximately 3 million ARB available for distribution between 5-10 programs.

Don’t just request the maximum amount but instead focus on how “1 dollar in can equal 2 dollars out”. This does not need to reflect transactions on chain but please do include details about network effects or other outcomes that will drive adoption, attract talented developers or in other ways increase the perceived value of Arbitrum and Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"faqs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#faqs-7\"></a>FAQs</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"how-much-money-should-i-request-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-much-money-should-i-request-8\"></a>How much money should I request?</h3>\n<p>In total <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-to-fund-plurality-labs-milestone-1b-ridge/21332\">we have approximately 3 million ARB to distribute in Thank ARB Milestone 1(b)</a> and we intend to select five to ten programs to facilitate that distribution. The intention behind your program should be to demonstrate how money spent on grants can result in real, measurable results.</p>\n<p>Think of how your program can demonstrate how for every one dollar put in, you can generate two dollars worth of value when considering how much to request. Keep in mind that the objective should be to demonstrate this kind of value and the potential for scalability.</p>\n<p>As a general guideline, we are unlikely to fund programs requesting more than 500k ARB including expenses for administration and development. Again, keep in mind that your core objective here should be to demonstrate scalable results where the outcomes are greater than the input.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-is-the-rollout-timeline-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-is-the-rollout-timeline-9\"></a>What is the rollout timeline?</h3>\n<p>The application process will close at the end of April. Decisions will be made mid May. Programs should plan to roll out between June and the end of August,. No later than early September at the latest if necessary.</p>\n<p>All approved programs will be added to a Telegram group to discuss coordination and rollout timelines.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"can-i-apply-for-more-than-one-program-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#can-i-apply-for-more-than-one-program-10\"></a>Can I apply for more than one program?</h3>\n<p>If you have ideas for more than one program, feel free to submit them. If you have ideas for programs that you think should exist but can’t run yourself, propose them, and we’ll do our best to find a suitable program manager. If your intention is to run more than one program yourself or with a team you will need to demonstrate the capacity and execution plan that ensures these program would meet the highest possible standards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-if-i-have-an-idea-for-a-program-but-i-cant-be-the-program-manager-myself-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-if-i-have-an-idea-for-a-program-but-i-cant-be-the-program-manager-myself-11\"></a>What if I have an idea for a program but I can’t be the program manager myself?</h3>\n<p>We encourage you to make suggestions here for programs you think would be a good fit for Arbitrum DAO. You don’t have to be the program director and we have <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appwXztAtdLkcBD3v/pagH8ECykJpizDIfW/form\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a separate process</a> for identifying ideal program directors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-will-you-assess-which-programs-to-support-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-will-you-assess-which-programs-to-support-12\"></a>How will you assess which programs to support?</h3>\n<p>We have developed a rubric for assessing proposals. The questions asked on the application form are basically a mirror image of the assessment criteria. This process will involve delegates and community members participating in the review and ranking of proposals.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more information about this process and how to get involved (and compensated) as a reviewer.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"can-a-program-have-multiple-stages-and-be-iterative-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#can-a-program-have-multiple-stages-and-be-iterative-13\"></a>Can a program have multiple stages and be iterative?</h3>\n<p>Yes!

It may often be the case that starting with a smaller first round of a program and then doing subsequent rounds within the allotted time may actually generate the best outcomes and results for the community.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for reading all the way to the end.

In regards to the rewards program, I saw the updated post about including swaps in the program. I had done a few and then even shared in some tg groups about the furu program.</p>\n<p>My thought was furu is incentivizing swaps so if they are incentivizing it then it’s fair game. But in any case I waited until the last week to allow others to participate till the end of the campaign.</p>\n<p>After I heard the rewards were under review I re-read the campaign rules again (for a 3rd time) this is when I noticed for the first time that furu had a statement about to not abuse and that it would be reviewed. I had no idea that was stated. I don’t know if others were careful about their transactions but clearly looking at the dune analytics users would have been a lot more secretive about doing swaps if I or others were intentionally trying to hide and do something malicious.</p>\n<p>I can’t speak for everyone but I fully believed I wasn’t doing anything wrong and still at this point am a bit unsure of the problem. My ask would be if there is a problem to reimburse the fees taken from the transactions. I think that is a fair ask. I and I am guessing others simply saw any activity as a win win, furu gets some users, rewards, as well. I had no intentions on other users being negatively affected as you see the rewards stayed available until the very end of the epoch to allow anyone an opportunity for the program. This was an honest oversight that seemed acceptable since it was incentived. It was not intended to hurt the community, protocols, or users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1><a name=\"update-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#update-10\"></a>UPDATE</h1>\n<p>Before posting this I have tried to reach out again to Hsuan-Ting. I wanted to give him time to respond about 3 days but when I saw his status turn from ‘last seen recently’ to ‘last seen a long time ago’ inn one day, that indicates he has blocked me. Without posting all the screenshots, you can see I gave a kind request and shared with him with full transparency what I intend on posting.

We don’t have the ability to go out and meet with somebody, we talk to them through platforms and a lot of times those forms of communication are not good for async relationships. So this is bonding. this is the chance to go meet somebody you had a disagreement with and build a human connection, so that the next time when you disagree with somebody or see something differently, you know it’s a human on the other end - and it just makes life so much easier when I can see that I know that person, I have a personal connection with them and they just see things differently than I do.</p>\n<p>So this is web3 bonding - this is what this is.”</p>\n<p>-Shawn L.

Which is often one of the problems - you join a forum and there are a bunch of posts, and you don’t really know where to go. The key to really understanding, to really be able to participate, is the social relationships. We think that DAOs are trustless, but behind that there is this whole social network and unless you are part of that community, you cannot operate it.</p>\n<p>-Daniel Opsina, Founder of RnDAO</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4><a name=\"ship-in-depth-proposals-for-long-term-engagement-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ship-in-depth-proposals-for-long-term-engagement-16\"></a>Ship in-depth proposals for long-term engagement</h4>\n<p>23 proposals were launched during the event, which can be found <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/arbitrum-govhack/26\">here on the forum</a>.

This has been quite evident in the crowd, that everyone feels that the reason why they spend 2 days working on those proposals is because they really believe they can make it happen. And now we need to make sure that they actually can. So that was awesome - I want more of it.”</p>\n<p>-Krzysztof Urbański</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“One thing most people miss out about DAOs, because we focus on the technology, is DAOs are people. It’s bringing people together, it’s bringing diversity of ideas, diversity of thought, collectively moving these efforts forward. So I actually think GovHack is honestly an awesome idea.</p>\n<p>The same way we focus on iterating and building our technology, we do need to do the same thing on the human capital side of what we’re building and I think this was wonderful. The fact is there were many people who were only newly exposed to Arbitrum, who went and dedicated some time. They now have a sense of how their involvement is going to help move Arbitrum forward.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CoinFlipCanada</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“EthDenver was a blast, and the Arbitrum GovHack stole my heart. Exploring the vibrant ecosystem and governance was so enjoyable, and snagging second place was the cherry on top. Huge thanks to the Arbitrum Foundation and Hack Humanity for putting it all together. Excited to ship our proposal in the upcoming weeks, catch you in the forum!”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heather, Finalist from Team 11</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I think that there were many opportunities for us to talk to the different judges and delegates to get feedback, and I think the team was really helpful in kind of navigating how we should act and what our schedules are, so I had a pretty positive experience.”</p>\n<p>I met a lot of online individuals who have legs and are humans so that was really cool, and I think the more that we have in person events the more the community can connect on a more human level.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feems</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9c7cca895063c6e6ae002b644f13c388142029a9.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/mklQEn6yb7AOHRScrKx5Adfykn7.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9c7cca895063c6e6ae002b644f13c388142029a9_2_340x484.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"mklQEn6yb7AOHRScrKx5Adfykn7\" width=\"340\" height=\"484\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9c7cca895063c6e6ae002b644f13c388142029a9_2_340x484.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9c7cca895063c6e6ae002b644f13c388142029a9_2_510x726.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9c7cca895063c6e6ae002b644f13c388142029a9_2_680x968.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"48474B\"></a></div><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/2f1599305d9c99cf52197c7faad3bba0bdb5d320.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6IwImdwyEuOyIQMbLH5DYa69VIY.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2f1599305d9c99cf52197c7faad3bba0bdb5d320_2_341x141.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"6IwImdwyEuOyIQMbLH5DYa69VIY\" width=\"341\" height=\"141\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2f1599305d9c99cf52197c7faad3bba0bdb5d320_2_341x141.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2f1599305d9c99cf52197c7faad3bba0bdb5d320_2_511x211.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2f1599305d9c99cf52197c7faad3bba0bdb5d320_2_682x282.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"414547\"></a></div><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9695388d2e9cccaef2b47091b509fe30b45cf7ac.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lu7k8Q4kPbBrv8Qu6L1VGNoIMNe.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9695388d2e9cccaef2b47091b509fe30b45cf7ac_2_321x423.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"lu7k8Q4kPbBrv8Qu6L1VGNoIMNe\" width=\"321\" height=\"423\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9695388d2e9cccaef2b47091b509fe30b45cf7ac_2_321x423.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9695388d2e9cccaef2b47091b509fe30b45cf7ac_2_481x634.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9695388d2e9cccaef2b47091b509fe30b45cf7ac_2_642x846.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"2A313D\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Participant polls &amp;

The Pitstop panel on Day 2 received very positive feedback</li>\n<li>There was a lack of participation from more Delegates and key protocols in the Mapathon, which constrained the depth and breadth of the tracks and challenge statements that were identified as important for the DAO</li>\n<li>There were gaps in IRL participation from key ecosystem stakeholders during the 3 days because GovHack’s scheduling was alongside other key events in Denver, so people were pulled in different directions and unable to give full dedicated time to the participants. This lessened the overall quality of the event as often Community Leads were stretched thin to guide the conversation around their track and support newcomers</li>\n<li>The tight preparation timeline of 4 weeks with budget constraints led to challenges in the event organization. There was limited time to engage more key stakeholders in the Mapathon design process, and the Hack Humanity team was spread very thin on organizational tasks such as raising the necessary additional sponsorship to support the increased attendee participation this took up capacity until the very last days before the event, the original budget for the Bootcamp/Community day was for 70/150 people, actual numbers: 109/200+.</li>\n<li>Hack Humanity absorbed the cost of additional team staffing to accommodate the increased attendance without additional financial support; Hack Humanity also funded out-of-pocket additional media production over the level provided by the Foundation to generate quality media and storytelling to demonstrate the value of full high-end production media to bring the DAO and voices of the DAO to life. In addition, graphics design, t-shirt design, and decor design without a budget in order to demonstrate to Arbitrum what a high-quality production looks like. This needs to be funded properly for subsequent events.</li>\n<li>The high number of tracks, while promoting inclusion, also split attention more widely and made it difficult to go deeper on key topics</li>\n<li>People are excited to hack and will even organize themselves and their teams in advance of the event. The total team numbers nearly doubled on Day 2 (from 13 to 23) due to new teams showing up ready to submit proposals. While perhaps a good problem to have, this also presented challenges in catering, equipment, the hackathon structure as submission criteria and judging process needed to be adjusted dynamically to allow for more time to process the larger numbers.</li>\n<li>The quality of templates and guidance for proposal writing can be improved for participants, especially with the high number of newcomers to the DAO. Teams asked many questions looking for guidance on what constitutes a good proposal.</li>\n<li>Community voting was well-received but limited to a small pool of voters due to the IRL attendance at that particular time of day on Day 3.</li>\n<li>With more lead time, we could attract more sponsors to make the event more viable and sustainable, with a larger prize pool to incentivize contributions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Recommendation for Future Events</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>With more lead time and budget, a stronger program design and event plan could be established with smoother execution on the ground.</li>\n<li>There needs to be extreme clarity on submission criteria in advance, with contingency plans in place for sudden growth, to ensure a smooth participant experience in following events.</li>\n<li>A proposal framework should be prepared for the next event to provide newcomers with better guidance to start out with.</li>\n<li>A commitment from key delegates and stakeholders to be present for the Mapathon design process to ensure the most important challenges of the DAO are adequately prioritized and represented. Commitment to in-person presence for the full duration of the event would increase the quality significantly, both for the participant’s experience and for the quality of the project outputs. This is one of the core components of the event’s unique value offering.</li>\n<li>Consider extending the length of the event to provide participants with more time to work on their proposals. Day 1 was consumed with organization around tracks and team formations, and Day 2 proved to be extremely valuable for feedback, iteration and generation of projects. A third and/or 4th day would allow for more comprehensive content and refinement of ideas.</li>\n<li>If positioning these types of events alongside a major conference, consider choosing a venue within walking distance / very close proximity to allow for higher foot traffic.</li>\n<li>A cap on the number of demo projects may be advisable, and positioning the pitches earlier in the day when the energy levels of the room are higher. May be interesting to consider incentives for feedback and participation from the audience.</li>\n<li>Finalist presentations and community voting could be designed for future events to be more inclusive across the wider DAO using experiments via online participation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-27\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Key achievements of the GovHack include the establishment of <strong>meaningful connections</strong> among participants, many of whom were new to the DAO space, the identification and fostering of cross-collaboration opportunities, and the empowerment of participants through educational talks and expert feedback sessions. The <strong>event’s design increased the quality and quantity of governance proposals</strong>, showcasing the practical benefits of in-person collaboration in a digital-first community.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, the insights gained from this event should guide future initiatives, with a focus on refining event structure, enhancing collaborative opportunities, and ensuring more inclusive participation across the DAO. The success of GovHack serves as a testament to the vibrant potential of the Arbitrum community and sets the stage for further innovation and engagement in the ecosystem. Overall, GovHack was not just a meeting of minds but a pivotal moment that is likely to influence the trajectory of the Arbitrum DAO positively, paving the way for a more connected and dynamic future.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e6cf536e3c679bc4389ce8344bc676ba035bfc8c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wVQ0JJqMzwNdJrjyW2aRUhEMuny.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"C0177.MP4.05_51_46_12.Still001\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e6cf536e3c679bc4389ce8344bc676ba035bfc8c_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"C0177.MP4.05_51_46_12.Still001\" data-base62-sha1=\"wVQ0JJqMzwNdJrjyW2aRUhEMuny\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e6cf536e3c679bc4389ce8344bc676ba035bfc8c_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e6cf536e3c679bc4389ce8344bc676ba035bfc8c_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e6cf536e3c679bc4389ce8344bc676ba035bfc8c_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"776055\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1e2bcc51f5b9f0435bae226a216ae2b4c5e45c6f.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/4iU9Zw5sXswsDy3Q2N8CrWJoxyv.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1e2bcc51f5b9f0435bae226a216ae2b4c5e45c6f_2_666x500.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"4iU9Zw5sXswsDy3Q2N8CrWJoxyv\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1e2bcc51f5b9f0435bae226a216ae2b4c5e45c6f_2_666x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1e2bcc51f5b9f0435bae226a216ae2b4c5e45c6f_2_999x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1e2bcc51f5b9f0435bae226a216ae2b4c5e45c6f_2_1332x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"786959\"></a></div><br>\nThank you from team Hack Humanity.

While we have a lot of talented people in the DAO who have a lot of context of what’s going on and what the DAO needs are, it isn’t easy to go from identifying a need to working on a solution.</p>\n<p>Through the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-onboarding-working-group-experiment/22849\">Onboarding Working Group initiative that we announced at the end of March</a> we now have a list of potential contributors to the DAO. We now want to experiment with how we can provide a streamlined way of kickstarting initiatives in the DAO and going from discussion to action in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>To that end, inspired by how things work in other DAOs, and borrowing nomenclature from Lord of The Rings, we’re introducing Arbitrum Fellowships.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"arbitrum-fellowships-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#arbitrum-fellowships-3\"></a>Arbitrum Fellowships</h2>\n<p>Fellowships are groups of people united by their pursuit of a desire. Desires are basically needs that the DAO has — think incentives, game development, community growth, etc.</p>\n<p>The purpose of each fellowship is to ideate, discuss, research, and establish a plan through which we can address the DAO’s desires. To better understand the concept of fellowships, and how a fellowship should work, let’s use the Short Term Incentives Program (STIP) as an example. The program started after a group of people discussed, in a Telegram chat, the need for an incentives’ framework on Arbitrum. Tnorm lead the charge and formed a working group tasked with creating the incentives framework which we now know as STIP.</p>\n<p>The goal of Fellowships is to create a streamlined process to facilitate discussions around a desire that eventually leads to some sort of actionable result. Initially, we propose each fellowship has at least 5 calls discussing its respective topic of interest. Our assumption is that after 5 calls of discussing a topic, either something comes out of it, or we know there’s not as much interest in it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"gandalf-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#gandalf-4\"></a>Gandalf</h2>\n<p>The Fellowship of the Ring had Gandalf to guide them through the dangerous paths on their way to Mordor. While we do not have to face Ringwraiths and orcs, working toward an initiative in a DAO setting has its own set of challenges, one of which is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">diffusion of responsibility</a>. Simply put, when we’re part of a group, we tend to not claim responsibility for something, in the hopes that someone else will.</p>\n<p>In Arbitrum Fellowships, that someone is our Gandalf.</p>\n<p>While not necessarily acting in a leader’s capacity, a Gandalf is supposed to be the coordinator of the group, and the person who pushes the needle forward. Gandalf doesn’t have to make decisions on behalf of the group, neither is he responsible for the output of the fellowship. What they are responsible for, however, is making sure the fellowship has the opportunity to discuss the topic at hand and produce an output.</p>\n<p>Some of the responsibilities of Gandalf include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coordinating the efforts of the fellowship.</li>\n<li>Narrowing down the desire the fellowship is going to work on.</li>\n<li>Assembling the fellowship.</li>\n<li>Organizing a series of 5 meetings for the fellowship over a reasonable amount of time (e.g. 5 meetings in 2 months).</li>\n<li>Drafting, publishing, and maintaining a forum thread that describes the fellowship and summarises the work they’re doing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b287fd07e055a62f2d3dc45b1ff28e165bd007e7.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ptmliAHrtRiKokH5CfUUcgSJSl1.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"8mcspg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b287fd07e055a62f2d3dc45b1ff28e165bd007e7_2_690x290.jpeg\" alt=\"8mcspg\" data-base62-sha1=\"ptmliAHrtRiKokH5CfUUcgSJSl1\" width=\"690\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b287fd07e055a62f2d3dc45b1ff28e165bd007e7_2_690x290.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b287fd07e055a62f2d3dc45b1ff28e165bd007e7.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b287fd07e055a62f2d3dc45b1ff28e165bd007e7.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"3A2C1C\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"mines-of-moria-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#mines-of-moria-5\"></a>Mines of Moria</h2>\n<p>After a fellowship has been formed, and their meetings have been setup by their respective Gandalf, they’ll begin their work in the Mines of Moria. That’s a geek way of saying they’ll begin working towards the completion of the desire they were originally assembled to work on within a somewhat specified timeline.</p>\n<p>Fellowships are meant to push things forward in a streamlined way but at a fast pace. Ideally, there shouldn’t be more than 2 months from the assembly of a fellowship before we know whether there’s something there.</p>\n<p>If a fellowship spends more time than that in the Mines of Moria without delivering anything actionable, we should consider the fellowship was lost to the Balrog (more hardcore DAO nerds, you can compare Balrog to Moloch) and we should disband the fellowship and look for opportunities elsewhere. The purpose of the Mines of Moria and the Balrog analogy is to avoid spending time and effort in perpetuity towards an initiative that will start becoming increasingly harder to achieve as contributors lose interest.</p>\n<p>It’s important to clarify that the disbanding of a fellowship doesn’t constitute a failure. If anything, it informs the DAO that there’s no interest in the particular desire the disbanded fellowship was working on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/bb51fc75372ca33ccbdd535f32bd6c6c2269eee5.jpeg\" alt=\"images\" data-base62-sha1=\"qJ6WncpBjvStyL2z07J3iXeKY7P\" width=\"346\" height=\"146\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"rivendell-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rivendell-6\"></a>Rivendell</h2>\n<p>If the fellowship survives the Mines of Moria, defeats the Balrog, and comes out with a clear approach to fulfilling a desire, they should seek refuge in Rivendell.</p>\n<p>What that means is basically summarising the discussion - it doesn’t necessarily have to be too specific, but it has to be clear enough so delegates can express their support and other contributors can start ideating or working on proposals to address that desire. You can think of it as a loosely structured RFP that descibes what’s needed but not necessarily how to achieve it.</p>\n<p>At this point, the fellowship has discussed the topic long enough to have something to move forward with, ideally summarised in a forum post, that they can present to delegates who hold significant voting power in Arbitrum DAO and can provide feedback to the deliverable brought forward from the fellowship.</p>\n<p>The fellowship should reach out to delegates that have significant voting power, and seek to get formal support from at least 3 of them. There’s no expectations from those delegates who provide their support other than to signal that it’s something that the DAO is interested in - it can be a single response in a thread saying something like “yes, I think it’s important and I am willing to help those who put up a proposal move forward with it”. Obviously, we expect those delegates to later on be available to provide feedback and discuss proposals associated with the topic.</p>\n<p>The reason we suggest the process of having delegates express their support is to avoid having contributors working on well structured proposals that there’s no tangible interest in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f300afe99e2a0804528e5471c4a2b0aef480ac7c.gif\" alt=\"tumblr_4930d922ccb7a84c19b40fc2ba8417cc_ca9ef331_500\" data-base62-sha1=\"yFHuQzWz1KozjlJacHMorVVdwxS\" width=\"500\" height=\"210\" class=\"animated\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"tldr-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tldr-7\"></a>TL;DR</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>A fellowship is formed and appoints a coordinator/Gandalf.</li>\n<li>Fellowship’s Gandalf schedules 5 calls to discuss the fellowship’s topic.</li>\n<li>Following those 5 calls the fellowship describes the desire in a forum post.</li>\n<li>The fellowship seeks written support from at least 3 delegates with significant voting power.</li>\n<li>If a fellowship gets the suppport, it basically means that any individual or group (including the fellowship itself) can start working on a proposal to fulfil the desire in a way they see fit.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Arbitrum’s primary goal for this proposal is to invest in teams/products that not only deliver a liquid, stable, and uncorrelated yield for the Treasury, but also bring deep crypto-native expertise, prioritize compliance, and collaboratively foster ecosystem growth. Superstate shares Arbitrum’s mission of bringing traditional capital markets onchain and we are committed to collaborating to grow the ecosystem together.</p>\n<p>Superstate is modernizing investing through tokenized financial products, bringing traditional assets onchain via compliant, programmable, and composable tokens. Our first product, <a href=\"https://superstate.co/ustb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USTB</a>, is a yield-bearing ERC-20 token backed by a short-duration U.S. Treasury Bill and Agency Securities fund. All investors must be Qualified Purchasers and undergo KYC prior to investing. When investors onboard to the Fund, they can provide Ethereum address(es) which are added to a proprietary AllowList.</p>\n<p>USTB delivers consistent, uncorrelated, capital-preserving yield that the Arbitrum Treasury seeks to invest in. The Fund’s investment objective is to target returns in line with the federal funds rate (currently &gt;5%), providing current income as is consistent with liquidity and stability of principal.</p>\n<p>USTB is programmable and composable across smart contracts and applications with transactions permitted between counterparties on the aforementioned AllowList beginning in May 2024. USTB is currently on Ethereum but intends to expand across key EVM ecosystems to maximize utility for protocols, developers, traders, and investors.</p>\n<p>In addition to USTB, Superstate plans to launch additional products with different underlying investment strategies and asset classes that benefit from the advantages enabled by public blockchains. Our team has deep experience building onchain and is committed to partnering with Arbitrum to bring more RWAs to the ecosystem, ensuring Arbitrum is a top destination for this burgeoning asset class, which has been projected to bring trillions of dollars onchain, disrupting traditional capital markets.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

USTB is a private fund pursuant to Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. USTB is only available to a limited subset of potential investors that meet the criteria outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum. Investors must undergo AML, KYC, and sanctions compliance checks.</p>\n<p>USTB’s investment mandate is targeting returns in line with the federal funds rate by investing substantially all of its net assets in short-duration U.S. Treasury securities, securities issued by U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities, and other U.S. government securities (collectively, “Government Securities”). This mandate is executed by USTB’s Sub-Advisor, Federated Hermes, and Sue Hill, a tenured portfolio manager, responsible for overseeing $300B in fixed-income assets. USTB’s underlying securities are held in custody in the name of the Trust at an OCC-regulated bank, UMB Bank. USTB is audited annually by EY, ensuring the accuracy of accounting for investors. Daily NAV, transparent holdings, yield, and more are available via the Investor Portal or by visiting: <a href=\"https://superstate.co/ustb\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Superstate - USTB Fund</a></p>\n<p>Investors may purchase Shares of USTB via USDC or USD (“cash”) which may be issued in the form of ERC-20 tokens. This tokenized ownership is composable and transferable where one Share will be represented by one token on the Blockchain named a “USTB token.”</p>\n<p>The process entails three key steps: onboarding, purchase, and minting/redeeming. First, investors undergo Superstate’s KYC/AML onboarding where up to 3 Ethereum addresses may be added to the AllowList, with the Primary AllowList Address designated for USTB token minting. Second, to purchase USTB, investors transfer USDC (or USD) to their unique USTB Purchase Address. Lastly, Shares are minted and the quantity is calculated based on the prior Market Day’s NAV and gas fees covered by Superstate Inc. Redemption can be initiated by transferring them to the USTB Contract Address or “burning” the tokens. The proceeds from redeeming USTB are provided pursuant to the investor instructions in USDC (or USD) and are expected within 2 business days of the request, though often arriving within 24 hours. Certain investors may opt to record USTB Shares only in book entry form, electing to mint tokenized Shares at a later date or never at all. For book entry USTB, the key steps are the same except no tokens will be minted/burned.</p>\n<p>USTB offers T+0 liquidity for investors on Market Days when initiating a subscription or redemption before 9:00:00 A.M. ET. Market Days are defined as when both the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are open. Upon receipt of USD or USDC, Shares are minted on the Market Day at, or shortly after, the opening of business (typically 9:00:00 A.M. Eastern Standard Time) directly into the shareholder’s designated address. Shares will be minted at the net asset value (NAV) at the prior day’s close of regular trading, typically at 4:00 pm Eastern Time on Market Days. USTB accrues yield daily, reflected in the daily appreciation of the NAV per share. USTB may be redeemed at any time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"section-2-description-of-underlying-assets-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#section-2-description-of-underlying-assets-9\"></a>Section 2: Description of Underlying Assets</h3>\n<p>Under normal market conditions, the Fund expects to invest at least 95% of its net assets in Government Securities with a duration of one year or less.

Superstate Inc. serves as the Investment Manager for the Fund. The Delaware Series Trust structure means the shareholder’s investment in the Fund is in a separate legal entity which is bankruptcy remote from Superstate Inc. Additionally, this structure affords shareholders with inter-series liability, meaning shareholders will not be subject to potential liability that arises against Superstate Inc.</p>\n<p>The Fund is exempt from registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a private fund per Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act and is only available to a limited subset of potential investors that meet certain criteria as outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum.

Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third-party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Arbitrum’s assets are safeguarded in a bankruptcy-remote Delaware Statutory Trust, the Superstate Asset Trust, that is independent of Superstate Inc. and wholly owned by investors in the Fund. Superstate Inc. and its officers/key contributors only act as service providers to the Fund providing investment advisory, technology, and other services.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s underlying securities are held at UMB Bank, an OCC-chartered bank, pursuant to a Custody Agreement. Assets are held in a custody account at UMB that are segregated consistent with the Customer Protection Rule and are not rehypothecated, lent against, or otherwise encumbered. This means the Fund’s assets are securely held at UMB and if there is an unlikely credit or stress event, the Fund’s assets will remain protected and available for withdrawal.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>No, Superstate Inc. currently only manages one fund.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a detailed cash flow diagram that shows the flow of funds from ARB/Fiat conversion, investment in the underlying asset, payment of expenses, sale of the underlying asset, and repayment (Fiat/ARB conversion), including the counterparties and legal jurisdictions involved.</strong></p>\n<p>As a convenience to shareholders, purchases and redemptions may be made with USDC or fiat (USD), resulting in two unique, but similar, flows of funds.</p>\n<p>The Fund does not accept ARB tokens to purchase USTB, therefore conversion from ARB to USDC or USD must be done separately and prior to the below sequence.</p>\n<p><strong>AllowList</strong><br>\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will undergo Superstate’s KYC/AML onboarding process and once approved may add up to three Ethereum addresses to the AllowList. The Primary AllowList Address is where all USTB tokens will be minted.</p>\n<p><strong>Purchasing</strong><br>\nTo initiate a purchase of USTB, Arbitrum Foundation will transfer USDC to their USTB Purchase Address, which is a unique address provided to the Foundation after successful onboarding. Upon receipt of USDC, Circle Financial converts USDC to USD (“cash”) and sends it to the custodian, UMB Bank. Once the cash has settled, Federated Hermes is instructed to buy the U.S. Treasury Bills or U.S. Agency Securities with less than a one-year duration. Treasury Bills are custodied at UMB Bank and tokens are minted as a 1:1 representation of their underlying shares.</p>\n<p>The quantity of tokens minted will be calculated by dividing the dollar value of USDC (or cash) by the Market Day’s NAV. Superstate will pay gas fees for minting USTB tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Redeeming</strong><br>\nRedemption can be initiated one of two ways: 1) call the token’s burn() function or 2) transfer the tokens to the USTB Redemption Address: 0x43415eB6ff9DB7E26A15b704e7A3eDCe97d31C4e.</p>\n<p>Upon calling this burn function or transferring tokens to the contract, Superstate Inc. instructs Federated Hermes to sell U.S. Treasury Bills or U.S. Agency Securities. The proceeds of this sale are then transferred to UMB Bank, which wires cash to Circle Financial. Circle mints the corresponding amount of USDC and sends it back to the designated Ethereum address controlled by the Foundation and DAO.</p>\n<p>Please see the diagram below for the sequence of the flow of funds, including the mint and burn of USTB tokens.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/915d0c5f6f6cfb510717973841b39eb41281b248.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kJWAtBaz5mLmDHAAlME2xDo3k4U.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screen Shot 2024-04-10 at 11.55.11 AM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/915d0c5f6f6cfb510717973841b39eb41281b248_2_416x499.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2024-04-10 at 11.55.11 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"kJWAtBaz5mLmDHAAlME2xDo3k4U\" width=\"416\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/915d0c5f6f6cfb510717973841b39eb41281b248_2_416x499.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/915d0c5f6f6cfb510717973841b39eb41281b248_2_624x748.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/915d0c5f6f6cfb510717973841b39eb41281b248.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E2E7E8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>8. Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>On Market Days, NAV Consulting will provide a Net Asset Value per share. The NAV reflects the valuation of the securities in the portfolio, net of expenses, and is reported on a per-share basis.</p>\n<p>When investors purchase/redeem USTB, their purchase/redemption will be recorded at a specific NAV per share (see details above). The gain incurred between the redemption proceeds and the purchase amount will be taxable at their applicable tax rate (depending on their jurisdiction and short vs. long-term capital gains).</p>\n<p>The Fund does not pay any distributions/dividends so there are no additional tax consequences, aside from what was mentioned above. There are no taxes withheld on any transactions.</p>\n<p>Investors in the Fund are responsible for their own tax obligations and should consult with a tax adviser. NAV Consulting will prepare a Schedule K-1 annually for each investor reflecting their share of the Fund’s gains or losses during the period.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>Liquidity is daily during Market Days, as defined above. Superstate Inc. mints or burns USTB tokens at 9:00:00 AM ET at the prior day’s NAV. After 9:00:00 AM ET, purchases/redemptions triggered by investors are processed on the next Market Day.</p>\n<p>For redemptions before the cutoff time, we instruct Federated Hermes at 9:00:00 AM ET to sell securities that they aim to settle by 1:00:00 PM ET so UMB Bank may wire USD back to Circle to return USDC to you the same day (which we anticipate will happen a majority of the time given the assets in the fund). If Government Securities don’t settle before the wire cut-off, then we will send USDC back the following Market Day. USTB’s PPM and IA contemplate up to T+2 for redemption as a conservative buffer.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What amount of first-loss equity will the sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>NA - there is no product lending.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is composed of Government Securities which consist of short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills and U.S. Government Agency securities. U.S. Treasury bills are widely regarded as one of the most stable investments due to their deep and liquid trading market along with their backing by the U.S. government, which significantly limits the risk of default. With short-term maturities and high liquidity, Government Securities offer investors a safe option for yield and provides the flexibility to quickly access their funds, making them a cornerstone of conservative investment strategies. The short duration and investment mandate of USTB (less than one year) diminishes the risk of interest rates impacting the value and yield of securities in the Fund.</p>\n<p>These underlying Government Securities may be easily sold during Market Days, allowing T+0 for investors and repayment of USDC when redeeming before the cutoff time. Please see above for a more detailed flow. Superstate Inc. will also provide a white glove service for the Arbitrum DAO to be informed every step of the way and work to accelerate redemptions as much as possible, however, we have some constraints given the underlying reliance upon traditional banking/fiat system.</p>\n<p>A list of USTB’s current holdings is provided above.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain-derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>USDC Subscription &amp; Redemption</strong><br>\nAs a convenience to crypto-native investors, USTB permits purchasing shares via USDC. The Fund has a relationship with Circle Internet Financial (Circle) to enable conversion between USDC to fiat (and vice versa). Each client who elects to use USDC is given a unique deposit address (at Circle) on Ethereum Mainnet. When an investor sends USDC to this address, Circle burns USDC and wires USD to the Fund’s account at UMB Bank which gets invested from there. The unique deposit address enables Superstate to attribute each purchase to the right client. Investors must confirm they are sending USDC to the correct USTB Purchase Address provided to them. Superstate makes this information available on our Investor Portal to help ensure clients can confirm details before sending USDC.</p>\n<p>When Superstate returns USDC to clients, the reverse order of operations is performed (Government Securities are sold, USD is settled at UMB then wired to Circle to mint USDC, and last sent back to the client’s USDC Redemption Address). This end-to-end process enables a convenient way to purchase USTB but potentially adds risk to the process where investors must confirm all addresses before submitting transactions. Again, we provide an Investor Portal and are available to confirm verbally before making transactions, especially for the first few times.</p>\n<p><strong>Reconstitution</strong><br>\nInvestors may need to request the removal of an AllowList address that holds a positive balance of USTB for a variety of reasons. Superstate has controls to ensure if these errors occur, Superstate can reconcile properly with off-chain systems and return ownership.</p>\n<p>Several of these reasons are attributable to investor error and include any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lost access to a private key</li>\n<li>Private key compromised</li>\n<li>Held in the inaccessible smart contract (e.g. Gnosis Safe)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any of these issues above, investors must inform Superstate as soon as possible and submit a form (or in the future via our Investor Portal) to fix this issue. This begins the reconstitution process where Superstate will burn USTB from the affected address, remove it from the AllowList, and reconstitute shares in an unaffected address in the investor’s control.</p>\n<p><strong>13. Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps, OTC agreements?)</strong></p>\n<p>No – USTB’s investment mandate prohibits any options or derivatives</p>\n<p><strong>14.

We have developed multiple systems to maintain checks and balances between on-chain and off-chain records, as well as with USTB third parties. Superstate Inc. maintains a robust compliance program that includes processes, procedures, and training. For instance, all Superstate Inc. employees undergo compliance training, which includes strict AML/KYC and Code of Ethics training. In addition, Superstate Inc.’s COO is responsible for administering ethics and trading policies, as well as monitoring employees’ external communications.</p>\n<p>Access to both the custodian and Circle accounts is limited to authorized personnel only. To ensure extra safety measures, Superstate employs a secure Fireblocks MPC framework for all administrative addresses that manage token contracts and the AllowList for USTB. These updates require a multi-signature approval of 2-4 individuals.</p>\n<p>Superstate Inc. adheres to daily reports and reconciliations with third parties, ensuring consistent accounts and valuation. Federated Hermes, USTB’s Sub-Advisor, has developed robust risk management systems that have been tested over decades of managing similar investment mandates to USTB. They maintain a robust compliance program designed to comply with regulations for US investment companies. For transparency and audit controls, there are daily reports that go between the custodian, fund advisor, and Superstate Inc. to ensure there are no discrepancies</p>\n<h2><a name=\"performance-reporting-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#performance-reporting-10\"></a>Performance Reporting</h2>\n<p><strong>1. What are your proposed performance benchmarks? If this is substantially different from the underlying assets, please explain why.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s investment objective is to seek current income as is consistent with liquidity and stability of principal, targeting returns in line with the federal funds rate. Given the portfolio is managed by an experienced Sub-Adviser and is restricted to only invest in less than one-year duration U.S.Treasury Bills and Agency Securities, Superstate does not anticipate a deviation from the benchmark as the short-term US government securities market is highly correlated with Federal Reserve policy (effective federal funds rate).</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the content, format, preparation process, and cadence of performance reports. This should include proof of reserves, if appropriate. Please include a sample report.</strong></p>\n<p>Investors currently receive monthly statements via the Investor Portal.

Fee summary</strong></p>\n<p>The investment manager has waived all fees until the fund’s AUM exceeds $200M. After reaching $200M in AUM, Superstate Inc. charges a 0.15% management fee and the fund bears additional administrative, professional, and operating expenses. Shareholders are not subject to a performance-based fee or allocation.</p>\n<p>A summary of all expenses is found below:</p>\n<p><em>Note: These fees and expenses are outlined explicitly in the Fund’s Private Placement Memorandum and Investor Agreement upon subscription.</em></p>\n<p>(i) the Management Fee of 0.15%<br>\n(ii) operating the Fund (including, but not limited to, administrative, audit, custody, financial statement preparation, and Circle Internet Financial fees)<br>\n(iii) any expenses not expressly the responsibility of the Investment Manager.<br>\n(iv) blockchain expenses and gas fees to burn or transfer USTB tokens</p>\n<p>Superstate Inc. has agreed to waive or pay for certain expenses on behalf of the Fund.

There are no gas fees for minting USTB tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the frequency of fee payment and its position vis-a-vis payment priority compared with other expenses (i.e., cash waterfall)</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s daily NAV is calculated by subtracting all daily accrued expenses from the daily interest income of the securities in the portfolio. Service providers to the Fund are billed either monthly or annually, and the payment is made upon receiving the invoice. The NAV of the fund takes into account this payment on a daily accrual basis, so when investors redeem their shares, they have already covered their expenses.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"smart-contract-architecture-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#smart-contract-architecture-12\"></a>Smart Contract / Architecture</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

Is the project permission? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes – investors must undergo a standard KYC/AML process administered by Superstate Inc. before being able to purchase USTB. As part of onboarding, Superstate Inc. collects Ethereum addresses from each investor. Upon successful onboarding, Superstate adds the investors’ provided addresses to an AllowList smart contract which ensures USTB is only held in approved addresses. The AllowList requires 2/4 signatures via Fireblocks MPC.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present in several chains? Are there any cross-chain interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, USTB is only available onchain on Ethereum Mainnet and is an ERC-20 token. Certain investors may choose to hold their shares only in the book-entry form (off-chain) instead of being tokenized and mint at a later date.</p>\n<p>We plan to natively launch on other chains in the future, depending on client demand and opportunities. Superstate Inc. is looking forward to collaborating with the Arbitrum community to grow the RWA ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>USTB is not yet used on other protocols. We intend to grow USTB integrations on-chain across various ecosystems and protocols, depending on client demand and where permissible.</p>\n<p>Beyond the blockchain, USTB may become integrated with core institutional intermediaries including OTC desks, Prime Brokers, etc. for clients to be able to use their tokens for various secondary market opportunities between AllowList participants.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>Superstate’s USTB is built to be robust, reflecting similar structures in traditional finance that have been developed over several decades and are governed by applicable law. The Fund’s investment mandate is executed by experienced portfolio managers who deploy capital within the Fund, based on thorough analysis, industry expertise, and adherence to fiduciary responsibilities. Superstate strives to provide total transparency into every detail of the Fund, including public and private information, holdings, and NAV.</p>\n<p>Investors rely on Superstate’s management of admin privileges via our Investor Portal. Access to privileged roles within our Investor Portal is carefully controlled and restricted to whom Arbitrum grants access. We employ a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive functionalities and data. Investors can use the Portal to see their portfolio’s performance, transactions, and any actions taken by administrators or trusted roles.</p>\n<p>Investors trust Superstate to perform mint/burn activities per the 2-4 multi-signature standards outlined above (using Fireblocks MPC) and to continue developing reliable technology and infrastructure while getting independent third-party audits as needed. Superstate Inc. limits access to Circle and custody systems via multi-factor authentication, distributed across key management personnel. Regular audits and reviews are conducted to ensure compliance with internal controls and industry regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token?

BOLD delivers two critical improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains,</li>\n<li>Enhances the security of Arbitrum chains by mitigating the risk of <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a\">delay attacks</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BOLD accomplishes this feat by ensuring that any single honest party can always successfully defend against malicious claims to an Arbitrum chain’s state. BOLD represents the next step on the journey to having the Arbitrum technology stack being recognized as a <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571\">Stage 2 Ethereum rollup</a>. The implementation of BOLD will be thoroughly tested to ensure both its effectiveness and safety. The testing plan includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A comprehensive audit by Trail of Bits,</li>\n<li>Deployment of the protocol to public testnets for at least 8 weeks,</li>\n<li>A public audit program,</li>\n<li>Publication of mathematical safety proofs and formal specifications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal requests the ArbitrumDAO to approve an upgrade to the onchain smart contracts and to support the deployment of a new challenger manager contract on Ethereum. If the upgrade is approved, then validators on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova can use the Nitro software to participate in BOLD.</p>\n<p>Additionally, all Arbitrum Orbit chains may choose to adopt BOLD to reap the security benefits of this new dispute resolution protocol as soon as the upgrade is generally available. BOLD, like the current Arbitrum dispute resolution protocol, makes use of WebAssembly (WASM) technology and can seamlessly support Arbitrum Stylus, should the ArbitrumDAO adopt <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts/22970\">Stylus</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The ArbitrumDAO should consider approving this AIP as BOLD delivers critical security and decentralization improvements for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova that benefit all Arbitrum users, Arbitrum node operators, dApps on Arbitrum, and Arbitrum bridges. These benefits can be extended to any Orbit chain that wishes to adopt BOLD.</p>\n<p>More specifically, this new dispute resolution protocol brings the following benefits to Arbitrum chains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Permissionless validation</strong> - Today, the critical role of being a validator for Arbitrum One and Nova is currently restricted to a permissioned set of validators in order to prevent <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a\">delay attacks</a> on the current rollup protocol - a class of attacks where actors can delay confirmations if they are willing to sacrifice their stakes. However, since BOLD mitigates the risks of delay attacks using a different mechanism (enforcing a fixed upper time bound on dispute resolution), reliance on a permissioned set of validators is no longer necessary. Therefore, passing this AIP and implementing BOLD to secure Arbitrum One and Nova effectively enables permissionless validation, marking a key milestone for Arbitrum chains to be recognized as <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571\">Stage 2 Rollups</a>, as part of Arbitrum’s<a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization\"> journey to full decentralization</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Fixed delay time for assertion confirmation</strong> - The current rollup protocol for Arbitrum chains has a ~6.4 day challenge period during which validators can dispute claims about the chain’s state. These claims about the chain’s state are called “assertions”. While assertions are confirmable after 1 challenge period, malicious actors can open many challenges to delay confirming these assertions in a type of attack known as a <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a\">delay attack</a>. BOLD guarantees that all assertions, if there is a dispute using the validating bridge contract, will be confirmed within a fixed time window of 2 challenge periods (~6.4 days each), 1 day grace period for the security council to intervene, and a small delta for computing challenges.</li>\n<li><strong>Security Council Safety-First Approach</strong> - There is a set of contracts on Ethereum known as the OneStepProver contracts. These contracts are used to declare a winner in a challenge by producing the correct L2 state given the single step of WASM execution being disputed. As mentioned above, a 1 day “grace period” (also called the “challenge grace period”) exists at the end of a dispute for the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council\">Security Council</a> to intervene if there are any severe bugs in the OneStepProver contracts. The grace period is configurable by the ArbitrumDAO and initially set to 1 day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Enabling permissionless validation has been a long term goal of Arbitrum on the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization\">progressive journey towards decentralization</a>.</p>\n<p>BOLD mitigates the risk of delay attacks on Optimistic Rollups by ensuring challenges can be resolved within a fixed time period so long as there is an honest party involved. This particular change unlocks permissionless validation, enabling any well-resourced honest party or parties to defend and protect Arbitrum from malicious actors. All Arbitrum nodes are like watchtowers - honest validators by default and are able to catch fraudulent claims, and act if so desired.</p>\n<p>More specifically, this AIP for bringing BOLD to Arbitrum chains is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ethereum-aligned:</strong> Arbitrum, with BOLD validation, will continue to rely on Ethereum for transaction data and the arbitration of disputes. Additionally, in line with Ethereum’s commitment to being open to everyone, Arbitrum will become more decentralized and trustless since participation to secure the network (i.e. validation) will be entirely permissionless and open to everyone who wishes to participate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sustainable:</strong> The BOLD protocol is a long-term dispute resolution protocol to secure Arbitrum chains. Additionally, there are already future investments and research expected following the initial launch, to ensure BOLD and its security guarantees evolve alongside the Arbitrum protocol, technology, and community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Secure:</strong> The BOLD protocol is an intentional and strict improvement to the security model of Arbitrum chains. Arbitrum rollup chains, with BOLD validation, will continue to rely on Ethereum for data availability of transaction data and the arbitration of disputes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Socially inclusive:</strong> Should this AIP be adopted, permissionless validation using BOLD will allow any entity, individual, or team in the community to participate constructively in securing Arbitrum. Validation is not restricted to a single address, as BOLD considers all entities that are proposing honest claims to be part of the same team. Where one honest validator may fall off, another one can take up its same responsibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Technically inclusive:</strong> The BOLD protocol specification is publicly available on Github<a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold\"> here</a>.

The following link, <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf\">Economics of Disputes in Arbitrum BOLD</a>, offers greater details on the rationale behind the proposed bond sizes, why bonds are important, and how to think about their magnitude in the context of designing a dispute resolution protocol.</p>\n<p>Based on feedback, we wanted to clarify the various roles and expectations for those participating in bold validation -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By default, all Arbitrum nodes are validators that will track the progress of the chain to verify assertions being posted to the parent chain to flag if an invalid assertion is observed. Running this type of validator is permissionless today and does not require any bond. Running a validator in this mode is also known as a “watchtower” node.</p>\n<p>BOLD lets validators permissionlessly become proposers and challengers if they want to. The role of a proposer is required to help progress the chain which requires bonding ETH, proposing and then posting state assertions to the parent chain. This bond is known as an “assertion bond”.  The chain only needs 1 proposer to make progress. Therefore, most validators can watch the chain and independently verify assertions without being a proposer.</p>\n<p>In the unhappy case where there is a dispute about a proposed state assertion, BOLD lets anyone permissionlessly put up a bond of ETH to open challenges in the defense of Arbitrum (in their capacity as a challenger to invalid state assertions). This bond is known as a “challenge bond”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given that participation in BOLD is permissionless, we recommend that the size of bonds required to participate be high enough to disincentivize malicious actors from attacking Arbitrum One and Nova and to mitigate against spam (that would otherwise delay confirmations up to approximately 1 challenge period). High bonding values do not harm decentralization because (1) trustless bonding (or staking) pools can be deployed permissionlessly to open challenges and post assertions, and (2) any number of honest parties of unknown identities can emerge to bond their funds to the correct assertion and participate in the defense of Arbitrum at any time within a challenge. As with the current dispute resolution protocol, there are no protocol level incentives for parties who opt in to participate in validating Arbitrum One and Nova with BOLD.</p>\n<p>While both of these bonds can be any ERC20 token and be set to any size, this proposal recommends the use of the WETH ERC20 token &amp; the following bond sizes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assertion bonds:</strong> 1500 ETH - required from validators to bond their funds to an assertion in the eventual hopes of having that assertion be confirmed by the rollup protocol. This is a one-time bond required to be able to start posting assertions. This bond can be withdrawn once a validator’s assertion is confirmed and can alternatively be put together via a trustless bonding pool.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenge-bonds, per level:</strong> 3600/1000/100/10 ETH - required from validators to open challenges against an assertion observed on Ethereum, for each level. Note that “level” corresponds to the level of granularity at which the interactive dissection game gets played over, starting at the block level, moving on to a range of WASM execution steps, and then finally to the level of a single step of execution. These values were chosen to achieve a ratio of malicious-to-honest costs of 10:1. These bonds can be refunded at the end of a challenge and can also alternatively be put together by the community using a trustless bonding pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following link, <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf\">Economics of Disputes in Arbitrum BOLD</a>, covers the rationale behind the design and recommended values above in greater detail. Note that the ArbitrumDAO can change these values and the type of asset used for the bonds via a governance proposal.</p>\n<p>BOLD makes permissionless validation possible for Arbitrum rollup chains and marks a major step towards <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization\">full decentralization</a>. This significant milestone also lays the groundwork for productive discussions about future economic incentives for those participating in the protocol since anyone can participate.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"reimbursements-and-penalties-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#reimbursements-and-penalties-6\"></a>Reimbursements and penalties</h3>\n<p>Once all of a validator’s assertions are confirmed, a validator can withdraw their full assertion bond. Other costs, including the mini-bonds from both the malicious actor and honest party, will be held in escrow within a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet that The Arbitrum Foundation controls. The Arbitrum Foundation, on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO, will therefore have full discretion over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to reimburse the mini-bond and gas costs to honest parties, and</li>\n<li>What to do with the funds confiscated from a malicious actor (including, but not limited to:rewarding or reimbursing the honest parties with a portion of the confiscated funds, burning the confiscated funds in its entirety, or sending the confiscated funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that honest parties are not automatically rewarded with the funds confiscated from malicious actors to avoid creating a situation where honest parties wastefully compete to be the first one to make each honest move in the interactive fraud proof game. Additionally, BOLD resolves disputes by determining which top-level assertion is correct, without necessarily being able to classify every move as “honest” or “malicious” as part of the interactive fraud proof game without off-chain knowledge. These two factors are the reason why the ArbitrumDAO has the final authority on what to do with the funds that are held in the escrow smart contract mentioned above.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"technical-risks-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#technical-risks-7\"></a>Technical risks</h2>\n<p>Some of the technical risks of the BOLD upgrade include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issues preventing liveness of challenges due to smart contract bugs in the new contracts. For instance, no honest validator able to make a move when it should be able to;</li>\n<li>Safety issues where a malicious party is able to game the system and win due to logic errors in smart contracts;</li>\n<li>Logic bugs in the assertion smart contracts that could affect assertion confirmation and posting, which could delay withdrawals until it is fixed; and</li>\n<li>Bugs in bonding logic in the smart contracts that could lead to loss of funds due to logic errors in the Arbitrum Rollup and challenge manager smart contracts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Risks that remain the same between the current Arbitrum Rollup protocol and BOLD</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugs in the one step proof logic: BOLD does not change how one step proofs work for Arbitrum chains.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-and-steps-to-implement-bold-for-arbitrum-one-and-nova-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-and-steps-to-implement-bold-for-arbitrum-one-and-nova-8\"></a>Timeline and steps to implement BOLD for Arbitrum One and Nova</h2>\n<p>Below is a list of initiatives to ensure the new BOLD dispute resolution protocol is ready to be reviewed and ready to be voted on by the ArbitrumDAO for adoption in Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.

TVL</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of note, nearly all $4,000,000 of the TVL that was secured during our STIP incentives were locked for 6 months, beginning in February.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our team took special care to distribute the rewards in a long-term effective way that will provide a lasting value to both the exchange and the network as a whole. Creating solutions that earn user’s commitment is paramount to stability and longevity, which is why we assessed our original distribution model and pivoted. Although it required more bandwidth from our team to innovate, we created a new locked bridging contract that facilitated our onboarding of $2,000,000 new TVL <strong>from other networks</strong>. It’s crucial to highlight that we have specifically targeted new liquidity, rather than competing for TVL that has already been established on the network.</p>\n<p>After evaluating the success of the locked multi-chain bridging and staking contract, we also applied a new (optional) locking opportunity to any new or existing VLP holders. This followed in the successes of the former event, resulting in over $1,850,000 additional TVL being locked for 6 months.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Volume &amp; Fees</strong></p>\n<p>Volume surged as the popularity of our gamified trading competition grew, seeing the largest impact out of all other performance indicators. We believe that delivering socially competitive events is one of Vela Exchange’s key differentiators, and that the Grand Prix has solidified itself as a prime example of how to maximize user engagement through trading and rewards (as a ratio).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/09d887099707279783191ff26a66237c73340ff3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1p6cIWV2ti5ZSp9dDraJ7DUkY7h.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/09d887099707279783191ff26a66237c73340ff3_2_377x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"1p6cIWV2ti5ZSp9dDraJ7DUkY7h\" width=\"377\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/09d887099707279783191ff26a66237c73340ff3_2_377x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/09d887099707279783191ff26a66237c73340ff3_2_565x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/09d887099707279783191ff26a66237c73340ff3_2_754x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"171D27\"></a></div><p></p>\n<hr>\n<p>During the Grand Prix, users were pushed to the limits of their trading potential as they competed alongside one another in five themed rounds.

During STIP, our liquidity token holders saw an overall appreciation of 6.3% to their USDC.e on top of their additional ARB and esVELA rewards from staking VLP.</p>\n<p>A staggering 51% of all liquidations since official launch (June 2023) occurred during the STIP incentives period. Meanwhile, protocol revenue was also an impressive $1,100,000, representing 47.8% of all cumulative revenues.</p>\n<p><em>Over the course of the STIP incentive period Vela Exchange amassed a significant uptick in fees:</em><br>\n<img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/2857249b17c32dcdd4d76ed9cb17a02f56e87132.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"5KRNIbghm3u3AdD2O06e04M2kmu\" width=\"532\" height=\"445\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>3. Bots and Automations</strong></p>\n<p>The process of finding the right partner and forging a plan led us to realize that this tranche wasn’t a perfect fit, primarily due to time constraints. After discussing our options with the grant team, we decided that a final kickoff round for the Grand Prix was the best fit, since all KPI data had provided us with high confidence in trading volume results.</p>\n<p>Although we had to deviate from this approach, we were still able to forge a key partnership with Astrabit, just in time for their v2 rollout. Numerous hours from both teams went into realizing this, and we thank them for their effort and hard work that went into aligning documentation, testing, and collaboration.</p>\n<h2> Improvement Areas</h2>\n<p>Overall, STIP was a very fast-paced first step that can establish valuable precedence and structure. However, as a project that has now been through the full process, there were some areas that produced friction or felt left out.</p>\n<p><strong>Reporting Frequency</strong>: Bi-weekly reporting seemed unwarranted and lacking in oversight. We strongly believe that there should be frequent updates provided to the community and grant program managers, but the requirement to provide these every two weeks without receiving any feedback came off as an area that could be improved upon. We would suggest extending this to monthly updates and to assign personnel who could review and start discussions based on these updates. Any feedback midway through the STIP program or future programs would be so helpful and are likely to have a positive result.</p>\n<p><strong>Retention</strong>: Throughout the STIP, our team was challenged with creating and delivering thoughtful and effective mechanisms for users to engage with. There is a looming pressure for all decisions to be KPI driven, yet we soon realized that a KPI such as TVL might not consider longevity. In our bi-weekly updates we were to include an average TVL, however this did not capture the duration that TVL would be committed to Vela Exchange and, subsequently, the Arbitrum network. We believe that it is extremely valuable to establish the long-term value and effect of KPIs in addition to reporting snapshots of a given timeframe. This applies to most KPIs</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vela-exchange-stip-summary/23230\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vela-exchange-stip-summary/23230","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 13:41:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23230"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vela-exchange-stip-summary/23230.rss","#text":"Vela Exchange: STIP Summary"}},{"title":"Arbitrum LATAM Report — March 2024","dc:creator":"Sebix","category":"Grants Discussions","description":"<h1><a name=\"arbitrum-latam-report-march-2024-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#arbitrum-latam-report-march-2024-1\"></a>Arbitrum LATAM Report — March 2024</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"end-of-stage-1-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#end-of-stage-1-2\"></a>End of Stage 1</h2>\n<p>During this first stage of the Arbitrum LATAM project, the teams have successfully achieved all the objectives outlined in their <a href=\"https://questbook.app/dashboard/?chainId=10&amp;proposalId=0x4e1&amp;grantId=0x650b4a0dc2aec18f55adb72f13c5d95631db04be&amp;isRenderingProposalBody=true\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><strong>proposal</strong></a> for the Arbitrum grants within the ‘Education, Community Growth &amp; Events’ domain—and even surpassed some of them.</p>\n<p>As mentioned on previous reports, the Arbitrum LATAM project seeks to enhance the protocol’s accessibility and educate Latin American communities about the opportunities and potential of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>During this initial three-month phase, the teams concentrated on building a community from the ground up, now boasting over 500 members, and launched a Spanish portal featuring over 50 educational resources, including articles, newsletters, podcasts, educational videos, and tutorials. We also initiated university outreach by conducting an introductory class on web3 and Arbitrum for students at <a href=\"https://www.itba.edu.ar/en/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><strong>ITBA</strong></a>, thereby reaching a new audiences from the widely untapped latinamerican academic world.</p>\n<p>Additionally, collaboration ties have been established with the Arbitrum Foundation to maximize the project’s impact. This collaboration involves sharing resources, expertise, and strategic insights to drive mutual success and innovation. By leveraging the Foundation’s expertise and network, the Arbitrum LATAM project aims to accelerate the adoption of Arbitrum technology and drive positive change in the Latin American blockchain community.</p>\n<p>In essence, we have established a robust foundation to foster a meaningful connection with Latin American users and expand the protocol’s user base.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the teams up to now?</strong></p>\n<p>The teams are working to forge stronger connections with potential audiences by offering both in-person and virtual university classes, fostering deeper engagement with established LATAM communities, and organizing in-person events. Intermediate-level content will be produced to support community advancements and deepen its knowledge. Leveraging all available resources, we will implement a comprehensive growth strategy across all platforms and establish a Telegram group for direct engagement with new users seeking information or guidance on the protocol and ecosystem contributions.

With over 500 community members, a solid educational portal, and successful university outreach, the project has made significant strides in achieving its objectives.</p>\n<p>Also, production remained robust as we concluded the third month, successfully meeting all expectations and achieving the set milestones within the designated timeframe. Once again, we surpassed our target for educational articles by delivering 5 articles over the past 4 weeks, exceeding the initial goal of 3.</p>\n<p><strong>So, what’s next for Arbitrum LATAM?</strong></p>\n<p>The project members are currently developing a new proposal that integrates the following objectives and strategies, aiming to fully capitalize on the project’s potential initiated in January:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Audience Engagement</strong>: Our teams are actively working to forge stronger connections with potential audiences. This will be achieved through a combination of social-media engagement, in-person and virtual university classes, and collaboration with various web3 LATAM communities, thus allowing us to reach a diverse range of learners and enthusiasts.</li>\n<li><strong>University Calendar 2024</strong>: Our teams are also working on developing a comprehensive calendar of classes for 2024. This calendar will focus on organizing presentations at some of the most prestigious universities in Argentina. Moreover, we aim to expand our outreach to universities in Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela to engage with a broader audience.\n<ul>\n<li>We have already secured participation in four of Argentina’s most prestigious universities for upcoming events and presentations in 2024. This achievement further strengthens our engagement and outreach within the academic community.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Deepening LATAM Community Engagement</strong>: We are committed to fostering deeper engagement with established LATAM web3 communities.

Currently, we are proposing forming the group to conduct the research of such opportunities as well as the set-up of the legal, strategic, governance, and operational structures to support large scale investments.</p>\n<p>Expanding beyond the traditional grant-based model, AVI aims to adopt a multifaceted investment strategy that encompasses not just grant funding but a broader spectrum of financial instruments. This approach includes allocating capital towards venture capital funds, engaging in debt facilities, TVL provision, or revenue-sharing agreements.</p>\n<p>Additionally, AVI seeks to set up in such a way that we can provide a “fund in a box” mechanism for investment managers where appropriate, so that the legal, governance, and operational costs and time required to set up for venture capital firms and other managers and programmes can be streamlined and the whole fund deployment of Arbitrum be the leading example in Web3 and beyond.</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt - we are proposing to implement AVI in two stages, where:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Forming the group to conduct the research of such opportunities as well as the set-up of the legal, strategic, governance, and operational structures to support large scale investments. This what the successful vote of this proposal would cover and specifically the allocation of the funds described in the Overall Cost section only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The investment fund is structured and allocated and the mandate awarded to a management team. It is the intention and commitment of the group described above to fill that role, however that would be the function of separate approval and approving this proposal would not create a commitment to that end.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>AVI will not only enhance RoI, but also catalyze scalable and strategic investment across the ecosystem, unlocking innovation and growth for Arbitrum to lead the L2 market.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong><br>\nThe rapid development of L2s in the Ethereum ecosystem is creating a strong competition and a race for retaining and acquiring network activity. To grow effectively and to retain its number one spot in L2s, Arbitrum needs to engage capital to support its ecosystem and based on the competition, the capital required is in the billions. In the best interest of the ecosystem, capital deployment needs to happen at scale to retain and attract the best builders. At the same time, Arbitrum also needs to consider the sustainability of its treasury in the long term.</p>\n<p>In the best interest of the Arbitrum ecosystem, we should explore different approaches to diversification of the available capital to be deployed, which provide direct RoI and drive co-investment activity from a wide variety of other ecosystem players. Specifically, this initiative is looking to:</p>\n<p>(a) research the process and the legal and governance frameworks to deploy capital in excess of $1B in ARB equivalent while enabling the supported vehicles to attract an additional $1B to $3B from various Limited Partners (LPs) over a period of 5 years.</p>\n<p>(b) develop an investment thesis, deployment strategy and set up the operational infrastructure required to execute the initiative.</p>\n<p>(c) examine the potential value multiplier effects from co-investment and portfolio growth and link them to strategic outcomes valued by Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The current grants-only based funding model limits our ability to engage in the large-scale, strategic business development and investments necessary for ecosystem development and long-term growth.</p>\n<p>Currently, these limitations are manifested in a variety of ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Concerns about retention of grantees in the ecosystem</li>\n<li>Concerns about the RoI of incentive programs</li>\n<li>Concerns with the incentive alignment of ecosystem players</li>\n<li>Inability to attract co-investment</li>\n<li>Challenges with forecasting the revenue different programs could generate</li>\n<li>Growing reporting structures and additional resources consumed in oversight</li>\n<li>Legally uncertain IP licensing and ownership rights, including OSS libraries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By incorporating elements such as equity/quasi-equity investments or revenue-sharing mechanisms (agreements), the Arbitrum DAO can complement grant programs with specialized accelerators, venture builders, VCs, and other instruments, and thus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create win-win outcomes and long-term incentive alignment with funded projects and funding programs,</li>\n<li>leverage best practices from public-private partnerships (facilitate collaboration with a variety of commercial partners to bring additional talent, capital, industry connections, and market insights),</li>\n<li>Attract co-investment and strategic partnerships,</li>\n<li>reduce concerns about project retention and reporting,</li>\n<li>and improve ecosystem sustainability through generating RoI and diversifying revenue streams.</li>\n<li>Improve ecosystem tooling via accelerating decentralized capability development</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From a strategic point of view besides creating direct RoI from the ecosystem of funded protocols and thus diversifying Arbitrum’s revenue streams, AVI will also look at all relevant metrics supporting the adoption and growth of the platform.</p>\n<p>Our team has decades of entrepreneurial and venture experience across a very broad range of industries, where, among other things, we have been building on blockchain for the last 10 years. We have generated billions in exits, hundreds of millions in investments in startups, and further hundreds of millions in investments in venture capital funds. We can furthermore pull from deep talent pools in the 30+ countries in which we have operated.</p>\n<p>We are very excited to share our vision about the overall Web3 space and apply it towards the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem, and to execute on it in the shortest timeline possible.</p>\n<p>The work required to set up AVI, especially to go beyond creating it as a fund, but rather a powerful ecosystem platform is very significant. That includes and goes beyond legal, regulatory, strategic, financial management and governance infrastructure, design of community interfaces and stakeholder management mechanism, developing the investment thesis together with the community and potential investment managers, creating the smart contract and technology infrastructure, and more.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong><br>\nArbitrum stands as a market leader amongst L2s, but faces significant competition from at least 45 L2s (according to L2Beat data). As such, Arbitrum’s ability to leverage its large treasury effectively is a critical factor in its ability to survive, thrive, and stay continuously relevant.</p>\n<p>Deploying capital as investments, in parallel with infrastructure and business development activities, provides a range of powerful mechanisms for ecosystem growth, revenue generation, and diversification. AVI can leverage these instruments and lessons learned, translate them to a Web3 context, and enable Arbitrum to reap the benefits. While the objective is for those instruments to be organized as profitable venture capital, AVI will focus on longer term,  fundamental metrics that will ultimately lead to increased sequencer fees, diversification of revenue streams, improved network effects within clusters of complimentary protocols, increase in TVL, new ventures and protocols adopting the arbitrum stack, and developers building in the ecosystem, among other strategic objectives.</p>\n<p>Focusing on longer term opportunities and the success of the wider Arbitrum ecosystem is what differentiates AVI from other ecosystem funds that have a primary objective to drive financial returns.</p>\n<p>Critically, AVI proposes a diversified and large scale investment approach: instead of putting all our eggs in one basket or vertical, and instead of creating a single VC, we aim to create a governance structure and fund allocation process that can select multiple funding programs that are run commercially.</p>\n<p>Selecting and working with a wider range of VC and ecosystem development partners and related programs can bring additional expertise, industry connections, and market insights. In turn, this enables to more effectively source and select meaningful activities and investments, and significantly accelerate the growth of projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The rigorous due diligence procedures of these partners and programs ensures that projects with the highest potential for innovation and market impact receive support. This careful selection process aligns perfectly with the ethos of transparency and meritocracy, ensuring that the Arbitrum ecosystem is a fertile ground for projects that create value and long-term viability.<br>\nThe mentorship, investee support, and professional management accompanying investment programs can be particularly beneficial in the fast-evolving blockchain sector.<br>\nThe long-term investment horizon of selected programs (3-10 years) is in line with the forward-looking vision of Arbitrum’s development, where investments in funds and programs with proven track record and their activities are strategically placed in projects that contribute to the enduring growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The rationale for AVI aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission to create a scalable, efficient, and innovative blockchain ecosystem. The shift towards a more flexible and diversified investment model is driven by the understanding that the needs of the ecosystem are multifaceted and dynamic.</p>\n<p>Thus the capacity to rapidly deploy and provision new investment teams on emerging frontier topics is paramount. In the short term, these are going to be focused on areas that already have significant traction in the ecosystem and can generate quick wins for the existing ecosystem participants. Arbitrum’s ecosystem is particularly strong in DeFi and SocialFi, and we see those as key to generating stable usage by introducing fresh activity as well as capturing economic activity on-chain. Furthermore, we are going to explore newer trends like gaming, cross-chain tooling (bridges, deployment across different VMs, etc) as well as emerging categories that we see potential for support of long term initiatives onboarding critical real world data on-chain like DeSci. Our goal is to enable the ecosystem to pave the way to real economy adoption and participation by connecting initiatives, and eventually large enterprises across big industries as they make progress with their digital transformations. Examples include the climate economy, healthcare, traditional financial services, state governance, and many more.</p>\n<p>To enable cross-pollination of web2 and web3 expertise and capabilities, we can engage both existing Web3 specialized fund managers as well as supporting Web2 players expanding into Web3 to enhance their capabilities and mandates. Success can be achieved by creating containers and mechanisms (off-chain and on-chain) to reduce the time, friction, and cost for anyone who wants to manage funds, has a demonstrated track record, and ability to bring coinvestment, to do so. It will also provide support and education services to such contributors.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Key Terms</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>AVI (Arbitrum Venture Initiative): A new investment model within the Arbitrum ecosystem focusing on strategic growth through varied funding mechanisms.</li>\n<li>VC (Venture Capital): Funds allocated for investment in early-stage companies within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Debt Facilities: Loans provided to support ecosystem projects with expected return on investment.</li>\n<li>Revenue-Based Financing: Contracts that allow the ecosystem to receive a percentage of revenues from supported projects.</li>\n<li>Warrants - using covenants linked to desired strategic outcomes to secure favorable investment terms for investees who are strategically aligned to specific ecosystem objectives and benefit directly from scaling into the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Venture incubation / Venture building is a process providing repeated and systemic conceptualization, test and launch new businesses by leveraging resource pooling, IP sharing, economies of scale and network principles</li>\n<li>Container / Fund in a Box: legal and governance automation for the setup and operation of investment manager entities or groups, fast and cost-effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Platforms and Technologies:</strong> The AVI will utilize existing Arbitrum infrastructure and new legal Initiatives to facilitate investments and activities.

Making it a challenge to put the content in such a manner that even the newcomers would understand the context, which would lead to increased and easy onboarding of new users.</p>\n<p><strong>Scattered Information in the Arbitrum Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>One of the fundamental challenges in the Arbitrum ecosystem is the decentralized and uncurated nature of available resources. Vital information is dispersed across various platforms, including developer guides, project documentation, and community contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>Absence of a Go-to Platform</strong></p>\n<p>The current issue within the Arbitrum ecosystem is the absence of a go-to platform that consolidates all necessary information in one accessible location, making it easier for everyone to navigate the ecosystem. While there are existing platforms, they tend to present information in text-heavy formats, making it challenging for users to navigate and digest the content efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of Comprehensive Guidance</strong></p>\n<p>Users might have trouble finding all the information they need in one place. For example, they might find technical details but not know how to get involved in the community or understand how projects are managed.</p>\n<p><strong>Fragmented Community Engagement</strong></p>\n<p>Because information is scattered, community members might feel disconnected from each other. A central place to find information would help them feel more connected and make it easier for them to work together</p>\n<p><em>“The biggest problem with the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem is how hard it is for users to navigate. Information is all over the place, getting started is complicated, and remaining updated about decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) initiative is a real task.”</em></p>\n<p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>\n<p>We noticed these problems and proposed them to Plurality Labs in Jan 2023 to come up with a plan and solution to make the ArbitrumDAO user experience &amp; understanding amongst users better. We made an effort to fix these issues and make sure people were more involved with the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Research &amp; Analysis: Understanding the User Journey</strong></p>\n<p>The first step involved extensive research and analysis to gain a deep understanding of the current user experience within the Arbitrum ecosystem. We employed a multi-pronged approach:</p>\n<p><strong>Information Flow Mapping</strong></p>\n<p>Mapping the existing flow of information within the ecosystem helped pinpoint areas where users faced difficulty accessing or comprehending crucial data.</p>\n<p><strong>Brainstorming Sessions</strong></p>\n<p>Our team members with diverse backgrounds in design, research and development came together to brainstorm and identify key pain points. This collaborative effort ensured that the proposed solutions truly addressed user needs.</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Addressing the identified gaps</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the research findings, our team developed a user flow that addressed the identified gaps in the Arbitrum ecosystem through multiple iterations and feedback. here are the things we considered:</p>\n<p><strong>Information Consolidation</strong></p>\n<p>A central information hub, or knowledge base, would be established. This hub would aggregate relevant information from disparate sources, making it easily accessible and understandable for users.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplified flow to navigate the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>Streamlining the process to navigate the ecosystem would reduce the learning curve for new users. This could involve implementing interactive tutorials, creating a step-by-step onboarding guide, and offering in-platform support resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Increasing DAO Participation</strong></p>\n<p>User-friendly interfaces for DAOs would be designed. These interfaces would facilitate seamless idea sharing, proposal creation, and voting participation, fostering a more engaged DAO community.</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Building a User-Friendly Interface</strong></p>\n<p>Following the development of the user flow, We embarked on the UI design phase. There were few things we considered:</p>\n<p><strong>Consistent Design Language</strong></p>\n<p>A consistent design language would be implemented across all components of the Arbitrum ecosystem, including developer guides, onboarding materials, and community platforms. This would enhance user familiarity and create a seamless experience.</p>\n<p><strong>100% Open-Source &amp; Future-proof Platform</strong></p>\n<p>Created an open-source platform with consolidated data accessible to individuals of varying technical expertise levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsive Design</strong></p>\n<p>Recognizing the diverse range of devices used by our users, we ensured that the interface was responsive across various screen sizes and resolutions. This responsive design approach guarantees optimal viewing experiences, regardless of the device being utilized.</p>\n<p><strong>Structured Content Presentation</strong></p>\n<p>The content was organized and presented in a structured manner, catering to users with varying levels of technical proficiency. We employed clear language and concise explanations, avoiding jargon and technical complexities wherever possible. This approach ensures that users can easily comprehend the content and navigate through the interface without feeling overwhelmed.</p>\n<p><strong>User-Friendly Content Updates</strong></p>\n<p>Implemented a simple method for users to update information using markdown (.md) files, ensuring easy community engagement with the platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Practices while Developing</strong></p>\n<p>We followed industry best practices in coding, maintaining a structured and organized codebase. Clean and well-commented code not only improves readability and maintainability but also facilitates collaboration among developers. By adhering to coding standards and conventions, we ensured a smooth development process and minimized the risk of errors or inconsistencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges &amp; Solutions</strong></p>\n<p>The project faced some tough challenges. We had to find smart solutions for these problems:</p>\n<p>Bringing Together Different Information: Curating information from various sources proved to be a hurdle. We addressed this problem by rigorous research and use of proper tools and reliable sources to simplify the information that would be understood by both the regular users and the new users</p>\n<p>Balancing Tech and User Needs: Striking a balance between the technical intricacies of the Arbitrum ecosystem and user needs for a simple and intuitive experience was crucial. User-centric design principles were rigorously applied to ensure the final solution effectively met user expectations without compromising technical functionality.</p>\n<p>Scalability for Future Growth: We knew the platform would get bigger, so we made sure that the solution could handle more users at any point of time. To address this, the team designed the system with future expansion in mind, incorporating modular components that could be easily adapted to accommodate increasing user demands.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Features of the DAO Sync Platform:</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4f116b9304e36611108515e1c55d9a760be8d7e6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bht2EvTGURler0IR8MP59CMJ7xQ.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4f116b9304e36611108515e1c55d9a760be8d7e6_2_624x351.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"bht2EvTGURler0IR8MP59CMJ7xQ\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4f116b9304e36611108515e1c55d9a760be8d7e6_2_624x351.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4f116b9304e36611108515e1c55d9a760be8d7e6_2_936x526.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4f116b9304e36611108515e1c55d9a760be8d7e6_2_1248x702.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FDFDFD\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Home</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/46b15e5b17fb1265e2abdf61c0b92b38834ea686.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/a5nqROTfflJLq3HNZsanNuL2qOy.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/46b15e5b17fb1265e2abdf61c0b92b38834ea686_2_624x351.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"a5nqROTfflJLq3HNZsanNuL2qOy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/46b15e5b17fb1265e2abdf61c0b92b38834ea686_2_624x351.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/46b15e5b17fb1265e2abdf61c0b92b38834ea686_2_936x526.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/46b15e5b17fb1265e2abdf61c0b92b38834ea686_2_1248x702.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E3E8EB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The home page of the DAO Sync Platform offers a comprehensive overview of Arbitrum, its technologies, and the features of our platform.

For completeness, we have outlined a preliminary view of the rest of the phases.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"acknowledgements-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#acknowledgements-4\"></a>Acknowledgements</h1>\n<p>First of all big thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jacobpphillips\">@jacobpphillips</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/hiringdevs.eth\">@hiringdevs.eth</a> for sparking the initiative at the GovHack in Denver, and everybody who has been actively contributing to move this forward <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo\">@JoJo</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/juanbug\">@juanbug</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/abdullahumar\">@AbdullahUmar</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/mattonchain\">@MattOnChain</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/krst\">@krst</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/alexlumley\">@AlexLumley</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/djinn\">@Djinn</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/lino\">@lino</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"content-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#content-5\"></a>Content</h1>\n<p>I.

M&amp;A Opportunity for Arbitrum</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our thesis is that M&amp;A is a key driver towards cementing Arbitrum’s position as the leading L2, and is one of the most productive ways of utilizing Arbitrum’s treasury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The crypto space is incredibly fragmented at the moment, and the M&amp;A market is fundamentally nascent, presenting significant opportunities to scale and grow for active market participants. The unit could, for example, consolidate the fragmented L2 market where Arbitrum could buy up competitors, or help to grow the Orbit ecosystem by acquiring applications as L3s for Orbit. <strong>The design space is vast.</strong></p>\n<p>Furthermore, if the OpCo becomes a reality, the Arbitrum M&amp;A Unit could play an integral role in scaling and helping the DAO achieve the strategic objectives set out.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"expected-outcomes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#expected-outcomes-7\"></a>Expected Outcomes</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum M&amp;A Unit has an overarching mission:</p>\n<p><strong>To act as a key growth driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem and help the DAO expand non-organically through acquisition opportunities that are not accessible for competing ecosystems.</strong></p>\n<p>Thereby, the three key objectives are:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Enabling access to value creation through acquisitions.</strong> As can be seen in the DAO ROI section below, Arbitrum DAO can create value that can be judged via 1) financial metrics, 2) strategic value, and 3) long-term value.<br>\n<strong>2. Creating a strong ecosystem of self-operating, high performing companies owned by Arbitrum DAO</strong> that are fully focused on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.<br>\n<strong>3. Providing an exit opportunity for Arbitrum ecosystem projects</strong>, thereby significantly increasing the attractiveness of building on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes</strong>:</p>\n<p>Within the initial 2 years of the program, the aim is to establish Arbitrum as the leading crypto ecosystem with a functioning M&amp;A unit proving its power with key strategic acquisitions that significantly grow the ecosystem, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Executing 5-10 dedicated acquisitions of high-potential targets</strong> to fuel their growth and that of Arbitrum, enabled by deep due diligence.</li>\n<li><strong>Screening over 100 projects</strong> to determine where the value lies in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrating acquired companies into the Arbitrum ecosystem</strong> and unlocking value creation for 50+ affiliated companies within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An additional outcome is that the program will complete the lifecycle for companies building in Arbitrum from small-scale to normal-sized grants up until providing access to a real exit opportunity becoming part of Arbitrum DAO and even potential consolidation of other L2s and competitors.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"ii-ma-unit-structure-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ii-ma-unit-structure-8\"></a>II.

Flow of Funds</h1>\n<p>With regards to checks and balances from the DAO, we propose that the total fund amount is held within the DAO’s treasury but is earmarked for use by the M&amp;A Unit.</p>\n<p>Given that the Arbitrum DAO Steering Committee has ultimate veto right on acquisition decisions, and the Steering Committee is a group of experts mandated by the DAO to act in the best interest of the DAO while reviewing the investment decisions of the Unit in the Investment Committee, we propose the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Steering Committee holds a vote to approve all deals and each deal requires a majority vote to be approved.</li>\n<li>For approved deals up to $25M, the Steering Committee has the unilateral right to call for the capital from the Arbitrum DAO treasury that has been earmarked for the M&amp;A Unit.</li>\n<li><strong>For the first 2 deals done by the M&amp;A Mgmt Co. (of any size) there will be additional validation mechanisms put in place to ensure strategic alignment and quality.</strong> Both of these deals will require ratification from the DAO. We propose the use of the Optimistic Governance Module being developed by Axis Advisory and Tally for this purpose, which would function in the following manner:\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>“DAO Steering Committee”</strong> will outline the deal to the DAO as proposed above.</li>\n<li>Delegates have a predetermined amount of time to veto the deal.</li>\n<li>If the deal is not successfully vetoed, the funds will be sent to the <strong>“Arbitrum M&amp;A Mgmt. Co.”</strong> to execute the deal. If the veto is enforced, the M&amp;A Unit will pull out of the deal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For deals &gt;$25M, the <strong>“DAO Steering Committee”</strong> must get ratification from the DAO to go ahead with the deal. To preserve competitive advantage and the privacy of the deal, the Steering Committee will not be able to disclose <em>all</em> aspects of the deal, but will outline the strategic rationale and benefit to the DAO from executing the transaction. Again, we propose the use of the Optimistic Governance Module here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A summary of these rules is below:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Deal Value</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Process</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>All deals</td>\n<td>Reviewed by the Arbitrum DAO Steering Committee.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>First two deals</td>\n<td>Additional validation mechanisms put in place with added veto rights for DAO members.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Up to $25M</td>\n<td>Steering Committee has the unilateral right to call for the capital from the DAO’s treasury.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&gt;$25M</td>\n<td>Steering Committee must get ratification from the DAO via the Optimistic Governance process using the Optimistic Governance Module.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h1><a name=\"v-way-forward-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#v-way-forward-11\"></a>V.

Appendix: M&amp;A Target Areas</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"ma-ideas-for-arbitrum-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ma-ideas-for-arbitrum-19\"></a>M&amp;A Ideas for Arbitrum</h3>\n<p>There are several initial ways in which M&amp;A could act as a key growth driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem (non-exhaustive):</p>\n<p><strong>1. Tech Talent Acqui-Hires</strong></p>\n<p>Acquire or acqui-hire a team and enable them to focus on building tech for (or otherwise servicing) the Arbitrum DAO. The best opportunities are tier-1 tech teams who need distribution.</p>\n<p>There are already examples of this occurring in Web3, one which is close to home for Arbitrum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polygon acquired Mir in Nov 2021 for $400M. Mir’s system generates recursive zero-knowledge proofs which results in one of the fastest and most efficient L2 options (see case study). This transaction presents a compelling narrative for Arbitrum: The founders of the Mir protocol had technically built the best ZK chain, but launching a token would likely have led to failure. Therefore, the acquisition was mutually beneficial.</li>\n<li>Offchain Labs bought Prysmatic Labs, one of the core engineering teams behind the Merge, bringing in 11 new engineering talents to the Offchain Labs team.</li>\n<li>Hadron Labs brought Duality Labs to Neutron, an app-chain on Cosmos, as a core team. Hadron Labs allocated 2.5% of the NTRN supply as a long-term incentives package to current Duality Labs members with a 1-year lock and 3-year linear unlock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other adjacent examples include: Governance tooling that can potentially be scaled and licensed out to other DAOs (e.g., grants management platform, improved governance portal, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>2. Acquire or Strategically Invest in Complementary Infrastructure / Protocols</strong></p>\n<p>Zero-knowledge technology, e.g., could play a large part in Arbitrum’s future and strategic acquisitions / investments could accelerate the realization of this vision. Arbitrum can super-charge its entry into the ZK space by acquiring or investing in pioneers in the ZK space, such as <a href=\"https://www.lagrange.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lagrange</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pantherprotocol.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Panther Protocol</a>, <a href=\"https://herodotus.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Herodotus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ingonyama.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ingonyama</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.supranational.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Supranational</a> (these are just examples for illustrative purposes).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Acquire L2s</strong></p>\n<p>The L2 space is saturated and extremely fragmented at the moment and is only expected to grow in the future. While there are efforts to unify liquidity and enable interoperability across the ecosystem, these will take time to be perfected, and in the meantime, will fragment users and liquidity. With its large treasury, Arbitrum could potentially acquire L2s to unify the ecosystem, grow its user base, and reduce competition and fragmentation in the space.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Acquire Applications as L3s for Arbitrum Orbit</strong></p>\n<p>Arbitrum is a clear leader in the derivatives and DeFi markets and has made great strides in DeFi generally, while there are 50+ projects currently confirmed to be launching as Orbit chains. However, M&amp;A presents the DAO with an opportunity to identify gaps in the types of applications Arbitrum supports and that it thinks present strategically important use cases going forward in the crypto space - these could range from borrowing and lending protocols, PERP DEXs, NFT DEXs, gaming, etc., and would enable the Orbit ecosystem to scale even more rapidly.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c63121dd59320b213a5f83f0dcfe12192af05782.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/shhNSOgUuDe0Vg1uLd6VRwpnTJE.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c63121dd59320b213a5f83f0dcfe12192af05782_2_602x323.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"shhNSOgUuDe0Vg1uLd6VRwpnTJE\" width=\"602\" height=\"323\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c63121dd59320b213a5f83f0dcfe12192af05782_2_602x323.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c63121dd59320b213a5f83f0dcfe12192af05782_2_903x484.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c63121dd59320b213a5f83f0dcfe12192af05782_2_1204x646.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D7DBEC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"target-areas-working-group-exercise-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#target-areas-working-group-exercise-20\"></a>Target Areas Working Group Exercise</h3>\n<p>Throughout the operation of the M&amp;A working group, we conducted an initial exercise to define key themes and identify areas of interest as targets.

Other leading ecosystems have started to explore the opportunity as well (e.g., Uniswap’s former discussion which is not moving ahead at the moment), and Polygon has made M&amp;A a cornerstone of its growth strategy.</p>\n<p>Several market catalysts are converging currently, moreover, to make this an opportune time for Arbitrum to enter the M&amp;A space now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early Industry Maturation: Early consolidation is evident in older verticals as appetite amongst sector incumbents start to scoop up smaller protocols with great growth potential and lots of users.</li>\n<li>Protracted Bear Market Distress: Following years in the bear market, companies bleed through diminishing runway with private placements in web3 drying up, leading to more distressed sales.</li>\n<li>Buy or Build for New Entrants: Traditional companies looking to enter web3 face the decision of whether to build out their blockchain capacities internally or acquire existing web3 companies.</li>\n<li>Regulation &amp; Compliance: Regulatory compliance across fragmented global jurisdictions has become enough of a barrier that many companies are electing to acquire companies with relevant licenses.</li>\n<li>Acquihire: Many expanding web3 and traditional companies choose to acquire specialized talent, especially sought-after web3 developer talent, by buying out existing companies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"case-studies-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#case-studies-24\"></a>Case Studies</h2>\n<p>Several protocols have already experimented with M&amp;A. Although not all of the below have led to sustainable success, the case studies provide good insights into some of the dynamics involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Polygon’s Acquisition of Mir</strong></p>\n<p>Polygon acquired Mir in Nov 2021 for $400M. Mir’s system generates recursive zero-knowledge proofs which results in one of the fastest and most efficient L2 options. This, along with Polygon’s acquisition of Hermez, allowed it to scale its ZK-vision and build solutions like the AggLayer that was recently announced. The acquisition was completely in line with Polygon’s strategy of focusing on ZK cryptography as the end-game for blockchain scaling, and is also emblematic of Polygon’s complimentary buy-and-build strategy:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c3599e8cedf6c6330d0b0d202e44d0e7e4e340fe.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/rS9799hUU9aIK69QmImI1sq1GB8.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c3599e8cedf6c6330d0b0d202e44d0e7e4e340fe_2_602x300.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"rS9799hUU9aIK69QmImI1sq1GB8\" width=\"602\" height=\"300\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c3599e8cedf6c6330d0b0d202e44d0e7e4e340fe_2_602x300.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c3599e8cedf6c6330d0b0d202e44d0e7e4e340fe.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c3599e8cedf6c6330d0b0d202e44d0e7e4e340fe.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DDDFF0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Klaytn &amp; Finschia: The First Blockchain Merger</strong></p>\n<p>Klaytn and Finschia are both large L1s in Asia that recently merged in Feb 2024; their combined market cap is ~$887M, with a combined Web3 community of 410K+ members.

By funding projects with strong fundamentals that have responded well to the DAO council’s insights, it adheres to the LTIPP’s original specifications and timelines.

The LTIPP seeks to address three main issues identified in the Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The excessive burden on delegates.</li>\n<li>The lack of substantial feedback for protocols on their proposals.</li>\n<li>The stringent restrictions on incentive mechanisms.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While the first issue was effectively mitigated through the diligent (and mighty) efforts of advisors and an initial council screening process, the second issue’s underlying causes were not addressed, merely shifted to the screening phase. Consequently, protocols were disqualified from the voting process without the opportunity to incorporate or respond to feedback from the DAO Council.</p>\n<p>The group proposal provides a compelling pathway for including these proposals in the LTIPP voting round.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"protocols-included-and-feedbacks-addressed-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#protocols-included-and-feedbacks-addressed-3\"></a>Protocols Included and Feedbacks addressed</h1>\n<p>The LITPP Council screening round rationale can be found here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LnqTiR8t_crKYDeWEYBILiT0-fuWQVSdNiwrZeIFf2A/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.e6uvha41l4gr\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">LTIPP Council Feedback - Google Docs</a></p>\n<p>Following the guidance from the LTIPP next steps as noted below</p>\n<p><em>“Should the DAO feel an application that was rejected by the council should be funded, any delegate with sufficient voting power (500K ARB) may post a snapshot requesting to fund said applicant just like they would any other DAO proposal.”</em></p>\n<p>Table 1.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Protocol</th>\n<th>Original Proposal Link</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Connext</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/connext-ltipp-application-final/21579\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[Connext] LTIPP Application - FINAL</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D2 Finance</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/d2-finance-ltipp-application-draft-final/21826\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[D2 Finance] LTIPP Application Draft - FINAL</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smilee</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/smilee-finance-ltipp-application-final/21705\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[Smilee Finance] LTIPP Application - FINAL</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Yearn</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/yearn-ltipp-application-final/21528\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Yearn LTIPP Application - FINAL</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"connext-request-417000-arb-prev-540-000-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#connext-request-417000-arb-prev-540-000-4\"></a>Connext - Request 417,000 ARB (prev. 540, 000)</h2>\n<p><strong>Summary of Feedback:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incentives should go more towards users</li>\n<li>Lack of benchmarking with other bridging projects to justify LP requests</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Grant Request Size Modification</strong></p>\n<p>Connext has already brought more than $250m in LRTs to Arbitrum via our innovative Native Restaking Module. We know we are on the right track and want to further push Arbitrum as a lead in this area.</p>\n<p>Our priority remains to attract more users to bridge into Arbitrum and Restake ETH on the L2.</p>\n<p>In order to provide the best experience, we can incentivize users by subsidizing part of the bridging fees, and this will further boost the utilization of our pools which will increase our ETH TVL. Higher TVL enables us to provide the best pricing when the Restaking module is used.</p>\n<p>Incentivizing users to bridge into Arbitrum has 2 benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We can help more users bridge away from mainnet fees, onboarding them permanently onto Arbitrum</li>\n<li>It helps to rebalance the AMM pool, as the restaking activity tends to unbalance the pool in the opposite direction.

Lack of Information on ARB++ Vault Strategy</h3>\n<p><strong>Delegate’s Concern:</strong> Insufficient details were provided on the actual strategy employed by the ARB++ vault.</p>\n<p><strong>D2 Response:</strong> The ARB++ vault employs a strategy that maintains delta exposure ranging from 20% to 60% of ARB, designed to navigate market conditions efficiently while minimizing downside volatility while keeping ARB upside. ARB++ acts as a natural buyer in “market dumps’ ’ hence if ARB++ achieves reasonable TVL, it can work as a shock absorber for the ARB ecosystem.

Concerns Over TVL and Reward Distribution</h3>\n<p><strong>Delegate’s Concern:</strong> The grant size exceeds current TVL and concerns over ARB rewards benefiting a small group of users. Current TVL = $350,000, Original Grant Request 195,000 ARB (~$288,600)</p>\n<p><strong>D2 Response:</strong> The decision to cap TVL in D2 is a deliberate security measure, ensuring the vault’s integrity and performance could be maintained without compromising user assets. This cautious approach reflects D2 Finance’s commitment to security and its strategic plan for controlled growth.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note, this TVL is purposefully capped by D2 Finance until our DAO vote to enable deposits via our front end. This is set to happen prior to LTIPP grant streaming and will facilitate exponential growth of D2 Finance TVL based on current demand and commitments for our products</p>\n<p>D2 will be reducing our request from 195,000 ARB to 100,000 ARB putting the TVL/Grant ask well in line with those protocols who passed the screening round</p>\n<p>That’ said if you compare to claiming ARB concentrations vs <a href=\"https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/claims\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenBlock Labs</a> we have displayed a decent distribution in comparison</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-4-justification-for-requested-grant-size-and-expected-native-yield-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-4-justification-for-requested-grant-size-and-expected-native-yield-10\"></a>4. Justification for Requested Grant Size and Expected Native Yield</h3>\n<p><strong>Delegate’s Concern:</strong> The requested grant size was ambitious, and the expected native yield of the strategy vault wasn’t considered, which could offset the need for the amount of ARB requested.</p>\n<p><strong>D2 Finance Response</strong>: D2 Finance’s approach to generating native yield is deeply rooted in sophisticated active trading strategies, similar to those utilized by market makers and asset management firms. These strategies are inherently subject to market volatility and are designed to capitalize on this volatility to achieve a positive expected value (EV) over the long term. Thus we do not provide estimates on base yield at the start of an epoch; instead, our yield is dynamically generated based on the performance of our active trading strategies.</p>\n<p>The request for a sizable grant from the Arbitrum DAO is timed with the release of the new FE, ensuring that the grant distribution process will be streamlined and accessible to a wider range of users, moving beyond the current limitations of depositing solely through Arbiscan for compliance reasons which required limited TVL up to now. With that friction removed we believe we can have exponential growth, in part facilitated through the grant.</p>\n<p>Such strategic foresight is vital for a growing operation like D2 Finance. The initial phases of our strategy’s implementation play a pivotal role in shaping market perception and bolstering user confidence.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"grant-request-size-modification-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#grant-request-size-modification-11\"></a>Grant Request Size Modification</h3>\n<p>D2 Finance is committed to growth and sustainability within the ecosystem and open to feedback from the council. As such we would amend our grant ask as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Current TVL = $350,000 (<a href=\"https://debank.com/protocols/arb_d2\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeBank | The Web3 Messenger &amp; Best Web3 Portfolio Tracker</a>)</li>\n<li>Its important to note, this TVL is purposefully capped by D2 Finance until our DAO vote to enable deposits via our front end. This is set to happen prior to LTIPP grant streaming and will facilitate exponential growth of D2 Finance TVL based on current demand and commitments for our products</li>\n<li>Therefore we are reducing our request from 195,000 ARB to 100,000 ARB putting the TVL/Grant ask in line with those protocols who passed the screening round</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Outside the periods when the vaults were closed, we observed an organic and accelerating trend in volumes even spread out in different weights between different protocols, which correlates with the available market opportunities.</p>\n<p>Based on a simple regression analysis of historical data, our milestones are not only achievable but also conservative, especially when considering Lyra’s trading volumes, which are not reflected in Dune data.</p>\n<p><strong>Therefore, D2 Finance update our request to 100,000 ARB</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"smilee-finance-request-125000-arb-prev-150000-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#smilee-finance-request-125000-arb-prev-150000-12\"></a>Smilee Finance - Request 125,000 ARB (prev. 150,000)</h2>\n<p><strong>Summary of feedback received (excluding who voted yes):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>GMX: Expresses reservations regarding the proposal due project maturity, performance metrics, and grant size relative to current status.</li>\n<li>KAREL: Suggests resubmitting the proposal in a later grants window with a reduced ask after demonstrating greater traction.</li>\n<li>GFX: Argues against financing fee subsidies to a grantee, citing the finite nature of grants funding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Smilee Protocol launched shortly before the LTIPP application program but lacked a proper tracking tool to demonstrate performance and traction.
