To address this, a pilot fund is proposed, utilizing Questbook’s small grants model to support early-stage initiatives focused on problem definition (root causes, gathering requirements), alignment, and scoping proposals for operational and governance improvements. A collective intelligence exercise will be conducted to inform proposers and the assessor by identifying key problem areas through qualitative surveys and a collective intelligence algorithm, ensuring initiatives are well-aligned with the DAO’s current needs.<br>\nThe pilot fund will prioritize initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO’s operations and governance. An assessor, elected by the DAO, will oversee the proposal assessment, following the established Questbook program rules. The success of this pilot will be measured by the number of initiatives that receive subsequent funding, clarity and alignment generated within the community, and an over 80% approval rate in a Snapshot vote to continue the program.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem:</h1>\n<p>The DAO has multiple challenges but currently needs a way to fund the initial steps of addressing them. As a result, only groups with a lot to win will invest all the necessary time and effort and take the risk to evolve a proposal without being paid.</p>\n<p>Areas like organisation design, strategy, spending plan, and more require not just crafting a proposal but they require problem definition work: significant stakeholder engagement to determine the right approach, understand root causes and requirements, generate buy-in, and craft the right proposal to make. There’s currently no way to fund all this problem definition and preparatory work leading to the DAO advancing slowly, delegates being overwhelmed assessing proposals that don’t quite hit the mark, and meanwhile key decisions and needed proposals don’t happen.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>A method for the DAO to aggregate challenge statements or problems</li>\n<li>A funding program for initiatives that will carry out problem definition and initial solution work on one of the challenge statements.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Questbook has shown to be a viable mechanism for distributing small grants to groups. We propose to use this model and set up a pilot fund to evolve proposals that address key Operational and Governance needs to improve Arbiturm DAO.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’ll carry out a “collective intelligence exercise” to identify the key problem areas.</p>\n<p><strong>What will be funded:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early-stage initiatives ultimately aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO ops and gov</li>\n<li>Priority for funding initiatives that will advance problem definition and alignment around key challenges (previous examples have included M&amp;A pilot, AVI, and multiple PL grants).</li>\n<li>Initiatives funded are expected to last up to 3 months.</li>\n<li>Initiatives can request up to 100k ARB and are recommended to request no more than USD$50k equivalent. (subsequent submissions based on completion of previous proposal will be considered).</li>\n<li>product/protocol development will not be funded (that’s better suited for other Questbook tracks or programs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>** How are proposals assessed:**</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An assessor will be selected by the DAO via an election as conducted for previous Questbook tracks.</li>\n<li>Proposals up to USD $25k can be approved directly by the assessor for this track. Proposals above this amount requires cross-checking with the assessors form other tracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fund governance:</strong></p>\n<p>This track will follow the same rules as the ongoing Questbook program (<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326\">link</a>), whereby funds are held in the multisig operated by the assessors of the multiple Questbook tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Method to Identify problem areas:</strong></p>\n<p>Before opening the fund to proposals, we’ll work with the DAO to identify key problem areas that could then lead to proposals for problem definition and alignment work. This work will be carried by RnDAO.</p>\n<p>Based on Professor Daniel Kahneman’s work, we have selected a collective intelligence method that provides high efficiency (low time involvement required from delegates) and is credibly neutral. The method is based on the use of a qualitative survey of delegates and other stakeholders to collect a list of statements proposing key challenges. The statements are then analysed using a collective intelligence algorithm (SimScore) that identifies a theoretical ‘central’ statement that would be most agreed upon, and then analyses the provided statements to rank them for proximity to said theoretical centre.</p>\n<p>The ranked statements as well as the graph (positioning of statements relative to each other) will then be made publicly available to inform (not mandate, just inform) those proposing initiatives to the pilot fund.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-5\"></a>Timeline:</h1>\n<p>The Pilot is expected to last circa 4 months</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Month 1 for identifying problem areas.</li>\n<li>Month 2-4 for assessing and funding proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-success-look-like-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-does-success-look-like-6\"></a>What does success look like?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Experts in the community can work towards improving Arbiturm DAO.</li>\n<li>The initiatives funded generate clarity, buy-in, and alignment,</li>\n<li>The initiatives funded evolve towards full proposals for the DAO and are funded.</li>\n<li>The delegates love this pilot and want to continue funding it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>KPIs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of initiatives that continued and received subsequent funding</li>\n<li>Over 80% approval in a Snapshot vote asking delegates whether the program should be continued after the pilot</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"budget-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#budget-7\"></a>Budget</h1>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/99e5d840683cc9527d3876a066e1008f72d34f69.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lXruzh2whdnId4DmlZzD3rCEd0R.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 16.48.46\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/99e5d840683cc9527d3876a066e1008f72d34f69_2_690x287.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 16.48.46\" data-base62-sha1=\"lXruzh2whdnId4DmlZzD3rCEd0R\" width=\"690\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/99e5d840683cc9527d3876a066e1008f72d34f69_2_690x287.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/99e5d840683cc9527d3876a066e1008f72d34f69_2_1035x430.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/99e5d840683cc9527d3876a066e1008f72d34f69_2_1380x574.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E5E7EB\"></a></div><p></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/jumpstart-fund-for-dao-improvement/25309\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/jumpstart-fund-for-dao-improvement/25309","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 15:06:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25309"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/jumpstart-fund-for-dao-improvement/25309.rss","#text":"Jumpstart fund for DAO improvement"}},{"title":"GovHack Brussels Submission instructions","dc:creator":"raam","category":"GovHack Brussels","description":"<h1><a name=\"deadline-sunday-7th-915am-cet-brussels-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#deadline-sunday-7th-915am-cet-brussels-1\"></a>Deadline: Sunday 7th @ 9:15am CET (Brussels)</h1>\n<p>Any post or deck with timestamp edits past the deadline will invalidate the submission.</p>\n<p>Pitches will be done as a 2 min recording on <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/\">Loom</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day 3: Judges pick 5 finalists to pitch on Day 3.

Tailor-proof payments and resilience against unauthorized access are guaranteed by blockchain, that distributes information among a network of nodes and uses consensual techniques like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. Smart contracts ensure visible and irreversible processes, and the use of cryptography protects data integrity. The ongoing enhancement of safeguards and procedures is necessary in light of the weaknesses in smart contract technology and the possibility of 51% attacks, regardless of their strengths.</p>\n<p>This blog discusses the core safety features of blockchain networks and assesses how resistant they are to cyberattacks and hacking.</p>\n<p><strong>What Is Blockchain ? and Its Importance</strong></p>\n<p>Blockchain is a decentralized database system that safely records payments. Through saving data throughout a network of computers, it offers safety by rendering it almost impossible to change or hack without the approval of the whole network.</p>\n<p><strong>Importance:</strong> Nowadays, businesses need safety in blockchain due to the safeguards private information and builds confidence between participants without the need for middlemen like banks or authorities.</p>\n<p><strong>Comparing Blockchain Security with Traditional Systems</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Overview of Blockchain Security Features:</strong> Key security elements of the blockchain system include consensus methods for transactional validation, data protection via encrypted hashing, and decentralization—the ability to operate independently of a single institution.</p>\n<p><strong>Comparison with Traditional Systems:</strong> The integrity of blockchain is not like that of conventional systems that are centralized. Because blockchain distributes information over an internet rather than centralized frameworks that depend on one entity, it is more difficult to attack or corrupt.</p>\n<p><strong>Emerging Cyber Threats in Blockchain Security</strong></p>\n<p>Cyber attacks such as 51% attacks, in which an organization gains authority over most of a blockchain’s processing capacity, are prevalent and have the ability to manipulate payments. The act of using the exact same digital currency more than once is known as double-spends. Automatic contract vulnerabilities in code are holes that can be utilized .</p>\n<p>Instances from the real world included attacks such as the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) hack, in which the smart contract’s weakness enabled fifty million dollars to be siphoned off. These events demonstrate how crucial blockchain safety has become.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Measures in Blockchain Networks</strong></p>\n<p>Encryption and Cryptography: Information is safeguarded by cryptography and cryptography processes, which jumble it up so that only those with permission may decipher it. This guarantees the privacy and security of data on blockchain-based systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Consensus Mechanisms:</strong> Safety on networks is maintained through consensus techniques like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, which validate operations and stop fraud. They make it possible for users of the blockchain to concur on a transaction’s legitimacy without depending on a governing body.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract Audits:</strong> Finding and addressing these issues requires smart contract audits. It lessens the possibility of flaws or faults that might be taken advantage of by bad actors and helps guarantee that smart contracts work as planned.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges and Controversies</strong></p>\n<p>The continuing debate is on striking a balance between blockchain networks’ capacity to process massive volumes of operations (scalability) and their ability to provide robust defenses against intrusions and other threats (safety). Administrative Issues: These are problems pertaining to laws and regulations that have an impact on the applications and security of blockchain-based technologies. The design and maintenance of blockchain-based systems might be influenced by legal difficulties.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical Tips for Businesses</strong></p>\n<p>Companies should implement a number of doable strategies to improve <a href=\"https://bidbits.org/blockchain-development-company\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">blockchain development services </a>and protection. Start by selecting a platform for blockchain technology that is trustworthy, safe, and has a lot of safeguarding capabilities. Verify thoroughly that suppliers of services follow strict security guidelines. Detects and remediate problems by conducting routine security audits and assessments. Employee education is essential; teach staff members how to identify malware, create safe passwords, and protect secret keys, among additional best practices for security on the blockchain. Frequently update software and use multiple authentication methods to guard against emerging risks. These actions can help firms greatly strengthen their blockchain safety measures.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-secure-are-blockchain-networks-against-hacking-and-other-cyber-threats/25306\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-secure-are-blockchain-networks-against-hacking-and-other-cyber-threats/25306","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 12:00:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25306"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-secure-are-blockchain-networks-against-hacking-and-other-cyber-threats/25306.rss","#text":"How Secure Are Blockchain Networks Against Hacking And Other Cyber Threats?"}},{"title":"About the GovHack Denver category","dc:creator":"raam","category":"GovHack Denver","description":"<p>(Replace this first paragraph with a brief description of your new category.

Motivation</h2>\n<p>Arbitrum is the leading L2 by all relevant KPIs, including number of protocols, TVL, and daily active address. ArbitrumDAO also has the 3rd <a href=\"https://deepdao.io/organizations\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">largest treasury</a> of any DAOs, but one key difference between Arbitrum and other protocols is the extent of independence and power given to the DAO from its onset.</p>\n<p>Despite having the 3rd largest treasury of any DAOs, the ArbitrumDAO faces three main challenges with its current treasury (refer to VIII. Appendix: Motivations in-Depth):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ensuring long-term sustainability</strong>: treasury should be able to support ecosystem efforts through market cycles; in the long-run, DAO should be a self-sustaining vehicle, with expenses covered by yield generated from Treasury, without having to materially compromise Treasury principal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fostering ecosystem growth</strong>: treasury should be used to foster a vibrant community of users and builders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transparency and accountability</strong>: treasury should be expertly managed, and uses of the treasury should be transparent and held accountable to the DAO.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-working-group/18978\">Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability Working Group</a> and the broader Arbitrum community have previously researched and discussed the issues at depth, and there is a strong consensus that we need a more holistic approach towards managing Arbitrum’s treasury to prevent inefficient decision-making processes and misallocation of resources. Arbitrum’s impressive decentralization is a double-edged sword; the DAO can use its collective intelligence to make the best decisions, but without clear structure and oversight, conflicting opinions and divergent interests may hinder timely and effective resource allocation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ii-expected-outcome-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ii-expected-outcome-4\"></a>II. Expected Outcome</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum Strategic Treasury Management Group aims to allocate assets within the Arbitrum ecosystem to ensure long-term sustainability and foster growth.</p>\n<p>Three main areas of priority would be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Ecosystem alignment and growth. Bolster ecosystem growth by utilizing Arbitrum’s treasury via Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fortress balance sheet. Diversify Arbitrum treasury to build sufficient runway and resiliency to market downturns by reducing long-tail asset exposure. As the DAO is currently spending $97M+ per year, it is ideal to maintain a treasury in excess of $200M.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sustainability. Leverage Arbitrum DAO’s treasury to generate sustainable yields via DeFi lending, staking, and liquidity provisioning. To reach sustainability at current spending levels, the DAO needs to eventually deploy $1.5B, targeting 6-8% APY.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Outcomes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Yield Optimization Program aims to generate sustainable yields to fund the DAO’s operations in a non-custodial and risk-minimized manner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DAO Owned Liquidity Program, with the goal of expanding ecosystem liquidity, attracting builders to Arbitrum, and deepening ARB on-chain liquidity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Treasury Diversification Program, to reduce long-tail asset exposure and capital raising.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"iii-introduction-to-the-arbitrum-strategic-treasury-management-group-and-tooling-providers-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#iii-introduction-to-the-arbitrum-strategic-treasury-management-group-and-tooling-providers-5\"></a>III. Introduction to the Arbitrum Strategic Treasury Management Group and Tooling Providers</h2>\n<p>Initiative of Arbitrum Strategic Treasury Management Group will be led by karpatkey and Aera, combining experience across DAO treasury management and risk management.</p>\n<p><strong>About karpatkey</strong></p>\n<p>karpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in providing financial services to DAOs. Since its inception in 2020, karpatkey has been a trusted partner to respected DAOs like Gnosis, Aave, and ENS, managing over $1bn in non-custodial assets. Through its comprehensive support in treasury management and financial operations, karpatkey empowers its partners to effectively pursue their missions. Leveraging its extensive experience, karpatkey will serve as the treasury manager, designing investment processes to meet the DAO’s goals and constraints.</p>\n<p><strong>About Aera</strong></p>\n<p>Aera is an on-chain solution to autonomously optimize DAO funds. It addresses the common pain point of inactive treasury management that often hinders a DAO’s ability to maintain runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from market growth. Unlike traditional institutions that rely on nimble managers for fund allocation, DAOs face a unique set of challenges that include governance and incentive alignment with external managers. To address these, Aera offers a unified solution for efficiently and transparently managing on-chain treasuries, grants, and incentive funds through customizable vaults. Aera vaults can hold stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies, with their objective functions tailored to each DAO’s needs.

A simple portfolio analysis shows the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Historical daily return of ARB has been -0.11%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Daily standard deviation value of 4.4%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>95% value-at-risk (%) of -7.1% i.e. in any given day, there is 5% chance of portfolio losing 7.1% of its value</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sheer size of the DAO Treasury can give the illusion that spending can be indefinitely funded. During the latest ‘22-’23 bear market, many L1 / L2 tokens saw ~90% drawdowns (e.g. $SOL dropped from $250 at its peak to $10, $AVAX dropped from $125 at its peak to $9). Many had to downsize their operations and some even shut down, but the well-prepared ones were able to continue incentivising and growing the ecosystem, as they managed to raise significant amounts of money (fiat, stablecoin) during the bull market. Although it is only natural that the DAO be wholly invested in the success of the ecosystem, it also needs to ensure prudent risk management, and diversify in order to ensure sustainability over extended periods of market volatility. A standard practice is ensuring 1.5 to 2 years of runway.</p>\n<p>Maintaining runways is even more important in cases of deficit spending, as is the case with ArbitrumDAO. For the year ending February 2024, the DAO had an annual gap of -$61M due to its high annual spend rate on grants and incentives ($97M; also worth noting these numbers do not yet include STIP Bridge and LTIPP) vs. net network revenue of ~$21M. There are a few concomitant problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Reduction in principal of the Treasury.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Large selling pressure in ARB: grantees most likely need stablecoins to fund their operations, and may sell ARB in a non-optimal manner with high(er) price impact. This historically has manifested in two ways:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>a. Protocols receive large grants for incentives (STIP, LTIPP, etc.) to be disbursed at the same time, protocol users look to realize their boosted yield relatively immediately, large amounts of ARB is sold at the same time leading to large amount of selling pressure indiscriminate of market conditions.</p>\n<p>b. Contributors receive grants to cover operations denominated in USD. These contributors often either pay a market maker a large fee to swap the tokens at a set price, take on market risk, or take slippage from selling large amounts of ARB when liquidity is not optimal.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth highlighting that while the DAO has several illiquid initiatives, including <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/catalyze-gaming-ecosystem-growth-on-arbitrum/22368\">Gaming Catalyst Program</a> (passed Tally), <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23205\">M&amp;A Unit</a> (in-discussion), and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-proposal-non-constitutional-establishment-of-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-avi/23222\">Arbitrum Ventures Initiative</a> (in-discussion), there are currently no non-custodial liquid initiatives under way. Traditional web2 companies usually have a much larger deployment to liquid holdings/investments vis-a-vis illiquids, given the need for liquidity and yield generation.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/08da68eb6702b9f6a3ec9872ded67d01e41149dd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1gjLa6axdbGVDVWjl0rnRa9akwd.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/08da68eb6702b9f6a3ec9872ded67d01e41149dd_2_624x221.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1gjLa6axdbGVDVWjl0rnRa9akwd\" width=\"624\" height=\"221\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/08da68eb6702b9f6a3ec9872ded67d01e41149dd_2_624x221.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/08da68eb6702b9f6a3ec9872ded67d01e41149dd_2_936x331.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/08da68eb6702b9f6a3ec9872ded67d01e41149dd_2_1248x442.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E5E4E4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/55444f3c1369986dbbb1a2cc59804ce492e33e42.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/caiW7w29i85eTqTpt4WJPd9RVEC.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/55444f3c1369986dbbb1a2cc59804ce492e33e42.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"caiW7w29i85eTqTpt4WJPd9RVEC\" width=\"624\" height=\"97\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"D8D7D7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Motivation <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2:</span> Fostering the Arbitrum Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>One of Arbitrum’s competitive advantages is its liquidity and reputation as a DeFi-friendly chain.

Architecture for Treasury Management</h2>\n<p><strong>Architecture for Strategic Treasury Management Tooling</strong></p>\n<p>We aim to define and implement a robust architecture for strategic treasury management. This architecture enables non-custodial treasury management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community enabling treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the ArbitrumDAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Safe multi-sig, and treasury deployment aligns with the stipulations of this proposal. Separate proposal, outlining tooling architecture and set of permissions granted to the Strategic Treasury Management, will be put forward to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Safe + Zodiac Roles Modifier Module</strong></p>\n<p>Safe is the account abstraction leader on Ethereum and EVM, and it has the most secure smart wallet infrastructure and platform. It is estimated that 6.3M Safe wallets have been deployed, protecting $91Bn in different crypto assets. ArbitrumDAO has an extensive track record of using Safe accounts for different purposes, spanning from committees to deployers of Arbitrum contracts.</p>\n<p>Zodiac Roles Modifier is a Safe module that allows the owners of an address to grant role-based permissions for specific actions that can only be carried out within approved contracts and functions. The Roles module allows the owner of a Safe (called Avatar) to create a role for a particular address (named Manager) that is then authorised to run specific operations (presets). This module is configurable, allowing full customisation of the target, method, and parameters to be used.</p>\n<p>Through a combination of Safe and Zodiac Module, ownership and custody of the funds do not need to be altered vis-a-vis any previous setup since a Safe can inherit the type of ownership any previous solution had. As a result, the owner of the Safe has complete control, including movements of assets, installing modules, and granting permissions via the Roles Modifier.</p>\n<p>To configure the Roles Modifier, a group of actions called “permissions policy” is configured simultaneously and aggregates all the critical actions needed to manage a specific strategy. For example, to allocate liquidity to a DEX pool, a permissions policy may include approving the transfer of assets, depositing and withdrawing liquidity, and claiming interest. In a single transaction, the Avatar can delegate all future responsibility for managing that specific strategy to a Treasury Manager. For Roles Modifier, an action must have a specified target and method. It may also enforce thresholds and values on the parameters used and limit how often a specific action may be used.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/on-chain-non-custodial-asset-management-infrastructure\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">karpatkey currently uses the Safe and Zodiac Roles Modifier</a> module to manage treasury for DAOs including Gnosis, Aave, ENS and Balancer, as well as its own treasury.</p>\n<p><strong>Aera</strong></p>\n<p>Aera is a solution for optimizing DAO funds autonomously and on-chain. For most DAOs, treasury funds (e.g., reserves, treasuries, safety modules, backstops) are not actively managed or adjusted based on market conditions. For DAOs, this can lead to an inability to maintain runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from growth in the market. Traditional institutions can allocate funds to more nimble managers who make day-to-day decisions, but DAOs face numerous challenges with this model including governance and creating strong incentive alignment with external managers.</p>\n<p>Aera provides DAOs with a one-stop solution for managing onchain treasury, grant, and incentive funds efficiently and transparently. The Aera protocol consists of vaults, which are constructed on a per-protocol basis and can hold a combination of stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies. Each DAO determines the objective function of the vault and is highly customizable ranging from simply keeping fund proportions in line with marketcaps, to sophisticated liquidity strategies to support your ecosystem’s growth. Vaults are automatically rebalanced by Guardians who support the DAO’s objective function leveraging offchain logic to power onchain rebalancing decisions. This ensures that the vault objective is met across a wide range of market scenarios and time horizons.</p>\n<p>Aera integrations include Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Bebop, and other onchain venues.

Yet somehow over the last 15 years, I kept getting pulled into ecosystem development, working around startup ecosystems and venture capital in the EU, UK, and the Global South. I’ve been particularly interested in how DAOs would play their role since a project I did in the space in 2015.</p>\n<p>A big part of the story began between 2006 and 2012, when with different groups of friends we set up the first hacker house, tech conference, university tech entrepreneurship club, and then accelerator in Bulgaria. This naturally connected me with many people in the Bulgarian diaspora, who were returning as the country joined the EU in 2007.</p>\n<p>The was one standout group of Harvard alumni I worked with on economic cluster development, where one of them became a government minister who essentially kickstarted the Bulgarian venture capital scene. With just €200 million of EU funds, we sparked an entire economy.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, as he became the chief economic advisor to the president, I got asked to make a list of people I know around the world that would be helpful for advancing the above agenda. We had the president personally invite them, often calling them himself. We organized a number of small private gatherings at the presidential villa, where key relationships and deals were forged. You can now track many of the success stories and unicorns that came out of that scene in one way or another to conversations that happened there. Many of these people now also shape the European venture capital scene out of Brussels and Luxembourg.</p>\n<p>From what I’ve learned since the last GovHack, I believe one of the most important things for the Arbitrum community is to figure out how to support builders sustainably and long-term, while reducing the financial burden of grant-based programs.</p>\n<p>Recent developments in that conversation have striking similarities to the stories above.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p>While we may not have a presidential villa at GovHack, we do have a venture track, which <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/klausbrave\">@KlausBrave</a> kindly invited me to help lead.</p>\n<p>I can’t help but feel that years from now we might end up looking at this event in a similar way as I do to the gatherings from the above story.</p>\n<p>There’s a great group of tremendously capable and experienced people attending and it would be fantastic to come together, set things in motion, define problem statements, consolidate forces and ideas, and move forward in the most mature way possible.</p>\n<p>Which is precisely why I’m so sad that because of a nasty food poisoning I just had to cancel my trip to Brussels. However <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ana.vc\">@ana.vc</a> will be there and I’m sure she’ll do an even better job in my place.</p>\n<p>Ana-Mariya has been a VC for almost a decade and focused on Web3 exclusively over the last 8 years. She has over 200 deals under her belt and led on over 50 as head of the investment team of Outlier Ventures. She’s been leading <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-proposal-non-constitutional-establishment-of-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-avi/23222\">AVI</a> alongside me since we started at GovHack in Denver a few months ago. I can’t think of a better way to more broadly introduce her to the community.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to reach out and let us know if you have any objectives that Ana or I can help you achieve in Brussels in regards to Arbitrum Venture funds.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/making-an-awesome-ventures-track-at-govhack/25287\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/making-an-awesome-ventures-track-at-govhack/25287","pubDate":"Thu, 04 Jul 2024 09:06:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25287"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/making-an-awesome-ventures-track-at-govhack/25287.rss","#text":"Making an Awesome Ventures Track at GovHack"}},{"title":"Timeswap STIP.B Bi-Weekly Update","dc:creator":"ameeth","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"timeswap-stipb-bi-weekly-report-1-july-3rd-2024-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeswap-stipb-bi-weekly-report-1-july-3rd-2024-1\"></a>Timeswap STIP.B Bi-Weekly Report <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> July 3rd 2024</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-2\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p><strong>ARB Received Last Disbursement:</strong> 33,334 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks:</strong> No distribution yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</strong> No distribution yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract address label <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2AYnjAaQjVOLtvemZpsWoN5sTJEJ8dLqdRDExTBQv_SUeug/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Form 48</a> completed for all addresses:</strong> No. No distribution yet.</p>\n<p><strong>ARB left over:</strong> 200,000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for leftover ARB:</strong> Continue as per original proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives:</strong></p>\n<p>Timeswap has been allocated a total of 200,000 ARB, all to be redistributed to users through interacting with the incentivised pools.

As a result, many community members choose to transfer their token-weighted voting power to representatives (i.e. delegates) whose values align with their own and who are better positioned to make informed decisions for the DAO. By doing so, token holders can ensure their interests are represented without needing to actively track and vote on every proposal.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, delegation allows token holders to passively engage in the governance of the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>It is important to note that:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you delegate, you still retain full ownership of the tokens, but your selected delegate will wield the voting power associated with those tokens</li>\n<li>Even if you have already delegated your voting power, it is worth checking whether or not your delegate is still active.

There are <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum\">~436K delegates</a> who have enabled the DAO to vote on <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/improving-predictability-in-arbitrum-dao-s-operations/25136#motivation-4\">over 280 Snapshot and 30 Tally proposals</a>. However, to further decentralization and diversity, ArbitrumDAO needs to increase its number of active delegates.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today, plenty of new contributors have become paramount in driving the DAO forward. However, many of these recent contributors have little-to-no delegation power and therefore, cannot significantly partake in decision-making. This is because most delegators delegated their voting power soon after the DAO’s inception, and may not have reassessed their delegations since. Additionally, the Arbitrum community has grown over the past year, meaning that many $ARB token holders have a significant amount of voting power that could, potentially, be delegated to active delegates.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, (Re)delegation Week aims to enable these newer and active contributors to step up, make themselves heard, and potentially get more voting power to become more involved in governance.</p>\n<p>The figures below reiterate the importance of (Re)delegation Week.

This is the third and final case study of a three-part series that entails an in-depth analysis of the risk and efficiency of the Arbitrum STIP on three major protocols, the third of which is Pendle Finance.</p>\n<p>As requested by the DAO advocate for the ARDC, L2BEAT, Chaos Labs has been conducting case studies on STIP recipients. This case study provides an in-depth analysis of the Arbitrum STIP program’s impact on Pendle Finance, focusing on its efficiency and associated risks. This analysis is part of a broader series that evaluates the STIP program across three major protocols.</p>\n<p>Following our previous analyses of Vertex and Silo Finance, we now turn our focus to Pendle Finance to provide a comprehensive evaluation of its performance and risk profile.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-3\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>An in-depth, bottom-up analysis of the protocol is essential to comprehensively understand the specific risks and efficiency factors influencing the Pendle STIP allocation. The initial section of this report delves into all pertinent aspects of Pendle Finance’s functionality, providing context and reference.</p>\n<p>Following this, detailed analyses of efficiency and risk are conducted, using the insights gained from the protocol deep-dive as a foundation. This analysis aims to identify all factors that could potentially result in adverse outcomes. These findings are then used to derive positive and negative insights from the Pendle STIP incentive program, which will inform the design of future incentive schemes.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive Amount:</strong> 2m ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive Uses:</strong> Liquidity incentives (55%), trading incentives (40%), Ecosystem integrations (5%)</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Matching:</strong> Yes</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pendle-overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-overview-4\"></a>Pendle Overview</h1>\n<p>Pendle is a permissionless yield-trading protocol where users can execute various yield-management strategies. This is achieved by first wrapping yield-bearing tokens into Standardised Yield (SY) tokens. SY tokens are compatible with the Pendle AMM and can be split into its principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token), respectively. This process is called yield tokenisation and allows both PT and YT to be traded on Pendle’s AMM.</p>\n<p>By creating a yield market in DeFi, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield, enabling users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed yield (e.g. earn fixed yield on stETH)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long yield (e.g. bet on stETH yield going up by purchasing more yield)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Earn more yield without additional risks (e.g. provide liquidity with your stETH)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A mix of the above strategies</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each PT and YT has a maturity date. For PT, you can redeem the full underlying yield-bearing token after this date. For YT, the yield of the yield-bearing token is only accrued up until the maturity date, after which YT has no value.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-liquidity-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-liquidity-5\"></a>Pendle Liquidity</h2>\n<p>Pendle liquidity comes from holders of yield-bearing tokens wrapping and depositing them into AMM pools. These liquidity providers then earn swap fees, PENDLE rewards, and any other incentives on top of the tokens’ native yield. The fixed maturity nature of these pools also means that if LPs keep providing liquidity until maturity, there will be no impermanent loss, and they will receive their initial tokens back along with the additional yield.</p>\n<p>During the STIP, Pendle launched an Order Book system alongside its AMM to enable peer-to-peer trading of PT and YT. This allows users to place limit orders to buy or sell at a specified implied APY.</p>\n<p>Together, the Order Book and AMM enhance market liquidity, facilitating smoother trading on Pendle.</p>\n<p>The total liquidity in a pool impacts slippage and is therefore crucial for user experience and seamlessly offering the use cases users desire.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-trading-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-trading-6\"></a>Pendle Trading</h2>\n<p>Liquidity pools in Pendle V2 are set up as PT/SY, e.g. PT-aUSDC / SY-aUSDC. Swapping PT is a straightforward process of swapping between the two assets in the pool, while swapping YT is enabled via flash swaps in the same pool.</p>\n<p>Flash swaps are possible due to the relationship between PT and YT. As PT and YT can be minted from and redeemed to its underlying SY, we can express the price relationship:</p>\n<p>P(PT) + P(YT) = P(Underlying)​</p>\n<p>Knowing that YT price has an inverted correlation against PT price, we use this price relationship to utilise the PT/SY pool for YT swaps.</p>\n<p>Traders on Pendle obtain SY tokens by depositing yield-bearing tokens, and swap them to gain exposure to the token of their choice. As yields change they then have the option to trade further to alter their exposures.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-yield-token-integrations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-yield-token-integrations-7\"></a>Pendle Yield Token Integrations</h2>\n<p>A key feature of Pendle’s principal and yield tokens is their ability to support strategies that create specific exposures for users, enabled by ecosystem integrations with other protocols. Pendle offered incentives for depositing PT or LP positions into specific pools on other protocols to foster the broader ecosystem, liquidity, and trading activity. This initiative began in Week 5 of the program and was adjusted based on general market sentiment.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"use-of-incentives-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#use-of-incentives-8\"></a>Use of Incentives</h1>\n<p>The objectives for the STIP, as stated by Pendle, were:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Increasing yield trading volume, inciting activity on the platform, deepening liquidity on existing pools as well as an additional incentive for users to bootstrap liquidity for newly listed Pendle markets Arbitrum, and finally to encourage activity on protocols built on top of Pendle.</strong></em></p>\n<p>This was implemented by allocating 55% of incentives towards liquidity providers on Pendle, 40% towards trading incentives, and 5% to ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidity-incentives-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquidity-incentives-9\"></a>Liquidity Incentives:</h2>\n<p>Slightly over half of the total incentives were allocated to boosting additional yield for LPs, aiming to encourage deeper liquidity and reduce slippage on Pendle.</p>\n<p>Initially, Pendle distributed liquidity incentives based on vePENDLE votes for Arbitrum pools. However, this approach soon proved suboptimal as the incentives were neither distributed broadly nor targeted at the most active markets or new markets needing support. Starting from week 3, the Pendle team took over the allocations, using metrics such as the most active yield markets and new pools requiring initial liquidity. Additionally, there was significant experimentation and iteration in the weekly allocations.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows the evolution of weekly incentives by category. Over the course of the STIP, incentives were redirected from LST and derivative LP markets to lending, LRT, and Silo Pendle LP markets in response to market interest.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/clqSs4QQ4Dd0xdDuTrwCBxI4npy.png?dl=1\" title=\"The Evolution of Pendle Weekly Incentives by Category\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_690x439.png\" alt=\"The Evolution of Pendle Weekly Incentives by Category\" data-base62-sha1=\"clqSs4QQ4Dd0xdDuTrwCBxI4npy\" width=\"690\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_690x439.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_1035x658.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_1380x878.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"222729\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"trading-incentives-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trading-incentives-10\"></a><strong>Trading Incentives</strong>:</h2>\n<p>Trading incentives were designed as campaigns targeted at increasing trading activity on Pendle. The initial STIP application suggested that there would be “at least one campaign per month will be done to keep things fresh and to entice users to keep trying out the campaigns.” Over the course of the STIP, the following campaigns were conducted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Swap fee rebates:</strong> This campaign refunded a portion of traders’ swap fees with ARB tokens. The rebate was set below 100% to ensure wash trading remained unprofitable, starting at 75% and reducing to 50% in week 9. This campaign ran for the entire duration of the STIP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trading leaderboard with prizes for the most successful traders:</strong> An in-app leaderboard showcased the top-ranked users based on percentage gain. These top performers received ARB rewards to stimulate more trading volume and TVL. Performance-based prizes also incentivized traders to improve their strategies, aiding in long-term retention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Supercharged swap fee rebates:</strong> For a limited time, certain pools had their swap fee rebates increased to 120% to further incentivize trading activity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Maker incentives to promote the new limit order book feature:</strong> Rewards were provided for using Pendle’s newly launched limit order feature. Filled limit orders earned ARB rewards proportional to the order size, drawing attention to this innovation. Pendle’s limit orders were initially launched on Arbitrum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"ecosystem-incentives-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ecosystem-incentives-11\"></a>Ecosystem Incentives:</h2>\n<p>Ecosystem incentives were designed to integrate Pendle tokens further into the broader DeFi ecosystem by encouraging their use on partner protocols. Large lending pools that accepted Pendle LP or PT tokens as collateral received ARB incentives to boost their usage. The incentivized protocols included Stella, Dolomite, Timeswap, Silo, and Teller.</p>\n<p>Similar to the liquidity incentives, the focus of these incentives evolved throughout the STIP. Notably, in February 2024, the incentives shifted to emphasize leveraged strategies using LRT PT tokens, aligning with the development of these markets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pendle-incentives-impact-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-incentives-impact-12\"></a>Pendle Incentives Impact</h1>\n<p>The objective of this impact assessment is to evaluate the effects of the incentive program on protocol activity, specifically examining the demand for holding Pendle PT and YT tokens, trading activity and liquidity provision on Pendle’s AMM. This detailed, bottom-up analysis scrutinizes individual components of the STIP, which are unique to Pendle. This allows a clear prescription of how the results of the program were obtained and how this could be applied to other protocols. The unique nature of the Pendle protocol makes direct comparison impossible, but important incentive principles can be gleaned from their program strategy.</p>\n<p>Despite the STIP program’s short-term nature, this report assesses its prolonged benefits by analyzing protocol usage data following the program’s conclusion. The intention is to identify persistent activity changes and what drove them.</p>\n<p>Pendle accepts deposits of yield-bearing assets, wraps these into standardized yield (SY) tokens, and splits these into Principal (PT) and yield (YT) tokens. These PT and YT tokens are then bought and sold on the Pendle AMM, with Arbitrum end users primarily leveraging their PT positions or holding YT for yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the impact analysis will focus on the effects of the incentives on the growth of the supply of yield-bearing assets available for trading (the supply side), the growth in the trading of Pendle yield tokens (trading activity), and the growth of ecosystem TVL.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of Pendle’s incentives is thoroughly examined across various dimensions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How did the incentives affect the supply of yield-bearing assets by LPs?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did the incentives affect trading activity on the Pendle AMM?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Did they attract new users?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect retention?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect the average volume per user?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect the ecosystem growth of Pendle tokens?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of the incentives is also analyzed to gain insight into the structural efficiency of this program.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidity-provider-reactions-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquidity-provider-reactions-13\"></a>Liquidity Provider Reactions</h2>\n<p>Liquidity from AMM LPs on Pendle grew from $52 million to $723 million over the STIP period. Most of this growth occurred between February and March 2024, driven by points programs on Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) that were ideally suited to Pendle’s products. The increase in LRT TVL during this period was clearly due to the demand for Pendle’s offerings, although this growth on Arbitrum was positively affected by the STIP use.</p>\n<p>Pendle’s focus on Arbitrum during this time, enhanced by STIP incentives, brought significant LRT TVL to Arbitrum and added considerable value to the chain. Without these incentives, LRT strategies on Pendle Arbitrum would have been less attractive, and the supply may not have grown as it did. It is also important to highlight how the attention flywheel established Arbitrum as a prominent hub for leveraged LRT strategies, with the incentives having a highly asymmetric effect on its success.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xv2DDOkfOfXXLlEyXl8txLNT5Bv.png?dl=1\" title=\"Total Pendle LP Supply\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_690x429.png\" alt=\"Total Pendle LP Supply\" data-base62-sha1=\"xv2DDOkfOfXXLlEyXl8txLNT5Bv\" width=\"690\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_690x429.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_1035x643.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_1380x858.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"192632\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The aggressive growth observed after the launch of LRTs overshadows the performance during the first three months of the STIP.

Most of this growth occurred within the first six weeks of the STIP, before the launch of ecosystem incentives. It remains unclear whether these alternative avenues for accessing STIP rewards competed with LP supplies or if an equilibrium was reached between demand and supply, making the timing coincidental.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1hGuOpRJX8kjTIvRfzUWhhXzoNN.png?dl=1\" title=\"LP Supply up to the end of January 2024.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_690x421.png\" alt=\"LP Supply up to the end of January 2024.\" data-base62-sha1=\"1hGuOpRJX8kjTIvRfzUWhhXzoNN\" width=\"690\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_690x421.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_1035x631.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_1380x842.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"15334F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"trading-activity-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trading-activity-14\"></a>Trading Activity</h2>\n<p>These metrics focus on Pendle’s AMM activity.

Liquidity providers in incentivized pools received incremental yield in the form of ARB tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Growing The Protocol Through Incentivized Integrations</strong></p>\n<p>This was an important focus area for Pendle, unlocking incremental utility for its yield tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Iterating and Experimenting</strong></p>\n<p>Pendle aggressively experimented and culled underperforming strategies on a fortnightly basis using market data.</p>\n<p>Some positive examples included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The focused but aggressive iteration in liquidity pools incentivized. Pendle targeted incentives aimed at increasing activity where the market was at almost every week. This enabled hypergrowth in LRT markets in February, almost since launch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Iteration in ecosystem incentives, resulting in the highly productive growth in Silo pools, offering leverage and growing YT token utility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experiments in trading campaigns.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-incentive-potential-improvements-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-incentive-potential-improvements-26\"></a>Pendle Incentive Potential Improvements</h2>\n<p><strong>Grow the Rate of New User Acquisition As Well As TVL and Activity</strong></p>\n<p>For most of the STIP Pendle active users, there was little change from the prior period. While it is true that volumes increased significantly, growing the user base along with overall volumes and TVL could have great long-term benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Pendle Ecosystem Integrations on Dolomite and Timeswap GLP, wstETH and rETH Markets Had a Poor ROI while Continuing Receiving Incentives</strong></p>\n<p>Dolomite rETH and GLP markets received 31 500 ARB over 14 weeks during the STIP, but only grew to a combined $345k in TVL. Timeswap GLP received 10,000 ARB and only grew to $485k. Both of these pools continued receiving incentives despite poor ROI, and these incentives could have likely been better used in alternative ways.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pendle-stip-useful-resources-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-stip-useful-resources-27\"></a>Pendle STIP Useful Resources</h1>\n<p><strong>Application:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pendle-final-stip-round-1/17234\">STIP Application</a></p>\n<p><strong>Bi-weekly updates:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pendle-stip-program-updates/19609/3\">Forum Thread</a></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-3-pendle-finance/25254\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-3-pendle-finance/25254","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 23:33:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25254"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-3-pendle-finance/25254.rss","#text":"STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Case Study #3: Pendle Finance"}},{"title":"Balancer DAO Bi-Weekly Update July 1st 2024","dc:creator":"zen_dragon","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p><strong>ARB Received Last Disbursement:</strong> Week 0:  <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xadb30d1960b5356bb328ad9beafc13aee1b33b313aa8f46edd10e9268c499131\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">100,000</a></p>\n<p><strong>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks:</strong> 50,000</p>\n<p><strong>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pool Symbol</th>\n<th>Gauge Address</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ETHx/wstETH</td>\n<td>0x8f57378CaD866a46eA702B7ACAEBF21dd93B4804</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rsETH/wETH</td>\n<td>0x59907f88C360D576Aa38dba84F26578367F96b6C</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cbETH/rETH/wstETH</td>\n<td>0x5a0e92a55800BB5bFd5ec6C7340BfdE7f0947c3E</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ECLP-weETH-wstETH</td>\n<td>0xdB66fFFf713B1FA758E348e69E2f2e24595111cF</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ECLP-AUSDC-AUSDT</td>\n<td>0x2b52a321Fc2ab77e9fC8488D792BB3CaEA966c0b</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rETH/wETH BPT</td>\n<td>0x8ba2D53F34159C5C5e7add60B56C7dE3BBc1DA68</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sFRAX/4POOL</td>\n<td>0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ezETH/wstETH</td>\n<td>0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ankrETH/wstETH-BPT</td>\n<td>0xfC745035F31BCbaEb2D1a89aA9171495c671F6cE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wstETH/sfrxETH</td>\n<td>0x06eaf7bAabEac962301eE21296e711B3052F2c0d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ECLP-WOETH-WETH</td>\n<td>0x40e86216712cB9871B9C698EA3AFB22f88c00E6e</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wstETH-WETH</td>\n<td>0x260cbb867359a1084eC97de4157d06ca74e89415</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ECLP-wstETH-WETH</td>\n<td>0x96d7C70c80518Ee189CB6ba672FbD22E4fDD9c19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>instETH/wstETH</td>\n<td>0xb072496eEf1F88a2Bd1BA93F880c7ed685264EB1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>inETH/wstETH</td>\n<td>0x2dEafe52b0bCb9801d3aaDc0D75c7879cB2E5825</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Contract address label <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2AYnjAaQjVOLtvemZpsWoN5sTJEJ8dLqdRDExTBQv_SUeug/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Form </a> completed for all addresses:</strong> Yes</p>\n<p><strong>ARB left over:</strong> 550,000 for total grant</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for leftover ARB:</strong> As the leftover ARB is claimed we will be streaming the ARB on our liquidity pool gauges in order to incentivize strong LST/LRT and yield bearing stable coin liquidity on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives:</strong> Balancer’s ARB incentives plan is based upon the direction of BAL to the gauges we already have on Arbitrum, which is then amplifying the most profitable pools for LPs in terms of yield and fees accrued.

The primary goal of our work is to help Arbitrum DAO continue its path toward efficient and effective operations and execute its long-term vision of becoming a sustainable entity with diversified revenue streams. We believe that over the coming years, Arbitrum DAO has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year while maintaining its status as the leading Ethereum scaling solution with an ever-growing base of users and developers.

Despite our belief that Arbitrum holds a strong position in the market today, there is a lot of work to be done over the next 3-5 years to ensure Arbitrum maintains and advances its position. We have diagnosed some key areas in need of improvement that we feel well suited to take on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Designing, drafting and executing proposals that benefit Arbitrum.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Strengthening overall governance processes and providing feedback to other DAO contributors, unlocking efficiencies and ensuring redundant work is avoided.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Acting as a mesh layer between key stakeholders, e.g., active delegates, development teams such as Offchain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Helping potential 3rd party strategic partners navigate the DAO to attract high-quality companies and individuals within the ecosystem and RFP applicant pools.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Attracting/retaining top talent working full-time, professionally on behalf of Arbitrum DAO.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Improving the ability of the DAO to spend money effectively and support a long term sustainable future for Arbitrum.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Today the Arbitrum DAO faces friction executing across all of the aforementioned tasks. Many times those creating proposals have known or unknown ulterior motives and incentives at play. It is difficult for aspiring contributors and partners to navigate the DAO. No one is incentivized to bolster RFP applicant pools. Communication is fragmented with no entity in place to tie perspectives together, and operations/goals often overlap across initiatives. There are numerous proposals that are consensus to move forward but do not progress because there is no financial incentive to do so. There is inadequate accountability over and transparency into DAO funded programs. The problems are ever-evolving and growing, and the Arbitrum DAO needs an entity that only has the DAO’s best interests in mind to fill the gaps.</p>\n<p>Our team (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/swmartin19\">@swmartin19</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/mattonchain\">@mattonchain</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/pruitt\">@pruitt</a>) brings an extensive network as well as experience in research, governance, brand building, and project management to the Arbitrum DAO, having led well-known brands in the space such as Blockworks Research and 404 DAO. We have all been involved in the DAO since the beginning, starting with Blockworks Research’s entry into the DAO by <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-1-arbitrum-improvement-proposal-framework/30/91\">highlighting flaws</a> in the DAO’s very first proposal, AIP-1. We are not afraid to push against the status quo if we believe it helps Arbitrum achieve its goals.</p>\n<p>Entropy Advisors was extremely fortunate to receive a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation. As such, we have been able to use the past few months contributing full-time to Arbitrum DAO to further showcase our value in the community. We have hosted bi-weekly 1-on-1 calls with a cohort of large delegates, with the foundation, and with OCL, and feel that we have a strong hold on various stakeholder’s interests, strategic goals for Arbitrum, working initiatives, etc. When paired with our experience and networks within the industry, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help Arbitrum achieve its long-term goals with all stakeholder perspectives in mind. With exclusivity meaning no official or unofficial engagements with any other client, Entropy Advisors can serve Arbitrum DAO with no ulterior motives or conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Today, virtually no money is spent on operations, while the DAO has spent almost 435M ARB in total with ~95% going towards investments, incentives, and grants (Source: Delphi &amp; R3gen). We believe it is absolutely imperative for the DAO to make an investment in operations, simultaneously ensuring different initiatives across the ecosystem can be set in motion swiftly, fit together seamlessly, and can reach the best talent, while the DAO’s expenditures can be managed in a way that enables long-term sustainability. It is evident that this is becoming a wider-reaching theme within the DAO, but requires a heavy lift (see <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737\">OpCo</a> proposal from <span class=\"mention\">@dkpremia</span> that asks for 25M ARB). We are NOT looking to replace OpCo, but rather drastically reduce the scope and funding request by helping formulate operational procedures until the OpCo is formally stood up. At that point, the DAO can decide what role Entropy Advisors plays as a service provider to the OpCo.</p>\n<p>With the budget as outlined, Entropy will be able to hire up to 10 employees with a diverse range of skill sets including governance, data analytics, marketing, and development/engineering. We will be able to hire top talent in our industry who will dedicate their full-time bandwidth to Arbitrum DAO. Regardless of Arbitrum’s current strategic priorities, whether cutting costs or scaling strategies, our team will work to execute the goals of the DAO. Given Arbitrum’s dominance, size, and number of initiatives it is important that we build a well-rounded team at Entropy that can operate as the tip of the spear as a catalyst for change across the many sectors that the DAO operates.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"entropys-portfolio-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#entropys-portfolio-5\"></a>Entropy’s Portfolio</h1>\n<p>At the beginning of May, we <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-print-hello-world/23675/9\">introduced</a> Entropy Advisors to the Arbitrum DAO.

The partnership will begin on the first of the month after this proposal passes. During this time, Entropy will service no other clients in any capacity. We will achieve the aforementioned goals through the following deliverables:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposals-as-a-service-paas-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposals-as-a-service-paas-7\"></a><strong>Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Neutral Proposal Broker\n<ul>\n<li>Hold introductory strategy meetings with key Arbitrum stakeholders and partners to help them navigate the DAO.

This involved acting as a neutral party to broker proposals, aligning stakeholders, attracting talent, and improving strategic partner onboarding and stakeholder relations. Our initial efforts have already demonstrated notable progress in a short time period, setting the stage for a more capable DAO.</p>\n<p>During Phase 1 we identified how Entropy fits into the broader DAO, and how we can be most useful. This involved lessons learned in passing proposals, project management, and working with new and existing partners. Additionally, we took this time to start building relationships with all of the DAO’s most active stakeholders including many delegates, members of the foundation, protocol teams, and key individuals at Offchain Labs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"this-proposal-phase-2-passing-a-dao-proposal-for-one-year-of-continued-work-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#this-proposal-phase-2-passing-a-dao-proposal-for-one-year-of-continued-work-11\"></a>[This Proposal] Phase 2: Passing a DAO Proposal For One Year of Continued Work.</h3>\n<p>Over the next year, we will build on the foundations we have established, aiming to make the Arbitrum DAO an efficient and effective community dedicated to long-term sustainability through the points brought up in the Motivation &amp; Rationale section.</p>\n<p>We will enhance governance processes by ensuring the initiatives we develop and implement focus on accountability. By fostering stronger relationships between key stakeholders we will ensure more cohesive collaboration. Through data, quantitative, and qualitative analysis we will begin to analyze active initiatives and propose clawbacks and other mechanisms to decrease DAO spend to focus its budget on high ROI initiatives.</p>\n<p>Leveraging our extensive network, we will secure partnerships that bring value to the DAO, enhancing the overall ecosystem. Additionally, we will pick up small lift brand and marketing campaigns to help bring awareness to DAO initiatives. We will continue to attract and retain high-quality contributors by offering competitive compensation, professional development opportunities, and a collaborative work environment.</p>\n<p>Through strategic projects, such as well-thought-out economic stimulation, we will support the DAO in generating sustainable revenue streams. Our proposal includes an agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation so that if the OpCo is stood up in the next year, we can easily port our agreement to fall under its purview instead of the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"phase-3-a-well-oiled-machine-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#phase-3-a-well-oiled-machine-12\"></a>Phase 3: A Well-Oiled Machine</h3>\n<p>In Phase 3, we envision Entropy Advisors as a well-oiled machine, seamlessly servicing the Arbitrum DAO. Entropy will grow together with the ecosystem, continuing to perfect the deliverables mentioned earlier while looking for areas where we can add value. By this stage, we will have employed and retained top talent, creating an environment where the DAO operates at peak efficiency. Our efforts will help position Arbitrum as the clear-cut leader in the rollup ecosystem, driving innovation, growth, and success.</p>\n<p>At this point OpCo should be well underway and Entropy Advisors will continue to serve as a service provider to OpCo, if viewed as beneficial. The DAO will be able to retain a second year of Entropy’s services under the same terms stipulated in this proposal, if it desires to do so. For this second-year engagement clause to be executed in the future, the DAO will also need to vote in favor of the future bonus proposal discussed below. If the OpCo is stood up, this entity can be responsible for the potential renewal in place of a DAO vote. This structure would come into effect at the end of our initial 1-year term.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"cost-budget-breakdown-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#cost-budget-breakdown-13\"></a>Cost &amp; Budget Breakdown</h1>\n<p><strong>Salaries: $1.96M</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: According to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGkU4uF_Lz5Y_qiOaimLAVxYdy9JfEn3DfIraJCUY0E/edit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Delphi</a>, a VC analyst (the lowest level employee) makes $85,000-$160,000 + a carry with more senior positions making significantly more. Employees cost an employer substantially more than base salary due to benefits, taxes, and other assorted costs. This ensures competitive compensation to attract and retain top talent, with our goal being to hire up to 10 employees. Additionally, we will be able to hire independent contractors and service providers on a project-by-project basis as needed. We are doing highly specialized work, and obtaining experienced individuals in the middle of a bull market with extensive experience in operations, project management, finance, and governance that are also crypto native will be expensive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Legal, Insurance, and Accounting: $90K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Covers necessary legal, insurance, and accounting services to ensure compliance and protect the organization. As a company operating in a forward-facing role in the governance space, a sufficient budget is necessary to protect against changing tides in the regulatory environment. Costs include setting up a Cayman Entity, D&amp;O + E&amp;O insurance, accountant’s hours, ESOP, employee agreement reviews, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conference Travel, Offsites, and Small Events: $105K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: It is important that Entropy represent Arbitrum DAO at industry leading events. Hosting our own small events is important for brand building. Offsites and conferences can cost as much as $5,000 per employee in attendance. Even throwing a small “Happy Hour” type event can cost between $5,000 and $15,000. This enables Entropy members to attend industry conferences, conduct 1-2 offsites per year, and host 1-2 small events to foster team collaboration and engagement with the community. All while representing Arbitrum DAO in a professional manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Assorted Software: $21K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Enterprise Dune, Gusto, QuickBooks, Replit, Google Suite, Web Hosting, Laevitas, Token Terminal, Open AI API, Slack, etc. Provides essential tools and platforms for data analysis, development, operations, and communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Brand and Marketing: $80K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Invests in brand building and marketing efforts to enhance the visibility and reach of the Arbitrum DAO. Though it is a small budget and the DAO should still explore other avenues for marketing, it will allow us to do the bare minimum of promoting Twitter/X threads, building websites, and other brand building mechanisms of this nature. Launching a high-quality podcast can also incur significant costs. Our existing familiarity with Arbitrum’s methods of information dispersion allow us to lean into brand and marketing in an optimal manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Office / Misc: $70K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Covers expenses for coworking spaces, office equipment (laptops, podcast materials, office stipend), dinner stipend for late nights, and other miscellaneous costs to support a productive work environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Operating Budget Subtotal: $2.326M</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Margin / Contingency (~20%): $465K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Provides a buffer for unforeseen expenses and ensures the project’s smooth progression and some potential profit for the company over year 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"total-budget-2791m-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#total-budget-2791m-14\"></a>Total Budget: $2.791M</h3>\n<h2><a name=\"payment-details-and-clawback-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#payment-details-and-clawback-15\"></a>Payment Details and Clawback</h2>\n<p>While the Entropy team scales, they will draw a reduced $100,000 per month and after crossing the threshold of 7 employees dedicated to Arbitrum, will start receiving regular monthly payments ($2,791,000/12 = $232583) for the remainder of the 12 month term.</p>\n<p>A total of 6 million ARB will be sent to the Foundation, for them to monetize at their discretion to secure at least $2,791,000. Any Excess ARB not monetized (or stored for the potential bonus below) and excess stables from lower payments during the initial scaling of Entropy will be sent back to the DAO by the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"termination-and-clawback-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#termination-and-clawback-16\"></a>Termination and Clawback</h3>\n<p>The DAO may vote via Snapshot to terminate Arbitrum’s relationship with Entropy Advisors at any time. Quorum for this proposal will be set at the same level as ongoing non-constitutional onchain proposals, with quorum defined as total votes for termination+abstention, and the proposal must have more voting power in favor of termination than against or abstaining. If the Snapshot proposal passes, the DAO can terminate the agreement with Entropy Advisors, effective on the last day of the month in which the Snapshot passes, effectively stopping any future payment at that moment. In this scenario, all funds earmarked for Entropy Advisors will be returned to the DAO by the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-15m-arb-bonus-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-15m-arb-bonus-17\"></a>1.5M ARB Bonus</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will hold 1.5 million ARB allocated to potential performance bonuses. As the 1-year period comes to a close, Entropy will post a Snapshot vote so that the DAO may decide if the bonus should be distributed. The DAO will have the options of no bonus, 500k ARB bonus, 1M ARB bonus, or full 1.5M ARB allocation. If the proposal passes, the Foundation will send the X (TBD number) ARB to a 3-year vesting smart contract that pays out to Entropy Advisors in monthly streams. This ensures Entropy Advisors remains aligned with the DAO and ARB token even after this agreement has expired and as we move into Phase 3 and onward.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"return-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#return-18\"></a>Return</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will send all funds in excess of – $2,791,000 + 1.5 million ARB – back to the DAO. At the end of the year, any additional dollars resulting from months where Entropy receives $100,000 instead of the full allocation, and remainder from 1.5M ARB if the full bonus is not allocated, will also be returned.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"our-vision-is-to-turn-arbitrum-into-a-sustainable-entity-with-durable-operations-in-place-entropy-will-be-the-spearhead-of-catalyzing-operational-change-and-leave-long-lasting-structure-in-its-wake-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#our-vision-is-to-turn-arbitrum-into-a-sustainable-entity-with-durable-operations-in-place-entropy-will-be-the-spearhead-of-catalyzing-operational-change-and-leave-long-lasting-structure-in-its-wake-19\"></a>Our vision is to turn Arbitrum into a sustainable entity with durable operations in place.

So far, the weekly amounts of ARB being distributed amount to less than the total budget. This is on purpose:</p>\n<p>As highlighted in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-gains-network-stip-addendum/23398/1\">Addendum</a>, Gains Network will utilize a large part of its LP incentives budget to bootstrap more (sticky) liquidity for the <a href=\"https://gains.trade/vaults/gUSDC\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gUSDC</a> vault as it’s anticipating more USDC-collateral usage over the coming months. Initially, the focus will be on building liquidity on third-party DEXs for gUSDC/USDC pools. This strategy aims to unlock various partnership opportunities, creating an ecosystem around gUSDC through lending markets, LP-strategy protocols, and more.</p>\n<p>Once the necessary requirements for these DEX pools are met and gUSDC price feeds are established, there will be potential for new partnerships. These new pools and contracts will be incentivized using the current surplus. Any new partnerships and corresponding incentives will be detailed in future bi-weekly reports.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GCGP Program [total budget = 112.5k for the entire program]</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-gains-network-stip-addendum/23398/1\">Addendum</a>, Gains Network is also organizing a “<a href=\"https://x.com/GainsNetwork_io/status/1803472036603502853\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gains Community Grants Program (GCGP)</a>” using 5% of its STIP.B budget to incentivize projects and builders to build on top gTrade contracts.</p>\n<p>This is a first step to Gains Network transitioning into a DAO where GNS voters will decide how the ARB budget for the GCGP should be allocated. A committee of selected Gains Network team members, community members and contributors was formed to provide applicants with constructive feedback, ensuring their proposals align with STIP guidelines and GCGP rules.
