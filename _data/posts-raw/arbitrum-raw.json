Here’s a summary of some of the key takeaways:</p>\n<p><strong>STIP incentives were highly effective at increasing primary KPIs.</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to the STIP, Notional on Arbitrum had ~$1.5M in TVL and ~$3M borrowed. Notional’s STIP incentives greatly catalyzed the growth of these metrics. At peak, Notional’s TVL grew to over $20M and the amount borrowed grew to over $60M.</p>\n<p><strong>STIP incentives drove attention to leveraged liquidity and away from leveraged vaults.</strong></p>\n<p>In our original STIP application, we put 100% of our incentives on providing fixed rate liquidity on Notional. This created a lot of fixed rate liquidity. But it had the side effect of taking attention away from Notional’s core leveraged vault products which borrow from Notional and deploy capital into external protocols to earn yield. The end result was that users focused much more on providing fixed rate liquidity than on utilizing fixed rate liquidity through Notional’s leveraged vault products.</p>\n<p>We think this end result suggests that it would be better to distribute incentives more equally between providing fixed rate liquidity on Notional vs. using leveraged vaults.</p>\n<p><strong>Leveraged liquidity user retention was not great.</strong></p>\n<p>We split Notional users into three groups: depositors (only supplied capital, didn’t borrow), leveraged liquidity users, and borrowers (posted collateral on Notional to borrow against it). We found that the retention among depositors and borrowers was much higher than for leveraged liquidity users.</p>\n<p>We think that this is another reason to tweak our incentive distribution method for the STIP Bridge. By directing some of the incentives away from providing fixed rate liquidity and toward different products, we think we can achieve greater retention and more sustainable protocol growth after the conclusion of the STIP Bridge.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>250,000 ARB (50% of original grant)</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

My primary piece of feedback for the application process was that it would have been good to have more contact with delegates while we were drafting our STIP application. This would have helped us better understand whether our request was in line with delegates’ expectations and whether there was anything we could change which would have made our application more attractive. The DAO has already responded to this feedback by adding the adviser role in the application process which I think will help a lot.</p>\n<p>With respect to the actual execution of the grant, we could use more help with distribution and discoverability. If the Foundation or DAO were able to help channel attention to different projects that have received grants or make it easier for users to find different opportunities that would be very beneficial. During the STIP Backfund, we did this with some other projects by using a Layer3 campaign. But if Arbitrum itself were able to lend some of its weight to initiatives like this it would be very impactful for grantees.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n

Stake DAO strategies were leading to short term TVL increase and new TVL mainly coming from somewhere else on Arbitrum. We therefore focused our deployment of the grant on bringing products from Ethereum to Arbitrum, to make sure that people had to bridge and add value to Arbitrum if they want to benefit it, while having no reason to go back to mainnet when the incentives will stop. We believe that this is the best way to convert this short term incentive plan into long term added value for Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a><strong>New Plans for STIP Bridge</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The overall idea will stay the same, but we will focus on bringing long term value added to Arbitrum by focusing on bringing mainnet products on Arbitrum, and limiting the basic liquidity mining rewards. We will increase the number of services and options for users, so that Arbitrum becomes a much more complete place for our products than even mainnet. A good example is the financing of various lending markets for our products. We would like to also extend the use of our grant, not only to our Curve, but also to our Pendle products.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Recipient Multisig: 0x3B985f06D624C74F270daeCcDb65DcC6ee582372</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>asdCRV liquidity gauge: 0x25E822B65a58Ce1A53DbC327d4fA489351FB1Df0</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Our main suggestions would be:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Having one point of contact with the Arbitrum team/foundation.

[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Previous STIP round showed clearly that for Abracadabra, borrowing incentives for users are not needed. Our products are deemed competitive and go sold out regularly without any need of incentives, therefore the only required focus is to improve MIM liquidity so that the products can be used by more and more users.</em></p>\n<p><em>Our ARB focus will now be on liquidity provision, MIM savings rate and potentially collateral apy boosts in partnerships with other protocols.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h2>\n<p><strong><em>7. Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways</em> as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<p><em>We have planned a slight change in the way rewards will be used, but it is coherent with the general idea expressed in the STIP proposal</em></p>\n<p><strong>8. How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Abracadabra’s newly acquired ARB will be used differently from the previous batch. Lets see how:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>1) 60% of the ARB rewards (450k ARB)</strong> - will be used to incentivise MIM LPers.</em></p>\n<p><em>MIM LPers will not only be on the main MIM-2crv pool and MIM-crvUSD pool on curve finance, but we plan on deploying our own stableswap infrastructure, called MIMswap, that will allow users to receive ARB reward by providing liquidity in the Abracadabra in house AMMs. MIMswap staking contracts are not only controlled in full by the Abracadabra DAO, but they also allow for LP locking.</em></p>\n<p><em>MIMswap LPers will therefore receive ARB LP rewards coming from the STIP, similarly to other LP rewards systems. The more user lock their funds for tho, the bigger their boost will be.</em></p>\n<p><em>MIMswap has gone through 2 rounds of audits, one with CodeArena and the other with Guardian Audits. MIMswap has been live for a month now on Blast.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>It is pivotal to notice that the deployment of MIMswap will not make our DAO stop its rewards to both Camelot and Curve, but just add to it another venue that will be focused on MIM-USDT pairings, while leaving MIM-USDC to Camelot, and MIM-USDT-USDC to curve.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>This three headed approach is intended not to create competition between the protocols, but just to increase the number of options available to LPers on Arbitrum.</em></p>\n<p><em>We plan on adding MIMswap pool, next to Camelot and Curve pools on the same incentive dashboard on our main user interface, so that users can easily find these different avenues.</em></p>\n<p><em>This new boost in liquidity will allow Abracadabra not only to expand its already successful gmCcauldrons, but also expand its collateral offering to other competitive yield sources. Following are some examples of integrations our developers have been working on:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Camelot LP Tokens by Camelot Dex</li>\n<li>jUSDC by Jones DAO</li>\n<li>Pendle Tokens</li>\n<li>Native naked assets ($GMX, $GRAIL, $JONES and others)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>2) 20% MIMswap Founders Boost (150k ARB)</strong> - will be used to reward LPers that lock their MIMswap LP tokens for 3 months mimicking the strategy happening on Blast.</em></p>\n<p><em>In order to better understand this system, the easiest example is MIMswap recent launch on blast. With only point rewards, MIMswap has attracted more than 13m in TVL in less than 3 weeks, out of this 13m, 9m worth of LPs have decided to lock their funds in MIMswap staking contracts for 3 months, in order to enjoy the founder’s boost. 20% of all the received GOLD points on blast have been dedicated to Founders.</em></p>\n<p><em>Similarly we are aiming at distributing 20% of all the received ARB to MIMswap LPers that in the first 3 weeks of the program lock their funds for 3 months. This part of the system will also be incentivised with part of the SPELL rewards pledged towards it.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>3) 20% MIM Savings Rate (MSR) (150k ARB)</strong> - We have now completed audits for our MSR contracts, we are happy to announce that MIM Savings Rate (MSR) is now ready to be deployed on Arbitrum to distirbutedARB rewards to users who lock their MIM tokens inside the MSR staking contracts.</em></p>\n<p><em>For reference, During the STIP campaign, the DAO allocated 239,400,000 SPELL tokens to deepen MIM liquidity on Arbitrum (13.3M per epoch allocated to the MIM-2CRV Curve pool), compared to our initial commitment of 160,000,000 SPELL tokens. <strong>Despite the reduced size of the bridge TIP, our DAO is committing to match the ARB grant with 200m SPELL tokens.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>9. Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Multisig:</em> <a href=\"https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0xfBDf75866904767dE1Caa8B64eb18a7562517F5A\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0xfBDf75866904767dE1Caa8B64eb18a7562517F5A<br>\n</a><br>\n<em>Contracts for Distribution:</em> MIMswap and MIM Savings Rate contracts will be deployed shortly, and will be communicated to both the DAO and Grant trackers accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<p><em>The STIP has been one of the most successful incentivisation protocols that Abracadabra has experienced.

We’re excited to share with the community the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) reporting updates from our first 2 months of operation.</strong></p>\n<p>The first 2 months have seen strong progress, with the publication of the Subsidy Fund proposal and the creation of the Means Test. We are also in the process of setting up the procurement framework RFP to whitelist security service providers for the DAO, which will be published by May 1.</p>\n<p>This thread will be used to update the Arbitrum DAO about the progress made by the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (ADPC). The post will cover 3 sections:</p>\n<p>I. ADCP’s mandate and the work done towards fulfilling the mandate;<br>\nII. Timeline and Open Items;<br>\nIIi.

ADPC’s Mandate &amp; Progress</h1>\n<p>As ratified by this <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/43616303506326656287362617487331059827021737444126158637397168372555259240241\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tally vote</a>, the ADPC was created on February 8 2024, with an initial mandate of 6 months, extending until August 8 2024.</p>\n<p>We will break down the progress we have made for each of the ADPC’s mandate points:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/one.png?v=12\" title=\":one:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":one:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> The primary mandate of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is to oversee and facilitate the recently ratified procurement framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, as per the following reference: <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a>. In this capacity, the ADPC bears the responsibility of diligently executing the steps essential to implement the aforementioned procurement framework in a manner characterized by transparency and efficiency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The ADPC is currently in the process of setting up the procurement framework RFP to whitelist security service providers for the DAO.</li>\n<li>The RFP includes a Framework Agreement which outlines detailed considerations around general provisions of the framework, administration of the framework, financial provisions, personnel, information management, risk management, IP rights, termination and dispute, delivery, security, and reporting. The RFP also includes an Order Form and Contract Details for all applicants.</li>\n<li><strong>The first draft of the RFP has been created and is currently being vetted and reviewed internally by the ADPC.</strong></li>\n<li>The aim is for the ADPC to publish the RFP by May 1, with applications needing to be submitted 4 weeks after the RFP being published and a subsequent review period consisting of 4 weeks, which will be a rolling process where the ADPC will approve applicants through the course of this period. <strong>We aim to have the service providers white-listed by the end of June.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/two.png?v=12\" title=\":two:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":two:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> The ADPC will be tasked with researching &amp; drafting a proposal to the ArbitrumDAO to set up a subsidy-fund for security-oriented services that will be used to subsidize the costs for security-services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958/15\">Subsidy Fund proposal</a> has been drafted and shared with the DAO. The proposal is up for vote on <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd45c0426919353cbce3e7e2a3e7a00c01f9d606bb7ed6c9788db4598f044b16a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a>. We have also created Grant Application T&amp;Cs for any applicants which you can find <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYCtfP_GqfjkKQafVr86hCpjEsQ2Ec4a/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. <strong>Applications for subsidies will only start getting accepted after service providers are white-listed.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/three.png?v=12\" title=\":three:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":three:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> The ADPC will be tasked with researching &amp; implementing a framework that will establish a set of qualitative &amp; quantitative metrics that will be utilized so as to assess a project’s eligibility for the ‘Subsidy Fund’ referred to in point [b] above. This ‘Means Test’ (as referred to in traditional administrative practices), will be bundled in with the proposal that will set up the subsidy fund referred to in [b]. The Means Test will be used to assess whether a project is eligible for security service-fee subsidies. Initially, this methodology will only be applied to security-oriented services. However, this does not preclude the application of this same concept to other verticals within the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Means Test is included as part of the Subsidy Fund proposal and you can find it in the same forum post.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/four.png?v=12\" title=\":four:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":four:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> The ADPC will be tasked with establishing procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service-types that the ArbitrumDAO could need in the foreseeable future. This proactive approach towards procurement will naturally aid in ensuring that projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem have immediate access to high-quality whitelisted service providers when the need arises. In this regard, all procurement frameworks developed by the ADPC will need to be ratified through a Snapshot vote by the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given our focus on establishing the procurement framework for security service providers and creating the Subsidy Fund, we have not worked on establishing any other procurement frameworks yet. However, we are in conversations with BlockScience to take the findings of their <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/blockscience-report-arbitrum-expert-service-provider-network-program-development/22687\">report</a> to develop Expert Service Provider Networks for Arbitrum forward and identify the best process for outlining the next procurement frameworks for the DAO to create. As these conversations become more advanced, we will provide further updates on this thread.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/five.png?v=12\" title=\":five:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":five:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> The ADPC will be tasked with creating &amp; communicating guidance notes &amp; circulars that will substantiate &amp; provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The aim of these guidance notes &amp; circulars is to provide prospective applicants going through the procurement process with the necessary information that would enable them to satisfactorily complete the steps of the corresponding procurement framework.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are currently in the process of creating guidance notes and circulars alongside the RFP and will publish these in due course.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"ii-timeline-and-open-items-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ii-timeline-and-open-items-2\"></a>II.

We set out to boost the visibility of budding Arbitrum projects that were flying under the radar, and we achieved this with WOOFi’s cross-chain carousel which spotlighted 13 builders over 13 consecutive weeks. This initiative alone triggered 18,347 cross-chain swaps into the ecosystem and showcased some of the attention-starved gems innovating at Arbitrum’s application layer.</p>\n<p>We led more collaborative efforts when we teamed up with Layer3, GMX, Trader Joe, Radiant Capital, Silo Finance, and Camelot to launch WOOFi’s Quest for the Holy Grail of Arbitrum. This campaign was designed to reward users who completed the quest collection with the Holy Grail NFT, giving each holder a guaranteed share of 25,000 ARB. Originally slated to go live on March 5th, the initiative was postponed due to a WOOFi Swap pricing exploit but is still scheduled to go ahead in May.</p>\n<p>Concerning WOOFi specifically, data shows that our metrics boomed from the incentives. Not only did the TVL of WOOFi Earn Arbitrum vaults more than triple from $4.6m to $15.2m, but staked WOO also jumped from 19m to 35.6m, with 3,300 new stakers on Arbitrum. In tandem, perps flourished as WOOFi Pro 7-day volumes more than 100xed from $13.3m in late December 2023 to $1.36B in early March. In this same period, cumulative WOOFi Pro users multiplied by more than a factor of 8 from 5,429 to 45,867.</p>\n<p>Prior to the pricing exploit in early March, WOOFi Swap also observed 24-hour all-time-highs across the board with regard to swap volume ($61.7m), swap fees ($14,381), DAU (17,951), and number of swaps (21,449). It should therefore come as no surprise that Arbitrum is now home to more WOO token holders (47,666) than any other chain, surpassing even the token’s birthplace, Ethereum (19,932).</p>\n<p><strong>6. [Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We should ensure rewards are proportional to the $ value that users contribute to prevent sybil attacks. This will also make the incentives more efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h2>\n<p><strong>7.

However, the intense competition within the ecosystem made this more difficult to carry through.</p>\n<p>The lesson learned here is that instead of spreading efforts across a wide range of protocols and focusing on a rotating program that keeps rewards concentrated and over short periods, Trader Joe will instead double down on TJ exclusive partnerships to collaborate more with the wider ecosystem and to avoid yield competition against competing DEXs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-3\"></a><strong>New Plans for STIP Bridge</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>50% of the STIP - 755,000 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>High level plan as below:</strong></p>\n<p>Please note that NO ARB will be allocated towards JOE LPs or USDC.e LPs</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/98ea0fcbc3ca36afefe6990f23ce1bb89bc8ccac.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lOK37Ijx3xBBoPueZECfvwZi2tu.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/98ea0fcbc3ca36afefe6990f23ce1bb89bc8ccac.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"lOK37Ijx3xBBoPueZECfvwZi2tu\" width=\"690\" height=\"92\" data-dominant-color=\"F2F2F2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>YES and NO (some small adjustments/changes - but nothing major)</p>\n<p><strong>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>Ultimately the same core mechanisms of incentivization (MM program and Auto-Pool Farms) remain the same but with some adjustments to the overarching plan based on learnings from the STIP.

Hack Humanity intends to produce a subsequent proposal to provide a year-round program of events on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO, this will require a larger funding package, with a component to cover a full-time team &amp; and a component for an event budget to cover a series of IRL events. Hack Humanity needs the ability to hire and maintain a dedicated team committed to Arbitrum, this uniquely enables high-context, up to date and relevant continual program design in lockstep with the needs of Arbitrum’s roadmap and community needs, it also enables Hack Humanity and team to commit and block calendar dates for future events 6-12 months in advance, secure venues, and team member’s time.

This proposal does NOT seek to transfer any large funds, only enough to elect, empower and compensate dealmakers who upload token swap agreements on Tally for ArbitrumDAO to directly approve.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong> - This is the second of the Stable Treasury Endowment Program proposals put forth by the Treasury Working Group, formed in September ‘23 with a mandate to propose best in class solutions for diversifying Arbitrums treasury, currently containing ~3.5 billion ARB.</p>\n<p>Token swaps are a form of treasury diversification that increases Arbitrum alignment of protocols. In our view, token swaps should be the final stage of ecosystem support by the DAO, which could begin with a small Questbook grant and finally graduate to a direct token swap with us.<br>\n.<br>\n<strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p><em>A. Ecosystem Growth</em> : We see broadly three categories of projects that would benefit from and apply for token swaps</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Builders: Some founders, such as Susruth Nadimpalli of Catalog (Ren Protocol), were seeking an L2 they could devote themselves to. A token swap emerged as one way to ensure they build on our chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mature Apps: Many of the top apps in Arbitrum have their own token. Although some of them have ARB in their treasuries because of the airdrop, we do not possess any of their tokens. We think ARB DAO should seriously think of getting a nonzero amount of the top tokens in our ecosystem to promote closer integration with successful dapps on our chain and more generally create positive sentiment in the ARB ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Orbit Adoption: The third category consist of big players that want to launch their own Orbit L2 or appchain. For example, Celo is researching a tech stack for their chains. A token swap deal can help cement their decision of choosing Orbit over its competitors for their L2.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>More broadly, getting a voice in the apps in our ecosystem may prove critical in the future for ensuring they remain Arbitrum aligned (such as by voting against their migration from our chain). At the same time, for it to truly be an ecosystem growth initiative, we need to ensure it doesn’t appear that the DAO is picking winners and that the source of tokens we receive in the swap is not from the founder encashing their holdings but a community treasury with clear guidelines on holding periods.</p>\n<p><em>B. Treasury Diversification</em> : The first proposal by our WG diversified our treasury into stable RWAs such as tokenized t-bills, while helping with ecosystem support through the DAO being a customer of such products built on our chain. The present token swap proposal takes this one step further by becoming more closely integrated with apps in our ecosystem through owning their tokens.</p>\n<p>More generally, we do not think apps that have launched their own token should be receiving large grants from ArbitrumDAO. People will always line up for free money; but when they have to give something in return such as their token, they would be more judicious about the amounts they are requesting.</p>\n<p>Some of the risks to take care of are avoiding what happened to FTX with their <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/QmXKDH8U54wHgKGUpeC3iR3UxF1ZQekADCQtM5crafnptF\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BitDAO token swap</a>. After $BIT migrated their token and became $MNT, they <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x00625c4f2d9aa9d4efb41ef3d0942194ca2087fae0599deced8b8ed86372c6c2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">invalidated</a> all tokens held by the FTX estate by preventing their exchange. We also want to prevent one sided deals where we hold in perpetuity while the other side liquidates ARB received. In the future, a DAO treasury manager could keep tabs on alt tokens in our treasury and recommend or even unilaterally hold power to liquidate them with an explanation to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<p>One big issue with token swaps are price increases upon announcement of a deal. We want to mitigate this issue by the elected dealmakers making the announcement of projects shortlisted via an onchain proposal on Tally, with the applicant locking in terms of the deal using Hedgey’s token swap escrow tool and Arbitrum DAO accepting or rejecting the deal via a direct onchain Tally vote.</p>\n<p>All shortlisted applicants will need to undergo KYC with the Foundation, before any deal is uploaded on Tally.</p>\n<p>We would also let dealmakers negotiate the vesting lengths, lockup periods and other details, which would vary depending on the applicants requirement (a builder seeking a token swap would be different from one launching their orbit chain and wanting a voice in governance).</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Snapshot approval of the proposal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Elections for dealmakers held on Snapshot</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tally vote approving or rejecting the dealmakers elected in the Snapshot poll and transferring remuneration to them (in case the DAO is not satisfied with the candidates or changes its mind, they can reject the proposal at this stage).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dealmakers put out an RFP for projects to apply for token swaps with Arbitrum DAO</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shortlisted applicants complete KYC, lock up their tokens in escrow and dealmakers upload the deal on Tally ; if passed, tokens are swapped between our treasuries and if rejected, applicant gets back their tokens.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>\n<p>April : Solicit comments and feedback on the proposal</p>\n<p>May : Put forth a Snapshot vote and if successful, invite applications for people to become ARB DAO dealmakers</p>\n<p>June : Snapshot election for appointing dealmakers</p>\n<p>July : Onchain tally vote to authorize and pay elected dealmakers</p>\n<p>August-October: RFP for DAOs seeking token swaps + search and review of applicants</p>\n<p>November: Submission window closes and KYC checks for shortlisted candidates</p>\n<p>December : Upload deals for the DAO to vote on Tally</p>\n<p>January : Vote on continuation of the program or its disbanding</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong> : 210,000 ARB</p>\n<p>We are still working out the right amount of pay and seek feedback from the DAO and interested candidates in the position. We propose 35k ARB to each of the 5 dealmakers and the Treasury WG as facilitating, nonvoting member except in tie-breaks (upper range should be 50k and lower 20k)</p>\n<p>35,000 x 6 = 210,000 ARB</p>\n<p>This will be the only incurred cost in the proposal, as the DAO will directly approve or reject any token swap deal uploaded to Tally.</p>\n<p>We are keeping a soft target of uploading token swap deals worth at least 10 million ARB before seeking additional funds for continuation of the program. 2% of this amount for implementation is reasonable by industry standards , especially considering the power these dealmakers have.</p>\n<p>As a concluding note, we would highlight that it is not terribly important whether these deals are approved or rejected, just that apps in our ecosystem are aware of Arbitrum’s token swap ecosystem support program that they may one day benefit from.</p>\n            <p><small>16 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-arbitrum-treasury-token-swap-program/23303\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-arbitrum-treasury-token-swap-program/23303","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Apr 2024 14:01:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23303"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-arbitrum-treasury-token-swap-program/23303.rss","#text":"Proposal [Non-Constitutional] Arbitrum Treasury Token Swap Program"}},{"title":"AIP: Support RIP-7212 for Account Abstraction Wallets","dc:creator":"Arbitrum","category":"Proposals","description":"<h1><a name=\"constitutional-proposal-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#constitutional-proposal-1\"></a><strong>Constitutional proposal</strong></h1>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This proposal adopts <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md\">RIP-7212</a> (Rollup Improvement Proposal), a precompile for verifying the <a href=\"https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/what_is_secp256r1\">secp256r1 curve</a> on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Other major L2s have committed to adopting RIP-7212. Adding support for this precompile would enable account abstraction wallets to cheaply verify a type of signature widely used in passkeys and secure enclaves.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Wallet security is one of the most prominent pain points for crypto users today. Adopting RIP-7212 will reduce the costs of using passkey-based wallets on Arbitrum One and Nova, making them more feasible for everyday use and enabling dApp developers and protocols to offer their users improved UX.</p>\n<p>Passkey-based wallets offer a better level of security than a typical EOA and seamless cross-device support. Specifically, adding this precompile will reduce the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve for account abstraction wallets. Passkeys offer a solution that removes the need for personally storing a private key. They leverage WebAuthn, a global standard for passwordless authentication used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and all major web browsers. The private key generated when creating a passkey can be encrypted and then stored in the iCloud Keychain (or the Android Keystore for Android devices). The decryption of the private keys happens in a specialized module located in every iPhone (and other smartphones) called the Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave ensures a user’s private key can never leave the device, transforming a smartphone into a hardware wallet. Users can authorize transactions with biometric features like Touch ID or Face ID when using passkey-based wallets for key management. These qualities add flexibility and significantly improve UX while maintaining high security.</p>\n<p>Ethereum currently has a precompile for the <a href=\"https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/secp256k1_a_key%20algorithm_(explainCKBot)\">secp25k1</a> curve, which all EOA wallets use as their signature scheme. Account abstraction wallets can use alternative signature schemes, such as the one that passkeys utilize: secp256r1. Without a precompile, verifying this signature onchain is extremely expensive. Adding support for RIP-7212 would decrease the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve <a href=\"https://www.alchemy.com/blog/what-is-rip-7212\">by 99%</a> when compared to current implementations. This makes implementing passkey-based wallets feasible for everyday use. Many wallets, and notably, apps using embedded wallets, have been requesting this feature for over a year.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>This proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s mission and values as per the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values\">Constitution</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>Ethereum-Aligned</strong>: RIP-7212 is the first Rollup Improvement Proposal adopted by the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The RIP stakeholders coordinate with Ethereum Core Devs to ensure Ethereum will continue to be compatible with the upgrade.</p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Many users who are not crypto-native will refuse to write down a seed phrase or buy a dedicated hardware wallet. While options exist to get around those pain points, this upgrade empowers account abstraction wallets to provide high-level security without UX tradeoffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure</strong>: Passkeys and secure enclaves offer hardware-level security since a user’s private key can never leave the device. This is a great alternative to EOAs that does not compromise on usability.</p>\n<p><strong>Inclusivity</strong>: RIP-7212 was discussed publicly among all major L2s before being adopted.
