Our experience during this phase was intense and filled with learning opportunities. Although the program officially kicked off in March, we conducted several tests throughout <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/experimental-delegate-incentive-test-1/20944\">January</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/experimental-delegate-incentive-test-2/21172\">February</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/experimental-delegate-incentive-test-3/22219\">March</a>. We dedicated a considerable amount of time in the program, managing data, gathering feedback, addressing delegate concerns, and striving for clear and concise communication.</p>\n<p>Many of our initial assumptions turned out differently, and there were aspects we hadn’t anticipated, which evolved alongside the DAO’s dynamics. Looking back, we were right to label this program as experimental. Ultimately, being administrators of the program doesn’t imply ownership; it belongs to the DAO, and this is an invitation to collective improvement.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-developments-key-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-developments-key-1\"></a>Key Developments <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/key.png?v=12\" title=\":key:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":key:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h1>\n<p>Throughout implementation, we recognized the program’s potential for change. Collaborating with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/mmurthy\">@mmurthy</a> and the Karma team, we continuously enhanced existing aspects, particularly with the delegate dashboard. Some of the job done so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding relevant information about the parameters measured by the program.</li>\n<li>Updating data for delegates who have reached +50K ARB delegations</li>\n<li>Pushing constant fixes</li>\n<li>Developing automation for the Communication Rationale parameter. Improving significantly and giving a clear breakdown of both onchain and offchain communication rationale.</li>\n<li>Automating the Commenting Proposals parameter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In that process, we also fine-tuned the scoring parameters and established direct communication channels with the delegates. The program facilitated daily interaction with stakeholders committed to the Arbitrum ecosystem, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Additionally, we received unwavering support from the Tally team, and we are grateful for their assistance at all times. Last but not least, we must recognize the invaluable feedback and comments provided by the delegates, which served as the cornerstone for the changes we intend to propose.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"learning-mistakes-improvements-mag-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#learning-mistakes-improvements-mag-2\"></a>Learning, Mistakes, Improvements <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mag.png?v=12\" title=\":mag:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":mag:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h1>\n<p>During the process, we encountered scenarios where it was necessary to make unilateral decisions, responding to the circumstances in order to efficiently resolve the situations as they arose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LTIPP: We faced the challenge of addressing 77 proposals within a short timeframe. Considering the large volume of proposals, <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/about-ltipp-in-aprils-delegate-incentive-program/23103\">we communicated that it wasn’t necessary to comment on each one</a> to avoid excessive spam and overload for delegates. We prioritized ensuring delegates had sufficient time to vote, given the sheer volume of proposals during that week.</li>\n<li>The same approach was taken with the 17 proposals labeled ‘Post Council Feedback’, as highlighted by Bob-Rossi in his <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/about-ltipp-in-aprils-delegate-incentive-program/23103/4\">comment</a>.</li>\n<li>ARDC Elections: During the ARDC elections in March, we decided it wasn’t necessary to comment on each individual election. Since there were no forum posts for each vote and it didn’t add much value, we solely considered the voting rationale.</li>\n<li>Council Elections: Initially, we were unsure how to incorporate the work of delegates who dedicated time to selecting the best Security Council members. Due to the sensitive nature and voting dynamics of this election, to avoid confusion among delegates, we chose not to include it in this first iteration of the program. We are working on how to include it for the next Security Council election.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our decisions were made with the following considerations in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoiding unnecessary noise and spam</li>\n<li>Minimizing additional workloads</li>\n<li>Preventing gameability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to expand the discussion to include you all, so together we can devise a mechanism to prevent arbitrariness when addressing ongoing issues. Arbitrum DAO is incredibly dynamic, and new challenges will continue to arise… We aim to enhance the program experience based on the feedback we’ve received and ensure that the best possible decision emerges from the consensus of the DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"looking-ahead-eyes-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#looking-ahead-eyes-3\"></a>Looking Ahead <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=12\" title=\":eyes:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":eyes:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h1>\n<p>During the past few weeks, we’ve been actively seeking feedback from some delegates with the aim of swiftly improving and iterating the program. As a result, we would like to implement some minor changes that we believe can enhance the program:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ceasing the requirement for Commenting Proposals (CP) and Communication Rationale (CR) in technical proposals: We’ve noticed that unless delegates have a high level of technical knowledge, it’s challenging for them to provide valuable input on these types of proposals. To avoid forced comments, we propose discontinuing the inclusion of CP and possibly CR for technical proposals, which are typically driven by the Arbitrum Foundation.</li>\n<li>Adjusting the Participation Rate parameter: Instead of considering the entire historical data, we propose considering the last 90 days. This change, inspired by feedback from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cp0x\">@cp0x</a> , would be fairer to users actively engaging in the DAO’s day-to-day operations.</li>\n<li>Lowering the token delegation threshold for program participation from 50k to 25k ARB: Inspired by feedback from the Arbitrum Foundation, we believe this adjustment would enable more delegates to participate in the program.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"executing-changes-test_tube-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#executing-changes-test_tube-4\"></a>Executing Changes <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/test_tube.png?v=12\" title=\":test_tube:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":test_tube:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h1>\n<p>Our plan is to discuss these proposals with delegates and vote on them via Snapshot to ensure consensus within the community. In addition to the various individual conversations we’ve had with delegates, we aim to continue seeking feedback so that each decision is thoroughly deliberated and achieved through consensus. We want to hear from you, which is why we will host a public call to discuss the proposed changes to the incentive program on Friday, the 17th at 12:00 UTC.

PV01’s non-custodial platform Pivio allows issuers and institutional investors access to the primary and secondary bond markets in a transparent and efficient manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Product:</strong></p>\n<p>PV01’s digital bonds are the world’s first blockchain native debt secured by assets in a bankruptcy-remote SPV under English law - the gold standard for bond issuance. Our stable RWA backed product, a digital bond represented by a fully transferable bearer ERC-20 token called a ‘TBL’ token, is collateralized (secured) by a direct, 1-for-1 exposure to a single, underlying US Treasury Bill having the same maturity and same face amount. TBLs are denominated in USDC, and issued on the Ethereum blockchain in bearer (dematerialised) form represented by the ERC-20 bond tokens.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"chcklst-box checked fa fa-check-square-o fa-fw\"></span> <strong>Our product is a new “composable” primitive</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our TBLs are as proximate as possible on-chain with the fewest steps to owning a T-Bill in the fiat system. As modular, building block-like financial instruments, they can be reused to build other financial products on-chain.</p>\n<p>As building blocks, they are easily transferable with very few restrictions. They have the potential to be used as collateral in CeFi and DeFi. Their non-rebasing form makes it easy to compose with other dApps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"chcklst-box checked fa fa-check-square-o fa-fw\"></span> <strong>Fit for corporate debt</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first iteration of PV01’s product are tokens representing US T-Bills. However, the legal structure lends itself naturally to corporate bond issuances. PV01 will soon issue corporate bonds directly on-chain for crypto companies. The crypto credit market exceeded $30bn at its peak and has the potential to be even bigger in this new cycle. Having the ability to invest in the debt of major crypto-native companies on-chain would increase the attractiveness of Arbitrum as a blockchain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"chcklst-box checked fa fa-check-square-o fa-fw\"></span> <strong>PV01’s Network</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The team at PV01, having been operating in crypto as early as 2013 for some, has deep and personal connections with major exchanges and market makers, essential components of any new ecosystem. Market makers will deploy trading capital to Arbitrum should there be significant issuance of TBLs there. One large exchange is committed to accepting TBLs as collateral. Arbitrum will benefit from the cascading effect of involving volume-driven participants, not only TVL-driven participants. We believe that our institutional connections in the crypto market are second to none.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"chcklst-box checked fa fa-check-square-o fa-fw\"></span> <strong>Putting Arbitrum ‘First’</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>PV01’s goal is to support Arbitrum in becoming the foremost RWA ecosystem, as measured by TVL, utility and activity. Our robust and well defined legal and contractual structure, as well as proven early issuances with major crypto institutions, ensure that we can scale both in size and velocity.</p>\n<p>Together in partnership, we look forward to receiving feedback from users on Arbitrum and to make our product more relevant and valuable to users long term. Additionally, with our focus on corporate debt issuance beyond the current needs for Treasury products, we will be able to support Arbitrum-focused projects to raise debt capital themselves.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

We were asked to review the on-chain proposal to be executed and share any security concerns we had.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>The proposal is made up of three different calls to be made from the L2 Treasury Timelock:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It transfers $ARB 42,500 out of the DAO treasury to itself</li>\n<li>It then <code>approve</code>s Hedgey’s <code>BatchPlanner</code> contract for the same amount</li>\n<li>Finally, it calls Hedgey’s BatchPlanner contract which transfers the tokens to itself and then finally to a “locker” contract which stores and administers the vesting plan.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our simulation of this proposal was successful (i.e. did not revert) and our review of the contracts and their simulated behavior showed that the proposal provides two key features critical for the proposal’s success:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the proposer had access to funds which vested according to the specified schedule</li>\n<li>the security council had the ability at all times to revoke any unvested tokens</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Overall, we believe the proposal will execute successfully and meets the security expectations of the proposer and delegates.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"prepatory-calls-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#prepatory-calls-3\"></a>Prepatory Calls</h2>\n<p>The first two calls of the proposal entirely involve Arbitrum contracts that should be well known to the community and have done these sort of transactions before.

The compromised contract is not used by the contracts in this proposal and does not interact with the proposal contracts in any way. The issue it exhibited was <a href=\"https://github.com/hedgey-finance/Locked_VestingTokenPlans/blob/6a5ff58c2e83015b83c8de15f1cc61e9ac58f2c7/contracts/Periphery/ClaimCampaigns.sol#L193\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">giving approval privileges to an unsanitized address</a>. This specific issue is not present in the proposal contracts.</p>\n<p>The first contract, <code>BatchPlanner</code>, is used simply as an entry point for creating the vesting schedule. It performs some sanitation checks on the data, transfers the entire grant amount to itself, approves the other Hedgey contract (<code>VotingTokenVestingPlans</code>) to later take those tokens, and then calls the other contract’s <code>createPlan</code> method with the vesting schedule data.</p>\n<p>The second contract, <code>VotingTokenVestingPlans</code>, is the real work-horse of the vesting schedule and is referred to as the “locker” contract. It takes the grant tokens and starting from 1 Apr 2024 @ 12am UTC will vest $ARB 0.00323 per second (or roughly $ARB 1956.16 per week) until the final grant amount is entirely vested on 31 Aug 2024 @ 2am UTC. There is an initial cliff on 1 May 2024 @ 12am UTC where not tokens will be officially vest before then, but afterward all of the accrued, vesting tokens will become available. Below is a chart to show the total vested amount over time. Note that the on-chain vesting amounts don’t exactly match the numbers in the description of the proposal. These discrepancies are due to the authors rounding numbers to make the description more readable for the audience. They are, however, generally accurate.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e39517af8e3c86132f8e2774fdf501ab26510dd1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wthOx2OyxRfL8iAsfHlqjQzcv9n.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e39517af8e3c86132f8e2774fdf501ab26510dd1.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"wthOx2OyxRfL8iAsfHlqjQzcv9n\" width=\"690\" height=\"260\" data-dominant-color=\"EEEEEE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>With the grant transferred to the “locker” contract, some new functionality becomes available. It exposes a <code>redeemPlans</code> method which the proposer’s multi-sig can call to transfer vested grant tokens. It also exposes methods <code>revokePlans</code> and <code>futureRevokePlans</code> which the Arbitrum 7 of 12 Security Council contract can call to end the vesting schedule at either the time of call or a future, specified time and receive the tokens that will no longer vest. The Security Council contract can also call the <code>transferFrom</code> method to replace the proposer’s multi-sig as the owner of the grant. This is intended to be used in case the grant proposers lose access to their own multi-sig.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, while the tokens themselves are not able to be transferred out of the locker except as scheduled, the locker does allow the  proposer’s multi-sig to immediately gain the ability to delegate the <em>entire</em> grant’s voting power to another contract using its <code>delegate*</code> methods. In this way, the proposal will grant voting power to the proposers more than their actual ownership entails.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We looked for all sorts of ways in which the expected behaviors could fail or be frustrated.

During this analysis, concerns have arisen regarding the usage of ARB incentives by Synapse.</p>\n<p>As part of STIP Round 2, Synapse received an incentive allocation of 2M ARB, which was streamed to the project’s dedicated Funding Address (0xd31d3a2c19123b8ff48560c20a08ffb16ad62dfe) between January and March 2024. Following the STIP’s conclusion on March 29th, 2024, 750K ARB from the Funding Address was sent to three separate wallets on April 12th, 2024:</p>\n<p>0x95aAA6B27D6001dAb496c9FB229dE4CBd443C648 (~360K ARB)<br>\n0x7db3441406C34aF060eC64C31c4943A0234d8b36 (~150K ARB)<br>\n0xf6a3928F8E6820d78465Ef2675a8ad2438dd2a83 (~240K ARB)</p>\n<p>These wallets still hold all of the transferred ARB and have received small amounts of ETH from a wallet connected to the ENS socrates0x.eth (0xfc7A6e0b80b2cfcABBa789ef1565Af9BC5d00aa0), who is the co-founder of Synapse Labs. All of the ARB across the three wallets is currently delegated to socrates0x.eth, as can be seen in <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3725526/6266044\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this Dune query</a>. Moreover, ARB from the Funding Address was sent to a Distribution Address (0x48Fa1EBDa1AF925898c826c566F5Bb015E125EAd) before tokens were distributed to users. This Distribution Address still holds ~3.3K ARB.</p>\n<p>These actions raise questions about compliance with the rules established by the STIP, which stipulate that protocols receiving incentives should return any unused ARB to the DAO and prohibit the use of the grant in governance.

The ADPC would also like to clarify that the applications for the Subsidy Fund will only be accepted after vendors are whitelisted in accordance with the Procurement Framework for security-oriented service providers, by the ADPC.</p>\n<p>The original intention behind the inclusion of this task under the remit of the ADPC at no additional cost to the DAO was in part based on the fact that during the elections for the ADPC, there was a low number of applicants with a procurement background.</p>\n<p>While the ADPC wishes to remain responsive to the wishes of the DAO, we should note the adverse impacts and risks associated with the requested approach. These include (i) the creation of a new workstream that was not part of the original mandate and distracts from the core functions of the ADPC (ii) the natural delays associated with teams getting voted in, fully briefed on the procurement strategy and developing the necessary understanding of the legalities of the framework agreement. They will also need to establish working relationships, work allocation and deal-flow, get up to speed on the state of negotiations, tools, processes, etc.</p>\n<p>This will require at minimum a 3-4 week onboarding period, which will delay the disbursement of the subsidies by several weeks. We hope the current proposal of setting aside 3 weeks as the expectation for completion of this process represents an acceptable middle ground for the community.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to establish the SSSF Sub-committee, which will be composed of five [5] members. These members will be selected through an open election process using Snapshot’s weighted voting system, with the five [5] highest-ranked candidates being elected to the Committee. The committee’s term will last for 8 weeks.</p>\n<p>While the final decision will rest with the SSSF Sub-committee, their evaluations will be strongly guided by the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958\">Means Test from the ADPC’s Subsidy Fund proposal</a> that assesses key metrics to identify deserving projects.</p>\n<p>Albeit not legally binding, both delegates and token holders are encouraged to adhere to the specified selection criteria when voting for the SSSF Sub-committee members. This will ensure that the committee is adequately equipped to effectively carry out its duties and responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Note: The ADPC members will not be applying for any sub-committee positions unless this is explicitly requested by the community.</p>\n<p><strong>[1] Selection Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>In order for the committee to effectively fulfill its duties and responsibilities, it should ideally be comprised of individuals who possess the following attributes:</p>\n<p><strong>[i] Core Attributes</strong></p>\n<p><em>Security Knowledge</em></p>\n<p>Experience with digital asset security services (on the client or service provider side) and familiar with concepts such as static analysis bug detection, visualising the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, etc.</p>\n<p><em>Legal Knowledge</em></p>\n<p>A solid background and understanding of legal frameworks and core legal aspects, particularly those relating to contract law. Legal professionals can identify and mitigate legal risks associated with the operations of subsidy fund as facilitated by the legal agreements underpinning this process as developed by the ADPC. This aims to safeguard the committee, ensure an airtight legal workflow for the procurement framework, and aids in ensuring that all agreements are legally sound and thus.</p>\n<p><em>Procurement Expertise</em></p>\n<p>Prior experience in leading and managing a strategic sourcing process, in particular relating to project planning, strategic execution and thorough performance evaluation. This skill set supports the effective oversight of deadlines, optimal allocation of resources, and management of the strategic sourcing deliverables with precision, all while ensuring that transparency and fairness are maintained.</p>\n<p><em>Operational Expertise</em></p>\n<p>Prior operational experience relating to the managing, administration and selection of prospective applicants, particularly in managing IT and security services.</p>\n<p><strong>[ii] Other relevant attributes</strong></p>\n<p><em>Proven Track Record in Collaborative Environments</em></p>\n<p>Strong communication skills and proven ability to work well in team settings, especially in other DAO Communities. This encompasses skills that enhance collaboration with other fellow committee members, stakeholders, and service providers. It also includes a readiness to entertain different perspectives and achieve consensus.</p>\n<p><em>Financial Acumen</em></p>\n<p>A solid grasp of financial management, including budgeting, cost analysis, and understanding financial impacts is essential. This knowledge will aid in evaluating the financial health of subsidy applicants and ensure efficient distributions of subsidies, helping to maximize the ROI of the subsidy fund for the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p><em>Technical Knowledge &amp; Analytical Skills</em></p>\n<p>This includes robust analytical capabilities for reviewing subsidy fund proposals and performance indicators. Practical knowledge of security services is advantageous, as it enables the committee to identify and evaluate technical gaps associated with subsidy fund proposals, leading to a more thorough evaluation of technical proposals.</p>\n<p><em>Ethical Conduct &amp; Integrity</em></p>\n<p>Candidates must have a clear professional record and remain free from any conflicts of interest related to potential subsidy recipients. They must disclose any existing or potential conflicts that could compromise their ability to make decisions impartially and independently. Additionally, candidates are expected to commit to the highest standards of integrity and confidentiality in their roles, ensuring transparency and fairness in the selection of security service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>[2] Election Timeline</strong></p>\n<p>The following process will be overseen by the ADPC.</p>\n<p><em>[i] Application Submission Period (7 days):</em></p>\n<p>Candidates can apply on this dedicated page on the ArbitrumDAO Forums, adhering to the stipulated application template. Should the ArbitrumDAO vote in favor of this proposal on Snapshot, the submission period will be initiated for a period of 7 days.</p>\n<p><em>[ii] Member Election (7-day period following the end of Application Submission Period):</em></p>\n<p>A Snapshot with weighted voting will be included, including the list of all eligible candidates. The five [5] highest-voted candidates will be elected to the Security Services Subsidy Fund Sub-committee.</p>\n<p><em>[iii] KYB/KYC &amp; Delegate Review Period (7-day period following the end of member election):</em></p>\n<p>Applicants who have been elected will then be required to undergo KYB/KYC processes. The Arbitrum Foundation will oversee this compliance process, disqualifying any candidates who fail to meet KYB/KYC standards.</p>\n<p><em>[iv] Elected Members Onboarding &amp; Organisation (21-day period following the end of KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period):</em></p>\n<p>Following the elections, the five [5] highest-voted candidates will be briefed by the ADPC and given 3-weeks to familiarize themselves with the procurement strategy, legal frameworks, negotiation states, tools, processes, etc. Following this, the elected committee members will be responsible for executing the Application Process described in the Subsidy Fund Proposal.</p>\n<p>As determined by the Snapshot proposal, the Subsidy Fund will take place over 1 cohort consisting of a period of 8 weeks. Subsequently, the process underlying the election of the SSSF Sub-committee will add 6 weeks to the previously expected timeframes relating to this proposal. Therefore, this will result in a total timeframe of around 14 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>[3] Election Application Timeline</strong></p>\n<p>Kindly refer to the Selection Criteria outlined above when completing the election application template.

To create the reports the SSSF Sub-committee will set two monthly check-ins where projects fill a template/slide in order to give the key info about the project’s status, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Summary of Achievements for the Month</li>\n<li>Funds Utilized</li>\n<li>Milestones Reached</li>\n<li>Challenges Faced &amp; Plan of Action</li>\n<li>Feedback Integration, i.e., how projects have incorporated feedback provided.</li>\n<li>Next Steps &amp; Priorities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Output Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>With the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for meaningful output will look as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of Projects Funded: Total number of projects that have been funded.</li>\n<li>Total Funds Allocated: Cumulative sum of funds distributed, showcasing the program’s financial impact.</li>\n<li>Percentage of projects funded in target verticals: As outlined in the Means Test, the three key verticals identified are RWAs &amp; Tokenization, Gaming, and Collab Tech.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcome Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on the final portfolio of funded projects, the SSSF Sub-committee will gauge the success rate of awarded projects through specific outcome metrics. While these metrics can be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as market conditions and individual decisions on a project level, the sub-committee will be committed to supporting and funding the most promising projects to the best of their ability. Metrics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Percentage of funded projects successfully deployed on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Percentage of KPIs outlined in the application achieved by funded projects</li>\n<li>Percentage of projects successfully deployed as Orbit chains: One of the key aims of the Arbitrum DAO is to build and expand the Orbit ecosystem. Funding projects that grow the Orbit ecosystem is a net positive for the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the results of the grants will naturally incur a time lag, the SSSF sub-committee is required to report on the outcome metrics no later than 6 months post the end of the first 8-week cohort.</p>\n<p><strong>[vi] Project Allocation</strong></p>\n<p>The allocation of the subsidy fund focuses on achieving high impact while ensuring that a de minimus number of projects obtain funding.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the subsidy is spread across a large number of projects rather than concentrated in several larger projects, the maximum subsidy to be granted will comprise 10% of the subsidy fund available. Therefore, given that the subsidy fund amounts up to $2.5 million, the maximum subsidy that a project can receive will comprise no more than $250K worth of ARB.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-set-up-a-sub-committee-for-the-security-services-subsidy-fund/23766\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-set-up-a-sub-committee-for-the-security-services-subsidy-fund/23766","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 10:03:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23766"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-set-up-a-sub-committee-for-the-security-services-subsidy-fund/23766.rss","#text":"Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Set up a Sub-Committee for the Security Services Subsidy Fund"}},{"title":"Sanko GameCorp STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"SankoGameCorp","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h4><a name=\"information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\"></a>Information about STIP/STIP Backfund</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Can you provide a link to your previous STIP proposal (round 1 or backfund)?</li>\n</ol>\n<aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"17486\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/sankogamecorp/48/4100_2.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/sanko-gamecorp-final-stip-round-1/17486\">[Sanko GameCorp] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]</a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/incentive-framework/14\"><span data-category-id=\"14\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #000000; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF; --parent-category-badge-color: #25AAE2;\" data-parent-category-id=\"16\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category --has-parent\"><span class=\"badge-category__name\">Incentive Framework (Round 1)</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    <a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/5dd74792ff172770899afaad6dab86577ff015dd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/do9DCQKWlziz7zDhRb2wdSLgeQt.png?dl=1\" title=\"sanko_logo_white_copy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[sanko_logo_white_copy]</a> \n<a name=\"section-1-applicant-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#section-1-applicant-information-1\"></a>SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\nApplicant Name: Sanko GameCorp \nProject Name: Sanko Dream Machine \nProject Description: The Sanko Dream Machine is a multimedia-focused infrastructure protocol and suite of games hosted natively on Arbitrum.

cumulative volume and earnings during the STIP incentivization period. ARB incentives were distributed to users at the end of two seasons – 200K ARB was distributed to users at the end of Season 1 on February 2, 2024; 300K ARB was distributed at the end of Season 2 on March 29, 2024. Users accumulated points during each by interacting with Sanko TV in meaningful ways by tipping streamers, trading Passes, and hosting popular streams. Following the ARB disbursement at the end of Season 1, Sanko TV experienced a noticeable uptick in volume, earnings, and TVL; this also coincided with the addition of UX-enhancing features to Sanko TV, including stream VODs and boosted streams.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An interesting lesson learned relates to airdropping incentives in seasons rather than via drip. Sanko GameCorp distributed points to users at the end of each week based on their activity on Sanko TV. At the end of each season, the portion of a user’s points relative to the total number of points distributed determined their share of the rewards pool. Distributing ARB this way allowed us to ensure that user rewards corresponded with enduring Sanko TV and that rewards would last for the entire duration of the incentive period. The delayed gratification for users in this strategy may not have motivated potential users on the fence of joining Sanko TV until after the ARB allocated for Season 1 was airdropped. Presumably, some of this segment realized the opportunity once this occurred and converted to Sanko TV users.</p>\n<p>Overall, we were very satisfied with the results of the STIP program and believe it delivered measurable growth for the project, which has been sustained.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>250K ARB</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

One suggestion would be to equitably distribute grant funding across projects of all sizes – while established projects certainly deserve support, in the initial STIP the largest projects took the lion’s share of the grant to the preclusion of smaller projects that may produce a higher relative impact on Arbitrum’s adoption through programs like this.</p>\n<p>In addition, the timeline for disbursement - where every project has to release funds under the same timeline - hinders the flexibility of individual projects in a way that diminishes the effect of the program. More flexibility should be given to projects individually for their disbursement timeline. This would produce greater results.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/sanko-gamecorp-stip-addendum/23765\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/sanko-gamecorp-stip-addendum/23765","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 06:22:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23765"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/sanko-gamecorp-stip-addendum/23765.rss","#text":"Sanko GameCorp STIP Addendum"}},{"title":"Solv Protocol STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"Ray","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h4><a name=\"information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\"></a>Information about STIP/STIP Backfund</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Can you provide a link to your previous STIP proposal (round 1 or backfund)?</li>\n</ol>\n<aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"17236\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/r/e9a140/48.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/solv-protocol-final-stip-round-1/17236\">[Solv Protocol] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]</a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/incentive-framework/14\"><span data-category-id=\"14\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #000000; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF; --parent-category-badge-color: #25AAE2;\" data-parent-category-id=\"16\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category --has-parent\"><span class=\"badge-category__name\">Incentive Framework (Round 1)</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    <a name=\"section-1-applicant-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#section-1-applicant-information-1\"></a>SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\nProvide personal or organizational details, including applicant name, contact information, and any associated organization.

This would attract more institutional investors who seek secure, compliant, and scalable investment opportunities, and allow existing companies and users to take advantage of these RWA-backed yield products without ever having to off-ramp USDC or move to a different chain.</li>\n<li>Diversification of Investment Portfolios: The introduction of RWA-backed yield products allows investors to build diversified portfolios directly within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This diversification is crucial for risk management and provides more options for yield-seeking behavior, broadening the appeal of Arbitrum to a wider investor base.</li>\n<li>Innovation in Collateral and Financial Markets: Providing builders with new forms of composable digital collateral can lead to the creation of innovative financial instruments and markets. This development supports Arbitrum’s positioning as a cutting-edge platform for financial technology.</li>\n<li>Robust Legal and Regulatory Framework: The secure, time-tested, bankruptcy-remote legal and regulatory framework that OpenTrade operates under, managed by regulated investment firms, adds a layer of security and trust. This framework is essential for protecting investments and ensuring compliance, making the Arbitrum ecosystem more robust and resilient.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

The more native USDC liquidity available on Stargate, the easier it is for users to access this asset when bridging into the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Stargate’s pool is currently the 3rd largest holder of USDC.e on Arbitrum L2, and these incentives would help to essentially eliminate that, while significantly ramping up liquidity for native USDC.</li>\n<li>It’s a substantial challenge to migrate from USDC.e to native USDC, and therefore it’s a significant value proposition for those who bridge through Stargate to onboard directly into native USDC, supporting Arbitrum’s migration efforts.</li>\n<li>For users this will also reduce friction and confusion as native USDC expands within the ecosystem, with Stargate helping to proliferate that expansion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>25% (187,500) of the requested funds used to rebate fees for the bridging of OFTs (<a href=\"https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">omnichain fungible tokens</a>) into the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stargate is uniquely positioned as the sole user interface for most OFTs in the ecosystem. This includes some of the largest projects in DeFi, as well as many other STIP participants. For example: $RDNT, $USDe ($sUSDe and $ENA), $JOE, $rsETH. This also includes assets that have been permissionlessly expanded to Arbitrum as OFTs via several governance votes, such as <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gmx.eth/proposal/0xd1b6a1b2b3341d87caae34bb29817513a2108cc9de943556d46f8eed5e4790e0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$WBNB</a> and <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gmx.eth/proposal/0x7d70cb94128482bcae66e8815ad2cfd04126b702931504c58bdc88e11163c7a4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$OP</a> used in GMX markets.</li>\n<li>Eliminating the cost for the bridging of these tokens is something we view as very valuable to the underlying protocols, and could drive greater trading volume on (Perps) DEXes, staking, and governance participation on the Arbitrum Network.</li>\n<li>It’s important to note that Stargate currently only charges 2bps on OFT bridging, so this amount is sufficient to rebating over $1B in volume. While the fee isn’t necessarily prohibitive, associated marketing campaigns alongside Radiant, TraderJoe, GMX, etc. could go a long way to bringing a higher concentration of the global token supply to Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>10% (75,000) of the requested funds used for fee rebates on native ETH bridging.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stargate is uniquely placed in offering deep liquidity when bridging ETH into Arbitrum. For example, at time of writing, you can bridge &gt;1500ETH (~$4.5M) from Optimism to Arbitrum in a single transaction, in ~25 seconds. On Stargate V2, bridging protocol fees are dynamic and will be 6bps or less. This portion of funds would be used to rebate 80% of the fees incurred by users when bridging into Arbitrum over the relevant period.</li>\n<li>Observing the previous STIP period, it was a real learning for Stargate to witness some providers outright paying for volume into Arbitrum, which can of course be griefed and is counterproductive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the newly proposed incentive mechanism outlined in this proposal we think the following KPIs will be relevant to track going forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OFT specific volume flowing into Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Total Supply of OFT assets on Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Native Ethereum volume flowing into Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Native USDC liquidity.</li>\n<li>Reduction in USDC.e liquidity.</li>\n<li>Where the funds bridged in flow once they arrive on Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?<br>\nThe address will be:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisig to receive the incentives: StargateDAO Multisig: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9cd50907aeb5d16f29bddf7e1abb10018ee8717d\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stargate Finance: Multisig | Address 0x9cd50907aeb5d16f29bddf7e1abb10018ee8717d | Arbiscan</a></li>\n<li>Contracts that will distribute the incentives:\n<ul>\n<li>StargateMultiRewarder used for distributing incentives to native USDC poolers\n<ul>\n<li>[not yet announced] - will be shared once Stargate V2 is publicly announced (mid/late May).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>StargateIncentiveDistributor for OFT and ETH bridging incentives\n<ul>\n<li>[not yet deployed] - will be shared ASAP</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The multisig used to receive the incentives will be the same, while the incentive distribution contract changed compared to STIP</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Could you share any feedback or suggestion on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While the overall experience was positive, we did find some difficulties in drafting the initial proposal and getting proper feedback.

The aggregate budgeted cost across these programs for signers stands at 158,000 ARB, with an annualized total expenditure, based on estimations, of 470,000 ARB or $627,840 at an ARB price of $1.34. This is a high cost for the DAO to pay on a purely operational function, especially <strong>considering that these operational costs will likely rise as more programs are funded.</strong></p>\n<p>We propose creating a “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS) to unlock significant cost-saving opportunities, lessen committee fragmentation, ensure signers are competent with multi-sigs, and reduce friction for contributors creating proposals. The MSS will comprise 12 elected individuals to all DAO-funded multi-sigs. They will be compensated a base USD amount, paid in ARB, for performing these services across the DAO.</p>\n<p>This proposal also includes the optional steps to fund the implementation of r3gen monthly Token Flow reporting on inflows (revenue) and outflows (spend) across the DAO as well as providing detailed information and analysis on spending from MSS multisigs. Together, this proposal will help create a “backroom finance” function within the DAO that can be used across different initiatives.</p>\n<p>The proposed changes offer the potential to generate substantial cost savings, estimated to be ~$315,000 per annum, while increasing efficiency, transparency, and security of DAO spending.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO oversees six programs which pay multi-sig signers. Each multi-sig typically has five signers, except for the STIP and STIP backfund programs, which share the same multi-sig and have nine signers budgeted for. The table below outlines these programs, including the amount funded, duration (in months), and annualized figures to project a forecasted amount if future programs were to continue in the same manner.</p>\n<p>Here’s a breakdown of the programs:<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/n3ksB1H6usGNluKRMreNWZ3avqs.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 9.46.01 AM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_689x263.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 9.46.01 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"n3ksB1H6usGNluKRMreNWZ3avqs\" width=\"689\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_689x263.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_1033x394.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B6C3CF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The analysis underscores the operational unsustainability of the current expenditure level, with an annualised cost totalling $627,840 USD based on the average ARB price of $1.34 between August 7, 2023 and April 30, 2024, the period starting when Arbitrum DAO’s first multisig was funded.</p>\n<p>The cost per transaction appears excessive when comparing these figures against the volume of unique transactions sent from each multi-sig. While analysis for all multi-sig wallets is included for completeness, the STIP/Backfund multi-sig provides the clearest picture of the “cost per transaction” due to its proximity to completion.</p>\n<p>This analysis highlights the urgent need for restructuring and cost optimization within the Arbitrum DAO to ensure financial sustainability and operational efficiency in the long term.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/33h0Gzlv7Hg02RZJtnAyPjyWKsS.png?dl=1\" title=\"UTS\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_689x226.png\" alt=\"UTS\" data-base62-sha1=\"33h0Gzlv7Hg02RZJtnAyPjyWKsS\" width=\"689\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_689x226.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_1033x339.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ADBCCA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/y00Ac7P8UG4yzGSIRNKGSaP1med.png?dl=1\" title=\"AS CpT\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_690x253.png\" alt=\"AS CpT\" data-base62-sha1=\"y00Ac7P8UG4yzGSIRNKGSaP1med\" width=\"690\" height=\"253\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_690x253.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_1035x379.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"97B0C6\"></a></div><br>\nIt is also worth highlighting that the current structure has individuals appearing across multiple different multi-sigs, drawing income from each.<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7pnTF8JLQ90HZvpubC2WdySyn9b.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5_2_602x343.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"7pnTF8JLQ90HZvpubC2WdySyn9b\" width=\"602\" height=\"343\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5_2_602x343.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E1E6E8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Currently, the DAO experiences a significant dispersion in its structure, where each funded program operates its own multi-sig. This fragmentation not only leads to redundancy but also elevates the overall cost of operations. Through the “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS), we can eliminate these inefficiencies and significantly reduce unnecessary expenditure.</p>\n<p>Additionally, individuals on multi-sigs are generally not elected, posing a challenge in consistently ensuring that only the most trusted and competent members manage these critical roles. By shifting to an elected model within the MSS, we can enhance transparency, accountability, and professionalism, ensuring that every signer meets a high standard of trust and competency.</p>\n<p>Finally, contributors currently face friction in advancing proposals due to the need to wrangle signers, which can delay or deter the proposal process. The MSS aims to streamline this process by providing a reliable and consistent team of signers to be included in proposals, thereby reducing the time and effort of contributors, and accelerating the pace at which the DAO can execute its initiatives.</p>\n<p>By creating a structured multisig committee, process, and reporting cadence around spending, the DAO will be better equipped to service its plethora of proposals that require payments and maintain transparency around the programs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-solution-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-6\"></a>Proposed solution</h2>\n<p>The proposed framework for the Arbitrum DAO aims to address these issues by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO elects 12 signers via Snapshot weighted voting, shielded with Shutter\n<ul>\n<li>Signers, when submitting their application to join the MSS, may opt in to be an MSS Chair, who will be responsible for communicating to the DAO on the MSS’s behalf. The three opted-in signers with the highest weight according to Snapshot will be allocated MSS Chairs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For each new DAO initiative requiring a multisig, a new 12 signer multisig is set up.\n<ul>\n<li>The signing threshold will be dependent on the total dollar denominated value of the wallet<br>\ni. 5/12: &lt;$1M<br>\nii. 6/12: $1M-$5M<br>\niii. 7/12: $5M-$10m<br>\niiii. 8/12 $10M-$50M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Signers are paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB using spot price at the time of payment. The MSS Chairs will be paid $2500 per month in ARB using the spot price.\n<ul>\n<li>We feel denominating the payment in a $ value is important to ensure the DAO pays a fair price for service rendered without the risk of ARB price movement leading to a series of overpayment or underpayment to signers for their duty.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This will be paid out monthly from the MSS multi-sig, which will be a 6/12 including the entirety of the MSS.\n<ul>\n<li>Payment for multisig signers will only start once the first new multisig is onboarded under the Multisig Support Service MSS structure.</li>\n<li>Existing multi-sigs have the option to “opt in” to the MSS structure. If they do so any existing ring-fenced budget for multisig signing should be sent directly to a new MSS multisig. An MSS Chair will coordinate with the Program to manage the transition process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The same process is repeated to onboard new MSS members 12 months after the first is complete (starting the process 4 months before the term is up to allow for ample time)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We suggest the program is capped at initiatives seeking funding of $50M or less. This will help ensure that the program is not bottlenecked by one single initiative. For programs seeking more than $50M in funding, we suggest inspiration in design be taken from this model while creating a dedicated multisig committee and process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"mss-mechanics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#mss-mechanics-7\"></a>MSS Mechanics</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"who-would-be-a-suitable-multi-sig-signer-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#who-would-be-a-suitable-multi-sig-signer-8\"></a>Who would be a suitable multi-sig signer?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Actively involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem</li>\n<li>Prior experience being on multi-sigs.

(i.e. hack someone’s Telegram and tell the grants program to queue a payment up to the hacker’s wallet).</p>\n<p>An example of this structure</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Disruption Joe, Shawn and Ben can request a msig payment.</li>\n<li>Request made in “PL Payment” Telegram group”</li>\n<li>Supporting evidence of the payment will need to be produced to be reviewed by the signers (a forum post, an invoice, a milestone sign off etc)</li>\n<li>One written approval as indicated by “<img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12\" title=\":+1:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":+1:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">” on the payment message required from Joe, Shawn or Ben. “payment approver” cannot also be by “payment requestor”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the abstraction of responsibility from multisig signers and program operators, this step is important to ensure the security and integrity of fund transfers.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment request: format</strong></p>\n<p>Payment requests should be structured as follows by the “payment requestor”</p>\n<p>Name of supplier | Category | nature of the payment | supporting evidence</p>\n<p>This will allow for multisig approvers to better understand the details of the payment they are being asked to process. Moreover, by ensuring clear supplier name and categorization a more efficient reporting flow can be maintained. The category of payment is to be defined by the program itself (i.e. “Tooling”, “Contributor payment”, “legal fees”). If the DAO wishes to move ahead with Token Flow reporting, r3gen finance will also conduct discovery with each program team to help them define and confirm program reporting categorization at the outset of their program.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"payment-signing-den-implementation-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#payment-signing-den-implementation-11\"></a>Payment signing: Den implementation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>To aid in the efficiency and security of multisig programs at Arbitrum, we propose the implementation of <a href=\"https://www.onchainden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Den</a> across all MSS multisigs.\n<ul>\n<li>Efficiency: Den will automatically notify Arbitrum multisig signers when there is a transaction to sign. It will allow them to see exactly what you’re signing at a glance and cut through the noise by auto-tagging and DMing signers</li>\n<li>Security: Den helps you know what you’re executing and identify malicious transactions. It allows Arbitrum multisig signers to: Simulate and decode transactions before they execute them and see the outcomes of transactions before they are signed. It also helps signers easily understand complex transaction inputs and automatically see what’s behind any address.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"conflict-of-interest-policy-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conflict-of-interest-policy-12\"></a>Conflict of Interest Policy</h4>\n<p>In order to maintain the integrity and impartiality of the MSS, signers must adhere to a strict Conflict of Interest Policy. This policy ensures that all decisions made by MSS signers are in the best interest of the DAO and free from personal gain or undue influence.</p>\n<p>A conflict of interest occurs when an individual’s personal interests interfere, or appear to interfere, with their responsibilities to the DAO. Conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Being directly compensated by the Multi-sig: Receiving payments, reimbursements, or any form of financial benefit directly from the multi-sig for which the signer is responsible (Exclusion for the MSS multisig itself which will be paying it’s signers directly for their services)</li>\n<li>Authoring a Proposal that Funded the Multi-sig: Proposals a signer has authored or co-authored, which directly results in funding or operational changes to the multi-sig.</li>\n<li>Personal or Financial Relationships: Having financial relationships with any parties that stand to benefit directly from the signer’s decisions in relation to the multi-sig operations.</li>\n<li>Other Conflicts: Any other circumstances where the signer’s ability to act in the best interest of the DAO may be compromised.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Procedure in the Event of a Conflict: If a conflict of interest arises, or if a situation arises that could be perceived as a conflict, the signer must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide Disclosure: Promptly disclose the conflict to the other members of the multi-sig committee.</li>\n<li>Recusal: Abstain from participating in discussions and decision-making processes related to the conflict.</li>\n<li>Reduced Signer Multisig: In the scenario that there is a situation deemed a COI, a multisig should be created without this signer(s) included. A new threshold &gt;50% of the total remaining signers should be included. For example, if there are 3 signers with a COI for an initiative, the new multisig for this initiative would maintain 5/9 threshold and total signers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All COI executions must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"removal-of-mss-members-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#removal-of-mss-members-13\"></a>Removal of MSS members</h4>\n<p>There are 2 paths to the removal of an MSS member:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DAO Snapshot: Any DAO member can propose a Snapshot vote to remove an MSS signer. The proposal should clearly state the reasons for removal and provide evidence supporting the claims. A simple majority of votes cast by the DAO members is required for the removal to be approved with an 80M ARB Quorum (defined as total ARB votes).</li>\n<li>MSS Member Agreement: If at least 50% of MSS members (6 out of 12 members) agree that a signer should be removed due to breach of duties or conflict of interest, they can initiate the removal process internally. The agreement must be documented and publicly disclosed to maintain transparency. Analytics on signer activity from Den may be used as supporting evidence.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a member is removed via the DAO Snapshot or MSS Member Agreement the member will immediately lose further compensation. Once a member is removed, the following steps will be taken to ensure continuity and maintain the governance structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interim Measures: The MSS may appoint an interim member to serve temporarily until a new member is officially elected. The 3 chairs will collaborate and decide how to select the new member.</li>\n<li>Subsequent Snapshot: A subsequent Snapshot vote will be held to elect a new MSS member. This ensures that the DAO participates in selecting a new signer, maintaining democratic and transparent governance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All removal proceedings, details around the new signer, and the reasons for the removal must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"expectations-of-mss-members-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#expectations-of-mss-members-14\"></a>Expectations of MSS members</h4>\n<p>Transactions are expected to be promptly (within 24 hours) reviewed by all signers, and if approved through the process outlined above, signed. While we realise that there will be times when a signer may not have internet access or some other deterrent to signing, these are expected to be few and far between.

[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong><br>\n<strong>New major protocol feature laucnhed based on STIP learnings</strong></p>\n<p>MUX Degen Protocol</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The lack of market diversity and low listing time efficiency has been a long-standing bottleneck for on-chain perps protocol. Although MUX was able to offer 140+ markets as an aggregator (thanks to all the integrated protocols), it still couldn’t offer trendy markets with higher efficiency like CEXes. During the bull markets, faster listing speed is critical to onboarding &amp; retaining traders.</li>\n<li>As MUX onboarded more users during the previous STIP, MUX received more users’ requests for trendy markets listings, and this motivated MUX to design and launch the MUX Degen Protocol that can launch trendy long-tail asset markets timely. The MUX Degen Protocol is exclusively available on Arbitrum.\n<ul>\n<li>Upon launch, the MUX Degen Protocol has been integrated into the MUX Aggregator.</li>\n<li>The MUX Degen Protocol has listed 8 markets since launch: $BOME, $ETHFI, $ENA, $W, $TNSR, $SAGA, $TAO, $REZ.</li>\n<li>Since the MUX Degen Protocol is exclusively available on Arbitrum, MUX aims to use the Degen Protocol to continuously onboard more organic traders to the ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MUXLP Tranches</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The MUXLP pool is a multi-asset pool that serves as traders’ counterparty. LPs will earn a portion of the protocol fees and additional MUX token rewards but also bear positions holding related risks.</li>\n<li>MUXLP yield greatly benefited from the increased trading volume during STIP, and more LPs were onboarded. MUX contributors learned from LP feedback that offering pools tailored for LPs with different risk-exposure preferences can help to onboard and retain more LPs. To meet the demands of LPs with different risk-exposure preferences, MUX has released a risk-free senior tranche and leveraged mining junior tranche on top of the MUXLP pool.</li>\n<li>Senior Tranche\n<ul>\n<li>The senior tranche is a delta-neutral USDC-only pool that will lend liquidity to the junior tranche. The senior tranche’s yield will derive from a portion of the junior tranche’s income. LP’s principals in the senior tranche won’t be affected by market volatility; the junior tranche strategies &amp; liquidation setup will ensure the principals supplied from the senior tranche won’t bear any losses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Junior Tranche\n<ul>\n<li>The junior tranche, a MUXLP leveraged mining pool, offers the potential for exciting leveraged MUXLP yield. Its strategies will use up to 2.5x leverage, amplifying LP’s potential returns. However, junior tranche LPs will also face default and auto-deleveraging risks, and there are liquidation risks associated with using the junior tranche. Junior tranche LP’s principals will be affected when liquidation happens.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>MUXLP tranches users earn <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#RealYield</span> in the form of $USDC tokens weekly from MUXLP income. By offering additional $ARB token incentives for LPs, the pool size can potentially increase to support more trading demand and initiate a flywheel effect with the trading incentives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incentivization Strategy Takeaways</strong></p>\n<p>During the previous STIP, MUX rebated up to 100% open &amp; close fees for all integrated protocols on the MUX aggregator with the goal of aggressively onboarding more traders to Aribtrum. MUX witnessed notable volume and DAU growth during the campaign; however, based on the aggregator data from 30-day-before, 30-day-after and during the STIP program, although the incentives can stimulate more trading activities during drastic market movements, natural market volatility is still the main factor to drive trading volume, and the incentives serve as an additional boost.<br>\n<strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8127cbd92280309941fb9d4a0aa7400bfb6c13e4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/iqyR7Eik8hi6F6xd94lCW7RvvLe.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8127cbd92280309941fb9d4a0aa7400bfb6c13e4_2_624x336.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"iqyR7Eik8hi6F6xd94lCW7RvvLe\" width=\"624\" height=\"336\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8127cbd92280309941fb9d4a0aa7400bfb6c13e4_2_624x336.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8127cbd92280309941fb9d4a0aa7400bfb6c13e4_2_936x504.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8127cbd92280309941fb9d4a0aa7400bfb6c13e4_2_1248x672.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F6F2\"></a></strong></div><br>\nSince volatility is the core volume driver, incentives should serve as an additional stimulus for cost-sensitive traders to generate more volume when they prefer to trade.

Since the expected duration of STIP is 3 months, the rebate rate can be potentially adjusted along the way based on the grant spending speed.\n<ul>\n<li>Compared with the previous STIP, the max rebate rate has been updated from 100% to 75%.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If the rebate rates need to be adjusted according to grant spending speed and market conditions, MUX will notify the community before making any changes.</li>\n<li>The final rebate rate will be based on the users’ actual fees spent. If the integrated protocols offer additional rebates/rewards separately, MUX will ensure the final total rebates won’t exceed the fees paid.</li>\n<li>No wash trading or Sybil-attack-related activities are allowed. MUX contributors will apply the same anti-wash-trading from the previous STIP to closely monitor related activities from this campaign; Addresses involving wash trading or Sybil-attack-related activities will be published and excluded from receiving the rebates.\n<ul>\n<li>In the previous STIP, MUX protocol had one of the lowest sybil rates of 0.270%</li>\n<li>MUX contributors reserve the right to identify any Sybil-attack-related addresses and exclude them from the incentive program.</li>\n<li>The anti-wash-trading &amp; anti-sybil-attack rules will remain unrevealed. Otherwise, the rules can be abused with planned strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tentatively, 45% of the grant will be utilized to increase yield for the MUXLP tranches on Arbitrum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100% of the MUXLP tranches liquidity is on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>MUXLP tranches are built based on the MUXLP pool while meeting more diverse risk-exposure preferences from LPs. The goal is to onboard more LPs and increase LP retention.\n<ul>\n<li>As more high-yield farming opportunities appear during the bull market to win LPs, the leveraged-mining Junior Tranche is designed to attract more LPs with higher yield based on MUXLP income.</li>\n<li>The delta-neutral Senior Tranche is tailored for LPs needing risk-free farming opportunities without worrying about principal drawdown.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>MUX aims to effectively incentivize the tranches to increase LP adoption and retention for the ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10.</strong> <strong>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong><br>\nAddresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funding Address: 0x4Fa610DD115e790B8768A482Fc366803534e9Adc</li>\n<li>Funding Address Characteristics: 2/3 multisig</li>\n<li>Contract Address: 0xe21d366d5042F713C0C872591e610fB6a74C775b</li>\n<li>No changes compared to the previous STIP proposal</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>11. Could you share any feedback or suggestion on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong><br>\nThe incentive programs significantly boost protocol adoption and accelerate protocol PMF testing and improvements. The protocol submission, review, and individual voting process could’ve caused hassles for participants, delegates, advisors, and PMs, but for something that only happens a few times a year, the more decentralized process is reasonable.</p>\n<p>We propose an enhancement to the grant cap tier system, which will be based on relative protocol and sector metrics. This system will define the stage of the applicant protocol, offering more open opportunities while using a pre-determined guideline. The key benefit of this system is its potential to streamline the process, making it more efficient and effective for all participants.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower cap tier for relatively new kickstarter protocols that have innovative offerings but has limited track record, TVL, DAU, volume, etc.</li>\n<li>Mid cap tier for protocols with proven pmf, innovative offerings growing metrics, and a convincing reason for why the grant can help to accelerate adoption</li>\n<li>Higher cap tier for protocols with prominent TVL, volume, revenue and community to help with further adoption and more exposure for the ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Establishing a more dedicated Arbitrum incentive programs channel and Twitter page is also crucial. The dedicated channel can be a central hub for sharing all incentive programs’ existence and core progress. Currently, we have multiple separate Telegram channels for different programs, but they might not be effective enough to keep all intended applicants informed. A dedicated platform will ensure better communication and increased awareness, benefiting all participants involved in the process.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/mux-protocol-stip-addendum/23726\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/mux-protocol-stip-addendum/23726","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 18:58:31 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23726"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/mux-protocol-stip-addendum/23726.rss","#text":"MUX Protocol STIP Addendum"}},{"title":"Updates to the STIP Bridge Timeline","dc:creator":"Matt_StableLab","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h2><a name=\"extension-of-the-application-deadline-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#extension-of-the-application-deadline-1\"></a>Extension of the Application Deadline</h2>\n<p>Due to the many STIP /Backfund protocols missing the May 3rd Deadline, we are extending the deadline to apply to Tuesday, May 14th at 11:59 PM UTC.</p>\n<p>However, any Applications submitted after the initial May 3rd deadline will automatically require a challenge snapshot.</p>\n<p>All challenge snapshots posted must receive at least 66% of the votes in favor of funding (Excluding abstain votes) in order to receive their bridge funding.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-to-apply-late-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-to-apply-late-2\"></a>How to Apply Late</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new forum thread in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/stip-bridge-addendum/29\">STIP Bridge section</a> of the forum</li>\n<li>Title thread [Protocol Name] STIP Addendum</li>\n<li>After creating an addendum thread, Applicants will be assigned an Advisor</li>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdpAZAopmragWobcY3MdlROJN0hU3y_cAn0JOkdpsOE/edit?usp=sharing\">Addendum Template</a> to apply</li>\n<li>Applicants will then have until May 14th at 6:00 PM UTC to work with their advisor and finalize their addendum</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"extension-of-the-challenge-and-review-period-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#extension-of-the-challenge-and-review-period-3\"></a>Extension of the Challenge and Review Period</h2>\n<p>To give delegates more time to evaluate the success of STIP campaigns we will be extending the Challenge and review period until Monday, May 20th at 5:00 PM UTC</p>\n<p>The ARDC will be posting an analysis and report of the STIP to give delegates a better understanding of which protocols were successful in their STIP campaigns.</p>\n<p>Challenge Snapshots will now all start Monday, May 20th at 6:00 PM UTC.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-happens-during-the-challenge-and-review-period-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-happens-during-the-challenge-and-review-period-4\"></a>What Happens During the Challenge and Review Period</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Challenge and Review Period will run until May 20th, 5:00 PM UTC.</li>\n<li>Delegates will review the addendums to identify applicants they believe need further review before being funded.

While we are all for helping protocols provide their users with incentives, we shouldn’t forget that protocols should grow because they have a strong product that is being used, not because they’re giving away free money courtesy of the DAO.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, incentives are meant to highlight protocols’ competitive advantages by incentivizing users to try them. Incentives are not meant to <em>be a</em> competitive advantage in and of themselves.</p>\n<p>We’ve found ourselves in a precarious position where if some protocols do not receive incentives, they’re at a disadvantage to the ones that do, and they are driven away from building on Arbitrum because they cannot compete.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"taming-a-necessary-evil-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#taming-a-necessary-evil-2\"></a>Taming a necessary evil</h3>\n<p>Overall, incentives are a necessary evil for any ecosystem in the current landscape of crypto, including Arbitrum. They help boost numbers and make the ecosystem more appealing to users on other chains for them to move their capital over. They help users explore and experiment with different protocols to learn about what they have to offer, and they help protocols get more users to try them.</p>\n<p>However, the very existence of incentives creates a power imbalance between the biggest and most well-established protocols and the newer ones, especially the ones that haven’t yet deployed on Arbitrum. It creates an inherent competitive disadvantage, fosters a monopolistic mindset, and eventually drives builders away from Arbitrum which is a net negative for the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we need to find a way to leverage the advantage of offering incentives while mitigating the downside mentioned above.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"a-not-so-random-solution-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#a-not-so-random-solution-3\"></a>A not-so-random solution?</h3>\n<p>While internally thinking and discussing the different incentives program proposals we’ve had so far (STIP, Backfund, LTIPP and STIP Bridge), and how they all fit together, we realized that each of them had attempted in one way or another to mitigate the implications of some protocols having incentives while others didn’t.</p>\n<p>After brainstorming, we came up with an experimental approach that could prove to be a solution to the problems outlined above. Its goal is to unify the incentive programs wherever applicable so protocols under the same vertical do not compete with each other on the amount of incentives they provide. For example, the DAO should avoid situations where we are providing different amounts of incentives to 2 different DEXs if they both want to incentivize liquidity provision for an ARB/ETH pair — the amount of incentives shouldn’t be the only differentiating factor.</p>\n<p>We should find ways to be flexible in the distribution of incentives so protocols can leverage and showcase their unique features. Instead of creating a rigid rubric and asking every protocol to fit in it, we (e.g. the LTIPP council and application advisors) should work with protocols to make their incentive structure eligible for funding. As the famous quote goes, “You don’t judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree”.</p>\n<p>We’ve come up with a process that goes against the initial instincts of how an incentives program should work, but we believe it makes sense the more we think about it. On a high level, it looks like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protocols apply not to receive incentives, but to become eligible for receiving them. Similar to how the ADPC creates a list of whitelisted service providers, we’ll create a list of protocols that are eligible for receiving incentives. Eligibility basically means that they have a structured plan to distribute the incentives and they meet some minimum requirements.</li>\n<li>Every epoch (for example every month), we sample the projects from the list and randomly choose a few that will receive incentives for that epoch.</li>\n<li>The sampling should be done vertically (e.g. dex, yield, games, etc) and there should be mechanisms in place to prevent cases of protocols being “sure” that they’ll get incentives (e.g. if only 2 protocols exist under a vertical). We should also ensure that the chosen projects are rotating so no single protocol has over 2 consecutive epochs of incentives, even if by simple luck.</li>\n<li>The amount of incentives should somehow be normalized per epoch and per vertical so there are no big discrepancies between protocols of relatively same size. It is expected that protocols with more/less users will need more/less incentives, but that should be determined by the council in advance, as part of the protocol’s eligibility. This specific point should be discussed separately as it’s a broader topic and we will address it further in a separate post.</li>\n<li>Ideally, protocols receiving incentives should commit to some marketing effort during the epoch when they’re receiving incentives. For example, a multi-chain protocol should urge its users to use Arbitrum while incentives are running. This specific point should be discussed separately as it’s a broader topic and we will address it further in a separate post.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"why-selecting-at-random-might-make-sense-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#why-selecting-at-random-might-make-sense-4\"></a>Why selecting at random might make sense</h3>\n<p>The reasons why we thought about selecting a few protocols at random every epoch on a rotating basis are many:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incentives can act in a more targeted way to attract users.</li>\n<li>We can have a better sense of how effective incentives are at attracting users over a shorter period of time.</li>\n<li>Protocols under the same vertical won’t have to compete with all other protocols under the same vertical at the same time.</li>\n<li>We won’t have to play favorites as each protocol will have the same chance to be selected if they’re eligible.</li>\n<li>Makes protocols focus more on building cool products that stand out.</li>\n<li>Encourages users to seek which protocols have incentives during a given epoch and try them out.</li>\n<li>Enables the incentives program to be an ongoing thing that protocols can join at any time and reduces governance overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-thoughts-on-the-end-game-perpetual-incentives-program/23720\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-thoughts-on-the-end-game-perpetual-incentives-program/23720","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 16:42:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23720"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-thoughts-on-the-end-game-perpetual-incentives-program/23720.rss","#text":"[RFC] Thoughts on the End-Game Perpetual Incentives Program"}},{"title":"ARDC DAO Advocate Discussion with Arbitrum DAO","dc:creator":"Sinkas","category":"Governance","description":"<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re hosting a call on <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/yng-nrnu-jms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Friday 10th of May at 1 pm UTC / 9 am EST / 9 pm SGT</a> to discuss with delegates and other governance contributors about how the ARDC can potentially help their initiative.</li>\n<li>The call is open to anyone to participate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Arbitrum Research and Development Collective (ARDC) was established to assist the DAO with reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement.

We are incredibly thankful to the Arbitrum community for the opportunity.</p>\n<p>With that being said, we decided not to apply for the STIP Bridge since <strong>we are currently working on Rysk v2. For this reason we don’t believe that asking for the STIP bridge incentives for Rysk will be the best ROI for the Arbitrum DAO</strong>. In the current state these incentives would not prove to be as beneficial as the ones during STIP.</p>\n<p>We are thankful to the Arbitrum DAO and we remain aligned with their long term vision; for this reason we would feel more comfortable returning and applying for future grants when appropriate, where they can have higher ROI for both Rysk and the DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"kpis-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#kpis-1\"></a>KPIs</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"depositors-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#depositors-2\"></a>Depositors</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/aa6e6b9f8e66810f167e896d4fb6dfb227666100.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ojHKaeUI9jK7tNSVuqfakv1l7Xi.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/aa6e6b9f8e66810f167e896d4fb6dfb227666100_2_690x341.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ojHKaeUI9jK7tNSVuqfakv1l7Xi\" width=\"690\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/aa6e6b9f8e66810f167e896d4fb6dfb227666100_2_690x341.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/aa6e6b9f8e66810f167e896d4fb6dfb227666100.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/aa6e6b9f8e66810f167e896d4fb6dfb227666100.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"BCBBBB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>New depositors showed an increase with the STIP start with another larger spike at the beginning of the year after delivering a track record of consistent high return with base yield + ARB rewards (see analysis below).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"returns-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#returns-3\"></a>Returns</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6a38a7021a7ab2de817c678d28d6fc92fcb4221d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/f9FZjNT6tLXylZGSQ43NZnCW4Q5.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6a38a7021a7ab2de817c678d28d6fc92fcb4221d.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"f9FZjNT6tLXylZGSQ43NZnCW4Q5\" width=\"690\" height=\"321\" data-dominant-color=\"FAFAFA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Cumulated weekly returns (base + STIP incentive) for Depositors were ~18% since the start of STIP (~48% annualized).

Overall during the STIP we were able to on-board many options traders and record ATH volumes and position as a top protocol by volume.</p>\n<p>Some of those traders are still trading after the STIP and even more importantly provided feedbacks, ideas and data on how to improve the product and build the future of Rysk</p>\n<h3><a name=\"lps-liquidity-is-critical-but-very-mercenary-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#lps-liquidity-is-critical-but-very-mercenary-10\"></a>LPs liquidity is critical but very mercenary</h3>\n<p>For pool based products like Rysk DHV having enough liquidity in the pool to sustain volumes is critical. Despite Rysk being one of the most capital efficient protocol in terms of Volume / TVL, a lack of TVL leads to a drop in volume due to the size traders can enter on. Once the STIP weekly distribution extended, reducing the amount distributed per week, many users withdrew and deposited into other Arbitrum protocols with STIP. Compared to traders, depositors were harder to keep around, reducing the effect of the flywheel.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"multi-protocol-short-term-incentive-programs-are-great-marketing-but-also-increase-mercenary-flows-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#multi-protocol-short-term-incentive-programs-are-great-marketing-but-also-increase-mercenary-flows-11\"></a>Multi-protocol short term incentive programs are great marketing but also increase mercenary flows</h3>\n<p>The impact of STIP was net positive for Rysk. One of the main advantage was the reputation and marketing directly provided by the STIP and other protocols in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Overall a multi protocol program like the STIP is definitely net positive. But from a protocol perspective there is also a downside effect due to the mercenary liquidity that they can attract. With Rysk we realized on the LP side that depositors where very quick to move liquidity to the best opportunity in the ecosystem and during a program like STIP there are many running in parallel making it very hard to retain users, unless offering higher incentives than other protocols. From an ecosystem perspective it creates a competition among protocols on the incentives distribution to attract LPs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rysk-v2-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rysk-v2-12\"></a>Rysk v2</h3>\n<p>The STIP provided Rysk with a great opportunity for growth along with the collection of user data and feedback. We learned that traders enjoyed the trading experience at Rysk, and STIP was an effective tool for onboarding new traders. Based on these insights, we are developing Rysk V2, with the core mission of generating a stable flow of volume and returns. For this reason, we believe that embarking on a STIP Bridge at this stage might not be very effective for Rysk’s growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem and we would rather apply for a future program with Rysk v2 where the ROI can be much more effective.</p>\n<p>Rysk v2 is focused on implementing solutions to the liquidity stickiness issues seen in the STIP. We expect to return with a more rounded, robust, and targeted product.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rysk-stip-addendum-forfeit/23703\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rysk-stip-addendum-forfeit/23703","pubDate":"Tue, 07 May 2024 17:07:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23703"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rysk-stip-addendum-forfeit/23703.rss","#text":"Rysk STIP Addendum Forfeit"}},{"title":"7 May 2024 - Open Discussion of Proposals Governance Call","dc:creator":"cliffton.eth","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Hey folks!</p>\n<p>The link to join the governance call to discuss the proposal pipeline and notable discussions is on the <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Warsaw\">governance calendar</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 7, 2024</p>\n<p><strong>Time:</strong> 4:00 pm UTC</p>\n<p><strong>Link to join:</strong> <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/kvr-bpnx-zix\">https://meet.google.com/kvr-bpnx-zix</a></p>\n<p>The agenda below will be fluid.

As per STIP guidelines, projects were mandated to distribute their entire grant allocation by March 29, 2024, with any surplus funds being returned to the Arbitrum Multisig. This resulted in the return of approximately 736k claimed ARB tokens at the end of the STIP.</p>\n<p>Due to varying initial distribution dates for each project, we established a cut-off date for assessing performance metrics relative to the respective initial distribution dates. To normalize these metrics, we divided growth indicators by the value of ARB claimed, utilizing the average price of the ARB token from November 3 to March 29, 2024.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ecosystem-analysis-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ecosystem-analysis-2\"></a>Ecosystem Analysis</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"key-takeaways-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-takeaways-3\"></a>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Protocols supported by the STIP outpaced non-STIP protocols on Arbitrum in TVL growth by 82.6 percentage points.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum added more than 94,000 daily active users throughout the STIP.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum realized an 101.9% increase in transaction volume, exceeding 1 million transactions per day by the end of the STIP.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"tvl-and-dau-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tvl-and-dau-4\"></a>TVL and DAU</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d8290600de21b7d8ad4175f4f3cd38395e8b6c5d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uQf1BLLB5qkgd3Hu5lrg26qPLR3.png?dl=1\" title=\"|624x351.33365019011404\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d8290600de21b7d8ad4175f4f3cd38395e8b6c5d_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"|624x351.33365019011404\" data-base62-sha1=\"uQf1BLLB5qkgd3Hu5lrg26qPLR3\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d8290600de21b7d8ad4175f4f3cd38395e8b6c5d_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d8290600de21b7d8ad4175f4f3cd38395e8b6c5d_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d8290600de21b7d8ad4175f4f3cd38395e8b6c5d_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F5F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>During the STIP period from November 3 to March 29, 2024, Arbitrum experienced remarkable growth in both Total Value Locked (TVL) and Daily Active Users (DAU).</p>\n<p>The TVL on Arbitrum increased by more than $1.31 billion, surpassing the combined nominal growth on Optimism and Base. Notably, protocols supported by the STIP collectively realized a 118.2% increase in TVL over the same period, constituting approximately 75.8% of the total TVL growth on Arbitrum. In contrast, non-STIP protocols on Arbitrum collectively increased their TVL by 35.6%, underscoring the significant outperformance of STIP grantees, whose TVL growth surpassed that of non-STIP projects by 82.6 percentage points.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum saw a notable 76.4% increase in DAU, adding around 94,000 new daily users. While Base experienced a larger surge of 136,000 DAU and surpassed Arbitrum, Arbitrum still outpaced Optimism by approximately 46,000 users.</p>\n<p>An essential gauge for assessing the effectiveness of the STIP incentives is the normalized growth relative to the claimed ARB grants. When applying individual cut-off dates to account for each protocol’s initial incentive distributions, STIP grantees collectively generated $13.95 in TVL growth for every $1 of ARB incentives claimed and added 37 additional users engaging on a daily basis per 100,000 ARB claimed. Excluding Galxe, this figure rises to 57 additional users.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"transaction-count-and-fees-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#transaction-count-and-fees-5\"></a>Transaction Count and Fees</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ih8y4okd5UBBbW8nG8KiBjeq31E.png?dl=1\" title=\"|624x351.33365019011404\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"|624x351.33365019011404\" data-base62-sha1=\"ih8y4okd5UBBbW8nG8KiBjeq31E\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F4F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The transaction volume on Arbitrum increased by 101.9%, exceeding 1 million transactions per day by the end of the STIP. While this increase of over 577,000 transactions outpaced Optimism in nominal growth, it slightly underperformed Base by approximately 14,000 transactions. In December, the Arbitrum One sequencer experienced a brief outage, resulting in a backlog of transactions. Upon restoration, the network processed an all-time high of over 5 million transactions, briefly elevating transaction counts and fee metrics. Subsequently, transaction volumes began to rise again in March, coinciding with the network’s introduction of blob transactions, which notably reduced user transaction fees paid in ETH.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"efficacy-across-verticals-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#efficacy-across-verticals-6\"></a>Efficacy Across Verticals</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"key-takeaways-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-takeaways-7\"></a>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pendle outperformed all grantees in TVL growth, gaining an incremental $150.01 per ARB claimed.</li>\n<li>Balancer demonstrated the highest efficiency in increasing daily user activity relative to claimed ARB</li>\n<li>Gamma stood out as the leader in annualized fee growth relative to claimed ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"tvl-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tvl-8\"></a>TVL</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hBdxXgjKAuzcKqnl3KzFzWkF71I.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hBdxXgjKAuzcKqnl3KzFzWkF71I\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF0F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Among the DeFi verticals, the yield category emerged as the frontrunner in TVL growth, increasing by 647.5%.

Normalized by claimed ARB, this growth equates to an additional $2.61 in TVL. Notably, perpetuals have shown to be six times less efficient in attracting TVL through incentives compared to the DEX category, reflecting differing incentive structures. Perpetuals incentivize traders directly through volume-based incentives or trading fee rebates, while DEXs focus solely on incentivizing liquidity providers.</p>\n<p>Vertex emerged as a standout performer within the perpetuals category, contributing to 66% of the nominal TVL growth. Moreover, Vertex demonstrated superior efficiency in increasing TVL with incentives, being at least 5 times more effective than other protocols within the perpetuals category.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that GMX’s ARB grant was utilized to incentivize the adoption of GMX V2. By the end of the STIP, GMX V2’s share of the protocol’s TVL increased from 20% to 68%, indicating a successful migration of liquidity from V1 to V2. Normalized, this $217 million increase in TVL for GMX V2 translates to an additional $11.30 per dollar of ARB claimed, positioning GMX V2 as a close contender to Vertex in terms of incentive-driven TVL growth.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"fees-and-volume-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#fees-and-volume-21\"></a>Fees and Volume</h4>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qkVcs4uw5PZ3PhVeyzEvdmXIoro.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"qkVcs4uw5PZ3PhVeyzEvdmXIoro\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F4F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The perpetuals category realized a $102.3M increase in annualized fees compared to the pre-incentive figures.

Through examining a range of KPIs, it’s evident that STIP-supported projects have made substantial strides in enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem’s vitality and growth.</p>\n<p>One of the most notable observations is the outperformance of STIP grantees compared to non-STIP protocols. Protocols supported by the STIP accounted for 75.8% of the nominal TVL growth on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, vertical analysis revealed nuanced trends within different sectors. While the DEX category demonstrated the highest efficiency in attracting new users relative to incentives claimed, the lending category led in efficiency for attracting TVL. Additionally, perpetuals showed lower efficiency in attracting TVL compared to DEXs but demonstrated the highest efficiency in increasing trading volume.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the findings from the STIP highlight the pivotal role of incentives in fostering ecosystem development and user engagement on Arbitrum. Moving forward, continued assessment and refinement of incentive mechanisms will be crucial in sustaining growth momentum and ensuring the long-term success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"about-openblock-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#about-openblock-23\"></a>About OpenBlock</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://openblocklabs.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenBlock</a> is a data-driven platform dedicated to incentive engineering, fostering sustainable growth within decentralized protocols.

This company is being built by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattFiebach\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Matt Fiebach</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swmartin19\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sam Martin</a>, and bootstrapped with the help of the Arbitrum Foundation as a grant recipient.</p>\n<p>We were the first two employees at <a href=\"https://www.blockworksresearch.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockworks Research</a>, where we built a Saas-based research product offering deep investment insights to institutional crypto investors via long-form research, onchain analytics, and a governance screener. Matt spearheaded the services and governance operations, while Sam focused on the product and day-to-day operations. We scaled a team from 0 to 14 people, grew a daily newsletter and a twitter/X account to 10’s of thousands of readers/followers, launched and hosted the 0xResearch podcast, and more. We have developed vast networks within the crypto industry, and plan to leverage that network and experience to help the Arbitrum DAO operate more efficiently, effectively, and professionally.</p>\n<p>We have identified some pain points within Arbitrum DAO through our experience working directly with the DAO over the past year. Some of these problems include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>● DAO Alignment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO does not have a neutral party to broker proposals, ensure high quality RFP applicants, and generally serve as the steward for proposals. The DAO doesn’t know the ulterior motives and incentives of proposal authors, and there is often a lack of alignment between both of these entities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Collective Action Problem &amp; Proposal Stalemate</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Situations where there is a recognized need or solution that would benefit the broader ecosystem, but individual actors lack sufficient incentives to take action due to asymmetric benefits/costs. There is a lack of dedicated resources to execute strategies and see them through the lifecycle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Procuring &amp; Maintaining Contributors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Arbitrum DAO has trouble attracting full-time, high quality talent given its lack of ability to hire/employ these individuals. There is no incentive to be a full-time DAO contributor. Even with economic incentives (eg ARDC,) many of the top businesses within the industry at their respective specialty miss on these opportunities simply because they are unaware of the opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Strategic Partner Onboarding &amp; Growth</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Arbitrum DAO primarily relies on the Foundation as its BD arm, but having an additional Arbitrum aligned entity to assist in finding strategic partners could yield a richer set of partners to choose from.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Stakeholder Relations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information pipelines are broken between key stakeholders of the Arbitrum network including the Delegates, Protocols, the Foundation, Offchain Labs, and other service providers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We started Entropy Advisors to alleviate some of these problems within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This list is non-exhaustive, and we would love to know if the community sees any pain points that Entropy could help solve.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Firstly, our product addresses the pressing need for high, stable and sustainable yield opportunities in the institutional DeFi space. We provide diversified yields sourced from real-world private credit assets, akin to MakerDAO’s approach with RWA. This strategy is poised to attract larger risk-averse DAO treasuries, offering yields derived from real-world assets, which presents a less volatile alternative to yields based on token emissions. Additionally, these yields are stable due to the lack of correlation of returns with both crypto assets and traditional public market risky assets such as equities and bonds, further enhancing their appeal to institutional investors seeking reliable investment options.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we are poised to drive significant innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Our proprietary Credit Analytics platform processes millions of loan data points, providing real-time credit and fraud insights, backed by six years of proprietary data from various lending sectors in Southeast Asia. With the unique position of being the sole RWA private credit platform with a track record of 6 years, we are able to leverage extensive loan data to incorporate machine learning for accurate default prediction, enhancing our private credit deal origination at HELIX for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, as we scale beyond Southeast Asia and APAC, where we are sourcing our immediate set of highly curated deals leveraging Helicap’s deal origination capabilities, we have a planned decentralized credit approver mechanism that will continue to ensure the quality of deals brought onto the platform. These credit approvers will not be random token holders; instead, they will comprise a thoroughly vetted panel of global credit institutions and individual credit professionals like CPAs and CFAs with a proven track record in the private credit space. They will be incentivized to perform credit due diligence. Leveraging HELIX’s proprietary credit analytics and other aspects of each deal, they will provide detailed credit memos. A deal will only be made available to lenders on the platform if a majority of the Credit Approvers have approved it. We envision that these approvers will be akin to real-world credit agencies such as S&amp;P, Moody’s, and Fitch, where no single loan is approved by just one agency but by multiple agencies. Moreover, these approvers can be integrated with other future private credit protocols, enhancing their composability and utility.</p>\n<p>Fourthly, as HELIX is targeting institutions, this will not only enhance the reputation of Arbitrum as an institutional-grade Layer 2 solution but also secure more sticky and long-term TVL that doesn’t dissipate like retail investments in a bear market.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we are looking to address financial inclusion in emerging markets. These loans will support borrowers in underserved sectors such as consumer, agriculture, education, and SMEs, generating meaningful real-world changes.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Our strategies are designed to maximize returns by balancing risk and reward efficiently, drawing on our team’s deep expertise in hedge fund management and derivatives, and institutional grade infrastructure.</p>\n<p>From the Arbitrum perspective, the strong competitive advantage of our ARB++ managed strategy over other proposals is that it doesn’t require the Foundation to sell any ARB, which may be less optimal from an optics standpoint, while also driving additional ARB token volume throughout the ecosystem as collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Yield:</strong><br>\nD2 Finance’s approach to generating risk adjusted returns is deeply rooted in sophisticated active trading strategies, similar to those utilized by market makers and asset management firms. These strategies are inherently subject to market volatility and are designed to capitalize on this volatility to achieve a positive expected value (EV) over the long term. Thus we do not advertise a base yield at the start of an epoch; instead, our yield is dynamically generated based on the performance of our active trading strategies.</p>\n<p>D2 brings the sophistication of a top tier hedge fund, 100% on-chain, 100% non-custodial</p>\n<p><strong>ETH++ Strategy:</strong> 84.3% ROI (247% annualized) since inception 22 Dec 2023.
