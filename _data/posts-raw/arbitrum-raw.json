While we have an awesome on-chain governance through tally, Snapshot really helps us in getting sentiment checks on a lot of proposals. The problem we have had, over time, is the limitation of options available to fit our needs. Let’s add a few examples.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>elections of council/advisors in ltipp: users could select 5 members for council, 3 for advisors, some selected just one, some others all the available choices. While selecting only one is something that has a merit, selecting all translated in non legal votes</li>\n<li>ratification of decisions of the council for LTIPP votes on single protocols: we were constraints in putting up 77 proposals, and delegates have to vote on 77 different snapshots. We could have had, instead, put up for example 5 proposals with 16 options, one for each protocol, saying “yes/no/abstain”, so that loading the proposals would have been faster, and voting on proposals, while requiring still time for scrutiny, would have been effectively faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are the 2 main examples that came to my mind, involving</p>\n<ul>\n<li>imposing a minimum/maximum amount of selections in a multi choices snapshot</li>\n<li>create batch voting with no internal weights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Idea is to discuss here if DAO feels the above is useful, throw in the forum some more potential ideas, contact snapshot, define a cost, write a formal proposal, and then vote and execute. One thing that also has to be discussed is how this would be effectively execute, it doesn’t make sense to create a new multisig for this, so maybe we could leverage infrastructure and committee we have now already.</p>\n<p>Just to give some context: i have already taken contact with snapshot to understand if the above was possible, and the terms. We are talking accordingly to some initial findings about developments that should take a few weeks in the order of potentially 10-15k usd each. <strong>Please don’t take the numbers above as any hard promise</strong> on their side, nor anything. This is me just coming forward to have an estimate of the resources (time + capital) that we would need to move it forward on.</p>\n<p>If the DAO also finds the above just too much of a burden for the relative low amount, we could likely pursue other roads like questbook to make it done. But again, I am interested in gathering some opinions on the value, after chatting with a few delegates that were positive on it.</p>\n<p>You friendly arbitrum cow.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-custom-developments-for-the-arbitrum-snapshot/23180\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-custom-developments-for-the-arbitrum-snapshot/23180","pubDate":"Sat, 13 Apr 2024 02:17:25 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23180"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-custom-developments-for-the-arbitrum-snapshot/23180.rss","#text":"[RFC] Custom developments for the Arbitrum Snapshot"}},{"title":"Oracles and LTIPP","dc:creator":"Ken_x3","category":"General","description":"<p>I believe that supporting Pyth over other oracles that are live on Arbitrum, particularly with such a large grant (which I’m not sure how they will actually use, given users pay for the oracle updates), needs to be considered at a wider level across the DAO.</p>\n<p>The LTIPP outlined incentives for DeFi protocols to attract liquidity and thus I do not see how 1m ARB to Pyth aligns to the purpose of LTIPP. Maybe I missed something around how the funds will be used and would welcome any further understanding here.</p>\n<p>Moreso, from the commentary of the council members any technical aspects of oracles in their decision making are lacking. Most recently we saw stale oracle prices created due to congestion/block issues on solana (as per Chaos Labs <a href=\"https://x.com/halcyonprice/status/1778592172151128572?s=46\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">tweet</a>). There should be consideration of these technical factors and risks involved if the DAO is to support further adoption of the oracle. Perhaps there should be a separate DAO initiative for supporting oracles that is more equitable and considers the nuances of oracles as a crucial component of DeFi.</p>\n<p>I also do not think that this means Pyth should not be supported in this instance, more so keen to start a conversation around a fairer playing field for oracles within the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/oracles-and-ltipp/23172\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/oracles-and-ltipp/23172","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Apr 2024 12:19:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23172"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/oracles-and-ltipp/23172.rss","#text":"Oracles and LTIPP"}},{"title":"March 2024 Election Compliance","dc:creator":"Arbitrum","category":"Security Council Elections","description":"<p>The compliance stage of the March 2024 Security Council elections has come to an end.

This grant helped Abracadabra grow, and due to the nature of the protocol, this growth trickled down and impacted all partners the DAO worked with.</p>\n<p>Here’s a summary of how the funds were utilized and their impact.</p>\n<p>As per the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/abracadabra-dao-mim-final-stip-round-1/\">original proposal</a>, the goals were for Abracadabra to develop new Arbitrum-native products and use the grant in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deepen MIM Liquidity on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Increase the share of MIM circulating on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Increase the native Arbitrum borrowings</li>\n<li>Create a MIM Savings Rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we exceeded most of the KPIs proposed, some changes were made to the original proposal as the program developed in order to stay agile and better address the needs of the protocol and the Arbitrum ecosystem at large; as such:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We did not need to incentivize the direct borrowing of MIM on arbitrum, because the cauldrons’ performance itself was enough to foster demand and further incentives on the demand-side were not needed. Instead, the DAO allocated those funds to deepen MIM’s liquidity, which was key in increasing its supply to match the growing demand.<br>\nThe Partnership with Curve Finance, which saw both DAOs co incentivising the MIM-crvUSD pool was an extreme success, making it the largest decentralized stablecoin pool on Arbitrum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We did not need to create the MIM savings rate, as the inflow of MIM to Arbitrum, both from native borrowing but also from other blockchains exceeded our expectations and goals set with the Arbitrum Foundation. The DAO instead allocated those funds to deepen MIM’s liquidity in order to keep matching the growing demand.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MIM Savings rate contracts have been fully developed and audited, and are ready to be deployed on Arbitrum.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-performance-indicators-kpis-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-performance-indicators-kpis-3\"></a>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h2>\n<p>The following is an overview of the KPIs) set in our original proposal:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/03b93ace9192078a55c6b6541237d96daa395b1e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wWhGtIERZqwAioknyldS6xUMZ8.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 14.35.56\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/03b93ace9192078a55c6b6541237d96daa395b1e_2_690x367.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 14.35.56\" data-base62-sha1=\"wWhGtIERZqwAioknyldS6xUMZ8\" width=\"690\" height=\"367\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/03b93ace9192078a55c6b6541237d96daa395b1e_2_690x367.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/03b93ace9192078a55c6b6541237d96daa395b1e_2_1035x550.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/03b93ace9192078a55c6b6541237d96daa395b1e_2_1380x734.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECECEC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"grant-allocation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#grant-allocation-4\"></a>Grant Allocation</h1>\n<p>The use of the STIP grant by the Abracadabra DAO has been focused on deepening MIM liquidity, which is crucial in order to meet the demand for the products developed.<br>\nIt was allocated to 3 liquidity pools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Curve: MIM-2CRV <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x30df229cefa463e991e29d42db0bae2e122b2ac7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x30dF229cefa463e991e29D42DB0bae2e122B2AC7</a></li>\n<li>Curve: MIM-crvUSD <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4070c044abc8d9d22447dfe4b032405970878d06\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x4070c044abc8d9d22447dfe4b032405970878d06</a></li>\n<li>Camelot V3: MIM-USDC <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0e7ac13617cc1a289b222e4602bdaaa53ea4dc61\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x0e7ac13617cc1a289b222e4602bdaaa53ea4dc61</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following is a recap of the biweekly reports, summarizing the use of the grant per epoch per pool.

Liquidity Incentives</h3>\n<p>Liquidity Incentives were distributed to all the GM liquidity pools of GMX V2 on Arbitrum, to encourage capital inflows.</p>\n<p>The main results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GMX v2 experienced an unprecedented surge in Total Value Locked (TVL). Within a remarkably short timeframe, TVL rapidly grew from $80 million to a peak of over $400 million.</li>\n<li>GM Pools allowed Liquidity Providers to have more granular control over their liquidity provision compared to GMX v1 (the multi-asset GLP pool). Since the introduction of GM Pools, the best-performing markets were SOL/USD, XRP/USD, and ARB/USD, which outperformed their standard DEX AMM pool benchmarks by 37.31%, 23.53%, and 20.78%, respectively. Additionally, the average performance across all GM liquidity pools was 15.64%, highlighting their capital efficiency and robust performance.</li>\n<li>The liquidity incentives program successfully attracted significant liquidity to the protocol. As a result, GMX v2 experienced improved market depth and stability, enhancing the overall user experience for traders. A week after incentives concluded, V2 still enjoys a TVL of $290M: more than 360% growth from its baseline of $80M.</li>\n<li>New GM Pools were introduced for 6 assets: AAVE, NEAR, BNB, OP, AVAX, and ATOM. This broadened the range of markets available to traders and Arbitrum ecosystem partners to build on.</li>\n<li>DeFi users bridged $98 Million into Arbitrum across these newly available assets (SOL, AVAX, WBNB, OP), thereby boosting Arbitrum’s goal of being the premier asset layer within Ethereum DeFi.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-trading-incentives-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-trading-incentives-3\"></a>2. Trading Incentives</h3>\n<p>Trading Incentives, in the form of fee rebates, were offered to all traders on the GMX V2 markets. The goal was to encourage engagement with GMX v2 on Arbitrum and to stimulate CEX traders to experiment with trading crypto non-custodially on-chain.</p>\n<p>The main results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over its eight months of existence, GMX v2 has generated a total trading volume of $34.38B. From the start of the STIP campaign (in the second week of November), v2 trading volume shows a clear upward trend.</li>\n<li>March was the most successful overall month, with the STIP incentives boosting GMX v2 trading volume up to $7.74B, and $14.52M in protocol fees collected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During the entire STIP incentives campaign, GMX accumulated over $29.72B in volume and generated $27.10M in fees. This was the highest fee generation across all perpetual DEXes, demonstrating the demand among traders and the product-market fit of v2.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-grants-program-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-3-grants-program-4\"></a>3. Grants Program</h3>\n<p>A portion of the STIP grant was dedicated to supporting projects built on the GMX v2 platform, fostering innovation and development within the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The main results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GMX funded 22 applications out of 54 funding applicants, with 1,673,500 ARB allocated to the grantees. Based on their achieved milestones, ~1,290,000 ARB was ultimately distributed to the grantees.</li>\n<li>Our grantees generated close to 518 million in trading volume on GMX v2 and achieved a combined TVL of 40 million on their platforms, contributing to increasingly liquid on-chain markets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the evidence suggests that GMX’s use of the Arbitrum DAO STIP grant has been a success. The allocated funds were effectively deployed, achieving the overarching objective: driving significant on-chain engagement with DeFi on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The liquidity and trading incentives programs have driven growth and engagement on GMX v2, while the grants program has fostered the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>A more detailed report underpinning these conclusions is available below.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"full-report-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#full-report-5\"></a>Full Report</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"history-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#history-6\"></a>History</h2>\n<p>GMX is a decentralised spot and perpetual exchange where traders benefit from low fees, deep liquidity, reduced liquidation risks, and transparent pricing.

Following the infusion of 5 million ARB liquidity incentives, GMX v2 experienced an unprecedented surge in Total Value Locked (TVL). Within a remarkably short span, TVL skyrocketed from $80 million to a peak of $400 million, demonstrating the substantial impact of our efforts.</p>\n<p>With increased TVL, our protocol now offers deeper liquidity pools, reduced slippage, and enhanced trading opportunities for Arbitrum users, thereby encouraging a more vibrant and efficient ecosystem. This surge underscores the impact of our liquidity incentives in attracting and retaining liquidity providers (LPs) within our ecosystem. Moreover, through migration incentives and community engagement, we were able to effectively migrate liquidity providers (LPs) from our previous GLP pools to our new GM pools, promoting deeper liquidity and enhancing the overall resilience of our ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Not only has this injection of liquidity strengthened our protocol’s market presence and resilience, but it has also facilitated increased participation from users seeking to capitalise on the yield opportunities of the GM pools. This growth signifies the confidence of investors and LPs in our protocol and underlines the importance of incentives in these challenging, competitive markets. We remain committed to further advancing the growth of GMX and the Arbitrum DeFi landscape, powered by innovative solutions and community-driven initiatives.</p>\n<p>The liquidity incentives were initially intended to scale up as TVL grew, but with the extension of STIP over a longer period, we implemented a taper strategy. Additional ARB was allocated to newly launched markets like BNB, AVAX, ATOM, NEAR, OP and AAVE that were deployed on GMX v2.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/2a8c29e59570db19a0a53ac76247b5421e35c029.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/64olSZasZ32fGSifbKStNqBtgZX.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2a8c29e59570db19a0a53ac76247b5421e35c029_2_624x455.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"64olSZasZ32fGSifbKStNqBtgZX\" width=\"624\" height=\"455\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2a8c29e59570db19a0a53ac76247b5421e35c029_2_624x455.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2a8c29e59570db19a0a53ac76247b5421e35c029_2_936x682.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2a8c29e59570db19a0a53ac76247b5421e35c029_2_1248x910.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EBDCEC\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<p>In the process, GMX facilitated the arrival of new DeFi assets on Arbitrum.

GMX has effectively utilised all the incentives and has been able to maintain mindshare across all the top Perp Dex’s, with more volume, protocol fees collected, and daily active users. GMX V2 generated <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GMX_IO/status/1765001395109826937?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">total trading volume of over $25 billion</a> by March 1st, demonstrating the demand among traders and showcasing the product-market fit of v2.</p>\n<p>Despite fierce competition marked by aggressive liquidity mining and trading incentives campaigns from rivals, GMX has adeptly maintained its position as the leading protocol on Arbitrum in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), fees, protocol revenue, and L2 gas consumption.</p>\n<p>The DeFi community’s continued trust in the platform has fueled the further adoption of Arbitrum and solidified its user base, capturing 50% of the total Perpetual (Perp) market. GMX’s TVL and activity have exhibited remarkable stickiness, consistently locking between 15% and 30% of all TVL on Arbitrum over the past year. Additionally, GMX has consistently ranked among the top perpetual protocols in the broader DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>March was the most successful month in the overall incentives period, with close to $7.74 billion in trading volume on V2 and V2 Swaps, $379 million in GM Pools, $302 million and bringing in $14.52 million in overall protocol fees.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/24ec5a5f3ace3e856f87ec7fbe4c27c22face626.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/5gDzwmQrobwh421BSH7zAadb0Ts.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24ec5a5f3ace3e856f87ec7fbe4c27c22face626_2_624x232.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"5gDzwmQrobwh421BSH7zAadb0Ts\" width=\"624\" height=\"232\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24ec5a5f3ace3e856f87ec7fbe4c27c22face626_2_624x232.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24ec5a5f3ace3e856f87ec7fbe4c27c22face626_2_936x348.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24ec5a5f3ace3e856f87ec7fbe4c27c22face626_2_1248x464.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAD2D1\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Trading Competition</strong></p>\n<p>We observed a lot of demand from our community to host a Trading Competition. So, we decided to launch a trading competition to celebrate the launch of GMX’s new Trading Leaderboard, which coincided with the introduction of EIP-4844 and ArbOS ATLAS (which vastly reduced gas fees on Layer 2s like Arbitrum).<br>\nBy leveraging the trading contest alongside CEX wallet campaigns, we aimed to showcase the highly optimised post-EIP-4844 trading environment and encourage greater experimentation, attracting new traders to Arbitrum. We therefore hosted the GMX <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#EIP4844</span> Trading Competition, with a prize pot of 280,000 ARB tokens available for the winners. All trades on GMX V2 on Arbitrum automatically qualified for the competition.</p>\n<p>The trading competition started on March 13, 2024, and consisted of two contest phases, each lasting for a week. The first trading contest commenced on March 13 and ended on March 20. The second trading competition began on March 20 and ended on March 27. During this period, users who traded on the platform and ranked on the leaderboard were eligible for a share of the competition’s prize pool.</p>\n<p>Engagement with the trading competition was further boosted through active promotion on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coingecko</a>, financed by GMX’s own marketing fund rather than STIP funds.</p>\n<p>The contest was divided into two categories:</p>\n<p>Top PnL ($):</p>\n<p>The Top PnL ($) prizes were awarded to the 1st-18th highest notional PnL ($), based on the total realised and unrealised profit and loss for the competition period, including fees and price impact.</p>\n<p>Top PnL (%):</p>\n<p>The Top PnL (%) prizes were awarded to the 1st-18th highest PnL according to percentage gains. In this case, PnL (%) is defined as [PnL / Capital Used].</p>\n<p>Every trader on the platform was eligible for both prize categories, and the prize breakdown was as follows:</p>\n<p>Prizes for Top PnL ($) Category:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st Highest Notional PnL: 50,000 ARB</li>\n<li>2nd Highest Notional PnL: 25,000 ARB</li>\n<li>3rd Highest Notional PnL: 10,000 ARB</li>\n<li>4th-18th Highest Notional PnL: 1,000 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TOTAL: 100,000 ARB * 2 weeks = 200,000 ARB</p>\n<p>Prizes for Top PnL (%) Category:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st Highest PnL (%): 10,000 ARB</li>\n<li>2nd Highest PnL (%): 7,000 ARB</li>\n<li>3rd Highest PnL (%): 5,000 ARB</li>\n<li>4th-18th Highest PnL (%): 1,200 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TOTAL: 40,000 ARB * 2 weeks = 80,000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Driving Growth through Trading Incentives</strong></p>\n<p>The introduction of trading incentives, through the allocation of 5 million ARB tokens, provided a notable boost to user growth within the GMX ecosystem, which had already been trending up. The protocol’s exceptional performance in fee collection within the Perp DEX sector further solidifies GMX’s position. The availability of trading incentives attracted new users plus encouraged existing users to increase their participation levels, resulting in a surge in trading volume and fees collected on GMX.</p>\n<p>Analysing the data, GMX Protocol has consistently outperformed its competitors in fee collection, surpassing all other Perp Dexes in the market. This achievement underscores GMX’s effectiveness in capturing value from the derivatives trading ecosystem. GMX’s achievement can partly be attributed to the implementation of the STIP trading incentives, designed to encourage increased trading volume and activity within the protocol. As you can see in the market screenshot below, after the incentives, GMX has collected the highest amount of protocol fees across all Perp Dexes.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8fb295ac5ef629d0a0b9659a8792cc00ac599d62.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kvcTr6c9u7vdFnXMO6cUdvcwNqO.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fb295ac5ef629d0a0b9659a8792cc00ac599d62_2_624x271.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"kvcTr6c9u7vdFnXMO6cUdvcwNqO\" width=\"624\" height=\"271\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fb295ac5ef629d0a0b9659a8792cc00ac599d62_2_624x271.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fb295ac5ef629d0a0b9659a8792cc00ac599d62_2_936x406.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fb295ac5ef629d0a0b9659a8792cc00ac599d62_2_1248x542.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"3E4753\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-grant-incentives-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-3-grant-incentives-12\"></a>3.) Grant Incentives</h3>\n<h3><a name=\"the-objective-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-objective-13\"></a>The Objective</h3>\n<p>The main aim of the grant initiative was to encourage the growth of the broader, composable GMX V2 ecosystem, by offering development assistance through grant incentives. This would, by extension, increase liquidity and trading on GMX while boosting the Arbitrum DeFi sector. The support was targeted towards wallets, Telegram bots, projects integrating with GMX V2’s GM Pools, and emerging protocols that meet specific requirements and provide maximum safety and security for users.</p>\n<p>Our goal with the integrations was to distribute incentives to users who utilise GMX V2 contracts through these integrations in a manner that fits these objectives. These users will receive incentives for providing liquidity, engaging in trading activities, and contributing to the extension of GMX’s features.</p>\n<p>The grants program has been instrumental in attracting new talent into the ecosystem and realising innovative ideas. The financial support, combined with the opportunity to contribute to GMX’s growth, has drawn numerous applicants from different backgrounds, thereby infusing the ecosystem with fresh insights and creative energy.</p>\n<p>The program’s impact extended from the immediate beneficiaries of the grants to increased activity within the GMX ecosystem, thereby contributing to the overall growth and robustness of GMX V2.</p>\n<p>GMX was committed to providing limited operational support to ensure the success of protocols building on top of GMX as a base layer. This approach reinforced the channel that connects GMX’s growth to that of the entire Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring mutual benefits and collaborative development.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-implementation-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-implementation-14\"></a>The Implementation</h3>\n<p>After much initial discussion among the GMX core contributors, and with concerns regarding the three-month timeline, we decided to adopt a committee-based model instead of a community one. This decision was made in light of the STIP timeline and to allow for faster implementation.</p>\n<p>We established a<a href=\"https://gov.gmx.io/t/formation-of-grants-committee/2493\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Grants Committee</a> for our grants program. The committee, as proposed, consisted of eight members. These members were a blend of core contributors, individuals from the community, and technical domain experts, all supported by a grant administrator coordinating the process. This diverse mix ensured a wide range of expert opinions on grant proposals. The committee comprises DeFi experts, technical developers, data scientists, and DeFi ecosystem and growth experts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KrBlueberr98752\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">KR_GMX</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/coinflipcanada\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Coinflipcanada</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jonas_ALA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Jonezee</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jr0gon\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Jrogon</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanoeth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Tanoeth</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kalcrypto1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Kalcrypto</a>, and<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesCliffyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Shogun</a>, as existing contributors to GMX, formed the initial grant committee members. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaurabhDhekale\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Saurabh</a> was appointed as a Grants Administrator based on his previous experience in the administration of grants programs.</p>\n<p>After setting up the process, we worked on creating the<a href=\"https://gov.gmx.io/t/how-to-apply-gmx-dao-grants/2512\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> grants template</a> and setting up the<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/57b96d777d814e9387f2d79cf4c3ea9f?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> landing page</a> to enable grantees to navigate the grants process easily. The grants template was also subsequently implemented in the LTIPP program. We divided the grants program into three categories:</p>\n<p>a) Open Grants - grants ranging from 10K ARB up to 100K ARB</p>\n<p>b) Micro grants - grants ranging from 1K ARB up to $10K ARB</p>\n<p>c) RFP’s</p>\n<p>We implemented rigorous monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track the grant recipients’ progress and ensure the funds were used efficiently and effectively. We also established precise reporting requirements for the grant recipients, requiring them to submit regular updates on their progress and use of funds. Through these mechanisms, we ensured that the grant funds were used in a manner that maximised their impact on the growth of the GMX V2 ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The KYC for the grants program was managed end-to-end by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-paolo-patti-68b475113?utm_source=share&amp;utm_campaign=share_via&amp;utm_content=profile&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BLG</a>, who performed the process for the applicants. GMX paid them 3637 ARB as a service fee.</p>\n<p>We used Gitcoin Grants Stack to provide the tooling to help the grants program run smoothly and decentralise the decision-making process.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"outcomes-and-impact-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#outcomes-and-impact-15\"></a>Outcomes and Impact</h3>\n<p>We kickstarted the grants program on November 8th and, after receiving exactly 54 applications in the span of one month, we sunsetted the grants program on December 13th. While the grants program was active, we accepted 21 applications from the 54 received. The proposals that the grants committee did not support, were subsequently assisted by GMX’s business development contributors so they could continue building on GMX and Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The grants program attracted high-quality applications from a diverse range of projects and individuals, all aiming to contribute to the GMX ecosystem. After a thorough review process, we granted funds to 21 promising projects that demonstrated strong potential for advancing the ecosystem’s growth and innovation. We allocated around 1,673,500 ARB ARB to the grantees, and eventually disbursed close to 1,290,000 ARB.</p>\n<p>The impact of the GMX grants program has been substantial. The funded initiatives have not only led to direct improvements in the GMX V2 tooling but also contributed to increased community involvement and enthusiasm. The resultant increase in liquidity has made GMX V2 more attractive to traders and investors. The grants-based incentive program also encouraged crypto users to try out the platform, leading to an increase in the number of active traders and significant growth in TVL.</p>\n<p>In addition, the grant program has helped create accountability among the grantees, and a sense of community involvement and ownership. All the accepted grantees were required to<a href=\"https://gov.gmx.io/c/gmx-grants-report/8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> submit bi-weekly reports on the GMX governance forum</a>.</p>\n<p>Overall, the GMX grants initiative served as a strong foundation for innovation, development, and improvements within the GMX and Arbitrum ecosystems. As we move forward, we aim to build on this success by continually refining our ecosystem-focused approach, taking into account the valuable feedback and experiences garnered through the grants program.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3569362/6007837\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/182279b61c5e0eacff35b2f0a99caec71183e02c.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"3rvjZXoeBcTNFTPfnXJ8fvM1BMw\" width=\"624\" height=\"489\" role=\"presentation\"></a></strong></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Project Name</th>\n<th>Amount Asked (Funds allocated)</th>\n<th>Amounts disbursed for completing milestones</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Binance Wallet</td>\n<td>28.5K ARB</td>\n<td>28.5K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GMD Protocol</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Perpie</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GMX v2 Telegram &amp; Discord Analytics</td>\n<td>10K ARB</td>\n<td>10K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RabbitHole</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>50K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vaultka</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rodeo Finance</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>33.5K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tradao</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Python SDK</td>\n<td>55K ARB</td>\n<td>55K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dolomite</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>25K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DeltaPrime</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>95K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fluid</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Symbiosis</td>\n<td>50K ARB</td>\n<td>10K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Umami</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tradingview Alert Connector</td>\n<td>4K ARB</td>\n<td>4K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D2 Finance</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>60K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rage Trade</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fungi Protocol</td>\n<td>6K ARB</td>\n<td>6K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DappOS</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pear Protocol</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>40K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Steadefi</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>50K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OKX wallet</td>\n<td>20K ARB</td>\n<td>20K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>$1,673,500 ARB</td>\n<td>$1,290,000 ARB</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"grants-project-highlights-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#grants-project-highlights-16\"></a>Grants Project Highlights</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.gmx.io/t/vaultka-grant-final-update/3289\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vaultka</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Vaultka is a yield optimisation protocol for decentralised perpetual exchanges on Arbitrum, enabling users to maximise gains and tailor their strategies based on their risk preferences.

The grants program has been a pivotal initiative for the further development of the GMX ecosystem and has helped grow GMX V2 significantly. It has demonstrated the power of community-led initiatives and shown how strategic investments can drive growth and innovation in a decentralised ecosystem.<br>\nBy providing financial support and community involvement, the program has led to significant improvements within the ecosystem and has set a strong foundation for future growth. As we move forward, we will continue to use the grants program as a tool for creating sustainable growth in the GMX ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Anti-Sybil and Anti-Abuse Parameters:</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned in our STIP application, to ensure the integrity of the incentive program, anti-Sybil and anti-abuse parameters were implemented to prevent the incentives from being affected by bots or bad actors. These parameters generated organic volume and attracted genuine users to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Measures were established in consultation with the Liquidity Multi-sig and the GMX DAO to attempt to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure the program’s success.</p>\n<p>By implementing this breakdown of incentives and incorporating anti-Sybil and anti-abuse parameters, we aimed to grow a healthy and sustainable ecosystem on the Arbitrum network. Additionally, according to the<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/openblock-labs-stip-efficacy-sybil-analysis-2-24/21441\"> reports of Open Blocks</a>, our incentives were less Sybiled compared to our competitors and other protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Success of the Program</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>We saw an increase in liquidity, gradually increasing GMX v2 TVL. This increase in TVL reflected the success of the program in attracting and retaining users within the GMX ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Following the incentives, we saw an upsurge in daily trading activity, user count, and the total value locked (TVL) within the protocol.</li>\n<li>After launching the grants program, we saw more than 22 projects building on GMX v2. The increase in the number of active users that engaged with these applications, serves as a benchmark for measuring the success of initiatives aimed at increasing the adoption and usage of GMX v2 and Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>An increase in community participation in the forums, collaborations, and proposals submitted by community members indicates a growth in community engagement and activity, encompassing participation in the incentives, grant applications, and governance.</li>\n<li>Testimonials and success stories from grant recipients and partners within the ecosystem, highlighting the influence of grants on their projects or the ecosystem at large, offer firsthand insight into the grants’ impact.</li>\n<li>We saw an increase in token markets on GMX, with a total of 6 new markets getting listed on GMX v2 for traders, builders and DeFi liquidity providers to engage with.</li>\n<li>The conception and implementation of fresh features and enhancements into the GMX protocol, informed by insights derived from grant-supported projects and collaborations, can be assessed by the count of protocol upgrades and improvements executed, as well as feedback from users and ecosystem partners.</li>\n<li>GMX further enhanced the user experience through continuous protocol improvements and feature enhancements like One-Click Trading, Sub-Accounts and Adaptive Funding Rates.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>GMX has successfully executed its incentive program, achieving notable growth in trading volume, liquidity provision, and community development. We’ve seen increased user engagement, a surge in total value locked (TVL), and numerous successful projects emerging from our grant program.</p>\n<p>The lessons learned from this program, and the strategies we’ve cultivated, will guide our future initiatives as we continue to grow and evolve in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The STIP grant program has been instrumental in driving the growth and progress of GMX v2. The multifaceted approach combining trading incentives, liquidity incentives, and grant incentives has not only boosted user engagement and activity but also significantly increased the total value locked within the protocol.</p>\n<p>Our trading incentives led to a substantial increase in trading volume and attracted a diverse range of traders, while our liquidity incentives resulted in deeper, more stable liquidity pools. This, in turn, improved the overall trading experience for our users. Lastly, the grant incentives played a crucial role in fostering innovation and contributing to the development of the GMX ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We express our gratitude to the Arbitrum DAO and the STIP Grants program for their support. And we look forward to continuing our journey in creating a robust, efficient, and user-friendly decentralised exchange, which simultaneously functions as a liquidity base layer for all of Arbitrum DeFi.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/leveraging-the-stip-grants-program-to-grow-the-gmx-and-arbitrum-defi-ecosystem/23100\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/leveraging-the-stip-grants-program-to-grow-the-gmx-and-arbitrum-defi-ecosystem/23100","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 19:16:57 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23100"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/leveraging-the-stip-grants-program-to-grow-the-gmx-and-arbitrum-defi-ecosystem/23100.rss","#text":"Leveraging the STIP Grants Program to grow the GMX and Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem"}},{"title":"9 Apr 2024 - Open Discussion of Proposals Governance Call","dc:creator":"cliffton.eth","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n<p>The link to join the governance call to discuss the proposal pipeline and notable discussions is on the <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Warsaw\">governance calendar </a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Date: 9 April 2024</strong><br>\n<strong>Time: 4:00 pm UTC</strong><br>\nLink to join: <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/kvr-bpnx-zix\">https://meet.google.com/kvr-bpnx-zix </a></p>\n<p>I’ve put together a fluid agenda below.

As an introductory proposal and a call for collaborators, we welcome feedback from delegates, analysts, protocols, Orbit chains, and the community.</em></p>\n<p><em>We’d also like to note that while this proposal is under development, it is designed to complement existing Arbitrum project incentive programs like STIP and LTIPP, as well as Foundation programs for Orbit partners. It is not intended to compete with or deter those programs, but rather bring new tooling, onchain innovation, and important marketplace dynamics to the Arbitrum Incentives ecosystem.</em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum Orbit Stimulus Pilot introduces an objective and metric-driven onchain incentives program designed to provide infrastructure and tokens to help grow Arbitrum’s Orbit chains.</p>\n<p>This proposal evolves protocol-driven incentives by leveraging composable, permissionless, and onchain infrastructure to facilitate decentralization, via third-party incentives managers, and streamlined operations, via onchain tooling.</p>\n<p>The proposal introduces a six-month and 9M ARB program to support user growth and retention on up to six Arbitrum Orbit chains. Orbit chains will be selected via an Arbitrum DAO council with a budget to both setup infrastructure and incentives to bootstrap their project. Each accepted chain is eligible to receive the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Up to 1M ARB for onchain user incentives (including performance fees for Incentive Managers, etc.)</li>\n<li>Up to 500k ARB budget for onchain infrastructure support (Including rpc, indexer, data, and incentives infrastructure).</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The ultimate motivation of this proposal is to simultaneously endow Arbitrum Orbit chains with long-term onchain infrastructure for sustainable growth while simultaneously offering an alternative model that improves upon existing incentives programs by addressing existing issues of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karelvuong/status/1749859056292942268?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bureaucracy</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0x_ultra\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">capture</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-now-a-pragmatic-approach-for-the-moment/15779\">inefficiencies</a>.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Orbit strategy represents “freedom”. By encouraging its Orbit partners to customize their L2/L3 chains with unprecedented flexibility, Arbitrum is well positioned to attract a diversity of use-cases, structures, and strategies to the ecosystem. As such, this proposal aims to establish growth support for every Orbit chain (defined as an Orbit L2 sharing sequencer revenue or an Orbit L3 built on Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova).</p>\n<p>We believe that validating the efficacy of onchain incentives infrastructure and performance-driven incentives will establish a foundation for long-term Orbit success. Equipped with robust tooling, Orbit chains, the DAO, and even third-parties (DEXs, onchain games, creators, etc.) can leverage the infra beyond the ARB granted from the program, either leveraging future grants, native tokens or digital assets, even when DAO incentives dry up.</p>\n<p>The proposal aims to address multiple issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Experience</strong>: By establishing a unified incentives funnel, it seeks to unify Orbit chain discovery into a cohesive user experience, addressing fragmented users and providing a scalable growth strategy for each protocol’s journey from an app to a chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Onchain Tooling</strong>: By replacing short-term programs with long-term tooling and infrastructure, Orbit chains will leave the Stimulus Pilot program with robust user data (CAC, segmentation analysis, growth metrics) and onchain relationships with their users, extending value beyond the status quo of continuous incentives via program extensions.</li>\n<li><strong>Objective-based Grants</strong>: By grounding Orbit growth in <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/learnings-from-stip-community-interview-summaries-and-notes/20916\">objective</a> metric-based <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353/14\">strategies</a> (i.e. <a href=\"https://journey.mantle.xyz/en/rewards\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.blast.io/airdrop/api\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blast</a>, <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/3tkU-Y5479JPw83I6jp7GTu_0_q-TWEKAXckm3XKl28\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism</a>) the DAO can align it’s impact with specific Orbit chain goals and objectives.</li>\n<li><strong>Evolving Onchain Incentives</strong>: As a pilot step toward the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-new-thesis-for-network-level-incentives-programs/20757\">direct-to-contract philosophy</a>, the Arbitrum Orbit Stimulus Pilot aims to realign DAO grants with blockchain principles: transparency, decentralization, and <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">automation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO has approved over 115M ARB worth of incentive grants on Arbitrum. Although these<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-new-thesis-for-network-level-incentives-programs/20757\"> project-based grants</a> spurred significant on-chain activity, they’ve been impeded by operational inefficiencies, unclear governance, and a lack of strategic direction. The absence of clearly defined success metrics has created a disconnect between <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353/27\">expectations and outcomes</a>. The DAO has largely been unable to define success, leading to misaligned expectations, grants, and results. Further, as Arbitrum chains grows, its user base becomes increasingly fragmented, leading to a disunified user experience and making it more difficult to explore complementary protocols and chains in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This fragmentation complicates interaction with complementary protocols and chains within the ecosystem. While previous incentives favor protocols with precedent and governance influence (existing dApps on Arbitrum), an increasing wave of partners and protocols require support for new challenges in launching Orbit chains. This proposal advocates for a technical collaboration to foster and validate efficient, decentralized, and forkable on-chain workflows, along with tooling that will last long beyond the incentives themselves.</p>\n<p>Concentrating on Arbitrum Orbit chains, this proposal aims to establish an adaptable, user-centric, and accountable bootstrapping framework. This initiative is designed to address unique challenges of L2 and L3 chains, offering innovative solutions that underline the proposal’s goal to exemplify its strategies within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"program-structure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-structure-4\"></a>Program Structure</h1>\n<p>The program is managed by three key roles: The Orbit Pilot Council, Orbit Grantees, and Incentive Managers.</p>\n<p>How incentive programs generally work</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1sHBBHz6XNS05mrgoypjlvPx6AX.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_539x427.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1sHBBHz6XNS05mrgoypjlvPx6AX\" width=\"539\" height=\"427\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_539x427.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_808x640.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_1078x854.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAF8F1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>How The Orbit Stimulus Pilot Works<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/brRK90SCwLy141pwQKHbPGbCMaV.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_494x402.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"brRK90SCwLy141pwQKHbPGbCMaV\" width=\"494\" height=\"402\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_494x402.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_741x603.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_988x804.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F1F6ED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Program Roles and Responsibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orbit Pilot Council</strong>: The Orbit Pilot Council is responsible for evaluating, approving, and validating both Orbit Grantee and Incentive Manager applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Orbit Grantees</strong>: These are the Orbit Chains receiving incentives. They work with eligible Incentive Managers to define key objectives, metrics, campaigns, and KPIs. Orbit Grantees are approved by the Orbit Pilot Council.</li>\n<li><strong>Incentive Managers</strong>: These are professionals or entities whitelisted by the Orbit Pilot Council to design and deploy incentive strategies tailored to Orbit chains’ unique needs.

At least one seat will be filled by an appointed representative from either the Arbitrum Foundation or Offchain Labs at the time of the proposal’s onchain vote.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"process-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#process-6\"></a>Process</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Election Stage</strong>: The DAO elects council members for the Orbit Pilot Council.</li>\n<li><strong>Application Stage</strong>: Incentive Managers and eligible Orbit Chains submit applications in their respective tracks.</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluation Stage</strong>: The Orbit Pilot Council reviews and approves up to six Orbit applications and whitelists eligible Incentives Managers.</li>\n<li><strong>Proposal Stage</strong>: Accepted Orbit Chains work with Incentive Managers to propose strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution Stage</strong>: Orbit Pilot Councils approve proposals, allowing Incentive Managers to deploy strategies. Once approved, grantees will be empowered to distribute incentives over a 6-month period, from the date upon which incentives are received. Over this period, Incentives Managers and Orbit Chains will design, execute, and deploy strategies over 1-month periods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"technical-implementation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#technical-implementation-7\"></a>Technical Implementation</h1>\n<p>The program leverages the Boost Protocol, a composable, permissionless, and on-chain infrastructure for deploying incentive strategies. Incentive Managers can use no-code onchain tools to incentivize specific onchain actions, with parameters like address whitelisting, action types, protocols, assets, reward sizes, and incentive lengths.</p>\n<p>The innovative approach outlined below leverages the Llama protocol alongside a sovereign governance model, integrating role-based solutions to streamline grant operations without compromising the core principles of flexibility and decentralization. This model employs a contract system to establish a primary account and define policyholders, utilizing soulbound ERC-721 tokens to enable permissioned responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this framework introduces a management platform and no code incentives deployment, facilitating the direct control of DAO over program goals while ensuring compensation and monetization for each side of the incentives marketplace. The subsequent sections will delve into the distribution mechanisms, data and measurement strategies, and the economic impact of these innovations, underpinning a governance model that not only enhances program management but also fosters accountability, transparency, and community engagement in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"onchain-program-management-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#onchain-program-management-8\"></a>Onchain Program Management</h3>\n<p>The Program employs a role-based solution using <a href=\"https://llama.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Llama</a> protocol contracts, streamlining grant operations while maintaining flexibility and decentralization. The contract establishes a primary account, with the ability to define policyholders. A policy is a soulbound ERC-721 granted to an EOA, enabling permissioned responsibilities to either create (mint) new policyholder NFTs or spend permissioned amounts from the Llama primary account. This structure allows for onchain program management, ensuring both security and the use of funds on the appropriate use cases.</p>\n<p>The following summary outlines a sovereign governance model that enables direct DAO control over program goals, objectives, budgets, and managers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orbit Program Account</strong>: An account managed by Policyholders.

Despite strong efforts, the DAO has failed to agree upon concrete KPIs, while paying for reporting that, as a result, provides little actionable information. KPIs and accurately report them. To help solve this issue, this proposal provides financial support for both RPC and Indexer costs (if needed). Eligible chains will also receive integration with either Dune or Flipside, providing open data for the community and, therefore, accountability and performance.</p>\n<p>Leveraging native attribution, standardized claims, and the <a href=\"https://docs.boost.xyz/boost-protocol/for-developers/boost-api\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost API</a>, this proposal enables comparable analysis in real-time. As each Incentive Manager deploys strategies, The Orbit Pilot Council and Orbit Grantees have the ability to provide feedback on iterative campaigns. This means that each individual Boost strategy can be picked apart, compared, and incentive managers can conduct sophisticated methods such as A/B testing, targeted whitelisting, and iterative approaches.</p>\n<p>The goal is to collaborate with these entities to create comprehensive dashboards tailored to the specific objectives of each program. These dashboards will enable anyone to analyze, report, and evaluate the performance of various incentive strategies deployed by Incentive Managers. Since the underlying data is open-source, these dashboards can be modified, built upon, or critiqued by anyone in the community, fostering transparency and collaborative improvement.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"key-performance-indicators-kpis-and-data-driven-results-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-performance-indicators-kpis-and-data-driven-results-12\"></a>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Data Driven Results</h3>\n<p>Imperative to the proposal is the ability for each Orbit chain to be accountable to deliver reasonable and expected results. Thus, Incentives Managers, the Arbitrum Orbit Council, and Orbit Chains will work together to define and present key performance metrics to support their proposed strategies. The Council will be responsible for the approval of Orbit Chain KPIs and deployment objectives, while Incentive Managers and Orbit Chains will work together to design and implement strategies, iterating based on real-time results and campaign objectives.</p>\n<p>Depending on the chain, these metrics will be held as key indicators in each grant’s structure, holding both grantees and incentive managers accountable to performance. User KPIs will benefit from in-depth analyst guidance, including user segmentation, profiling, advanced targeting, and sybil-resistance (where necessary). Alternative KPIs can include number of transactions, mints, strategic asset volumes, bridging volume, etc., all depending on a chains specific business needs and objectives.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"program-economics-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-economics-13\"></a>Program Economics</h2>\n<p>Beyond its technical advantages, the Orbit Stimulus Program also features a built-in attribution that streamlines and powers a compensation structure to align each program stakeholder within the program itself. This allows earning opportunities for Incentive Managers, user frontends (through referrals), and further protocol development.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"incentive-managers-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentive-managers-14\"></a>Incentive Managers</h3>\n<p>The program’s success heavily relies on incentive managers, responsible for crafting and implementing strategies for Orbit grantees. To attract and compensate these managers, the program leverages Boost Protocol’s fee structures, allocating one-third of all protocol claim fees and 5% of all rewards to the managers (see fee structure below). This approach not only aligns the interests of the program and the incentive managers but also makes the role appealing to analysts and third parties, fostering competition for these positions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"frontend-clients-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#frontend-clients-15\"></a>Frontend Clients</h3>\n<p>Boost Studios will collaborate with the Arbitrum DAO to develop and launch an Arbitrum Inbox front-end, serving as a central point for user engagement. This platform will not only facilitate user discovery but also generate revenue through Boost Protocols’ fee mechanisms. By leveraging Boost Protocol’s attribution feature, frontend clients can access one-third of protocol claim fees and 2.5% of all rewards generated. This revenue-generation capability extends to the DAO and third-party frontend clients, including grantees, motivating them to integrate with the platform. This integration fosters a competitive environment among frontends, wallets, and dApps, all aiming to attract users to Orbit chain incentives.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protocol-maintenance-and-growth-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#protocol-maintenance-and-growth-16\"></a>Protocol Maintenance and Growth</h3>\n<p>Funds are directed to the <a href=\"https://app.llama.xyz/orgs/boost\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost Guild</a>, a group of Boost community members, to encourage innovation and activity on the Boost Protocol.

The DEF uniquely provides a dedicated voice for DAOs and DeFi in legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy efforts. You can find a summary of their past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US, below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>DeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.</p>\n<p>At this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.</p>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.</p>\n<p>Originally funded by Uniswap governance in 2021 with a one million UNI grant, DeFi Education Fund’s work is a public good that periodically requires funding to continue. This proposal would contribute funding to the organization so that it can expand its legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.</p>\n<p>The DeFi Education Fund’s work focuses on (further details below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Legal advocacy and litigation for DeFi, DAOs, and developers;</li>\n<li>Fighting regulatory overreach from the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, CFPB, IRS, et. al.;</li>\n<li>Advocating and lobbying for DeFi in Congress and at the state level;</li>\n<li>Educating elected representatives and traditional media about DeFi and its benefits; and</li>\n<li>Informing and serving the DeFi community about policy and regulatory developments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DEF is eager to continue leading the charge in the fight on behalf of DeFi. We can only do that with the backing of the DeFi community, which is why we will be initiating governance proposals for financial support from several DAOs. With the community’s support, we will</p>\n<ol>\n<li>super charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;</li>\n<li>expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;</li>\n<li>more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; and</li>\n<li>enhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"more-information-on-def-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#more-information-on-def-4\"></a>More Information on DEF</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/about\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Team</a>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/millercwl\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Miller Whitehouse-Levine</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amandatums\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Amanda Tuminelli</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbernstein6395\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Max Bernstein</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LazPieper\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lizandro Peiper</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://defieducationfund.substack.com/archive\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Weekly updates</a> on policy developments and activities</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTt5vI0P5MuBF2vq1UyhByKqmM6XbMp-twre8ahm_gs/edit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">12 Month Estimated Budget</a></li>\n<li>Historical financial <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/financial-information\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">information</a> (annual and monthly)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fund_defi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X</a></li>\n<li>Contact - Please reach out to discuss!\n<ul>\n<li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:miller@defieducationfund.org\">miller@defieducationfund.org</a></li>\n<li>Telegram: <span class=\"mention\">@millwl</span></li>\n<li>Twitter: <span class=\"mention\">@fund_defi</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#implementation-5\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<p>Upon passage, 500,000 ARB is to be transferred to and held in a <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x937561C09a3b19317958438489B4Bd0a8C986e45\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dedicated wallet</a> at Coinbase.

Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"faqs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#faqs-7\"></a>FAQs</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Why are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are seeking Arbitrum’s support now for three primary reasons.</p>\n<p>First, we need a sense of our longer term funding in order to take on the projects that our work focuses on, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will take a total of at least two years from start to finish. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting that challenge, we would not have been able to take that project on. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.</p>\n<p>Second, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States could cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects.</p>\n<p>Third, DeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Why are you asking Arbitrum for money and not other DAOs?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will definitely be passing around the hat! We seek Arbitrum’s support as a leading DAO that is building for the long term. The Uniswap DAO took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that other leading DAOs will contribute to funding our work going forward.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>When and how are you planning on selling tokens?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is important to us that the DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. We will hold half of any ARB tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will not sell any ARB tokens without pre-disclosing a sales plan in writing. For example, we received our initial grant from the Uniswap DAO in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18-month written <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/post/def-provides-update-on-our-funding\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sales plan</a>. We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"accomplishments-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#accomplishments-8\"></a>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h4>\n<p>Legal Advocacy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEC v. Kraken - In February 2024, we submitted an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_7c5fd096e8234f9bb66e4629d5f31b60.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> explaining the various incorrect and often inconsistent legal positions the SEC employs in its attempts to justify its position that digital asset transactions are securities transactions.</li>\n<li>Van Loon v. Treasury - In November 2023, we filed another <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_dc5e8345b3d34bd4af4d06663c12d413.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> related to the Tornado Cash sanctions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We argued that the use of privacy-protecting technology is normal and not inherently illicit and that Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) exceeded its statutory authority in issuing sanctions that included purely domestic transactions.</li>\n<li>Harper v. Internal Revenue Service - In October 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_492b137460ef4263aa43f3fcb946a1cd.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in a case involving a challenge to a “John Doe” summons the IRS sent to Coinbase that resulted in the collection of information (including information revealing on-chain wallet addresses) about 14,355 Americans (none of whom were accused of any wrongdoing prior to the summons) over a three-year period. Our brief explained the sweeping Fourth Amendment implications of indiscriminately collecting digital asset transaction information and how doing so is more revealing than in the context of TradFi.</li>\n<li>SEC v. Coinbase - In August 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_05b10d3583a647b08dd071727ab8b7f1.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in support of Coinbase. We explained how wallets and staking actually work and supported Coinbase’s arguments that it is not a broker through its wallet software, nor did it offer securities through its staking program.</li>\n<li>Coin Center v. Treasury - In June 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_aff0399d95324a94af6b5f6cd3e31b91.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in support of a challenge to OFAC’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment ag. In October 2022, Coin Center and several individuals sued Treasury, challenging OFAC’s designation of Tornado Cash smart contracts. The plaintiffs argued that doing so exceeded the Treasury’s authority, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the First Amendment. Our brief supported arguments that the sanctions were beyond the Treasury Department’s statutory authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act, made the point that Tornado Cash is an important privacy-protection tool, and argued that the sanctions designations made no sense when considering the realities of the technology at issue.</li>\n<li>Van Loon v. Treasury - In April 2023, we submitted our first <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_347cf86b54b540e9be5773f8560d62bc.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">brief</a> related to Treasury’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. In addition to Treasury’s lack of statutory basis for the actions, We argued that the downstream implications of sanctioning a software protocol will lead to not only a weakening of the digital asset industry, but will also seriously jeopardize law-abiding Americans’ financial privacy.</li>\n<li>CFTC v. Ooki DAO - In late 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) served Ooki DAO, alleging it is “illegally offering leveraged and margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets” without a Futures Commission Merchant designation or a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) program. The CFTC served “Ooki DAO” via a help chat box with a contemporaneous notice posted on a website purportedly affiliated with Ooki DAO. We filed a brief in the case explaining: “First, the Commission has named Ooki DAO as a defendant in this action, asserting that Ooki DAO is an “unincorporated association comprised of Ooki Token holders.” But nothing about the structure of a DAO inherently dictates that result. In many cases, DAOs lack any central organization or management, and many DAO token holders often lack coordination or common objectives. As a result, DAOs will often not be “associations” of any kind, and therefore will not be proper defendants in an enforcement action brought under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), which requires that a defendant be a “person” (defined to include “associations”). The Commission has not yet alleged facts sufficient to establish that Ooki DAO is an association, so its attempt to serve Ooki DAO here is premature.”</li>\n<li>Combatting crypto patent trolls: In September 2023, we took action to protect DeFi and crypto from invalid patent infringement claims. We filed a<a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_ed2f23226fbb4adaa53b86efa5d58f44.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> petition</a> with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to initiate an inter partes review and cancellation of all claims in a patent owned by True Return Systems LLC. TRS is a patent troll who first tried to sell the patent as an NFT, and when that didn’t work, sued both MakerDAO and Compound Protocol in federal court for alleged infringement of<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US10025797B1/en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> U.S. Patent No. 10,025,797</a>. Our petition argued that the technology that TRS purported to patent was not in fact TRS’s invention, but was instead very similar to oracle technology that had been in development and use for years prior to the patent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regulatory Advocacy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In January 2024, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_a5bb9050d8414cbab3f0285202464a29.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">urged</a> the Department of the Treasury to reconsider its proposed rule to classify crypto “mixing” transactions to be a “primary money laundering concern” subject to enhanced reporting requirements. Among the issues we commented on is the proposal’s all-encompassing definition of “mixing,” which would capture almost all crypto transactions and designate them to be “high risk.”</li>\n<li>In January 2024, we submitted <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_4bdb18a7e1b94bfea406dfbb0a0ffcc8.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our thoughts</a> on a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed rulemaking that could expand the CFPB’s supervisory authority to capture self-hosted wallets. We argued that the rulemaking should not move forward as it would further scramble the Federal government’s already-convoluted regulatory treatment of DeFi and crypto-related activities.</li>\n<li>In November 2023, we filed a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_40d4255857d142f2a1744be79f1dab3f.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">comment letter</a> regarding the Treasury Department’s proposed “broker” rulemaking. The proposed rule would introduce a brand new category of broker called a “digital asset middleman,” a new term that is essentially limitless in scope and creates brokers out of thin air in DeFi and, as we argue, runs contrary to the statute and legislative history. Furthermore, we argued that the proposal violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on warrantless searches and seizures of a person’s papers and effects because individuals do not voluntarily turn over their personal data to “digital asset middlemen” who themselves neither collect nor have any legitimate business reason to collect that information. For a plain language review of our issues with the rulemaking, read: “<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/11/15/congress-gets-the-runaround-from-regulators-again/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Congress Gets the Runaround From Regulators, Again</a>.”</li>\n<li>In October 2023, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_1dfebf33d77f40a0895314105ed47079.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to France’s Autorité de Marchés Financiers (AMF) concerning their DeFi regulatory discussion paper. Our comment letter addressed many topics including permissionless blockchain protocols, legal enforceability of smart contracts, off-chain elements, etc. Importantly, we addressed the legal liability of smart contract developers, arguing that smart contracts’ code is open-source for anyone to audit and make informed decisions. Furthermore, we argued that open-source code is a form of expression as it conveys ideas for societal change and demands protection. We also argued against the AMF’s proposal to create a government-run certification regime for smart contracts.</li>\n<li>In September 2023, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_94bb62e0bac1428585c944bc06884bd2.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to a request for comment from the Senate Finance Committee regarding the taxation of digital assets. In our submission, we recommended Congress: 1) Revise Section 6050I so that it does not “deputize recipients of digital assets to collect and report information about their payers;” 2) Do not tax staking rewards until a sale or other disposition; 3) Do not apply wash sale rules to taxpayers who utilize digital assets as a form of currency; and 4) explicitly extend the application of section 1058’s nonrecognition rule to “loans” of actively traded fungible tokens.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we submitted a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_e73f5656c9a047788521cf09259db7a4.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response </a>to a consultation from HM Revenue and Customs, the United Kingdom’s tax, payments, and customs authority, regarding “the taxation of DeFi involving the lending and staking of cryptoassets.” At a high-level, our submission noted that any changes to the tax regime that concern DeFi must: be flexible to account for future innovation; exhibit clarity and simplicity to promote compliance by minimizing the burden on taxpayers; and align with the underlying economic substance of a typical DeFi transaction.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we submitted a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_dbc796a8e44644539ffcd4722e1b442a.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response </a>to Banque of France’s Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) regarding their discussion paper: “Decentralised’ or ‘Disintermediated’ Finance: What Regulatory Response?” Our primary arguments included that ACPR should not directly regulate miners and validators by establishing standards for public blockchains; a policy that would “force centralization” would eliminate the core innovations of public blockchains; and a framework for smart contract certification would require centralization and the inappropriate regulation of speech.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we filed our <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_f997b07bbb6d43b8a3b6c0626f57cdf3.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">third comment letter</a> on the SEC’s proposed “exchange” rulemaking. Our brief made two primary arguments: first, the proposal improperly reads and misapplies the Exchange Act and exceeds the SEC’s statutory authority and mandate under the Act; and second, the SEC has flatly failed to comply with numerous procedural and statutory rulemaking requirements.</li>\n<li>In August 2022, the DEF filed a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khRThXkBfev9uTTtSlakcckfKjP1_8TT/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response</a> to the U.S. Treasury Department’s request for comment on innovation in digital assets. In our response, we explained how DeFi protocols have the potential to benefit consumers, investors, and businesses in the United States and around the world by creating accessible financial infrastructure usable by any individual with an internet connection.</li>\n<li>In June 2022, we <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y6_UbL2DBMvICeuhdENSGGWPJrZCBAWM/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to Abu Dhabi’s DeFi consultation, in which we expressed our view that decentralization and disintermediation serve important societal objectives and that forcing the reintroduction of intermediation via legal obligations is a misguided approach to DeFi that would undermine its core potential and innovation.</li>\n<li>In June 2022, In our second <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1inWXw7MSO8VjrbuPro8izeewgmRGNC9r/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">letter</a> on the SEC’s exchange rulemaking, we argued that the proposed rule represents an improperly static regulatory response to a dynamic innovation and therefore needs to be reconsidered in total.</li>\n<li>In May 2022, we <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GC4QPms1JxzrBr7sLDlSzoVVk3EcTsNP/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commented</a> on the SEC’s “dealer” rulemaking, which could not only subject large DeFi market participants to the threat of arbitrary SEC enforcement actions but also, potentially, capture liquidity pools themselves as so-called “dealers” under the securities laws. But how would it do so? In what way? The SEC did not say when it proposed the rule nor when it later finalized the rule in early 2024, which we expect to see challenged in court. .</li>\n<li>In April 2022, we submitted the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cjQIDH3VE9303k-r55lQFfn1v-tH5l0n/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">first</a> of three comment letters on the SEC’s “exchange” rulemaking, which would de facto ban DeFi protocols in the United States. We argued that the Proposal’s expanded definition of an “exchange” is so broad that it could be interpreted to cover DeFi market participants, yet the rule didn’t specify which or why—it didn’t even mention “crypto,” “DeFi,” or “digital assets” once. In January 2023 in response to these concerns, the SEC released 167 pages of additional information explaining that the proposal does apply to DeFi and crypto, which we also responded to.</li>\n<li>In April 2022, we submitted a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kaURtD9UIFBaB4mMkcZXRi15uGJ5d3dK/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">comment letter</a> to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on its proposed <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/oecd-seeks-input-on-new-tax-transparency-framework-for-crypto-assets-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.htm\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">framework</a> for tax reporting in the digital asset ecosystem. Broadly, when it comes to DeFi, the proposal fits squarely in the “how do we apply existing regulations and tactics to innovative systems” camp. This concept would force the creation of intermediaries where they do not exist for tax reporting purposes, a concept that the Treasury Department is now attempting to enshrine in the United States (see November 2023 comment letter on the IRS’s proposed “broker” rulemaking).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Legislative Advocacy</p>\n<p>The past year has yielded some fruit in the industry’s push for crypto-specific legislation, but legislation is still a few years out, in our view. In July, The House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) voted, with bipartisan support, to advance the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/20/us-house-republicans-introduce-crypto-oversight-bill-to-protect-investors/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act</a>, a bill that would create a regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S. That same month, the HFSC advanced a bill to establish a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4766/BILLS-118hr4766ih.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">federal regulatory regime</a> for stablecoins.</p>\n<p>More recently, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce passed the <a href=\"https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/H_R_Deploying_American_Blockchains_Act_Reps_Bucshon_and_Blunt_Rochester_e4ce972799.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Deploying American Blockchains Act</a> (by a 46-0 margin), which would direct the chief of the Department of Commerce “to promote the competitiveness of the United States related to the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology.” While these bills are not perfect, we’re pleased that Congress has taken a serious approach to these matters.</p>\n<p>There’s another factor that gives us hope for the long-term chances of good legislation passing both chambers. And that is the willingness of Congressional offices and policymakers to engage with DEF and learn about the foundational aspects of the technology. We do “DeFi Demos” on Capitol Hill and advocate for policies welcoming of DeFi and DAOs. We explain why we believe in DeFi and why government officials and elected representatives should be just as curious as we are as to how this technology can improve the lives of their constituents. Away from sensational media headlines and televised hearings, one can see that a better, more open future for DeFi is developing.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we’ve provided a perspective from DeFi’s corner on the following federal legislation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>H.R. 1122, CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act</li>\n<li>H.R. 1177/S. 427, Financial Freedom Act of 2023</li>\n<li>H.R. 1414.

These types of campaigns were not only impactful for overall growth metrics, but also for marketing and brand awareness. Because they were subsidized with ARB rewards, they were mostly exclusive to Arbitrum network deployments, which brought many new active users exclusively to the Arbitrum network deployments. A shining example is the March Madness campaign, where users could mint a Bracket NFT on Arbitrum to participate in the Bracket Competition while also having secondary rewards for all March Madness volume drivers. This campaign brought in ~ 4,000 unique volume drivers to Thales Sports Markets on Arbitrum and 430 Bracket NFTs minted accumulating approximately 20,000$ prize pool from mint

We ran a three-month (January-March 2024) hybrid blockchain development boot camp, featuring a hackathon, to onboard quality developers into the Arbitrum ecosystem. The program is divided into two tracks - front-end and back-end development.</p>\n<p>Front-end developers learned how to integrate the Arbitrum SDK into their applications and develop amazing web3 UI/UX. Back-end developers, on the other hand, focused on building scalable backends using Node.js and integrating Arbitrum. Participants in both tracks learned Solidity and Ether.js.</p>\n<p>The physical sessions were live-streamed and recorded, allowing participants to contribute in real-time and ensuring an all-round engagement. We believe these recorded classes will serve as resources for anyone interested in building on the Arbitrum chain in the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-milestones-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-milestones-3\"></a>Key Milestones</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>800 registrations</li>\n<li>164 preliminary selection</li>\n<li>100 participants</li>\n<li>43 completed the program</li>\n<li>6 Projects submitted for the hackathon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"program-goals-vs-achievements-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-goals-vs-achievements-4\"></a>Program Goals vs Achievements</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Goal</th>\n<th>Achievement</th>\n<th>Achieved?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Achieve 500 registrations for the program.</td>\n<td>Achieve 800 registrations for the program.</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Create engagement with 100 active participants the program.</td>\n<td>Achieved 100 participants</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Target an 80-90% completion rate among participants.</td>\n<td>Achieved 43% completion rate</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Render assistance to participants in launching a minimum of 10 projects on Arbitrum.</td>\n<td>Only 6 Projects deployed from the Hackthon</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provide live and recorded video sessions of every class within the program</td>\n<td>Achieved 100% video recording</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Receive anonymous feedback and ratings from participants.</td>\n<td>We collected anonymous feedback and ratings from participants.</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Create a program evaluation report 2-3 months after the program ends to analyse its long-term impact on the participants.</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sponsor/participate in pitching events for participants to onboard users into their projects.</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Generate media coverage through billboard advertisements and social media promotions, with an expected reach of 25,000 to 50,000 people.</td>\n<td>YouTube - 20,000+ impression</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Put together an end-of-program report to highlight achievements.</td>\n<td>Twitter - 15,773+ views</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Generate a comprehensive monthly report on training progress.</td>\n<td>We submitted monthly reports on Questbook, Arbitrum Forum and KarmaGap</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"projects-from-the-hackathon-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#projects-from-the-hackathon-5\"></a>Projects from the Hackathon</h2>\n<p>During the last week of the Bootcamp, a Twitter space was held on the 27th of February to announce the timeline of the Hackathon and explain the other Hackathon requirements to the participants. During this Twitter space, the judges for the Hackathon were introduced and asked to give useful tips for project development to the participants. The building and the submission period started from the 1st of March to the 23rd of March but was later extended due to a timezone error when setting up the hackathon on DoraHack. Individuals with strong affiliations and interests in the Arbitrum ecosystem were chosen as the hackathon judges. The Hackathon review started on March 24th, 2024, and ended on March 28th, 2024. They were able to review, grade, and give helpful comments on each of the Hackathon projects. The projects are outlined below:</p>\n<p><strong>1.

Below are some of the videos from the boot camp:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssHeOBLCD9c\">Blockchain Fundamentals</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtJvGQpYzzg\">Cryptography &amp; Consensus Algorithms</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzxH-Q2WmOI\">Blockchain Layers</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BZo7YQyvy4\">Introduction to Solidity</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pHypxT17Cg\">Solidity - Basic Data Types</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzl9MNCUS28\">Solidity - Advanced Data Types</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUg0DpKDF8w\">Introduction to Arbitrum SDK</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK9WzARyxrA\">Arbitrum SDK - Bridging</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL5_YzzP8QY\">Arbitrum SDK - Messaging</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lasgc7JVjl0\">Express js for Web3</a></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"participation-rate-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#participation-rate-8\"></a>Participation Rate</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the program, 800 participants registered. This number was narrowed down through a preliminary selection process to 164 candidates, culminating in a final selection of 100 candidates. Out of the 100 candidates selected, 54 opted for the front-end track, while 46 pursued the back-end development path within the program.</p>\n<p>We prioritized inclusivity, ensuring equal opportunities for both male and female candidates, and applying a balanced set of selection criteria uniformly across all participants.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f0f9716ef8a0b0e428e9457c0443a527e40166e0.png\" alt=\"image3\" data-base62-sha1=\"ynL1nEQqE3Yr1rRqVdif1o5OyEE\" width=\"421\" height=\"417\"></p>\n<p>Of the participants selected, 16 opted for onsite classes while the remaining 84 participants attended the classes virtually.</p>\n<p>Throughout the two months of boot camp, our goal was to maximize participant engagement, as evidenced by two key indicators: the rate of assignment submissions and attendance. We consistently aimed for high performance in these areas to gauge the program’s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>The rate of attendance reduced as the Bootcamp came to an end while the YouTube watch rate increased significantly. Two major factors contributed to participants not attending the live classes: school/work commitments and internet connectivity issues. We provided immediate solutions for each of these challenges.</p>\n<p>The attendance rates dropped in the second month compared to the first, due to learners’ inability to attend the live classes. This led to an increase in the amount of time spent watching our YouTube content and the impressions received on the channel. This trend highlighted learners’ preference for flexible learning options and also showed that external parties benefited from the program’s content.</p>\n<p><img

This goes as far back as 1990 when Phil Zimmerman released Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), one of the first openly available public-key cryptography applications that featured end-to-end (E2E) encryption. Zimmerman’s creation prompted a criminal investigation that was eventually dropped, resulting in federal court decisions that protect encryption under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. This clash on personal privacy became dubbed the “encryption wars.”</p>\n<p>Our team over at Axis Advisory has published a write-up that offers contextual information in relation to the above: <a href=\"https://axisadvisoryxyz.substack.com/p/defending-open-source-a-united-stand\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Defending Open Source: A United Stand for Developer Rights and Software Freedom</a></p>\n<p>In this regard, we are proposing a contribution from the ArbitrumDAO to DEF &amp; CoinCenter to continue their policy &amp; litigation efforts in relation to privacy-enhancement tooling and software developer advocacy. Some of the institutions’ most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:</p>\n<p><strong>COIN CENTER</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Coin Center’s case against the Office of Foreign Assets Control about adding Tornado Cash to the OFAC Sanction List, (naturally, Tornado Cash not being a person or entity but a mere set of open-source smart contracts running on the Ethereum Blockchain).

This action reflects DEF’s commitment to preserve the digital assets space’s core values: fostering innovation, ensuring open access, and maintaining an inclusive environment. By contesting what DEF consider to be an overly broad patent, they aim to prevent potential monopolistic control, ensuring the decentralization is not compromised.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>[Refer: <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_0b48beb0dd404637b4d988988b1bf3fc.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_0b48beb0dd404637b4d988988b1bf3fc.pdf</a>].</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The DeFi Education Fund filed a legal complaint along with Beba LLC against the SEC, after they recently created and distributed their ‘BEBA token’ via airdrops. Beba and DEF are seeking legal relief due to concerns that the SEC may classify BEBA tokens as securities, which could end up hindering not only their business operations but also the broader digital asset market. In essence, the DEF are fighting against the SEC’s approach towards digital assets which has become overly broad without adequate rule-making procedures, stifling innovation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>[Refer: <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_3f7a8f2ca6614d7381122cb1beeed4a8.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_3f7a8f2ca6614d7381122cb1beeed4a8.pdf</a>].</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The DeFi Education Fund submitted an amicus brief in support of James Harper against the IRS, advocating for the Fourth Amendment rights of cryptocurrency users.

The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately.</p>\n<p>Coin Center has been at the forefront of policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties of software developers and other stakeholders within the industry.</p>\n<p>DeFi Education Fund Contribution</p>\n<p>The ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote &amp; effect a contribution to the DEF whose mission revolves around educating policymakers globally about DeFi, promoting grassroots supports, enhancing legal support across jurisdictions, and advocating for policies welcoming of decentralized financial infrastructure.</p>\n<p>They have initiated several key projects and grants to advance its objectives. One of their initial endeavors targeted a group of organizations and individuals, with the goal of expanding the understanding of decentralization and the DeFi ecosystem among policymakers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the DEF is taking a stand against how some governments interpret laws in a way that could establish a troubling precedent, potentially discouraging software developers in various fields. They pointed out the risk that developers might face legal action for their open-source code if it is misused by other for illegal activities. This could place developers are risk of being held criminally responsible for actions they didn’t partake in, possibly affecting them years or even decades later.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTRIBUTION TO COIN CENTER [A NOTE FROM THE ORGANIZATION]</strong></p>\n<p>Founded in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coin Center</a> is an independent non-profit organization focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies. Our mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code – to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately. We do this by producing and publishing policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and by engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties.</p>\n<p>We are presently litigating two cases against the U.S. government. One is on Section 6050I crypto tax reporting, <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-has-filed-a-court-challenge-against-the-treasury-dept-over-unconstitutional-financial-surveillance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">pushing back against expanded warrantless financial surveillance</a>. The other is a civil case <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-is-suing-ofac-over-its-tornado-cash-sanction/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">challenging the U.S. Treasury Department’s designation of immutable smart contracts</a>. We argue that the Treasury does not have the statutory authority to add the Tornado Cash pool contracts to the list of sanctioned persons because immutable smart contracts are neither sanctioned persons themselves nor the property of any sanctioned person. We are fighting not only for the right of U.S. persons to continue using these tools but also seeking to set an important precedent: that the Treasury Department can’t simply identify decentralized apps and add them to the sanctions list without any evidence that the app is controlled by or enriches any sanctioned person.</p>\n<p>We are also coordinating with Roman Storm’s legal defense on an amicus brief in his criminal defense. Our amicus focuses on accurately describing the operation of Tornado Cash and the role that developers play in creating decentralized apps like Tornado Cash. We argue that publishing decentralized app software, both to the blockchain and to web servers, is not the kind of activity that can give rise to prohibitions under U.S. sanctions laws because (a) U.S. sanctions laws exclude from prohibitions any transactions for information or information materials and (b) the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment protects publishing software as “pure speech” warranting the strictest scrutiny from our courts.</p>\n<p>Finally, we are <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/blog/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">continuously engaged</a> in education and lobbying efforts in Congress and the various federal agencies in the U.S. to ensure that any changes to financial surveillance law does not impinge the free speech, privacy, and assembly rights of developers and users.</p>\n<p>A grant to Coin Center will be used to support our ongoing work and to contribute to the legal defense of developers facing criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>\n<p>In conclusion, the contributions mentioned above are not just a matter of protecting individual rights but a testament to our collective commitment to preserving the principles of innovation, decentralization, and individual sovereignty within the industry.

This rationale can be posted either in the delegate’s communication thread (if they have one) or in the proposal’s discussion thread itself. To adhere to best practices, we recommend that delegates communicate their voting intention and rationale as soon as possible after casting their vote.</p>\n<p>Examples of rationale communication:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Rationale posted in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/13794/32\">delegate’s communication thread </a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rationale posted in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223/36\">proposal’s discussion thread </a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the voting process in the DAO, where voting typically first occurs on Snapshot and then on Tally, it’s understandable that delegates may keep the same voting stance in both stages. It’s reasonable for delegates not to issue a new rationale for the second stage if it was already provided during the first stage (Snapshot) and their position remains unchanged. <strong>In these cases, we simply expect delegates to indicate that they have maintained their vote based on the previously expressed rationale.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<h4><a name=\"orange_circle-commenting-in-proposals-7-cps-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#orange_circle-commenting-in-proposals-7-cps-6\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/orange_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":orange_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":orange_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Commenting in proposals (7 CPs)</h4>\n<p>It is important to clarify that for this parameter, only the number of Snapshots in the month is counted (11 in total for March), given that most of the debate is centered during the Snapshot period and not so much in tally.

This represents a big percentage of march’s Snapshot votings. This votations lacked the option ‘ABSTAIN’. So, some delegates expressed that they will not-cast their votes.</p>\n<p>One of these delegates was BlockworksResearch, expressing its concerns about this situation. After analyzing it, to solve this situation and prevent making changes on the karma dashboard that might be very complicated to executed, we decided to give an additional score as Bonus Points to those delegates that abstained to vote of the following 4 snapshots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x05e8fa22813e74fd6e5f3360fda4bb6388d0f85d4e6aef834acbb48451307b01\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC Research Member Election</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x9210912a0a77090d1407107dcb9143864aa6c1faa5c6ed9046b6a0a56bf6bbcc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC DAO Advocate Election</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3d41ffb43e44e83d004505e362e70f703aed0e740322e8ebfbb390d54724ca91\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC Security Member Election</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb04e968c2439cd68e429f722722944c960f82ce75d9f75efe8be52333e1d6554\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC Risk Member Election</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to mention that voting in all snapshots of the months represents the 15% of the final score that a delegate can get each month. In this particular month there were 11 snapshots voting in total.</p>\n<p>If we make basic math (Rule of Three) :</p>\n<p><strong>11 Snapshot</strong> --------------------- <strong>15 % of SV</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1 Snapshot</strong> --------------------- X = <strong>1,3636 of SV%</strong></p>\n<p>And, if we consider the <strong>4</strong> Snapshots mentioned above:</p>\n<p><strong>1,3636</strong> of SV% x <strong>4 Snapshots</strong> = <strong>5,4545 %</strong></p>\n<p>So this <strong>5,4545 %</strong> is the bonus points that will be added to those delegates that abstained from voting on the ARDC Snapshots and expressed it in the forum.</p>\n<p>Of all delegates that form part of the program, only <strong>1</strong> delegate indicated that it would abstain.</p>\n<p>So this <strong>5,4545 %</strong> will be added as BP to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/blockworksresearch\">@BlockworksResearch</a></p>\n<p>Even this is not the ideal solution, our approach is that delegates participate in these votes by standing by their convictions. To avoid this in the near future, we will ensure that the ballots have the necessary options for delegates to express their voting intentions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"family_woman_woman_girl_boy-new-members-of-the-program-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#family_woman_woman_girl_boy-new-members-of-the-program-18\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/family_woman_woman_girl_boy.png?v=12\" title=\":family_woman_woman_girl_boy:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":family_woman_woman_girl_boy:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> New members of the program</h3>\n<p>As we said in previous posts, any delegate can <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945\">apply to the program anytime</a>.</p>\n<p>In fact, we have some new participants that will be part of it from the next month (APRIL):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/itublockchain/summary\">ITUblockchain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ocandocrypto\">ocandocrypto.eth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo/summary\">Jojo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945/47\">Bobbay</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"police_car-security-council-elections-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#police_car-security-council-elections-19\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/police_car.png?v=12\" title=\":police_car:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":police_car:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Security Council Elections</h3>\n<p>When the proposal was written, security council elections were not considered.

The efforts have addressed several challenges and introduced key updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Handling On-chain Voting Complexities</strong>: The process of calculating accurate lifetime voting percentages for delegates was complicated by numerous canceled or invalid proposals. Adjusting for these anomalies was essential for reliability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Standardizing Voting Rationale Documentation</strong>: The absence of a uniform method for delegates to report their voting rationale—spread across proposal threads, delegate communication threads, and Snapshot—posed a significant challenge. Karma employed AI (Large Language Models) to efficiently extract these rationales from forum posts, streamlining administrative workflows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Archiving Delegate Activities</strong>: To ensure transparency and provide a historical perspective, Karma has begun archiving snapshots of all delegate activities, allowing for the review of monthly statistics by any interested party.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are continuing to make more updates to provide even more granular information.

Just last week Optimism announced the commitment of $3.3B in grants and all trends suggest there are likely more announcements like that to come.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-and-opportunity-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-and-opportunity-4\"></a>Motivation and opportunity</h2>\n<p>Blockchain applications are still in their infancy, likely with the most significant players of the next 2 decades currently in early stages or still to be founded.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/acd1ef275e478cc0d60befbac9162c880a83529c.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"oEPUdWONJ7WmAxwKqPGdVbzcPzC\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p>Venture Capital instruments are proven models used by sovereign wealth funds, corporations, and government economic development initiatives to support the development of ecosystems. Let us broadly call these instruments, targeted not only at healthy self sustainable returns, but ecosystem strategic objectives - Development Venture Capital or dVC.</p>\n<p>What a lot of the above stakeholders have figured out over decades of work is that even if you only care about the ecosystem impact, having it enabled via high growth for profit schemes produces by far the best impact. And on top of that, returns are generated allowing for sustainability and growth of the treasury enabling even more funds to be deployed. These characteristics more than justify the added setup complexity compared to grant schemes, where applicable. For clarity, Grant financing is still a crucial part of the whole value chain, especially for funding public goods and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>If Artibrum is able to rapidly leverage not only its progressive values and commitment to decentralized governance, but also the best in class talent and practices from more matured Developmental Venture Capital approaches in the Web2 world, it can jump ahead of the competition, attract the best builders, capital allocators, and ecosystem support players, thus setting the trend for others to follow.</p>\n<p>Given the complex landscape of Web3 verticals and market segments, as well as the varying needs of ventures across the stages of their lifecycle, resource allocation is best done through a multitude of specialized programs and instruments. Additionally, it’s best to partner with and support the emergent players of the ecosystem instead of trying to reinvent them top down, as this enables access to the talent, networks, market insights, and momentum of the emergent players. Thus enabling Arbitrum to move faster, with lower risk, and more cost effectively.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, Arbitrum needs to do this without allowing any of the partners or capital allocators to capture AVI and the DAO’s resources for their own exclusive gains, but rather use the capital in deep alignment with Arbitrum, generating win-win outcomes for Arbitrum, program operators, and projects.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"key-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-5\"></a>Key Considerations:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The structure should have an executive team that is able to operate at speed and provide a stakeholder friendly counterparty for GPs to negotiate with and raise money from Arbitrum as an LP.</li>\n<li>Potentially be able to get involved in direct investments or acting as a liquidity provider, but without competing with its main objective to attract a broad group of VCs and programs to operate in the ecosystem. Whether AVI should at all make direct investments or act as a liquidity provider is debatable and will require further exploration.</li>\n<li>Have an oversight committee that is elected by the DAO and includes key qualified representatives. These might include key Arbitrum DAO contributors and delegates, representatives of the Foundation and of key investors of Arbitrum with relevant competence, whose main vested interest is clearly the success of the chain above all else.</li>\n<li>The liquidation of Arb tokens, while they are being funnelled to be used in the venture ecosystem should be done under policies dictated by the DAO in alignment with avoiding causing undesirable price action. Furthermore concentration of such tokens in this substructure should not concentrate governance rights as a result of delegation by the small group of appointed executives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"case-studies-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#case-studies-6\"></a>Case Studies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The group referred to some of the many case studies from our experience in thread <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/what-do-we-want-for-arbitrum-venture-funds/22213\"><em>What do we want from Arbitrum Venture Funds</em></a>. It is also running a research project to deeply understand all the mechanics of how other Web3 ecosystems are currently investing in their builders and leverage the best lessons learned.</li>\n<li>Some of these Web3 cases might be well known to the community, but as in many cases their success is debatable, they would be analysed in separate posts going forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"key-questions-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-questions-7\"></a>Key Questions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Legal Structure (in coordination with Foundation, M&amp;A, Gaming Catalyst group and others)</li>\n<li>What is the governance mechanism that should be employed to enable the DAO to represent its interests\n<ul>\n<li>What type of decisions should lead to a DAO wide vote</li>\n<li>What should be the powers of the oversight committee</li>\n<li>How should its members be elected and with what term</li>\n<li>How should the management team be selected and what should its mandate be</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How should synchronization with ArbitrumDAO’s strategy and thesis development be done</li>\n<li>Engaging with other groups within the DAO.
