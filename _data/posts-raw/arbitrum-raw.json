This project will empower a working group of experienced community members to create high-quality educational resources, foster a vibrant developer community, and accelerate innovation on the Arbitrum platform. This project is an outcome of the DevRel Fellowship.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>There are 860 projects listed on the Arbitrum Ecosystem Portal. Imagine a world in which every one of those projects that needed help communicating with developers using their project could get it. A thriving developer community is essential for the continued growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Accessible, accurate, and up-to-date technical content is a key factor in attracting, onboarding, and retaining developers. The Scaling DevRel for Arbitrum project aims to amplify the creation and dissemination of such resources, empowering developers to build innovative applications and contribute to the expanding Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>The Scaling DevRel for Arbitrum project aligns with the Arbitrum DAO’s mission to foster a decentralized and collaborative ecosystem. By empowering community members to lead educational initiatives, the project promotes inclusivity, knowledge-sharing, and innovation. This approach will not only accelerate the development of technical resources but also cultivate a sense of ownership and engagement within the developer community.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<p>Working Group: A dedicated team of five experienced community members, from the Arbitrum DevRel Fellowship, with proven expertise in Web3 and DevRel will spearhead content creation and community engagement efforts.</p>\n<p>To showcase the team’s expertise and capabilities, we have included links to samples of their previous work below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsQbsop73cfHn2VjMMrrbdBjZFPYEgBp6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Celo Spark with Nestor</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/24045084f16b55309f62694bd07e285ece14b095.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/58CqPzqZKPqDGKYcquNq5BVZErz.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24045084f16b55309f62694bd07e285ece14b095_2_476x368.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"58CqPzqZKPqDGKYcquNq5BVZErz\" width=\"476\" height=\"368\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24045084f16b55309f62694bd07e285ece14b095_2_476x368.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24045084f16b55309f62694bd07e285ece14b095_2_714x552.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24045084f16b55309f62694bd07e285ece14b095_2_952x736.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B5AEB4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ArI1j5zr3s8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Starknet Workshops</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/36677be458b9e276b3b1e975d5f1c3f7b8b4a121.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7LhuNvHkiVKhB5VDkS6kzqtRSDL.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/36677be458b9e276b3b1e975d5f1c3f7b8b4a121_2_483x269.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"7LhuNvHkiVKhB5VDkS6kzqtRSDL\" width=\"483\" height=\"269\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/36677be458b9e276b3b1e975d5f1c3f7b8b4a121_2_483x269.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/36677be458b9e276b3b1e975d5f1c3f7b8b4a121_2_724x403.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/36677be458b9e276b3b1e975d5f1c3f7b8b4a121_2_966x538.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDEDEF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Advisor</strong>: Matt Hamilton, a Senior Developer Advocate from the Arbitrum Foundation, will serve in an advisory role, offering guidance and expertise without receiving compensation.</p>\n<p><strong>Multisig</strong>: A 4-of-6 multisig wallet will be established to manage the funds securely and transparently, with signatories including working group members and community representatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Educational Content</strong>: The working group will produce:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comprehensive video tutorials on Arbitrum Stylus and Orbit</li>\n<li>GitHub repositories with practical examples</li>\n<li>Detailed articles integrating video content and code</li>\n<li>A “workshop in a box” framework that will package up this content for easy distribution and use by other teams, e.g the Arbitrum Ambassador programme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Content Distribution</strong>: The content will be disseminated through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Official Arbitrum channels (website, blog, YouTube)</li>\n<li>Relevant developer platforms</li>\n<li>DevRel Uni cohort (reaching 250+ students across 42 countries)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Transparency and Reporting</strong>: The working group will provide bi-weekly progress updates on the Arbitrum Governance Forum, publish detailed documentation of processes and expenditures, and host monthly community calls.</p>\n<p><strong>Partnership with DevRel University</strong>: DevRel University is a cohort-based programme to train and enable developer relations people, currently having completed 5 cohorts with over 250 people from over 50 countries.

The daoURI, following EIP-4824, will create a single source of truth on the DAO, that cannot be altered by external agencies, is fully manageable via governance, bringing helpful context on the DAO onchain. This will be helpful for newcomers, tooling providers, and experienced governooors alike.</p>\n<p>DAOstar received a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to improve the adoption of EIP-4824 in the Arbitrum ecosystem. We are allocating a portion of that grant to steward this proposal. <strong>Adopting EIP-4824 requires no additional spend from the DAO treasury, and it makes no change to its smart contracts or governance structure.</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO is one of the largest DAOs, and there is a lot of data surrounding it. This dataset grows with every new initiative and has multiple components that may not be very visible from the “outside”. For example, consider the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who are the current Security Council, Arbitrum Research &amp; Development Collective, Procurement Committee members? (Answer: you can search the respective forum post to find this)</li>\n<li>Can you share a location that tracks all DAO-owned/managed multisig addresses? (Answer: this could be <a href=\"https://www.arbwallets.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.arbwallets.xyz/</a>)</li>\n<li>Can you share a status update on the DAO’s grant spending? (Answer: R3gen Finance reports this on the forum)</li>\n<li>Where can we see delegate performance? (Answer: KarmaGAP or Tally)</li>\n<li>How much in sequencer fees is being collected? (Answer: there is a dashboard for this)</li>\n<li>What orbit chains exist? (Answer: the ecosystem page tracks this)</li>\n<li>Where to find recordings and transcripts of public meetings? (Answer: I’m not sure!)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For an active participant, these answers might not be very hard. But for the majority of people who are not active participants of the DAO, and even for tooling providers, collecting this information requires a painstaking amount of manual effort. This leads to inconsistencies, errors and outdated information.</p>\n<p>There are over 200 DAOs at the moment with a treasury size of over $1M, and collecting information on them manually is becoming an exponentially difficult task. EIP-4824 was authored by DAOstar with the support from the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Etherscan, DeepDAO, Snapshot, and a large number of DAO tooling companies, to create a better infrastructure for DAO data.</p>\n<p>Adopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. daoURIs have a standard JSON-LD format:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">{\n\"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n\"type\": \"DAO\",\n\"name\": \"&lt;name of the DAO&gt;\",\n\"description\": \"&lt;description&gt;\",\n\"membersURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"proposalsURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"activityLogURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"governanceURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"contractsRegistryURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It contains information on governance, members, activities and contracts by default. Outside of the endpoints mentioned above, a DAO can also choose to publish information that is specifically important to it. For Arbitrum, this could be information about orbit chains, different multi-sigs and councils, spending, sequencer fees, link to its constitution, etc. Essentially, <strong>the daoURI creates an “official repository” of information on the DAO.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some examples of how the daoURI could be used:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It can be used to bring more context to contracts on block explorers. For example, we could go from this:</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1QMspHKChbZaAlnUGWXZNp0rCKK.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_624x331.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1QMspHKChbZaAlnUGWXZNp0rCKK\" width=\"624\" height=\"331\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_624x331.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_936x496.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_1248x662.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F8FA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>to this:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sIqiG4h9JSjvKbsmjRAawo9gqyc.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_624x328.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"sIqiG4h9JSjvKbsmjRAawo9gqyc\" width=\"624\" height=\"328\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_624x328.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_936x492.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_1248x656.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F1F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>We can make DAO data easily and freely available to everyone</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, Arbitrum DAO’s current DeepDAO profile misses a ton of info - contracts, or revenue, or governance guardrails (councils and multi-sigs), etc. Messari’s Arbitrum DAO dashboard requires a paid membership to access, which could also be due to the difficulty of collecting and presenting DAO data (thus making it too valuable to give away for free).

This takes away a lot of available information. If we wanted to change this, we could achieve it easily by enforcing a discussionURI field inside the proposalURI (which is a standard component of daoURI). Tally, Aragon, Snapshot X, and most governance tooling providers are members of DAOstar. Extending the standard will create an easy upgrade pathway for them and this change would reflect the change across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>To summarize, a daoURI creates a source of truth for metadata, that can represent the present state of the DAO, and is easily accessible for onchain and offchain tools. This proposal carries no additional cost, or changes to any existing smart contract or process. It’s a step in the right direction with no downside.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>This proposal aligns with the Arbitrum’s mission and <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">community values</a>, by making the Arbitrum DAO more open, accessible, and inclusive to participants and tools alike.

It will be stored on IPFS.</p>\n<p>Note that this is a starting point. The daoURI of Arbitrum DAO will continuously evolve and become more comprehensive over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Publish the daoURI onchain:</strong> As detailed in the execution summary above, this will be a simple smart contract call to deploy a new contract on Arbitrum One.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintain the daoURI:</strong> Though daoURI is fully manageable through governance, it may not be practically feasible to initiate an onchain vote for every upgrade. To solve this, the DAO can set one or many <em>manager</em> to manage its daoURI. The Arbitrum Foundation might be a good candidate. <strong>If needed, DAOstar can commit to maintaining Arbitrum DAO’s daoURI for a year for at additional cost.</strong> <em>Managers</em> can only update daoURIs. They can be added or removed easily by the DAO.</p>\n<p>To keep the daoURI a community-led effort, we suggest that whoever is set as a <em>manager</em> maintain a forum topic to discuss updates. That way, any Arbitrum DAO member can publicly request to add a missing piece of info to the daoURI.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"timeline-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-6\"></a>Timeline</h3>\n<p>Creation of daoURI V0.1 (includes conversations with delegates, service providers, the Arbitrum Foundation, and all other participants through the forum, led by DAOstar): 4 weeks</p>\n<p>Testing (ensuring that the subURIs work well &amp; that any static data is either uploaded to IPFS or hosted by a trusted 3rd party, for example the Arbitrum Foundation): 2 weeks</p>\n<p>Overall: 6 weeks before the proposal is ready to be executed</p>\n<h3><a name=\"overall-cost-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overall-cost-7\"></a>Overall Cost</h3>\n<p>This proposal does not require any transfer of funds from the DAO treasury.</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/bobbay\">@Bobbay</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_stablelab\">@Matt_StableLab</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/raam\">@raam</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/coolhorsegirl\">@coolhorsegirl</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/srijith-questbook\">@Srijith-Questbook</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/sinkas\">@Sinkas</a>, Hayden (BlockworksResearch) and Nick Nahaghi (Hats) for feedback and edits; <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/krst\">@krst</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/alexlumley\">@AlexLumley</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/frisson\">@Frisson</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3\">@dk3</a>, and George Beall (Gauntlet) for the expert sessions, and to Klaus and the rest of the GovHack team for making an awesome event happen at Brussels!</em></p>\n<p><em>EIP-4824 has already been adopted by Snapshot, Aragon, Treasure, 1inch, Optimism Collective (through the Optimism Foundation), and multiple frameworks and DAOs.

This is not just an Arbitrum DAO problem but it affects Arbitrum DAO governance quite a lot. Still to this day, most governance processes in most big DAOs are spread across multiple platforms and systems, from messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Twitter, to Discourse forums, to offchain voting platforms like Snapshot and then to onchain voting front-ends like Tally.</p>\n<p>In each of these platforms, delegates need to keep themselves up to date, review information about proposals coming to vote in the DAO and form their opinions about whether they should support a particular proposal. Delegates are also expected to actively share their concerns and provide feedback on proposals throughout the lifecycle of a proposal so that the proposal can advance through the several stages of the governance process successfully.</p>\n<p>For a delegate, even to the most competent ones, to keep up with all of this information scattered around different sources is… overwhelming, to say the least. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/melting_face.png?v=12\" title=\":melting_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":melting_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>As an example, this is roughly what happens when a delegate (or anybody else for that matter) tries to understand the context and form an opinion about an important Arbitrum proposal like the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/catalyze-gaming-ecosystem-growth-on-arbitrum/22368\">Gaming Catalyst Program</a> that just recently passed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/aa6b813b591ad6a5fc0af87fc7e46eec1e9b21d9.gif\" alt=\"gcp4\" data-base62-sha1=\"ojBuSd0BVgexpX3j2X9krCKRMVj\" width=\"576\" height=\"360\" class=\"animated\"></p>\n<p>If we expect more and better delegates to keep up with governance proposals adequately, we should invest in appropriate tooling to make their jobs much easier than they currently are.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_shrugging/2.png?v=12\" title=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-terms-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-5\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_shrugging/2.png?v=12\" title=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_shrugging/2.png?v=12\" title=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"steps-to-implement-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-7\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_shrugging/2.png?v=12\" title=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-8\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_shrugging/2.png?v=12\" title=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"overall-cost-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overall-cost-9\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_shrugging/2.png?v=12\" title=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":man_shrugging:t2:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12\" title=\":pray:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":pray:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\nThank you for reading this proposal until the end, and please give us your honest and harshest feedback.

Title</h2>\n<p><strong>Bringing AI Delegates to Arbitrum DAO Governance</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-abstract-2\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO will delegate 5M ARB, divided equally between 5 AI Voting Agents created by Blockful. Three of these agents will have their “bias prompts” chosen through a JokeRace contest, while the other two will focus on Public Goods Funding and Arbitrum DAO Longevity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-3-motivation-3\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>ARB holders should strive to keep the DAO treasury safe and efficient. However, human delegates may fail to be active. They can also vote contrary to delegators’ preferences, as humans agreeing on a topic might still disagree on others, creating a counter-incentive for delegation by lack of trust and resulting in even lower delegated supply and active voting delegations, which puts the DAO at risk.</p>\n<p>AI Delegates can address these issues: they always vote, maintain a consistent perspective, and are immune to social pressure, lobbying, or bribery.</p>\n<p>By adopting AI Delegates, Arbitrum DAO can improve its governance body, ensuring decisions are made more efficiently, inclusively, and transparently. This proposal aims to create a resilient and adaptive governance tool leveraging the strengths of both human and AI participants.</p>\n<p>Drawing from the insights of the “Event Horizon” proposal, the integration of AI Delegates addresses the fundamental issues of low voter participation and the unpredictability of human delegates. The benefits of this approach include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Consistent and Reliable Voting:</strong> AI Delegates always vote in accordance with their predefined biases, ensuring that the DAO’s decisions are made with consistent logic and reasoning. This reliability addresses one of the major shortcomings of human delegates, who may fail to participate in all votes or be influenced by external factors.</li>\n<li><strong>Elimination of Human Shortcomings:</strong> Human delegates can be influenced by external factors such as lobbying, bribery, and social pressure. AI Delegates are immune to these influences, making them a reliable alternative. This eliminates the risk of votes being swayed by non-transparent factors and ensures that decisions are made based solely on predefined biases and the DAO Dataset.</li>\n<li><strong>Encouragement of Delegation:</strong> By providing a reliable and transparent voting mechanism, AI Delegates can encourage more ARB holders to participate in the governance process through delegation. This addresses the issue of low delegated supply and strengthens the DAO’s governance structure. ARB holders can delegate their voting power to AI Delegates with confidence, knowing that their votes will be cast consistently and transparently.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"h-4-rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-4-rationale-4\"></a>4. Rationale</h2>\n<p>Integrating AI Delegates aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission by enhancing governance quality and security. This initiative provides a reliable delegation option, ensuring diverse preferences are represented. It promotes consistent participation and mitigates risks associated with low voter turnout.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancing Voter Participation and Mitigating Risks:</strong><br>\nAI Delegates ensure consistent voting and are free from external influences such as bribery and social pressures. This consistency mitigates risks associated with low participation, safeguarding the DAO treasury and decision-making processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Inclusive Representation and Community Engagement:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bias Prompts:</strong> The use of bias prompts allows diverse perspectives to be represented consistently through different AI Delegates. The JokeRace contest engages the community in selecting these prompts, ensuring they reflect a wide range of views.</li>\n<li><strong>Alignment with DAO Values:</strong> Community-selected bias prompts ensure AI Delegates align with Arbitrum DAO’s community preferences, promoting integrity and effectiveness in governance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear Voting Process:</strong> AI Delegates operate transparently with community-defined biases, ensuring stakeholders understand the rationale behind each vote and give their reasoning on the votes.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring Tools:</strong> Blockful’s tools provide real-time insights into AI Delegate voting behaviors, enhancing accountability and trust in the governance process.</li>\n<li><strong>Stable Voting Activity:</strong> Consistent AI Delegate participation maintains stable voting power, reducing volatility and promoting informed, balanced decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"h-5-key-terms-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-5-key-terms-5\"></a>5.

This interactive dashboard will provide real-time and historical insights into key metrics that measure developer experience.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"motivation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-8\"></a>Motivation</h4>\n<p>Developers face challenges in finding the right resources, community support, and incentives to build on Arbitrum(especially considering new parts of the tech stack like Stylus and Orbit). There is also no effective system to measure developer satisfaction, engagement, and productivity, leading to suboptimal allocation of resources. Arbitrum Builders Hub aims to address these issues by providing a centralized platform to track and reward developer activities, ultimately improving the overall developer experience and accelerating the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"rationale-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-9\"></a>Rationale</h4>\n<p>By helping us to create this DevEx dashboard, the Arbitrum DAO can demonstrate its commitment to their core values. This will ultimately attract and retain talented developers, creating a thriving and innovative ecosystem long-term. Having data breakdowns about the tooling usage and developer activity will also help align incentives better and create reasonable KPIs for other developer focused programs run by the DAO.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"specifications-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-10\"></a>Specifications</h4>\n<p>Developers using the web app can either preview already existing statistics, public feedback, bug reports, feature requests or authorize to gain access to more features.

They need fast micro-loans, but the market is dominated by loan sharks with insanely high interest rates, which are impossible to pay out, leaving them in a vicious cycle.</p>\n<p>Challenges in accessing financing, along with bureaucracy, are other obstacles that Latin American micro-businesses must overcome to consolidate their growth. Financial institutions do not sufficiently facilitate access to the loans that micro-businesses need to expand their businesses. On the other hand, in general, the process of creating a company is slow, requiring numerous, complex, and costly procedures that delay starting a business.</p>\n<p>DeCredit Score gives local businesses in Latam access to micro-loans, with affordable interest rates, avoiding loan sharks, while protecting investors’ funding and providing them a good risk-managed return on investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>Micro-businesses make up 90% of all economic units in Latin America, and the majority of them depend on micro-loans. The market is dominated by loan sharks, landing micro-credits but at the same time imposing insanely high interest rates (up to 400% a year!). Besides the financial aspect, which creates a strong dependence on micro-loans they can never pay out, there is an alarming underlying security threat for the borrowers and their loved ones. Regular kidnappings or death threats by the hand of loan sharks, followed by a ransom that will be borrowed directly from the same usurers, creating an infinite loop of debt, are a daily occurrence.</p>\n<p>Micro businesses live in a poverty trap and DeFi can drop these interest rates by about 90%. Studies have shown that access to affordable credit allows micro businesses to grow about 54% a year! We could be unlocking the potential of underdeveloped countries with a solution that allows unsecured credits to leverage the power of web3</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>Real-world assets (RWAs) are underrepresented in Arbitrum, comprising only 1.1% of grants in 2023, and tokenized private credit making up just 0.4% of the global market. Arbitrum should develop an actionable strategy, allocate more resources, and take a leading role in RWAs, aligning with its position of being the Home of DeFi.</p>\n<p>DeCredit Score has the potential to become a tangible use case that brings an Arbitrum based blockchain solution to the masses, attracting thousands of users through word of mouth from trusted contacts and first-hand experience rather than blockchain insiders. By addressing the problem of loan accessibility for micro-businesses, which represent 90% of Latin America’s economic entities, DeCredit Score and Arbitrum will provide tangible value to DeFi and gain significant public traction.</p>\n<p><strong>How Does DeCredit Score Work?</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/dd3c6c4a70003845e724654a16d0664ca7082588.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vz8YykuOST4zhTHBin3nJHWPlfG.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Frame 26\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/dd3c6c4a70003845e724654a16d0664ca7082588_2_690x199.jpeg\" alt=\"Frame 26\" data-base62-sha1=\"vz8YykuOST4zhTHBin3nJHWPlfG\" width=\"690\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/dd3c6c4a70003845e724654a16d0664ca7082588_2_690x199.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/dd3c6c4a70003845e724654a16d0664ca7082588_2_1035x298.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/dd3c6c4a70003845e724654a16d0664ca7082588_2_1380x398.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAFAFA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The micro-business owner (user) registers on the app, creating a smart wallet and getting onboarded to Arbitrum. The user, then, undergoes a KYC process that has two parts: in-app validation of business location, identity, and business permits, followed by on-ground validation by DeCredit Score team members with attestations. This process assigns an initial credit score.</p>\n<p>Next, users create profiles and can add validations (e.g., email, social media, crypto transactions via Bitso, house ownership (through the Ethereum Attestation Service), and payment history) to boost their credit score. Users then can apply for loans, specifying the amount, weekly payments, and justifications (such as business invoices). DeCredit Score doesn’t require collateral initially; instead, each weekly loan payment builds collateral, mitigating risk if payments stop.</p>\n<p>The pilot, with a 200k stablecoin loan pool on ARB, aims to support 100 micro-businesses over six months. Past research* shows micro-businesses often renegotiate loan terms due to vulnerabilities to unexpected events, not lack of commitment. DeCredit Score offers flexible payback terms.</p>\n<p><strong>Pilot KPIs include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of businesses signed up</li>\n<li>Initial and final credit score</li>\n<li>Number of loans paid on time</li>\n<li>Number of renegotiated loans</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To prevent gaming the system, the app uses dID to recognize if users try to open multiple accounts, ensuring the same credit score and verification stamps apply, and blocking new loans if previous ones aren’t repaid.</p>\n<p>*NOTE: DeCredit Score’s database is sourced from a Mexican financial institution that serves micro-businesses.

Our proposed track sought to surface relevant information and recommend gradual steps toward decentralizing aspects of the Arbitrum sequencer, such as enabling faster bridging via decentralized preconfirmations.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Arbitrum’s sequencer is centralized, and while this might serve the purposes of the community today, it is necessary for the DAO to consider the implications of decentralizing the sequencer. In addition, Offchain Labs and Espresso are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@espressosys/espresso-systems-and-offchain-labs-release-r-d-roadmap-for-decentralized-timeboost-5d0007dff66d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">collaborating</a> on r&amp;d towards decentralizing Timeboost, suggesting the necessity for the DAO to begin having such discussions.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-terms-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-3\"></a>Key Terms</h1>\n<p>Sequencer: entity responsible for collecting and ordering users’ transactions</p>\n<p>Liveness (uptime):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Arbitrum One chain keeps processing user transaction</li>\n<li>censorship resistance i.e honest transactions get included in Arbitrum without bias towards individual users or applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>guarantee that a transaction does not revert</li>\n<li>latency: time to achieve finality</li>\n<li>pre-confirmation: a promise that a user’s transaction will eventually be a part of the finalized Arbitrum state. Can also be seen as a type of finality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum sequencer has two primary tasks: ordering transactions into blocks, and providing a guarantee that blocks won’t revert prior to posting a batch to Ethereum. In other words, the sequencer is in charge of building blocks and of providing a preconfirmation.</p>\n<p>Block building entails choosing which transactions to include, thus a centralized sequencer has control over which transactions end up making it into the Arbitrum chain. This leads to the first critique: a lack of censorship resistance and neutrality.</p>\n<p>Beyond censorship, the fact that only a single sequencer can build blocks means that if that sequencer goes down, the Arbitrum chain is effectively halted till the sequencer comes back online (barring using the escape hatch). This is commonly referred to as the liveness property of a protocol.</p>\n<p>Decentralizing block building can thus improve upon the status quo, by improving the censorship resistance and liveness guarantees of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The preconfirmation provided by the centralized sequencer provides best in class UX for the vast majority of transactions on Arbitrum, however, third-party bridges often don’t want to rely on this preconfirmation, especially for high volume transactions. This is to avoid the risk of an issue with the centralized sequencer causing a bridging transaction to revert, which can lead to an economic loss.</p>\n<p>Instead, these bridges default to waiting for a batch that includes a bridging transaction from Arbitrum to finalize on Ethereum, which ensures that it wont revert. This is why third-party bridges often take 15+ minutes to bridge funds out of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>It is possible to retain centralized control over block building, but add a decentralized preconfirmation protocol to gradually decentralize the sequencer over time. We’d like to propose for the Arbitrum DAO to consider integrating decentralized preconfirmations as a first step towards decentralized sequencing. This imposes minimal changes to how the protocol presently works. Instead it can be seen as an additive layer of security.</p>\n<p>As an example of how this might works, imagine a new consensus protocol similar to the one employed by the Ethereum L1, except this new consensus protocol reaches finality in a manner of seconds. Arbitrum blocks will then receive a preconfirmation from this new consensus protocol, prior to being posted to Ethereum. This allows third-party bridges to safely settle transactions in a matter of seconds. It is worth noting that Arbitrum can still maintain its 0.2s block time in this design.</p>\n<p>By implementing decentralized preconfirmations as a first step, the DAO can improve UX around bridging, and give itself more time to explore the trade-off space related to completely decentralizing the sequencer. Below we’d like to introduce some of those trade-offs as a starting point for further discussion.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"tradeoffs-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tradeoffs-5\"></a>Tradeoffs</h1>\n<p><em>Centralized Sequencing:</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"pros-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pros-6\"></a>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Already live today, no extra work needed.</li>\n<li>Guarantees fast pre-confirmation (the speed at which you receive notification from your wallet when you submit a transaction on Arbitrum).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"cons-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#cons-7\"></a>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Trust issues: Reliance on the sequencer not to censor or reorder transactions.</li>\n<li>Increased downtime risk (which has occurred a few times in the past for Arbitrum).</li>\n<li>Regulatory vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>Geographical centralization (co-location and regulatory risks)</li>\n<li>Slower bridging for high-value transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Decentralized Sequencing:</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"pros-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pros-8\"></a>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Real-time liveness/censorship resistance: If one operator goes down or censors transactions, another can step in to ensure the chain continues processing transactions.</li>\n<li>Practical liveness/censorship resistance: If the sequencer goes down and there are no other sequencers, users would need to force include their transactions (see this <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wakeup-labs-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/25134\">proposal</a>). This would involve direct interaction with Ethereum, which is a) longer (24 hours) and b) more costly. In scenarios where time equals money, this could be very detrimental for certain users.</li>\n<li>Regulatory: Regulatory guidance around centralized operators (even for permissionless systems) has not been provided. While there are no immediate requirements, this is an area to be mindful of going forward.</li>\n<li>Ethos: Truly decentralized applications include broad community participation and ownership. Permissionless and decentralized operators further this goal.</li>\n<li>Bridging: Faster finality for high value bridged transactions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"cons-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#cons-9\"></a>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Potentially slower pre-confirmations</li>\n<li>New code stack introduces potential new risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"desirability-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#desirability-10\"></a>Desirability:</h1>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lineabuild/status/1797283493778710949?s=46\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Linea Case Study</a></em>: A few weeks ago, a hacker drained an application on Linea, causing the loss of user funds. The Linea team had to stop the sequencer to censor the hacker’s addresses. In this case, operating a centralized sequencer serves as a tool to mitigate the damage from exploits.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if there had been significant price movement during that period, lending protocols could not have liquidated positions, potentially causing bad debt - an undesirable outcome. This situation also highlights how, even though the hacker would have been able to fully drain users’ funds, decentralized sequencing could prevent a scenario in which other users accumulate bad debt.</p>\n<p>These are trade-offs that the DAO should weigh when considering the implications of decentralizing the sequencer. However, we do know that the protocol takes a less opinionated stance with a decentralized sequencer. It is worth noting that merely decentralizing the preconfirmations has no impact on this question.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"potential-further-work-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#potential-further-work-11\"></a>Potential Further Work</h1>\n<p>Offchain Labs and Espresso are already working on a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GHPFWMQOwCk?list=PLpktWkixc1gX-L5NT-vuDP54kW--3gDnK&amp;t=390\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">decentralized version</a> of <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167\">Timeboost</a> which can enable decentralized sequencing.

The first step we introduce is decentralized preconfirmations for faster bridging. Other potential work includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investigate the economics of centralized sequencing vs decentralized sequencing.\n<ul>\n<li>How will the protocol bootstrap and/or reward Timeboost operators?</li>\n<li>Can we measure the economic trade-offs?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Highlight the mechanism design of centralized Timeboost, decentralized Timeboost, and Timeboost’s compatibility with Espresso.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"final-thoughts-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#final-thoughts-12\"></a>Final thoughts</h1>\n<p>After discussing with community members and the expert panel at GovHack, we have decided to continue working on this proposal asynchronously. This effort will involve consulting with delegates, other community members, Offchain Labs, and Espresso.

This lack of presence hinders the ecosystem’s growth and reduces its competitive edge in the fast-evolving Layer 2 solutions space. Without a robust social media strategy, Arbitrum struggles to communicate its advantages, foster community engagement, and drive adoption. A structured social media activation is crucial to address these challenges and boost the ecosystem’s prominence and influence.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum ecosystem currently faces a significant challenge: a lack of visibility and engagement. This proposal aims to address this issue by implementing a structured social media activation strategy. By leveraging the power of community-driven content and activities, we can increase awareness and engagement around the Arbitrum DAO, ultimately contributing to its growth and adoption.</p>\n<p>This proposal provides a structured and scalable approach to increasing Arbitrum’s visibility. By creating a bounty program on different platforms, we can engage micro-influencers and content creators to produce high-quality content and activities. This will not only enhance the ecosystem’s visibility but also ensure that the content meets high standards through quality assurance criteria.</p>\n<p>Finally, this proposal offers a targeted approach to solving Arbitrum’s visibility problem. These stakeholders will produce high-quality content and activities that highlight the benefits and opportunities within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The structured approach ensures that efforts are coordinated and impactful, with clear quality assurance criteria and KPI tracking to measure success.</p>\n<p>Rationale-</p>\n<p>On Solana, SuperTeam DAO does the same idea. Their bounties platform helps projects connect with the community and allows projects and the foundation to create and manage bounties.</p>\n<p>The goal of this bounty initiative is to highlight the benefits of using the platform for both project owners and contributors. Project owners can list bounties or grants to find contributors, gain visibility, and create listings easily and for free. Contributors can create profiles to get notified of new opportunities, contribute to top crypto projects, build their on-chain resumes, and get paid in crypto.</p>\n<p>To know more: <a href=\"https://earn.superteam.fun/bounties/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Superteam Earn | Discover Bounties and Grants in Crypto for Design, Development, and Content</a></p>\n<p>On Arbitrum, there is an incredible opportunity to further enhance the ecosystem by increasing community involvement. Currently, the ecosystem could benefit from more incentives to attract a broader range of participants. By empowering and fostering activities around content creators, builders, community organizers, and general enthusiasts, we can significantly boost Arbitrum’s visibility. This increased visibility will not only improve understanding and engagement but also drive growth and adoption in a decentralized and open manner. Our goal is to create a vibrant and dynamic community that reflects the true potential of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The Marketing Axis of Arbitrum is divided into four axis:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b4a0c1f828b762b89a415df4ae3e385d67d0652f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pLUmID8g0jIrfCEXy8tuSw1OeZN.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b4a0c1f828b762b89a415df4ae3e385d67d0652f_2_602x453.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"pLUmID8g0jIrfCEXy8tuSw1OeZN\" width=\"602\" height=\"453\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b4a0c1f828b762b89a415df4ae3e385d67d0652f_2_602x453.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b4a0c1f828b762b89a415df4ae3e385d67d0652f_2_903x679.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b4a0c1f828b762b89a415df4ae3e385d67d0652f.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9FAF9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Awareness: People hear about the project.</p>\n<p>Builders: People build projects on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Investment: People invest in the project.</p>\n<p>Protocol Users: People use Arbitrum and the underlying projects.</p>\n<p>The most crucial one is protocol users because it will help the project achieve more adoption, more transactions, and a higher Total Value Locked (TVL).</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<p>So, how to make Arbitrum viral?</p>\n<p>The goal of this proposal is to increase visibility for Arbitrum through micro programs powered by the existing Community Platform.

This proposal can be activated quickly, has low structural costs, low failure risk, and serves as a prototype pilot that can be replicated across various verticals and scaled based on the amount of funding provided.</p>\n<p>The solution is to fund multiple simultaneous campaigns designed on social platforms to encourage micro-influencers to promote Arbitrum, thereby increasing visibility and contributing to general awareness of the projects building on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The proposed solution aims to better onboard various stakeholders, including micro-influencers, content creators, developers, community organizers, and general enthusiasts, with fair rewards that lead to increased visibility and engagement around the Arbitrum DAO. This will be achieved by implementing missions and bounties (rewards). The idea is to create specific pilot missions that encourage micro-influencers and builders to complete tasks, create content, and onboard new people and communities.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep dive solutions</strong></p>\n<p>To effectively onboard various users through rewards and bounties, a structured and comparative approach we propose a challenge involving four platforms, each with a budget of $20k and an expected return of $5k.

The campaign targets content creators, including threaders/micro-influencers, writers on documentation and articles, and video creators, to create the best platform for learning, earning, and building in the Arbitrum space.

To address this, a pilot fund is proposed, utilizing Questbook’s small grants model to support early-stage initiatives focused on problem definition (root causes, gathering requirements), alignment, and scoping proposals for operational and governance improvements. A collective intelligence exercise will be conducted to inform proposers and the assessor by identifying key problem areas through user research interviews, qualitative surveys, and a collective intelligence algorithm, ensuring initiatives are well-aligned with the DAO’s current needs.<br>\nThe pilot fund will prioritize initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO’s operations and governance. An assessor, elected by the DAO, will oversee the proposal assessment, following the established Questbook program rules. The success of this pilot will be measured by the number of initiatives that receive subsequent funding, clarity and alignment generated within the community, and an over 80% approval rate in a Snapshot vote to continue the program.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem:</h1>\n<p>The DAO has multiple challenges but currently needs a way to fund the initial steps of addressing them. As a result, only groups with a lot to win will invest all the necessary time and effort and take the risk to evolve a proposal without being paid.</p>\n<p>Areas like organisation design, strategy, spending plan, and more require not just crafting a proposal but they require problem definition work: significant stakeholder engagement to determine the right approach, understand root causes and requirements, generate buy-in, and craft the right proposal to make. There’s currently no way to fund all this problem definition and preparatory work leading to the DAO advancing slowly, delegates being overwhelmed assessing proposals that don’t quite hit the mark, and meanwhile key decisions and needed proposals don’t happen.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>A method for the DAO to aggregate challenge statements or problems</li>\n<li>A funding program for initiatives that will carry out problem definition and initial solution work on one of the challenge statements.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Questbook has shown to be a viable mechanism for distributing small grants to groups. We propose to use this model and set up a pilot fund to evolve proposals that address key Operational and Governance needs to improve Arbiturm DAO.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’ll carry out a “collective intelligence exercise” to identify the key problem areas.</p>\n<p><strong>What will be funded:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early-stage initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO ops and gov</li>\n<li>Priority for funding initiatives advancing problem definition and alignment around key challenges.</li>\n<li>Requirement for being referred by at least 3 of the top 20 delegates.</li>\n<li>Priority for proposals including a last milestone for a successful snapshot vote.</li>\n<li>Initiatives expected to last up to 3 months.</li>\n<li>Initiatives can request up to USD$50k equivalent (subsequent submissions considered).</li>\n<li>product/protocol development will not be funded (that’s better suited for other Questbook tracks or programs).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>** How are proposals assessed:**</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An assessor will be selected by the DAO via an election as conducted for previous Questbook tracks.</li>\n<li>Proposals up to USD $25k can be approved directly by the assessor for this track. Proposals above this amount requires cross-checking with the assessors form other tracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fund governance:</strong></p>\n<p>This track will follow the same rules as the ongoing Questbook program (<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326\">link</a>), whereby funds are held in the multisig operated by the assessors of the multiple Questbook tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Method to Identify problem areas:</strong></p>\n<p>Before opening the fund to proposals, we’ll work with the DAO to identify key problem areas that could then lead to proposals for problem definition and alignment work. This work will be carried by RnDAO’s research team.</p>\n<p>Based on Professor Daniel Kahneman’s work, we have selected a collective intelligence method that provides high efficiency (low time involvement required from delegates) and is credibly neutral. The method is based on the use of a qualitative survey of delegates and other stakeholders to collect a list of statements proposing key challenges. We’ll complement this mechanism with user research interviews with the top 20 delegates.<br>\nThe statements are then analysed using a collective intelligence algorithm (SimScore) that identifies a theoretical ‘central’ statement that would be most agreed upon, and then analyses the provided statements to rank them for proximity to said theoretical centre.</p>\n<p>The ranked statements as well as the graph (positioning of statements relative to each other) will then be made publicly available to inform (not mandate, just inform) those proposing initiatives to the pilot fund.</p>\n<p>(Further untangling between statements and root cause analysis is part of the work this Questbook track will fund.)</p>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-5\"></a>Timeline:</h1>\n<p>The Pilot is expected to last 4-6 months depending on whether the option to distil learnings into a playbook for proposing to the DAO is approved in Snapshot or not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Month 1 for identifying problem areas.</li>\n<li>Month 2-4 for assessing and funding proposals.</li>\n<li>Month 5 for reporting</li>\n<li>month 6 for (optional) collecting learnings about proposal development into playbook</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-success-look-like-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-does-success-look-like-6\"></a>What does success look like?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Experts in the community can work towards improving Arbiturm DAO.</li>\n<li>The initiatives funded generate clarity, buy-in, and alignment,</li>\n<li>The initiatives funded evolve towards full proposals for the DAO and are funded.</li>\n<li>The delegates love this pilot and want to continue funding it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>KPIs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>40%+ of initiatives continued and received subsequent funding</li>\n<li>Over 80% approval in a Snapshot vote asking delegates whether the program should be continued after the pilot</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"budget-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#budget-7\"></a>Budget</h1>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3061f33e2a715131f15105f1b53e117be5bdf982.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6U0M6m6RdUKf7SDvgklrZc8LeoO.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-07-07 at 01.14.57\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3061f33e2a715131f15105f1b53e117be5bdf982_2_690x308.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-07 at 01.14.57\" data-base62-sha1=\"6U0M6m6RdUKf7SDvgklrZc8LeoO\" width=\"690\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3061f33e2a715131f15105f1b53e117be5bdf982_2_690x308.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3061f33e2a715131f15105f1b53e117be5bdf982_2_1035x462.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3061f33e2a715131f15105f1b53e117be5bdf982_2_1380x616.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E5E8EB\"></a></div><p></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-3-jumpstart-fund-for-dao-improvement/25309\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-3-jumpstart-fund-for-dao-improvement/25309","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 15:06:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25309"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-3-jumpstart-fund-for-dao-improvement/25309.rss","#text":"Team 3: Jumpstart fund for DAO improvement"}},{"title":"GovHack Brussels Submission instructions","dc:creator":"raam","category":"GovHack Brussels","description":"<h1><a name=\"deadline-sunday-7th-915am-cet-brussels-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#deadline-sunday-7th-915am-cet-brussels-1\"></a>Deadline: Sunday 7th @ 9:15am CET (Brussels)</h1>\n<p>Any post or deck with timestamp edits past the deadline will invalidate the submission.</p>\n<p>Pitches will be done as a 2 min recording on <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/\">Loom</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day 3: Judges pick 5 finalists to pitch on Day 3.

Tailor-proof payments and resilience against unauthorized access are guaranteed by blockchain, that distributes information among a network of nodes and uses consensual techniques like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. Smart contracts ensure visible and irreversible processes, and the use of cryptography protects data integrity. The ongoing enhancement of safeguards and procedures is necessary in light of the weaknesses in smart contract technology and the possibility of 51% attacks, regardless of their strengths.</p>\n<p>This blog discusses the core safety features of blockchain networks and assesses how resistant they are to cyberattacks and hacking.</p>\n<p><strong>What Is Blockchain ? and Its Importance</strong></p>\n<p>Blockchain is a decentralized database system that safely records payments. Through saving data throughout a network of computers, it offers safety by rendering it almost impossible to change or hack without the approval of the whole network.</p>\n<p><strong>Importance:</strong> Nowadays, businesses need safety in blockchain due to the safeguards private information and builds confidence between participants without the need for middlemen like banks or authorities.</p>\n<p><strong>Comparing Blockchain Security with Traditional Systems</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Overview of Blockchain Security Features:</strong> Key security elements of the blockchain system include consensus methods for transactional validation, data protection via encrypted hashing, and decentralization—the ability to operate independently of a single institution.</p>\n<p><strong>Comparison with Traditional Systems:</strong> The integrity of blockchain is not like that of conventional systems that are centralized. Because blockchain distributes information over an internet rather than centralized frameworks that depend on one entity, it is more difficult to attack or corrupt.</p>\n<p><strong>Emerging Cyber Threats in Blockchain Security</strong></p>\n<p>Cyber attacks such as 51% attacks, in which an organization gains authority over most of a blockchain’s processing capacity, are prevalent and have the ability to manipulate payments. The act of using the exact same digital currency more than once is known as double-spends. Automatic contract vulnerabilities in code are holes that can be utilized .</p>\n<p>Instances from the real world included attacks such as the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) hack, in which the smart contract’s weakness enabled fifty million dollars to be siphoned off. These events demonstrate how crucial blockchain safety has become.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Measures in Blockchain Networks</strong></p>\n<p>Encryption and Cryptography: Information is safeguarded by cryptography and cryptography processes, which jumble it up so that only those with permission may decipher it. This guarantees the privacy and security of data on blockchain-based systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Consensus Mechanisms:</strong> Safety on networks is maintained through consensus techniques like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, which validate operations and stop fraud. They make it possible for users of the blockchain to concur on a transaction’s legitimacy without depending on a governing body.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract Audits:</strong> Finding and addressing these issues requires smart contract audits. It lessens the possibility of flaws or faults that might be taken advantage of by bad actors and helps guarantee that smart contracts work as planned.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges and Controversies</strong></p>\n<p>The continuing debate is on striking a balance between blockchain networks’ capacity to process massive volumes of operations (scalability) and their ability to provide robust defenses against intrusions and other threats (safety). Administrative Issues: These are problems pertaining to laws and regulations that have an impact on the applications and security of blockchain-based technologies. The design and maintenance of blockchain-based systems might be influenced by legal difficulties.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical Tips for Businesses</strong></p>\n<p>Companies should implement a number of doable strategies to improve <a href=\"https://bidbits.org/blockchain-development-company\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">blockchain development services </a>and protection. Start by selecting a platform for blockchain technology that is trustworthy, safe, and has a lot of safeguarding capabilities. Verify thoroughly that suppliers of services follow strict security guidelines. Detects and remediate problems by conducting routine security audits and assessments. Employee education is essential; teach staff members how to identify malware, create safe passwords, and protect secret keys, among additional best practices for security on the blockchain. Frequently update software and use multiple authentication methods to guard against emerging risks. These actions can help firms greatly strengthen their blockchain safety measures.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-secure-are-blockchain-networks-against-hacking-and-other-cyber-threats/25306\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-secure-are-blockchain-networks-against-hacking-and-other-cyber-threats/25306","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 12:00:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25306"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-secure-are-blockchain-networks-against-hacking-and-other-cyber-threats/25306.rss","#text":"How Secure Are Blockchain Networks Against Hacking And Other Cyber Threats?"}},{"title":"About the GovHack Denver category","dc:creator":"raam","category":"GovHack Denver","description":"<p>(Replace this first paragraph with a brief description of your new category.

Motivation</h2>\n<p>Arbitrum is the leading L2 by all relevant KPIs, including number of protocols, TVL, and daily active address. ArbitrumDAO also has the 3rd <a href=\"https://deepdao.io/organizations\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">largest treasury</a> of any DAOs, but one key difference between Arbitrum and other protocols is the extent of independence and power given to the DAO from its onset.</p>\n<p>Despite having the 3rd largest treasury of any DAOs, the ArbitrumDAO faces three main challenges with its current treasury (refer to VIII. Appendix: Motivations in-Depth):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ensuring long-term sustainability</strong>: treasury should be able to support ecosystem efforts through market cycles; in the long-run, DAO should be a self-sustaining vehicle, with expenses covered by yield generated from Treasury, without having to materially compromise Treasury principal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fostering ecosystem growth</strong>: treasury should be used to foster a vibrant community of users and builders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transparency and accountability</strong>: treasury should be expertly managed, and uses of the treasury should be transparent and held accountable to the DAO.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-working-group/18978\">Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability Working Group</a> and the broader Arbitrum community have previously researched and discussed the issues at depth, and there is a strong consensus that we need a more holistic approach towards managing Arbitrum’s treasury to prevent inefficient decision-making processes and misallocation of resources. Arbitrum’s impressive decentralization is a double-edged sword; the DAO can use its collective intelligence to make the best decisions, but without clear structure and oversight, conflicting opinions and divergent interests may hinder timely and effective resource allocation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ii-expected-outcome-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ii-expected-outcome-4\"></a>II. Expected Outcome</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum Strategic Treasury Management Group aims to allocate assets within the Arbitrum ecosystem to ensure long-term sustainability and foster growth.</p>\n<p>Three main areas of priority would be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Ecosystem alignment and growth. Bolster ecosystem growth by utilizing Arbitrum’s treasury via Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fortress balance sheet. Diversify Arbitrum treasury to build sufficient runway and resiliency to market downturns by reducing long-tail asset exposure. As the DAO is currently spending $97M+ per year, it is ideal to maintain a treasury in excess of $200M.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sustainability. Leverage Arbitrum DAO’s treasury to generate sustainable yields via DeFi lending, staking, and liquidity provisioning. To reach sustainability at current spending levels, the DAO needs to eventually deploy $1.5B, targeting 6-8% APY.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Outcomes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Yield Optimization Program aims to generate sustainable yields to fund the DAO’s operations in a non-custodial and risk-minimized manner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DAO Owned Liquidity Program, with the goal of expanding ecosystem liquidity, attracting builders to Arbitrum, and deepening ARB on-chain liquidity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Treasury Diversification Program, to reduce long-tail asset exposure and capital raising.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"iii-introduction-to-the-arbitrum-strategic-treasury-management-group-and-tooling-providers-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#iii-introduction-to-the-arbitrum-strategic-treasury-management-group-and-tooling-providers-5\"></a>III. Introduction to the Arbitrum Strategic Treasury Management Group and Tooling Providers</h2>\n<p>Initiative of Arbitrum Strategic Treasury Management Group will be led by karpatkey and Aera, combining experience across DAO treasury management and risk management.</p>\n<p><strong>About karpatkey</strong></p>\n<p>karpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in providing financial services to DAOs. Since its inception in 2020, karpatkey has been a trusted partner to respected DAOs like Gnosis, Aave, and ENS, managing over $1bn in non-custodial assets. Through its comprehensive support in treasury management and financial operations, karpatkey empowers its partners to effectively pursue their missions. Leveraging its extensive experience, karpatkey will serve as the treasury manager, designing investment processes to meet the DAO’s goals and constraints.</p>\n<p><strong>About Aera</strong></p>\n<p>Aera is an on-chain solution to autonomously optimize DAO funds. It addresses the common pain point of inactive treasury management that often hinders a DAO’s ability to maintain runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from market growth. Unlike traditional institutions that rely on nimble managers for fund allocation, DAOs face a unique set of challenges that include governance and incentive alignment with external managers. To address these, Aera offers a unified solution for efficiently and transparently managing on-chain treasuries, grants, and incentive funds through customizable vaults. Aera vaults can hold stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies, with their objective functions tailored to each DAO’s needs. Guardians leverage off-chain logic to automate rebalancing decisions, ensuring the vaults meet their objectives across various market scenarios and time horizons. Gauntlet will be the initial Guardian for the Aera vault operating under the direction of karpatkey and the DAO Oversight Committee.</p>\n<p><strong>About DAO Oversight Committee</strong></p>\n<p>We recommend creating a 3-member DAO Oversight Committee via a 1 week application period with a 5 day Snapshot vote. This committee will serve as a layer for checks and balances between the STMG and the DAO, and would be responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Coalescing the DAO Treasury Mandate and setting the guardrails for the treasury vaults and tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Evaluating the performance of the Strategic Treasury Management Group and confirming the accuracy of reporting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating governance procedure for capital recall process if the execution of the treasury management strategy diverges from the stated treasury mandate.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Committee members should be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Familiarity with prudent treasury management strategies</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Level of engagement and activity in ArbitrumDAO to effectively act as DAO advocate</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On-chain literacy to verify the accuracy of treasury reporting</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"iv-deployment-initiatives-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#iv-deployment-initiatives-6\"></a>IV.

Liquid deployment varies from low-risk ‘cash-equivalent’ investments (staking, lending/borrowing, liquidity provisions), to higher-risk, strategic investments such as treasury swaps. Illiquid deployment is largely strategic in nature, and includes venture investments and M&amp;A activities. As an example <a href=\"https://abc.xyz/assets/43/44/675b83d7455885c4615d848d52a4/goog-10-k-2023.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Alphabet</a> has ~28% of its total assets in cash and other marketable securities, and ~8% of its total assets in non-marketable securities (including those invested by GV and CapitalG).</p>\n<p>Strategic Treasury Management Group will focus on non-custodial, liquid deployment of Treasury to achieve synergy with pre-existing illiquid deployment discussions surrounding the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/catalyze-gaming-ecosystem-growth-on-arbitrum/22368\">Gaming Catalyst Program</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-22-establishment-of-arbitrum-venture-initiative-avi/21535\">Arbitrum Ventures Initiative</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/start-of-arbitrum-m-a-working-group/22520\">Arbitrum M&amp;A Working Group</a>.</p>\n<p>We are asking the DAO to allocate 250M ARB for the first tranche of the Arbitrum Strategic Treasury Management Initiative, in order to bolster the Arbitrum treasury’s sustainability and strategic ecosystem deployment; based on the success of the initial deployment, size of the allocation can be increased via a future proposal.</p>\n<p>The DAO Oversight Committee will be responsible for facilitating DAO governance process for recalling any deployed funds; whether for DAO financial requirements, poor performance by the Strategic Treasury Management Group, or any other reason.</p>\n<p><strong>Allocations &amp; Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>The specific strategies will be selected by the Strategic Treasury Management Group with guidance from the DAO Oversight Committee, providing an additional level of accountability and transparency.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Targets</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

A simple portfolio analysis shows the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Historical daily return of ARB has been -0.11%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Daily standard deviation value of 4.4%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>95% value-at-risk (%) of -7.1% i.e. in any given day, there is 5% chance of portfolio losing 7.1% of its value</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sheer size of the DAO Treasury can give the illusion that spending can be indefinitely funded. During the latest ‘22-’23 bear market, many L1 / L2 tokens saw ~90% drawdowns (e.g. $SOL dropped from $250 at its peak to $10, $AVAX dropped from $125 at its peak to $9). Many had to downsize their operations and some even shut down, but the well-prepared ones were able to continue incentivising and growing the ecosystem, as they managed to raise significant amounts of money (fiat, stablecoin) during the bull market. Although it is only natural that the DAO be wholly invested in the success of the ecosystem, it also needs to ensure prudent risk management, and diversify in order to ensure sustainability over extended periods of market volatility. A standard practice is ensuring 1.5 to 2 years of runway.</p>\n<p>Maintaining runways is even more important in cases of deficit spending, as is the case with ArbitrumDAO. For the year ending February 2024, the DAO had an annual gap of -$61M due to its high annual spend rate on grants and incentives ($97M; also worth noting these numbers do not yet include STIP Bridge and LTIPP) vs. net network revenue of ~$21M. There are a few concomitant problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Reduction in principal of the Treasury.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Large selling pressure in ARB: grantees most likely need stablecoins to fund their operations, and may sell ARB in a non-optimal manner with high(er) price impact. This historically has manifested in two ways:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>a. Protocols receive large grants for incentives (STIP, LTIPP, etc.) to be disbursed at the same time, protocol users look to realize their boosted yield relatively immediately, large amounts of ARB is sold at the same time leading to large amount of selling pressure indiscriminate of market conditions.</p>\n<p>b. Contributors receive grants to cover operations denominated in USD. These contributors often either pay a market maker a large fee to swap the tokens at a set price, take on market risk, or take slippage from selling large amounts of ARB when liquidity is not optimal.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth highlighting that while the DAO has several illiquid initiatives, including <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/catalyze-gaming-ecosystem-growth-on-arbitrum/22368\">Gaming Catalyst Program</a> (passed Tally), <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23205\">M&amp;A Unit</a> (in-discussion), and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-proposal-non-constitutional-establishment-of-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-avi/23222\">Arbitrum Ventures Initiative</a> (in-discussion), there are currently no non-custodial liquid initiatives under way. Traditional web2 companies usually have a much larger deployment to liquid holdings/investments vis-a-vis illiquids, given the need for liquidity and yield generation.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/08da68eb6702b9f6a3ec9872ded67d01e41149dd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1gjLa6axdbGVDVWjl0rnRa9akwd.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/08da68eb6702b9f6a3ec9872ded67d01e41149dd_2_624x221.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1gjLa6axdbGVDVWjl0rnRa9akwd\" width=\"624\" height=\"221\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/08da68eb6702b9f6a3ec9872ded67d01e41149dd_2_624x221.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/08da68eb6702b9f6a3ec9872ded67d01e41149dd_2_936x331.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/08da68eb6702b9f6a3ec9872ded67d01e41149dd_2_1248x442.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E5E4E4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/55444f3c1369986dbbb1a2cc59804ce492e33e42.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/caiW7w29i85eTqTpt4WJPd9RVEC.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/55444f3c1369986dbbb1a2cc59804ce492e33e42.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"caiW7w29i85eTqTpt4WJPd9RVEC\" width=\"624\" height=\"97\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"D8D7D7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Motivation <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2:</span> Fostering the Arbitrum Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>One of Arbitrum’s competitive advantages is its liquidity and reputation as a DeFi-friendly chain.

The Roles module allows the owner of a Safe (called Avatar) to create a role for a particular address (named Manager) that is then authorised to run specific operations (presets). This module is configurable, allowing full customisation of the target, method, and parameters to be used.</p>\n<p>Through a combination of Safe and Zodiac Module, ownership and custody of the funds do not need to be altered vis-a-vis any previous setup since a Safe can inherit the type of ownership any previous solution had. As a result, the owner of the Safe has complete control, including movements of assets, installing modules, and granting permissions via the Roles Modifier.</p>\n<p>To configure the Roles Modifier, a group of actions called “permissions policy” is configured simultaneously and aggregates all the critical actions needed to manage a specific strategy. For example, to allocate liquidity to a DEX pool, a permissions policy may include approving the transfer of assets, depositing and withdrawing liquidity, and claiming interest. In a single transaction, the Avatar can delegate all future responsibility for managing that specific strategy to a Treasury Manager. For Roles Modifier, an action must have a specified target and method. It may also enforce thresholds and values on the parameters used and limit how often a specific action may be used.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/on-chain-non-custodial-asset-management-infrastructure\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">karpatkey currently uses the Safe and Zodiac Roles Modifier</a> module to manage treasury for DAOs including Gnosis, Aave, ENS and Balancer, as well as its own treasury.</p>\n<p><strong>Aera</strong></p>\n<p>Aera is a solution for optimizing DAO funds autonomously and on-chain. For most DAOs, treasury funds (e.g., reserves, treasuries, safety modules, backstops) are not actively managed or adjusted based on market conditions. For DAOs, this can lead to an inability to maintain runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from growth in the market. Traditional institutions can allocate funds to more nimble managers who make day-to-day decisions, but DAOs face numerous challenges with this model including governance and creating strong incentive alignment with external managers.</p>\n<p>Aera provides DAOs with a one-stop solution for managing onchain treasury, grant, and incentive funds efficiently and transparently. The Aera protocol consists of vaults, which are constructed on a per-protocol basis and can hold a combination of stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies. Each DAO determines the objective function of the vault and is highly customizable ranging from simply keeping fund proportions in line with marketcaps, to sophisticated liquidity strategies to support your ecosystem’s growth. Vaults are automatically rebalanced by Guardians who support the DAO’s objective function leveraging offchain logic to power onchain rebalancing decisions. This ensures that the vault objective is met across a wide range of market scenarios and time horizons.</p>\n<p>Aera integrations include Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Bebop, and other onchain venues. Integrations with Camelot, Radiant, Silo, and more on the way. Aera is currently utilized by Compound DAO, Threshold DAO, Questbook (for Arbitrum grant management), Seamless, and more.</p>\n<p>Below is an image of how Aera works.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7f166b8fe2df66950d599d2276fd84e839ded722.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/i8gFLO7ndkjf68NVxRalgAUS9Ka.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7f166b8fe2df66950d599d2276fd84e839ded722_2_624x279.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"i8gFLO7ndkjf68NVxRalgAUS9Ka\" width=\"624\" height=\"279\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7f166b8fe2df66950d599d2276fd84e839ded722_2_624x279.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7f166b8fe2df66950d599d2276fd84e839ded722_2_936x418.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7f166b8fe2df66950d599d2276fd84e839ded722_2_1248x558.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDEDEF\"></a></div><p></p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 09:27:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25301"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301.rss","#text":"Strategic Treasury Management on Arbitrum"}},{"title":"Mehdi_eth - Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"Mehdi_eth","category":"Governance","description":"<h2><a name=\"delegate-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#delegate-information-1\"></a>Delegate Information</h2>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> Mehdi_eth<br>\n<strong>Delegate Address:</strong> 0x5F367BF126FDa56D88BA88a8978D5496c66B3569<br>\n<strong>Tally Profile:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/profile/mohammadmehdi.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mehdi_eth | Tally </a><br>\n<strong>Snapshot Profile</strong> : <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/profile/0x5F367BF126FDa56D88BA88a8978D5496c66B3569\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a><br>\n<strong>Forum:</strong> <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/mehdi_eth/summary\">@Mehdi_eth </a><br>\n<strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehdi_eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/Mehdi_eth </a><br>\n<strong>Language:</strong> English</p>\n<h2><a name=\"introduction-and-experience-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-and-experience-2\"></a>Introduction and Experience</h2>\n<p>To be completed</p>\n<h2><a name=\"why-mehdi_eth-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#why-mehdi_eth-3\"></a>Why Mehdi_eth</h2>\n<p>To be completed</p>\n<h2><a name=\"delegate-communication-intent-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#delegate-communication-intent-4\"></a>Delegate Communication Intent</h2>\n<p>This thread will provide regular updates to the community to ensure transparency and fully communicate My rationale as a delegate.

Yet somehow over the last 15 years, I kept getting pulled into ecosystem development, working around startup ecosystems and venture capital in the EU, UK, and the Global South. I’ve been particularly interested in how DAOs would play their role since a project I did in the space in 2015.</p>\n<p>A big part of the story began between 2006 and 2012, when with different groups of friends we set up the first hacker house, tech conference, university tech entrepreneurship club, and then accelerator in Bulgaria. This naturally connected me with many people in the Bulgarian diaspora, who were returning as the country joined the EU in 2007.</p>\n<p>The was one standout group of Harvard alumni I worked with on economic cluster development, where one of them became a government minister who essentially kickstarted the Bulgarian venture capital scene. With just €200 million of EU funds, we sparked an entire economy.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, as he became the chief economic advisor to the president, I got asked to make a list of people I know around the world that would be helpful for advancing the above agenda. We had the president personally invite them, often calling them himself. We organized a number of small private gatherings at the presidential villa, where key relationships and deals were forged. You can now track many of the success stories and unicorns that came out of that scene in one way or another to conversations that happened there. Many of these people now also shape the European venture capital scene out of Brussels and Luxembourg.</p>\n<p>From what I’ve learned since the last GovHack, I believe one of the most important things for the Arbitrum community is to figure out how to support builders sustainably and long-term, while reducing the financial burden of grant-based programs.</p>\n<p>Recent developments in that conversation have striking similarities to the stories above.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p>While we may not have a presidential villa at GovHack, we do have a venture track, which <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/klausbrave\">@KlausBrave</a> kindly invited me to help lead.</p>\n<p>I can’t help but feel that years from now we might end up looking at this event in a similar way as I do to the gatherings from the above story.</p>\n<p>There’s a great group of tremendously capable and experienced people attending and it would be fantastic to come together, set things in motion, define problem statements, consolidate forces and ideas, and move forward in the most mature way possible.</p>\n<p>Which is precisely why I’m so sad that because of a nasty food poisoning I just had to cancel my trip to Brussels. However <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ana.vc\">@ana.vc</a> will be there and I’m sure she’ll do an even better job in my place.</p>\n<p>Ana-Mariya has been a VC for almost a decade and focused on Web3 exclusively over the last 8 years. She has over 200 deals under her belt and led on over 50 as head of the investment team of Outlier Ventures. She’s been leading <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-proposal-non-constitutional-establishment-of-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-avi/23222\">AVI</a> alongside me since we started at GovHack in Denver a few months ago. I can’t think of a better way to more broadly introduce her to the community.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to reach out and let us know if you have any objectives that Ana or I can help you achieve in Brussels in regards to Arbitrum Venture funds.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/making-an-awesome-ventures-track-at-govhack/25287\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/making-an-awesome-ventures-track-at-govhack/25287","pubDate":"Thu, 04 Jul 2024 09:06:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25287"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/making-an-awesome-ventures-track-at-govhack/25287.rss","#text":"Making an Awesome Ventures Track at GovHack"}},{"title":"Timeswap STIP.B Bi-Weekly Update","dc:creator":"ameeth","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"timeswap-stipb-bi-weekly-report-1-july-3rd-2024-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeswap-stipb-bi-weekly-report-1-july-3rd-2024-1\"></a>Timeswap STIP.B Bi-Weekly Report <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> July 3rd 2024</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-2\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p><strong>ARB Received Last Disbursement:</strong> 33,334 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks:</strong> No distribution yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</strong> No distribution yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract address label <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2AYnjAaQjVOLtvemZpsWoN5sTJEJ8dLqdRDExTBQv_SUeug/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Form 48</a> completed for all addresses:</strong> No. No distribution yet.</p>\n<p><strong>ARB left over:</strong> 200,000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for leftover ARB:</strong> Continue as per original proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives:</strong></p>\n<p>Timeswap has been allocated a total of 200,000 ARB, all to be redistributed to users through interacting with the incentivised pools.

As a result, many community members choose to transfer their token-weighted voting power to representatives (i.e. delegates) whose values align with their own and who are better positioned to make informed decisions for the DAO. By doing so, token holders can ensure their interests are represented without needing to actively track and vote on every proposal.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, delegation allows token holders to passively engage in the governance of the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>It is important to note that:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you delegate, you still retain full ownership of the tokens, but your selected delegate will wield the voting power associated with those tokens</li>\n<li>Even if you have already delegated your voting power, it is worth checking whether or not your delegate is still active.

There are <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum\">~436K delegates</a> who have enabled the DAO to vote on <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/improving-predictability-in-arbitrum-dao-s-operations/25136#motivation-4\">over 280 Snapshot and 30 Tally proposals</a>. However, to further decentralization and diversity, ArbitrumDAO needs to increase its number of active delegates.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today, plenty of new contributors have become paramount in driving the DAO forward. However, many of these recent contributors have little-to-no delegation power and therefore, cannot significantly partake in decision-making. This is because most delegators delegated their voting power soon after the DAO’s inception, and may not have reassessed their delegations since. Additionally, the Arbitrum community has grown over the past year, meaning that many $ARB token holders have a significant amount of voting power that could, potentially, be delegated to active delegates.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, (Re)delegation Week aims to enable these newer and active contributors to step up, make themselves heard, and potentially get more voting power to become more involved in governance.</p>\n<p>The figures below reiterate the importance of (Re)delegation Week.

This is the third and final case study of a three-part series that entails an in-depth analysis of the risk and efficiency of the Arbitrum STIP on three major protocols, the third of which is Pendle Finance.</p>\n<p>As requested by the DAO advocate for the ARDC, L2BEAT, Chaos Labs has been conducting case studies on STIP recipients. This case study provides an in-depth analysis of the Arbitrum STIP program’s impact on Pendle Finance, focusing on its efficiency and associated risks. This analysis is part of a broader series that evaluates the STIP program across three major protocols.</p>\n<p>Following our previous analyses of Vertex and Silo Finance, we now turn our focus to Pendle Finance to provide a comprehensive evaluation of its performance and risk profile.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-3\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>An in-depth, bottom-up analysis of the protocol is essential to comprehensively understand the specific risks and efficiency factors influencing the Pendle STIP allocation. The initial section of this report delves into all pertinent aspects of Pendle Finance’s functionality, providing context and reference.</p>\n<p>Following this, detailed analyses of efficiency and risk are conducted, using the insights gained from the protocol deep-dive as a foundation. This analysis aims to identify all factors that could potentially result in adverse outcomes. These findings are then used to derive positive and negative insights from the Pendle STIP incentive program, which will inform the design of future incentive schemes.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive Amount:</strong> 2m ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive Uses:</strong> Liquidity incentives (55%), trading incentives (40%), Ecosystem integrations (5%)</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Matching:</strong> Yes</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pendle-overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-overview-4\"></a>Pendle Overview</h1>\n<p>Pendle is a permissionless yield-trading protocol where users can execute various yield-management strategies. This is achieved by first wrapping yield-bearing tokens into Standardised Yield (SY) tokens. SY tokens are compatible with the Pendle AMM and can be split into its principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token), respectively. This process is called yield tokenisation and allows both PT and YT to be traded on Pendle’s AMM.</p>\n<p>By creating a yield market in DeFi, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield, enabling users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed yield (e.g. earn fixed yield on stETH)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long yield (e.g. bet on stETH yield going up by purchasing more yield)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Earn more yield without additional risks (e.g. provide liquidity with your stETH)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A mix of the above strategies</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each PT and YT has a maturity date. For PT, you can redeem the full underlying yield-bearing token after this date. For YT, the yield of the yield-bearing token is only accrued up until the maturity date, after which YT has no value.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-liquidity-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-liquidity-5\"></a>Pendle Liquidity</h2>\n<p>Pendle liquidity comes from holders of yield-bearing tokens wrapping and depositing them into AMM pools. These liquidity providers then earn swap fees, PENDLE rewards, and any other incentives on top of the tokens’ native yield. The fixed maturity nature of these pools also means that if LPs keep providing liquidity until maturity, there will be no impermanent loss, and they will receive their initial tokens back along with the additional yield.</p>\n<p>During the STIP, Pendle launched an Order Book system alongside its AMM to enable peer-to-peer trading of PT and YT. This allows users to place limit orders to buy or sell at a specified implied APY.</p>\n<p>Together, the Order Book and AMM enhance market liquidity, facilitating smoother trading on Pendle.</p>\n<p>The total liquidity in a pool impacts slippage and is therefore crucial for user experience and seamlessly offering the use cases users desire.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-trading-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-trading-6\"></a>Pendle Trading</h2>\n<p>Liquidity pools in Pendle V2 are set up as PT/SY, e.g. PT-aUSDC / SY-aUSDC. Swapping PT is a straightforward process of swapping between the two assets in the pool, while swapping YT is enabled via flash swaps in the same pool.</p>\n<p>Flash swaps are possible due to the relationship between PT and YT. As PT and YT can be minted from and redeemed to its underlying SY, we can express the price relationship:</p>\n<p>P(PT) + P(YT) = P(Underlying)​</p>\n<p>Knowing that YT price has an inverted correlation against PT price, we use this price relationship to utilise the PT/SY pool for YT swaps.</p>\n<p>Traders on Pendle obtain SY tokens by depositing yield-bearing tokens, and swap them to gain exposure to the token of their choice. As yields change they then have the option to trade further to alter their exposures.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-yield-token-integrations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-yield-token-integrations-7\"></a>Pendle Yield Token Integrations</h2>\n<p>A key feature of Pendle’s principal and yield tokens is their ability to support strategies that create specific exposures for users, enabled by ecosystem integrations with other protocols. Pendle offered incentives for depositing PT or LP positions into specific pools on other protocols to foster the broader ecosystem, liquidity, and trading activity. This initiative began in Week 5 of the program and was adjusted based on general market sentiment.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"use-of-incentives-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#use-of-incentives-8\"></a>Use of Incentives</h1>\n<p>The objectives for the STIP, as stated by Pendle, were:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Increasing yield trading volume, inciting activity on the platform, deepening liquidity on existing pools as well as an additional incentive for users to bootstrap liquidity for newly listed Pendle markets Arbitrum, and finally to encourage activity on protocols built on top of Pendle.</strong></em></p>\n<p>This was implemented by allocating 55% of incentives towards liquidity providers on Pendle, 40% towards trading incentives, and 5% to ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidity-incentives-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquidity-incentives-9\"></a>Liquidity Incentives:</h2>\n<p>Slightly over half of the total incentives were allocated to boosting additional yield for LPs, aiming to encourage deeper liquidity and reduce slippage on Pendle.</p>\n<p>Initially, Pendle distributed liquidity incentives based on vePENDLE votes for Arbitrum pools. However, this approach soon proved suboptimal as the incentives were neither distributed broadly nor targeted at the most active markets or new markets needing support. Starting from week 3, the Pendle team took over the allocations, using metrics such as the most active yield markets and new pools requiring initial liquidity. Additionally, there was significant experimentation and iteration in the weekly allocations.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows the evolution of weekly incentives by category. Over the course of the STIP, incentives were redirected from LST and derivative LP markets to lending, LRT, and Silo Pendle LP markets in response to market interest.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/clqSs4QQ4Dd0xdDuTrwCBxI4npy.png?dl=1\" title=\"The Evolution of Pendle Weekly Incentives by Category\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_690x439.png\" alt=\"The Evolution of Pendle Weekly Incentives by Category\" data-base62-sha1=\"clqSs4QQ4Dd0xdDuTrwCBxI4npy\" width=\"690\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_690x439.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_1035x658.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_1380x878.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"222729\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"trading-incentives-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trading-incentives-10\"></a><strong>Trading Incentives</strong>:</h2>\n<p>Trading incentives were designed as campaigns targeted at increasing trading activity on Pendle. The initial STIP application suggested that there would be “at least one campaign per month will be done to keep things fresh and to entice users to keep trying out the campaigns.” Over the course of the STIP, the following campaigns were conducted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Swap fee rebates:</strong> This campaign refunded a portion of traders’ swap fees with ARB tokens. The rebate was set below 100% to ensure wash trading remained unprofitable, starting at 75% and reducing to 50% in week 9. This campaign ran for the entire duration of the STIP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trading leaderboard with prizes for the most successful traders:</strong> An in-app leaderboard showcased the top-ranked users based on percentage gain. These top performers received ARB rewards to stimulate more trading volume and TVL. Performance-based prizes also incentivized traders to improve their strategies, aiding in long-term retention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Supercharged swap fee rebates:</strong> For a limited time, certain pools had their swap fee rebates increased to 120% to further incentivize trading activity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Maker incentives to promote the new limit order book feature:</strong> Rewards were provided for using Pendle’s newly launched limit order feature. Filled limit orders earned ARB rewards proportional to the order size, drawing attention to this innovation. Pendle’s limit orders were initially launched on Arbitrum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"ecosystem-incentives-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ecosystem-incentives-11\"></a>Ecosystem Incentives:</h2>\n<p>Ecosystem incentives were designed to integrate Pendle tokens further into the broader DeFi ecosystem by encouraging their use on partner protocols. Large lending pools that accepted Pendle LP or PT tokens as collateral received ARB incentives to boost their usage. The incentivized protocols included Stella, Dolomite, Timeswap, Silo, and Teller.</p>\n<p>Similar to the liquidity incentives, the focus of these incentives evolved throughout the STIP. Notably, in February 2024, the incentives shifted to emphasize leveraged strategies using LRT PT tokens, aligning with the development of these markets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pendle-incentives-impact-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-incentives-impact-12\"></a>Pendle Incentives Impact</h1>\n<p>The objective of this impact assessment is to evaluate the effects of the incentive program on protocol activity, specifically examining the demand for holding Pendle PT and YT tokens, trading activity and liquidity provision on Pendle’s AMM. This detailed, bottom-up analysis scrutinizes individual components of the STIP, which are unique to Pendle. This allows a clear prescription of how the results of the program were obtained and how this could be applied to other protocols. The unique nature of the Pendle protocol makes direct comparison impossible, but important incentive principles can be gleaned from their program strategy.</p>\n<p>Despite the STIP program’s short-term nature, this report assesses its prolonged benefits by analyzing protocol usage data following the program’s conclusion. The intention is to identify persistent activity changes and what drove them.</p>\n<p>Pendle accepts deposits of yield-bearing assets, wraps these into standardized yield (SY) tokens, and splits these into Principal (PT) and yield (YT) tokens. These PT and YT tokens are then bought and sold on the Pendle AMM, with Arbitrum end users primarily leveraging their PT positions or holding YT for yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the impact analysis will focus on the effects of the incentives on the growth of the supply of yield-bearing assets available for trading (the supply side), the growth in the trading of Pendle yield tokens (trading activity), and the growth of ecosystem TVL.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of Pendle’s incentives is thoroughly examined across various dimensions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How did the incentives affect the supply of yield-bearing assets by LPs?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did the incentives affect trading activity on the Pendle AMM?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Did they attract new users?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect retention?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect the average volume per user?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect the ecosystem growth of Pendle tokens?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of the incentives is also analyzed to gain insight into the structural efficiency of this program.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidity-provider-reactions-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquidity-provider-reactions-13\"></a>Liquidity Provider Reactions</h2>\n<p>Liquidity from AMM LPs on Pendle grew from $52 million to $723 million over the STIP period. Most of this growth occurred between February and March 2024, driven by points programs on Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) that were ideally suited to Pendle’s products. The increase in LRT TVL during this period was clearly due to the demand for Pendle’s offerings, although this growth on Arbitrum was positively affected by the STIP use.</p>\n<p>Pendle’s focus on Arbitrum during this time, enhanced by STIP incentives, brought significant LRT TVL to Arbitrum and added considerable value to the chain. Without these incentives, LRT strategies on Pendle Arbitrum would have been less attractive, and the supply may not have grown as it did. It is also important to highlight how the attention flywheel established Arbitrum as a prominent hub for leveraged LRT strategies, with the incentives having a highly asymmetric effect on its success.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xv2DDOkfOfXXLlEyXl8txLNT5Bv.png?dl=1\" title=\"Total Pendle LP Supply\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_690x429.png\" alt=\"Total Pendle LP Supply\" data-base62-sha1=\"xv2DDOkfOfXXLlEyXl8txLNT5Bv\" width=\"690\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_690x429.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_1035x643.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_1380x858.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"192632\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The aggressive growth observed after the launch of LRTs overshadows the performance during the first three months of the STIP. Focusing on the period from July 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, a clear trend emerges with LP supply increasing from $52 million to $116 million by the end of January. Most of this growth occurred within the first six weeks of the STIP, before the launch of ecosystem incentives. It remains unclear whether these alternative avenues for accessing STIP rewards competed with LP supplies or if an equilibrium was reached between demand and supply, making the timing coincidental.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1hGuOpRJX8kjTIvRfzUWhhXzoNN.png?dl=1\" title=\"LP Supply up to the end of January 2024.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_690x421.png\" alt=\"LP Supply up to the end of January 2024.\" data-base62-sha1=\"1hGuOpRJX8kjTIvRfzUWhhXzoNN\" width=\"690\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_690x421.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_1035x631.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_1380x842.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"15334F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"trading-activity-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trading-activity-14\"></a>Trading Activity</h2>\n<p>These metrics focus on Pendle’s AMM activity.

Liquidity providers in incentivized pools received incremental yield in the form of ARB tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Growing The Protocol Through Incentivized Integrations</strong></p>\n<p>This was an important focus area for Pendle, unlocking incremental utility for its yield tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Iterating and Experimenting</strong></p>\n<p>Pendle aggressively experimented and culled underperforming strategies on a fortnightly basis using market data.</p>\n<p>Some positive examples included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The focused but aggressive iteration in liquidity pools incentivized. Pendle targeted incentives aimed at increasing activity where the market was at almost every week. This enabled hypergrowth in LRT markets in February, almost since launch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Iteration in ecosystem incentives, resulting in the highly productive growth in Silo pools, offering leverage and growing YT token utility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experiments in trading campaigns.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-incentive-potential-improvements-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-incentive-potential-improvements-26\"></a>Pendle Incentive Potential Improvements</h2>\n<p><strong>Grow the Rate of New User Acquisition As Well As TVL and Activity</strong></p>\n<p>For most of the STIP Pendle active users, there was little change from the prior period. While it is true that volumes increased significantly, growing the user base along with overall volumes and TVL could have great long-term benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Pendle Ecosystem Integrations on Dolomite and Timeswap GLP, wstETH and rETH Markets Had a Poor ROI while Continuing Receiving Incentives</strong></p>\n<p>Dolomite rETH and GLP markets received 31 500 ARB over 14 weeks during the STIP, but only grew to a combined $345k in TVL. Timeswap GLP received 10,000 ARB and only grew to $485k. Both of these pools continued receiving incentives despite poor ROI, and these incentives could have likely been better used in alternative ways.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pendle-stip-useful-resources-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-stip-useful-resources-27\"></a>Pendle STIP Useful Resources</h1>\n<p><strong>Application:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pendle-final-stip-round-1/17234\">STIP Application</a></p>\n<p><strong>Bi-weekly updates:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pendle-stip-program-updates/19609/3\">Forum Thread</a></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-3-pendle-finance/25254\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-3-pendle-finance/25254","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 23:33:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25254"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-3-pendle-finance/25254.rss","#text":"STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Case Study #3: Pendle Finance"}}]}}}
