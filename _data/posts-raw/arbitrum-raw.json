It’s crucial to highlight that the impact of our STIP is not about ephemeral incentives. Instead, we are strategically deploying funds directly into DAO treasuries to foster long-term, sustainable TVL on the Arbitrum network. Our approach is not centered on short-term fluctuations; rather, we’re committed to enhancing the long-term stability and scalability of TVL on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We aim to cultivate a sticky and lasting TVL within these DAO treasuries on Arbitrum, focusing on the strategic growth of the ecosystem. This will be achieved by strengthening the financial health and governance capabilities of the DAOs involved, as evidenced by monitored metrics such as TVL growth and participatory governance activities incentivized by Tally. We are excited to track these metrics over time</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, we are in close communication with STIP recipients Open Dollar and Pixel Vault, who are expected to augment their DAO treasuries with substantial TVL contributions shortly. We are currently gathering feedback regarding the timelines and specifics of these deployments, which we will include in our final STIP Bridge proposal. Thus far, here are some metrics on the 3 DAO recipients of our STIP: Open Dollar, Content Guild, and Pixel Vault:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TVL in DAOs on Arbitrum incentivized by Tally</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>10/23</th>\n<th>11/23</th>\n<th>12/23</th>\n<th>1/24</th>\n<th>2/24</th>\n<th>3/24</th>\n<th>4/24</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/opendollar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open Dollar</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>41.7k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/content-guild\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Content Guild</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>16.4k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xa1885BFfE760bcCa872D3C34c976Eb0350e3590c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pixel Vault</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>75k (still awaiting our STIP distribution via bridge to Arbitrum Nova)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li>Votes in DAOs on Arbitrum incentivized by Tally</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>10/23</th>\n<th>11/23</th>\n<th>12/23</th>\n<th>1/24</th>\n<th>2/24</th>\n<th>3/24</th>\n<th>4/24</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/opendollar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open Dollar</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/content-guild\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Content Guild</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xa1885BFfE760bcCa872D3C34c976Eb0350e3590c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pixel Vault</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ol start=\"5\">\n<li>[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?<br>\nThere are a lot of moving parts in launching a DAO. We learned quite a bit about managing time and expectations better for DAO launches, with prime example being GMX, which we expected to launch during the STIP period and was unable to (this is one of the reasons we want to apply for STIP bridge, to deploy to them). It turns out we needed more time than we thought to get each DAO up and running, which taught us to plan for the unexpected and maybe pad our timelines a bit. We also saw how crucial it is to dive deep with each DAO, ensuring their contracts are spot-on and everything’s functional from the start.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?<br>\n200,000 ARB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

The token grabs the place of asset information, where it is securely stored in the server named token vault. Token Vault is the only place where the original information can be linked to its corresponding token thus protecting the sensitive information. Creating tokenized assets includes defining the token type, choosing the blockchain to issue the token, a third party to verify, and more. In Asset Tokenization Platform Development, assets can also be divided and stored in blockchain ensuring security, transparency, and immutability which helps the investors to buy a part of the asses without buying them outright. This process can democratize access to an asset, reduce transaction costs, and increase the liquidity in the market.<br>\nVisit&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://maticz.com/asset-tokenization-platform-development\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Asset Tokenization Platform Development Company</a><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/l6ussYKDLbueaeeY9ubEq1EFttj.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Asset Tokenization Platform development\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"Asset Tokenization Platform development\" data-base62-sha1=\"l6ussYKDLbueaeeY9ubEq1EFttj\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"5A626F\"></a></div><p></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-does-asset-tokenization-work/23461\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-does-asset-tokenization-work/23461","pubDate":"Sat, 27 Apr 2024 05:30:31 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23461"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-does-asset-tokenization-work/23461.rss","#text":"How Does Asset Tokenization Work?"}},{"title":"Frax Finance STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"Frax.Finance","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h4><a name=\"information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\"></a>Information about STIP/STIP Backfund</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Can you provide a link to your previous STIP proposal (round 1 or backfund)? <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-final-stip-round-1/16579\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[Frax Finance] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How much, in the previous STIP proposal, did you request in ARB? 1,500,000 ARB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What date did you start the incentive program and what date did it end?

Leveraging strategic partnerships and innovative strategies, we successfully increased our TVL by nearly threefold, surpassing the 50 million mark. The graph below illustrates this remarkable growth trajectory over the course of the program, showcasing the steady rise in TVL and highlighting our commitment to fostering a robust DeFi environment on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4e4da1250841ceafe23184ddff4e9152c106dd94.jpeg\" alt=\"Graph 1: TVL Growth Over Time\" data-base62-sha1=\"baHyUrpnWemBNB34aLkoWeMewEk\" width=\"624\" height=\"245\"></p>\n<p>This substantial growth in TVL not only demonstrates the growing confidence and participation of users within our ecosystem but also reflects the effectiveness of our liquidity strategies and engagement initiatives. By attracting more assets and liquidity into Arbitrum, we have contributed to the network’s overall vibrancy and liquidity depth.</p>\n<p>Moreover, our collaborative efforts with approximately 30 different protocols played a crucial role in creating, bootstrapping, and nurturing liquidity pools, thereby enhancing the economic value within Arbitrum. This collaborative approach fostered a thriving ecosystem and contributed to the overall growth and development of DeFi on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we initiated Fraxlend on Arbitrum, providing users with advanced lending and borrowing capabilities and further enriching the decentralized finance landscape on the Arbitrum network. These achievements underscore our ongoing dedication to innovation, collaboration, and sustainable growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We gained insights into the diverse demand for various products from the previous round and identified optimal strategies for maximizing incentive efficiency. Additionally, we recognized the effectiveness of user education in showcasing new opportunities and enhancing participation within the ecosystem. These lessons learned have contributed significantly to refining our approach and ensuring targeted and impactful allocation of resources in the extended STIP grants.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal? 750,000 ARB</li>\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same way* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?<br>\nWe plan to maintain a similar approach with some adjustments to our economic strategies.</li>\n<li>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in term of mechanisms and products?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We plan to maintain a similar approach to incentive distribution as outlined in Section 3 of the STIP proposal. However, we intend to make some adjustments to our economic strategies. These adjustments include increasing protocol lending directly in Arbitrum, enhancing incentives for our yield-bearing assets, and introducing incentives for borrowers with yield-bearing collaterals. These changes aim to optimize our incentive structure and better align with the evolving dynamics of the ecosystem.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?<br>\nThe address will be:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisig to receive the incentives: 0xe61D9ed1e5Dc261D1e90a99304fADCef2c76FD10</li>\n<li>Contracts that will distribute the incentives:\n<ul>\n<li>FRAX Incentivizer AMO Address (All of FRAX pools are being incentivized through this contract): 0xefa5D36deBF5191328b17f2Ff74090DAdfda9A70</li>\n<li>frxETH Incentivizer AMO Address (All of frxETH pools are being incentivized through this contract): 0x3C6d74267b01E00B2C8F541ff132A7b03bcC6c70</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The multisig used to receive the incentives and contracts for distribution of incentives will be the same.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Could you share any feedback or suggestion on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In reflecting on our experience with the previous incentive programs, we’ve identified a few areas for improvement and future considerations. One key suggestion is to incorporate target-based incentives into the program. This addition would ensure that scalability is accompanied by sustainability, providing clear goals and milestones for participants to strive towards.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, implementing a protocol matching system for coincentivization could significantly enhance the program. Our experience in the first month highlighted the time-consuming process of finding suitable allies in Arbitrum. With a matching system, we could identify more win-win opportunities and accelerate the collaboration process, ultimately maximizing the impact and success of the incentive program.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-stip-addendum/23459\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-stip-addendum/23459","pubDate":"Sat, 27 Apr 2024 04:41:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23459"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-stip-addendum/23459.rss","#text":"Frax Finance STIP Addendum"}},{"title":"Vela Exchange STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"Djinn","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h4><a name=\"information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\"></a>Information about STIP/STIP Backfund</h4>\n<p><strong>1.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The driving idea behind the Arbitrum STEP is to support the growing RWA ecosystem and diversify the Arbitrum treasury into tokenized RWAs that offer stable, liquid and uncorrelated yield. For this, Dinari is offering two possible investments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>USFR.d, a token based on the WisdomTree Floating Rate ETF (ticker USFR), a fund that invests in U.S. Floating Rate Notes. Even among the various available Dinari dShares, USFR.d offers a unique investment avenue that was purpose-built with price stability, liquidity and yield in mind.</li>\n<li>SPY.d, a token based on the SPDR S&amp;P500 ETF (ticker SPY), a fund that invests in S&amp;P 500 companies and tracks the S&amp;P500 index.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dinari dShares are a new type of decentralized security bringing tokenized access to the US stock market to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The public stock markets are perhaps the largest traditional RWA category in the world representing $50T USD of value in the US alone and over $110T USD globally. While these markets are large and efficient, traditional access to them, especially outside of the US, is still challenging.</p>\n<p>It is Dinari’s overarching goal to democratize access to the traditional stock market and bring these assets on-chain. Dinari issues 1:1 backed security tokens (“dShares”) in the form of a standard, transferable and yield-bearing ERC-20s. dShares are guaranteed to be 100%-backed at all times with our fully-automated and audited mint and burn process.</p>\n<p>Dinari has been an SEC-registered transfer agent since 2022 and issues dShares under SEC Regulation S to investors that undergo KYB/KYC.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem is small but fast growing and Dinari is proud and excited to be a part of it.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

He stepped back as CEO in 2021 as the company was preparing to IPO. He has been contemplating the ways in which we can globalize the stock exchange through the blockchain since 2016, working to formulate the idea with Balaji Srinivasan who was a friend building a biotech company next door to Freenome at the time. The establishment of the first version of RWAs (mainly stablecoins) and their high market cap makes Gabriel believe that this is finally the time that a global RWA exchange will take off. His previous dealings with regulators has proven valuable navigating the difficult regulatory challenges of Dinari. Gabriel holds a BA in Computational Biology and Chemistry from Cornell University and attended University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine for graduate studies before withdrawing to start Freenome.</p>\n<p><strong>Jake Timothy (CTO)</strong>: Jake began his career at Northrop Grumman’s aerospace division, where he led the development of sophisticated data-driven systems.

Our users and investors should consult their tax advisors for any tax considerations.</p>\n<p><strong>Dividends</strong></p>\n<p>Yield for all underlying stock are distributed as dividends which are then subsequently distributed by Dinari to token holders in one of two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Holders of dShares like USFR.d and SPY.d are issued dividends in the form of USDC to the holding wallet.</li>\n<li>Holders of wrapped dShares like USFR.dw and SPY.dw are issued dividends in the form of reinvestment in the dShare which are reified upon unwrapping.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: Wrapping of dShares from their SYMB.d to SYMB.dw is necessary for compatibility and composability with DeFi. Wrapped dShares are able to account for changes to the underlying stock such as stock splits/reverse splits and continue to provide yield even when staked or otherwise used in DeFi protocols. You are able to wrap and unwrap dShares at <a href=\"http://sbt.dinari.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sbt.dinari.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>USFR.d</strong><br>\nThe USFR.d token issuance and redemption price is determined by the underlying USFR ETF price on the stock market. This price is typically very stable at approximately $50 USD per share with very minor fluctuations loosely based on dividend timing. We anticipate that holders of USFR.d will primarily see dividend-based tax implications.</p>\n<p><strong>SPY.d</strong><br>\nThe SPY.d token issuance and redemption price is also determined by the underlying SPY ETF price on the stock market. The price tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index and can vary over time. Because it is an index composed of many companies from varied industries, the price tends to be more stable than other stocks or ETFs. SPY is the oldest and most liquid ETF in the world and is considered a stable growth ETF in many portfolios. We anticipate that holders of SPY.d will primarily see dividend and capital gains/losses tax implications.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>The issuance and redemption of dShare tokens is a fully-automated process. Redemption requests are made by sending dShare tokens to the Dinari order contract.</p>\n<p>If the US stock market is open, redemption requests will typically take seconds. If the US stock market is closed, redemption requests are queued and executed upon market open. Large redemption requests that exceed Dinari real-time operational liquidity will still be executed in seconds but the return of USDC funds may take up to T+2 business days (typically same-day if before wire cutoff). This is primarily due to the slowness of moving fiat USD through the traditional finance system.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari plans to comply with and exceed at all times the minimum net capital rule outlined by SEC Rule 15c3-1 for broker-dealers. Namely, Dinari will hold funds that exceed the greater of $250,000 or 6-2/3 percent of its aggregate indebtedness (basic method); or, Dinari will hold funds that exceed the greater of $250,000 or 2 percent of customer-related receivables (alternative method). In practice, the amount allocated for first-loss equity has far exceeded the minimum requirements set forth by SEC Rule 15c3-1 to date. First-loss equity would first be denominated by the equity holdings in the underlying position; any excess would be sourced by Dinari equity capital, as appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>USFR.d</strong><br>\nThe underlying assets (USFR stock) is very stable with typical daily pricing aberrations of less than 0.02% and has an average daily trading volume of $190M. Typical transaction times for USFR for issuance or redemption is measured in seconds.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USFR:NYSEARCA?window=MAX\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1aa3393c8b13ba848a07f23aaf571effc78d2250.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"698C74\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USFR:NYSEARCA?window=MAX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Google Finance</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/359;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6396ae75dae0ab0f555434446a9eeee9cdb3c807_2_690x360.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEEEC\" width=\"690\" height=\"360\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USFR:NYSEARCA?window=MAX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund (USFR) Price &amp; News - Google Finance</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Get the latest WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund (USFR) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>The underlying asset of the WisdomTree Floating Rate ETF (“USFR”) itself are U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Notes which are generally regarded as one of the safest investment instruments in the world and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.

If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari dShare issuance and redemption flows are exclusively based on smart contracts and we rely on the transparency and programmability of the blockchain for all order flows. Blockchain derived risks can be split into a few categories.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Technical - Our smart contracts support a wide variety of assets and order modes and this naturally introduces technical complexity. We believe that we mitigate technical risks with internal code reviews, extensive automated test environments and external code audits.</li>\n<li>Operational - In addition to smart contracts, there are a number of internal processes that interact with our blockchain contracts to execute orders and move funds. To mitigate these risks, we employ Drata, an external consultant, to audit our corporate controls and processes and ensure adherence to AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. We are actively working on SOC 2 Type II compliance.</li>\n<li>Regulatory - The regulatory landscape around the blockchain is still evolving but our goal has always to be transparent and compliant. We have been a registered SEC transfer agent since 2022 and maintain active and direct relationships with both the SEC and FINRA.</li>\n<li>Error/Fraud - In the event of an error or detection of fraudulent activity, the dShare holdings of a wallet may become trade-restricted and/or blacklisted. At Dinari’s discretion and ability to accurately reconcile asset ownership with off-chain processes, dShare tokens are able to be reissued to return rightful ownership.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>7.

Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari manages risk along a number of different dimensions.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Investment:</strong><br>\nDinari issues tokens (dShares) that are backed 1:1 with an underlying equity security or ETF. We mitigate market and liquidity risk by only offering tokenized access whose underlying securities meet certain market capitalization and trading volume thresholds and trade on major stock exchanges, such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. In addition, none of our customers are currently using margin accounts or are able to borrow against their tokens. If we were to plan to offer customers the use of margin accounts in the future, Dinari would subject them to regulatory requirements, such as Federal Reserve Regulation T and FINRA Rule 4210, as well as to the margin requirements of our broker-dealer partner, Alpaca Securities.</p>\n<p>From a portfolio perspective, while the majority of assets under management relate to customer securities and funds held by Alpaca, Dinari does own a small amount of securities itself for the sole purpose of facilitating market-making and liquidity. Dinari actively monitors the amount of Dinari-owned securities to ensure that it does not exceed a certain threshold; historically, this figure has averaged less than two percent of Dinari’s equity capital.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Operational</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Customer: All users must undergo KYB/KYC processes with Dinari’s third-party partners, as well as pass AML/CTF procedures, before gaining approval to use the Dinari platform. Additionally, because Dinari solely controls the mint and burn process of our tokens, Dinari controls the redemption process of those tokens as well. Dinari also has the unilateral ability to restrict customer transaction activity on the Dinari platform should any user be found to be in violation of our policies.</li>\n<li>Internal Controls: Dinari employs Drata, an external consultant, to audit our corporate controls and processes and ensure adherence to AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. We also employ Fordefi, an institutional multi-party computation (MPC) wallet and security solution that is SOC 2 Type II-compliant and centralizes control over and access to our portfolio of crypto wallets.</li>\n<li>IT Security: In addition to internal controls, Dinari operates a centralized Identity and Access Management system using OAuth, SAML and multi-factor authentication to centrally manage access to all internal systems, production/staging environments and even most external systems. Dinari employs Drata to continuously audit and monitor access controls to proactively secure our systems and endpoints.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"performance-reporting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#performance-reporting-5\"></a>Performance reporting</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

This means all of the grant rounds contracts, grant proposals that were created on grants stack are all now on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Also in their 20th quarterly grants program round all of the contributions from donors that and the matching fund payouts from Gitcoin will all take place on Arbitrum!</p>\n<p>This means approximately <strong>50,000 people using Arbitrum</strong> for their donations (many of them first-time community members) and about <strong>5 million onchain transitions</strong> during the round.</p>\n<p>There are over 1.5 million dollars in matching funds for grantees in these rounds and direct donations from community members are often half or more of that total, So we can anticipate over 2 million USD equivalent in transaction volume generated from this program in a little more than 2 weeks.</p>\n<p>We have done our part by allocating funds from the Thank ARB program Milestone 1(b). We are giving 100k to the Open Source Software Rounds and 100k to the Community rounds that were selected by Gitcoin to be part of GG20 and who are running their rounds on ARB.</p>\n<p>But that’s not all!</p>\n<p>To make the most of this momentous occasion we have organized a series of rewards for your contributions in GG20, which kicked off this week on Tuesday the 22nd. Whether you’re a builder, a promoter, a curator, or a program manager, there’s a way for you to get involved, showcase your talents, and earn rewards along the way.</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing experimentation and iteration on funding allocation mechanisms and grant program design (at least 90 assessments done by multiple expert reviewers of projects plus all 8 of the grans rounds supported)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Attracting new builder and new community members (30k-50k users, at least 30 projects assessed as high quality which were made by builders on Arbitrum)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>generating transaction volume (approximately 5 million onchain transactions)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>increasing awareness and adoption of Arbitrum Nova infrastructure. (harder to measure but its a good intention to have)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strategy:</p>\n<p>This process is being “supercharged” by Thrive Protocol which we are using to facilitate these incentives as well as assessments and validation of the projects funded as well as the program themselves.</p>\n<p>The intention of this approach is to create a flywheel effect where one dollar in equals more than 2 dollars out in value (based on the goals stated above). In practical terms that means strategic rewards to incentivize useful activity as well as a mixture of automated and human assessment and human validation. This is the key to scalability and effective iteration/ refinement.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ha3zD7rrngTE3yjwjKDtk2Gjv2G.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Thriving_GG20_flywheel\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a_2_690x387.jpeg\" alt=\"Thriving_GG20_flywheel\" data-base62-sha1=\"ha3zD7rrngTE3yjwjKDtk2Gjv2G\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a_2_690x387.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"323231\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>For Builders:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Apply for the Thank ARB Builders Bonus: Don’t be shy about your amazing work!

One example would be support real-yield assets, such as LSD and stablecoins backed by RWA yields. By allocating more incentives to these assets, we aim to ensure that liquidity remains robust and resilient even after the conclusion of the campaign.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a><strong>New Plans for STIP Bridge</strong></h3>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>500,000 ARB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

What are the top level objectives and north star metrics our grant funding should drive? Most grant programs won’t directly affect these top level metrics, but how do we know that they are precisely targeting a goal which has leverage on the north star metrics? How do we define success of a grant program in a way that is aligned with the needs of the ecosystem overall?</p>\n<p>On Tuesday the 23rd, Thank ARB hosted a session to align on these goals.</p>\n<p>There are three phases to this project.

In the end, we came up with the following North Star Metrics (which we call Objectives) in no particular order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase Daily Active Users (DAU)</li>\n<li>Increase Total Volume Locked (TVL)</li>\n<li>Increase Net Bridge Inflows</li>\n<li>Increase Number of Verticals Arbtrum Leads in Market Share</li>\n<li>Increase Number of Protocols Actively Building on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Increase Number of People Buying ARB to Use in Governance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then brainstormed and heatmapped support for which levers have the best opportunity to affect these objectives. We called these goals.</p>\n<p>The top suggestions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kickstart new verticals</li>\n<li>Incentivize dapps for retention</li>\n<li>Attract new protocols willing to mint natively with lockups on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Design and implement staking &amp; utility use cases for ARB</li>\n<li>Convince RWAs to launch natively</li>\n<li>Market to institutional investors</li>\n<li>Targeted marketing campaigns to educate about orbit &amp; stylus</li>\n<li>Conduct token swaps with leading protocols</li>\n<li>Incentivize redelegation by tokenholders</li>\n<li>Highly targeted marketing</li>\n<li>Start a DAO DevRel team</li>\n<li>Provide DAO support services</li>\n<li>Gain unquestionable lead in defi, gaming, and RWAs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These goal suggestions were then broken down into strategies and measures. We relate this to a grant program in that most won’t be able to directly affect an objective like increasing the TVL. However, we can select them based on their alignment to ecosystem needs.</p>\n<p>If you’re thinking “Holy snozberries!!! Those North Star Metrics must have been drafted by some type of nincompoop”, don’t worry. This is only the first phase.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#next-steps-2\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>We will be launching a survey to key delegates &amp; contributors to suggest anything missing. During this time, we will use what we have to guide our grant program coaching efforts.</p>\n<p>The results of the survey will be used to create a Snapshot vote allowing the full DAO to participate in ranking the Goals.</p>\n<p>Then, each grant program will need to show which ecosystem goals they are directly aiming to impact. They will articulate the strategy being used and the measure of their success.</p>\n<p>In the end, we will end up with grant programs having legitimate measures to understand their success or failure. It is important that an experimental program can fail at the pilot stage, but the incentive is normally to claim everything as a success. This ratified alignment and process requirement to improve communication at all levels of the program will be critical.</p>\n<p>Here are some more pictures of our OGSMs which were started during the final breakout session.

Users with pre-existing positions in eligible pools will only start earning rewards if they originally deposited it via the Shell app. Otherwise they must first withdraw, and then re-deposit their liquidity via the Shell app.</p>\n<p>ARB rewards will be applied to all DeFi protocols connected to the Shell Protocol network and supported by the Shell super dapp. These rewards will be additive with any additional ARB rewards and protocol-specific incentives. Supported protocols will include (but won’t be limited to): Aave, Balancer, Curve, Pendle, Beefy, and Shell-native protocols such as the Proteus AMM. More pools and protocols may be added as integrations are built out.</p>\n<p>The Shell super dapp enables cross-chain zaps directly into any Arbitrum DeFi protocol. In order to incentivize users to bridge onto Arbitrum, a higher concentration of the total ARB incentives will be applied to rewards for Arbitrum-native protocols (i.e., with majority TVL on Arbitrum).</p>\n<p><strong>10.

Here’s a summary of some of the key takeaways:</p>\n<p><strong>STIP incentives were highly effective at increasing primary KPIs.</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to the STIP, Notional on Arbitrum had ~$1.5M in TVL and ~$3M borrowed. Notional’s STIP incentives greatly catalyzed the growth of these metrics. At peak, Notional’s TVL grew to over $20M and the amount borrowed grew to over $60M.</p>\n<p><strong>STIP incentives drove attention to leveraged liquidity and away from leveraged vaults.</strong></p>\n<p>In our original STIP application, we put 100% of our incentives on providing fixed rate liquidity on Notional. This created a lot of fixed rate liquidity. But it had the side effect of taking attention away from Notional’s core leveraged vault products which borrow from Notional and deploy capital into external protocols to earn yield. The end result was that users focused much more on providing fixed rate liquidity than on utilizing fixed rate liquidity through Notional’s leveraged vault products.</p>\n<p>We think this end result suggests that it would be better to distribute incentives more equally between providing fixed rate liquidity on Notional vs. using leveraged vaults.</p>\n<p><strong>Leveraged liquidity user retention was not great.</strong></p>\n<p>We split Notional users into three groups: depositors (only supplied capital, didn’t borrow), leveraged liquidity users, and borrowers (posted collateral on Notional to borrow against it). We found that the retention among depositors and borrowers was much higher than for leveraged liquidity users.</p>\n<p>We think that this is another reason to tweak our incentive distribution method for the STIP Bridge. By directing some of the incentives away from providing fixed rate liquidity and toward different products, we think we can achieve greater retention and more sustainable protocol growth after the conclusion of the STIP Bridge.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>250,000 ARB (50% of original grant)</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

My primary piece of feedback for the application process was that it would have been good to have more contact with delegates while we were drafting our STIP application. This would have helped us better understand whether our request was in line with delegates’ expectations and whether there was anything we could change which would have made our application more attractive. The DAO has already responded to this feedback by adding the adviser role in the application process which I think will help a lot.</p>\n<p>With respect to the actual execution of the grant, we could use more help with distribution and discoverability. If the Foundation or DAO were able to help channel attention to different projects that have received grants or make it easier for users to find different opportunities that would be very beneficial. During the STIP Backfund, we did this with some other projects by using a Layer3 campaign. But if Arbitrum itself were able to lend some of its weight to initiatives like this it would be very impactful for grantees.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n

Stake DAO strategies were leading to short term TVL increase and new TVL mainly coming from somewhere else on Arbitrum. We therefore focused our deployment of the grant on bringing products from Ethereum to Arbitrum, to make sure that people had to bridge and add value to Arbitrum if they want to benefit it, while having no reason to go back to mainnet when the incentives will stop. We believe that this is the best way to convert this short term incentive plan into long term added value for Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a><strong>New Plans for STIP Bridge</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The overall idea will stay the same, but we will focus on bringing long term value added to Arbitrum by focusing on bringing mainnet products on Arbitrum, and limiting the basic liquidity mining rewards. We will increase the number of services and options for users, so that Arbitrum becomes a much more complete place for our products than even mainnet. A good example is the financing of various lending markets for our products. We would like to also extend the use of our grant, not only to our Curve, but also to our Pendle products.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Recipient Multisig: 0x3B985f06D624C74F270daeCcDb65DcC6ee582372</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>asdCRV liquidity gauge: 0x25E822B65a58Ce1A53DbC327d4fA489351FB1Df0</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Our main suggestions would be:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Having one point of contact with the Arbitrum team/foundation.

Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways</em> as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<p><em>We have planned a slight change in the way rewards will be used, but it is coherent with the general idea expressed in the STIP proposal</em></p>\n<p><strong>8. How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Abracadabra’s newly acquired ARB will be used differently from the previous batch. Lets see how:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>1) 60% of the ARB rewards (450k ARB)</strong> - will be used to incentivise MIM LPers.</em></p>\n<p><em>MIM LPers will not only be on the main MIM-2crv pool and MIM-crvUSD pool on curve finance, but we plan on deploying our own stableswap infrastructure, called MIMswap, that will allow users to receive ARB reward by providing liquidity in the Abracadabra in house AMMs. MIMswap staking contracts are not only controlled in full by the Abracadabra DAO, but they also allow for LP locking.</em></p>\n<p><em>MIMswap has been live for more than a month now on Blast, allowing for seamless swaps between USDB and MIM. Our locking contracts have been incentivising Liquidity Provision there at full speed using the point system. Our expectation is that this same setup, but using actually ARB rewards, will be a killer product to add to our Arbitrum Ecosystem. MIMswap is ready to be deployed on Arbitrum, to offer one more avenue for users to LP MIM into!</em></p>\n<p><em>MIMswap LPers will therefore receive ARB LP rewards coming from the STIP, similarly to other LP rewards systems. The more user lock their funds for tho, the bigger their boost will be.</em></p>\n<p><em>MIMswap has gone through 2 rounds of audits, one with CodeArena and the other with Guardian Audits. MIMswap has been live for a month now on Blast.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>It is pivotal to notice that the deployment of MIMswap will not make our DAO stop its rewards to both Camelot and Curve, but just add to it another venue that will be focused on MIM-USDT pairings, while leaving MIM-USDC to Camelot, and MIM-USDT-USDC to curve.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>This three headed approach is intended not to create competition between the protocols, but just to increase the number of options available to LPers on Arbitrum.</em></p>\n<p><em>We plan on adding MIMswap pool, next to Camelot and Curve pools on the same incentive dashboard on our main user interface, so that users can easily find these different avenues.</em></p>\n<p><em>This new boost in liquidity will allow Abracadabra not only to expand its already successful gmCcauldrons, but also expand its collateral offering to other competitive yield sources. Following are some examples of integrations our developers have been working on:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Camelot LP Tokens by Camelot Dex</li>\n<li>jUSDC by Jones DAO</li>\n<li>Pendle Tokens</li>\n<li>Native naked assets ($GMX, $GRAIL, $JONES and others)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"mimswap-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#mimswap-3\"></a>MIMswap</h2>\n<p><em>The following section will be a short description of MIMswap, that will allow delegates and users to learn more on the product.</em></p>\n<p><em>Abracadabra launched an Automated Market Maker DEX (AMM DEX) called MIMSwap with its own liquidity needs as the first use case. MIMSwap specializes is the exchange of tightly pegged assets (like stablecoins).</em></p>\n<p><em>MIMswap utilises a continuous curve AMM (very different from the concentrated liquidity model), optimised to improve stableswap efficiency thanks to the addition of two new parameters:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>K - <em>which adjusts the concentration of the assets in the pool</em></li>\n<li>I - <em>which adjust the price at which the pool is correctly balanced, the target price.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>MIMswap design allows LP tokens to be swiftly integrated in other defi legos, which requires much less work from protocols compared to concentrated liquidity LPs, while maintaining superior level of efficiency for tightly pegged assets.</em></p>\n<p><em>On top of this, MIMswap uses a LP lock mechanism that commits users liquidity for a certain period of time, in exchange for immediate LP rewards, perfectly mimicking the need of the Abracadabra DAO in terms of Liquidity Provision.</em></p>\n<p><em>MIMswap currently focuses only on tightly pegged assets with only two-assets pool but it can be expanded in the future for other asset types.</em></p>\n<p><em>We expect MIMswap LP Tokens integration to be coming soon to our Arbitrum Cauldron lineup.</em></p>\n<p><em>MIMswap has undergone two round of audits, one with <a href=\"https://github.com/GuardianAudits/Audits/tree/main/MIMSwap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Guardian</a> and the second one with CodeArena.</em></p>\n<p><em>MIMswap docs can be found <strong><a href=\"https://docs.abracadabra.money/learn/intro/mimswap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a></strong>.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>2) 20% MIMswap Founders Boost (150k ARB)</strong> - will be used to reward LPers that lock their MIMswap LP tokens for 3 months mimicking the strategy happening on Blast.</em></p>\n<p><em>In order to better understand this system, the easiest example is MIMswap recent launch on blast. With only point rewards, MIMswap has attracted more than 13m in TVL in less than 3 weeks, out of this 13m, 9m worth of LPs have decided to lock their funds in MIMswap staking contracts for 3 months, in order to enjoy the founder’s boost. 20% of all the received GOLD points on blast have been dedicated to Founders.</em></p>\n<p><em>Similarly we are aiming at distributing 20% of all the received ARB to MIMswap LPers that in the first 3 weeks of the program lock their funds for 3 months. This part of the system will also be incentivised with part of the SPELL rewards pledged towards it.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>3) 20% MIM Savings Rate (MSR) (150k ARB)</strong> - We have now completed audits for our MSR contracts, we are happy to announce that MIM Savings Rate (MSR) is now ready to be deployed on Arbitrum to distirbutedARB rewards to users who lock their MIM tokens inside the MSR staking contracts.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"mim-saving-rate-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#mim-saving-rate-4\"></a>MIM Saving Rate</h2>\n<p>The MIM Savings Rate (MSR) contracts are one of the new innovative tools that our DAO is experimenting with to improve MIM liquidity outside of plain LP incentives.</p>\n<p>In its first iteration, the MSR contracts are staking contracts that allow for locking the deposited MIM for certain amount of times, and in exchange receive boosted rewards.</p>\n<p>Currently, the MSR contracts will allow the distribution for SPELL and ARB, which will then be expanded to the plain MIM distributions coming from the interest collected by Abracadabra.</p>\n<p>The MSR contracts were meant to be launched in our previous STIP, but because of the extreme focused our team put on the gmCauldrons, they have been only finalised 2 months ago. Audits are now completed tho, and the MSR is ready to be launched on Arbirtum.</p>\n<p>The MSR has undergone one round of audit with Guardian audits, and can be found <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/GuardianAudits/Audits/blob/main/AbracadabraMoney/2024-02-06_Abracadabra_MultiRewards.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n<p><em>For reference, During the STIP campaign, the DAO allocated 239,400,000 SPELL tokens to deepen MIM liquidity on Arbitrum (13.3M per epoch allocated to the MIM-2CRV Curve pool), compared to our initial commitment of 160,000,000 SPELL tokens. <strong>Despite the reduced size of the bridge TIP, our DAO is committing to match the ARB grant with 200m SPELL tokens.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>9.

Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<p><em>The STIP has been one of the most successful incentivisation protocols that Abracadabra has experienced. The DAO has been great in giving constructive feedback and recommendations on adjusting the grant distribution methods.</em></p>\n<p><em>Delegates have been responsive throughout the STIP voting campaign and after.</em></p>\n<p><em>The only pain point we have experienced has been with correctly tracking the effects of our rewards. Abracadabra incentives trickle down to the whole ecosystem, and they are not usually displayed only in our protocol’s own TVL.</em></p>\n<p><em>As an example, STIP arb rewards have allowed Curve Finance TVL to grow exponentially as well. In the screenshot below you can see that at its peak, MIM liquidity on arbitrum increased to nearly 37m, bringing trading fees, TVL and users to other protocols that are not directly related to Abracadabra.</em></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0176bf30ce4d6ef35fa66bf78e0affbd77f826b0.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/cWTgxe5zR6ugzj5M4XTxrL4Qb6.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0176bf30ce4d6ef35fa66bf78e0affbd77f826b0_2_499x367.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"cWTgxe5zR6ugzj5M4XTxrL4Qb6\" width=\"499\" height=\"367\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0176bf30ce4d6ef35fa66bf78e0affbd77f826b0_2_499x367.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0176bf30ce4d6ef35fa66bf78e0affbd77f826b0.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0176bf30ce4d6ef35fa66bf78e0affbd77f826b0.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C8C7D1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em>These findings have been reflected in our MIMswap deployment for the STIP Bridge, which will allow the Arbitrum DAO to track more easily the actual ecosystem effect that the ARB allocated had.</em></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/abracadabra-dao-stip-addendum/23376\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/abracadabra-dao-stip-addendum/23376","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Apr 2024 07:17:09 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23376"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/abracadabra-dao-stip-addendum/23376.rss","#text":"Abracadabra DAO STIP Addendum"}},{"title":"Thetanuts Finance STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"Thetanuts_Finance","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<p><strong>1</strong>. <strong>Can you provide a link to your previous STIP proposal (round 1 or backfund)?</strong></p>\n<aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"17539\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/thetanuts_finance/48/5849_2.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thetanuts-finance-final-stip-round-1/17539\">[Thetanuts Finance] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]</a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/incentive-framework/14\"><span data-category-id=\"14\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #000000; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF; --parent-category-badge-color: #25AAE2;\" data-parent-category-id=\"16\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category --has-parent\"><span class=\"badge-category__name\">Incentive Framework (Round 1)</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    <a name=\"section-1-applicant-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#section-1-applicant-information-1\"></a>SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\n<a name=\"applicant-name-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#applicant-name-2\"></a>Applicant Name:\nThetanuts Finance \n<a name=\"project-name-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#project-name-3\"></a>Project Name:\nThetanuts Finance \n<a name=\"project-description-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#project-description-4\"></a>Project Description:\nThetanuts Finance is a decentralized options marketplace with a comprehensive range of products for majors and altcoins – enabling users to generate yield on their collateral (current v2), and long / short options (via v3 in Oct 2023). \nOur pioneering v3 model will enable permissionless trading between option buyers and sellers through the introduction of AMM and lending mark…\n  </blockquote>\n</aside>\n\n<p><strong>2.
