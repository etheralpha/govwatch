Utilizing custom fine-tuned LLM models for each scenario, we minimize the risk of hallucination and maximize the positive outcome from each interaction with the bot.</p>\n<p>As we have advanced knowledge in investment evaluation and software development cost estimation we are able to integrate this knowlegde into Boris Boarman intellegence makig this unique IP another advantage allowing to delivery the smoothest user experience and the sharpest results.</p>\n<p>We also have a solid vision for future functionality to streamline project progress reporting to minize the risk of wasting approved funds. It will secure foundation funds from unaccountable teams, increase transparancy and reduce the transaction overhead even more.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovation:</strong><br>\nBoris Boarman is the first tool to integrate conversational AI with grant<br>\napplication automation, significantly reducing the workload for both applicants<br>\nand reviewers.</p>\n<p><strong>Company Background &amp; Team Expertise:</strong><br>\n<strong>Roman Gorbunov, Developer and Founder</strong><br>\n14 years of industry total experience, in web3 since 2016 developing various projects from cross-platform wallets with multi-asset support, nft-marketplaces, defi/defund infrastructure, proprietary blockchain projects and cloud-based fintech projects for Fortune 500 corporations and crypto native companies.

We are a team of dedicated governance enthusiasts who have been in the crypto governance space for over three years. Our team were some of the first members involved in defi governance and we want to apply what we have learned over here to Lido. We believe this community has some of the strongest and most intelligent community members and we’re grateful to be along for the journey!</p>\n<p><strong>Core Values:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Growth: Our decisions are primarily focused on the growth of the protocol. This often results in how to spend money efficiently, but even more importantly and objecting for unreasonable spends and knowing when to vote no.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transparency: Clear communication with votes and explanations of reasoning, and an equivalent demand for proposals to do the same. Too often we see thousands, if not millions, being rolled up together and glossed over during proposals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accountability: Too often once a decision is done, having proper accountability becomes an afterthought. Whether it’s a DAO promise or a grant or a new program, once a DAO votes something in, we forget about it. Our goal with PGov is to both continue to check in on these decisions as well as ensure that there are proper channels set up to ensure accountability.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance:</strong> We are committed to the code of conduct, mission, and respective values<br>\n<strong>Disclosures:</strong> We are delegates across other Defi protocols.

Before setting the anchor at Everstake, I was part of marketing teams in Web2, working for tech corporations such as Microsoft and Google, and contributing to the growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Many of you may know me from my regular <a href=\"https://x.com/search?q=Node%20Operator%20Community%20Call%20(from%3Aeth_everstake)&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Node Operators Community Call recaps</a>, but besides these, I do tons of <a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">educational content around Ethereum</a> for the community, as I believe that fighting informational asymmetry and biases will help make this space better. I cover covers not only the latest things around Ethereum and explain novel, complicated concepts in simple words but also touch on the broader landscape that shapes the Ethereum we know today and will face tomorrow. More solid materials from my side include Ethereum ecosystem reports within <a href=\"https://everstake.one/crypto-reports\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our reports hub</a>, articles, and talks on the crypto conferences (the last one was on Ethereum governance).</p>\n<p>Thanks for considering my application! Below, you can find out more about my motivation, values, and decision-making approach. If any questions, I will be happy to answer them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17237-contact-information-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17237-contact-information-4\"></a>Contact Information</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>X / Twitter: <a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@eth_everstake</a></li>\n<li>Discord: irina_everstake</li>\n<li>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/irina_everstake\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">irina_everstake</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17237-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17237-motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The recent <a href=\"https://x.com/DefiIgnas/status/1817928935490867309\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Compound governance attack</a> proved once more the importance of true voters’ dedication and accountability to the governance process, thus, in my opinion, the introduction of a Public Delegate Platform is just in time to enforce a sustainable governance process within Lido DAO itself.</p>\n<p>I have been within the Lido ecosystem for a long time, so I see this initiative as a great opportunity to contribute my expertise and usefulness to the protocol evolution, community, and LDO token holders. For the latter, keeping track of all proposals and voting deadlines may be a burden, which may create a perception of centralization, underrepresentation, and the worst—FOMO, as it’s pretty challenging to be on top of everything given the speed of projects within Web3 space.</p>\n<p>As soon as within my Everstake role I also take care of Everstake representation in the Lido governance process, thus if I become a Public Delegate, it won’t be an extra effort for me, as it is something I used to do on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Besides, I find the governance process itself interesting, as this concept matures across the Web3 industry (maybe that’s one of the reasons I write so much about it and my recent conference talk was dedicated to it).</p>\n<p>Below are some examples of my participation in the Lido governance across past few years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Posts (<a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1719766040282845540\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example 1</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1689588674348957696\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example 2</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1636726740004249600\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example 3</a>) explaining the proposal/s on the voting to the community</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://x.com/search?q=%22%F0%9F%97%B3%EF%B8%8F%20%22%20(from%3Airina_everstake)&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Weekly governance highlights</a></li>\n<li>Monthly voting reports (<a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1665016791393763329\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example 1</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1679597852316561414\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example 2</a>): what, when and why</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1616031474083299328\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Overview of all governance across the year</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/increasing-number-of-active-easy-track-motions-run-simultaneously/4075\">Proposal</a> suggested by me (one and only now)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/profile/0x06A90756e57bC7A016Eed0aB23fC36d11C42bBa0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">My Snapshot voting profile</a> (active since I received the LDO grant in March of this year)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Objectives as a Public Delegate</strong><br>\nThese are focused on three main pillars of the Lido ecosystem:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Serve to protocol</em>.

Lemma’s services cover governance design, implementation, initial setup of the foundation from an operations perspective (accounting, bank and exchange accounts, policies, and procedures) and running of grants programs and governance for DAOs.</p>\n<p>The Lemma is presented by a forward think team of professionals that consist of traditional finance professionals and crypto native researchers.</p>\n<p>In our short history we came to recognize the importance of governance and the role delegates play. This role is critical to effective governance of the DAO and being able to move forward with informed decision making.</p>\n<p>We are active contributors to other DAO’s.

Research is led by <a href=\"https://x.com/blockbanzai\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hugo May</a>, who is an experienced cryptoeconomics researcher and founding member and core contributor of <a href=\"https://justcryptoeconomics.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Just Cryptoeconomics</a>, an open-access and non-profit research group that was founded to advance the field of cryptoeconomics., an open-access and non-profit research group that was founded to advance the field of cryptoeconomics.</p>\n<p>Through this initiative, Hugo explores new theories, models, and frameworks, and the insights we gain often inform the projects Lemma takes on.</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional Expertise</strong></p>\n<p>The Founders of Lemma combines expertise from the traditional auditing world and big data. Karel Olivier worked as an auditor at Deloitte in South Africa, the USA and Cayman Islands bringing together a unique set of experiences where he learned from listed and private companies about controls, diversification and the importance of maintain accurate financial information in the making of informed decision making. Lize Page, has a Masters degree in Data Science. With the volume that is produced on the blockchain, the ability to make sense of this is of invaluable experience. Lemma has advisors who we rely on for council when needed. Petri Basson, from Hash Directors, a Web3 specialized directorship firm is an example. They bring an informed lens to decision making when it comes to operations of the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>We believe that effective governance design is of critical importance to the survival of online public goods. We are well aware of voting fatigue and the implications of the current DAO governance landscape. Having delegates who are informed, willing, active and responsive ensures that the DAO can continue with its mission without the added burden of having to work on “getting out the vote”.</p>\n<p>We bring a different set of skills to the Lido DAO. Being involved with DAOs in their formation stages allows us to see the thinking behind decision making. This experience will provide additional context and feedback to the DAO. We evaluate proposals not only on their merit and cost, but also on what it would mean operationally.</p>\n<p>Our promise to you, the delegates</p>\n<p><strong>Involvement</strong></p>\n<p>We will be involved in proposals. Not only in voting, but in articulating our reasoning and decision-making approach. We intend to offer the same level of diligence in our participation as we do in our operational enablement.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro-activity</strong></p>\n<p>We will be pro-active in our communication. Assessing proposals early-on to allow for changes to be made withing reasonable timelines.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliant and future Focused</strong></p>\n<p>Our primary focus will be on the future of Lido DAO. Each decision will be based on whether this is in line with the growth of the Lido DAO, adds value to the DAO and will allow the DAO to continue with its primary mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance</strong></p>\n<p>We accept the purpose/mission/values of Lido DAO</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure</strong></p>\n<p>We work with other DAOs. Where a proposal is raised in which we have a conflict of interest we will disclose this and abstain from voting or commentary unless it is specifically requested.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lemma-delegate-thread/8214\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lemma-delegate-thread/8214","pubDate":"Sun, 25 Aug 2024 19:42:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-8214"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lemma-delegate-thread/8214.rss","#text":"Lemma - Delegate Thread"}},{"title":"Marcbcs - Delegate Thread","dc:creator":"marcbcs","category":"Delegate Platform","description":"<p><strong>Name</strong>: Marc<br>\n<strong>Contact Information</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>X / Telegram / Discord = <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/marcbcs\">@marcbcs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Address</strong>: 0x98308b6dA79B47D15e9438CB66831563649Dbd94</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Background: During the day I work in TradFi, at night I work in Crypto. I’m an economist by training which is what got me into crypto a few years ago: the opportunity to create a better “money”, and from there I never escaped from the rabbit hole. I started my working career in management consulting, first at a top consultancy firm and afterwards as a freelancer. My consulting work has involved from high-level projects advising client’s senior leadership team / board of directors on key strategic matters, to hands-on projects defining and implementing cost reductions. My clients are businesses operating in TradFi Services, Public Sector and Investment Funds amongst others. Currently most of my time is dedicated to Revolut working there in Strategy (10%) &amp; Operations (90%), a decent amount of the time on crypto. After hours, I consult for crypto startups (mostly regulated businesses / CeFi) and I’m an active contributor to Lido in the Treasury Management Committee.</li>\n<li>Expertise: Get shit done in business strategy and operations; break down hard stuff into simple terms so people (from devs, to management to operators) can understand each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make it easier for LDO holders to participate in Lido’s governance: It’s not possible to be on top of everything, specially in an rapidly moving industry like crypto. This is why I myself focus on Lido and delegate my tokens for other projects. If elected, I will stop consulting for other companies to ensure I do a good job here.</li>\n<li>Ensure that Lido continues to be a leader in staking: Lido has a head-start because of it’s large market share with Retail. However, the Institutions are coming and this will be a completely different game. I want to see Lido thrive here and help make it happen.</li>\n<li>Bring the best of the traditional business world to Lido: DAOs are a great invention but have their own set of challenges. I believe that there are a few things we can borrow from traditional businesses improve Lido and I’m well placed to help with that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Values and Decision-Making Approach</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decentralisation</li>\n<li>Meritocracy</li>\n<li>Seek truth (<em>“what do people believe merely by convention and what is truth?”</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance</strong><br>\nI accept <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\">the Lido Public Delegate Code of Conduct </a> and commit to being fully aligned with <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-vibe-alignment-purpose-mission-vision/4380\">Purpose/Mission/Values of Lido DAO</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures</strong><br>\nI work a TradFi job for Revolut, which involves working on crypto. I also have to disclose my relationship with Lido to Revolut to avoid any conflicts of interest, and should one arise, I would inform both parties and anyone who has delegated to me.<br>\nI also advise crypto startups, mostly regulated businesses / CeFi.

Soichiro, with a background in asset management for institutional investors at Goldman Sachs, engages in strategic analysis and business development related to crypto assets. Shinya, with financial system development experience at Goldman Sachs, ensures the technological innovation and robustness of our staking infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Our investors, including Yamaguchi Capital and GMO Web3, support our vision and operations. Additionally, we collaborate with top-tier academic institutions, including Osaka Institute of Technology and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, reinforcing our research-driven approach.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17218-expertise-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17218-expertise-3\"></a><strong>Expertise:</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Staking Expertise</strong><br>\nNext Finance Tech has a proven track record in staking operations, with a particularly focus on Ethereum. We consistently maintain over 99.9% uptime in our staking services, supporting multi-client and multi-region operations.<br>\nAdditionally, we are leading the introduction of the Lido Community Staking Module (CSM) in Japan, hosting monthly events since July 2024 and creating Japanese documentation to promote knowledge dissemination. We have plans for further CSM development (<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/community-grants-csm-resources/7990/6\">link</a>).</li>\n<li><strong>Traditional Finance and Institutional Expertise (TradFi/Institutional)</strong><br>\nOur leadership team brings extensive experience from the traditional finance sector. Our CEO, Soichiro Tokuriki, notably worked at Goldman Sachs, where he specialized in institutional investor relations. As ETH spot ETFs and staking ETFs frows, an influx of institutional capital into ETH staking is anticipated. Lido Institutional is well-positioned to meet this demand, and we believe our expertise in traditional finance and institutional investor relations will significantly contribute to advancing these efforts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17218-motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17218-motivation-4\"></a><strong>Motivation:</strong></h2>\n<p>Lido has a robust ecosystem comprised of numerous stakers—both individual and institutional—as well as a diverse array of node operators including professional staking firms and solo validators. By effectively balancing and aligning the interests of these stakeholders, Lido continues to expand its ecosystem and foster a more decentralized Ethereum network.</p>\n<p>Within this context, providing staking services to institutional investors and advancing the development of community stakers emerge as critical challenges. Driven by these considerations, we are motivated to serve as a Lido DAO delegator with the following objectives.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decentralization of Ethereum Staking Entities (Integration with Institutional Investors)</strong><br>\nWith the recent introduction of Ethereum spot ETFs, there is an anticipated influx of capital from institutional investors into ETH staking. The continued development of stETH, which allows staking while maintaining decentralization, is crucial for the ecosystem. In this context, providing staking solutions to institutional investors—essentially advancing Lido Institution—is of paramount importance.

The team is constantly auditing governance contracts, systems, and processes to power our governance data API and governance client which is trusted and widely used across the industry. Boardroom also maintains close relationships with delegates and contributors in most major DAOs and their feedback has been helpful in analyzing tokenholder preferences and relaying industry best practices across the space.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17212-delegate-statement-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-delegate-statement-3\"></a>Delegate Statement</h2>\n<p>We support initiatives that onboard delegates, introduce governance improvements, and uphold agreed-upon governance procedures.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17212-what-we-want-to-see-happen-in-lido-governance-over-the-next-year-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-what-we-want-to-see-happen-in-lido-governance-over-the-next-year-4\"></a>What we want to see happen in Lido governance over the next year</h3>\n<p>We believe it is critical for the community to prioritize sound governance practices that are responsive to the goals of all stakeholders. As such, three things we want to see happen in Lido governance over the next year are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increased Delegate Activity:</strong> We’d like to see a focus on conversations about delegate engagement, retention, and compensation as we help establish a cultural practice of frequent re-delegation and delegate campaigning.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Information Asymmetry:</strong> Keeping up with the latest in DAO governance is cumbersome for the average tokenholder. Boardroom produces the leading weekly DAO governance newsletter and has contributed to several DAOs, including Lido, in the form of helping to reduce information asymmetry by producing easy-to-read Governance updates. As a Lido delegate, we would make solving this problem a priority.</li>\n<li><strong>Experimentation in Governance:</strong> Lido should experiment with innovations in decentralized governance, such as flexible voting, the use of working groups and SubDAOs, and governance privacy enhancements.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17212-reasons-we-want-to-be-a-delegate-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-reasons-we-want-to-be-a-delegate-5\"></a>Reasons we want to be a delegate</h3>\n<p>From our vantage point in the industry, we see many recurring issues in DAO governance. Some examples include information asymmetry, social dynamics hindering newcomer participation, limited access and support for large tokenholders and delegates, and widespread apathy and low participation among tokenholders. These issues create barriers to effective governance, making it difficult for stakeholders to stay informed, contribute meaningfully, and navigate the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Boardroom is well positioned to kickstart initiatives that can address these challenges by improving information dissemination, fostering community engagement, providing support to stakeholders, and promoting a more participatory governance environment in the Lido ecosystem onboarding. As a Lido delegate, Boardroom will offer support to contributors who don’t have the connections or the voting power needed to propose new initiatives and contribute to the governance and growth of the Lido ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17212-disclosure-of-conflicts-of-interest-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-disclosure-of-conflicts-of-interest-6\"></a>Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest</h3>\n<p>Boardroom is a venture-funded company with investors that include delegates in other protocols that could become competitive with Uniswap.

Our team of 10 is a strategic blend of engineers and ex CTOs, BDs and marketers, lawyers and economists, all heavily involved and demonstrably commited to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Collectively and over the years, we have either founded or actively contributed to a long list of promising and established protocols (like Yearn Finance, Perpetual Protocol), communities (like lobsterDAO) open-source tools (like smold.app) and infrastructure solutions (like The Graph). We are decentralization maxis and have proven to be longterm, big-picture investors.</p>\n<p>Our full team and track record can be found <a href=\"https://x.com/daedalus_angels/status/1509544280309837826\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17206-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17206-motivation-3\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>\n<p>Given its dominant position among incumbent liquid staking providers and an ongoing commitment to decentralizing its Node Operator set, we clearly see Lido as one of the most important stakeholders in Ethereum’s present and future. Thus, it becomes paramount to create and nurture an efficient, transparent and high-touch approach to Lido’s wholesale governance initiatives and all future proposals.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that voter apathy has plagued both young upstarts and established protocols that pledged to decentralize their capacities. The onus is on the Lido delegates to shoulder the bulk of the operative load and herald the interests of not just the underlying protocol, but of the Ethereum ecosystem at large.</p>\n<p>The Daedalus Collective is a group of seasoned builders, founders and operators helping shape the blockchain space for the better part of the last decade. With a healthy blend of technical and soft skills as well as a track record in helping guide, grow and govern successful projects, we now want to leverage our members’ expertise to help streamline Lido’s governance efforts, demystify future proposals and pending innovations to the broader public, and advocate for both sustainable growth and ecosystem-wide alignment of the Lido protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17206-values-and-decision-making-approach-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17206-values-and-decision-making-approach-4\"></a><strong>Values and Decision-Making Approach</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Clarity and context</strong> - we aim to diminish the massive information asymmetry currently present between most delegates and the wider public. Given many of our members’ history and experience in end-user and community-facing roles, we want to help unscramble the lifecycle of an average proposal and make them more digestible for any Lido community member.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralization</strong> - we support Lido’s ongoing efforts to expand the Node Operator set and employ novel decentralization mechanisms. We pledge to safeguard the decentralization ethos and help align stakeholder interests in its pursuit.</p>\n<p><strong>High-touch</strong> - our involvement goals go beyond merely proactive - we are committed to engaging fully with 100% of incoming DAO proposals.</p>\n<p><strong>Methodical and thorough</strong> - governance proposals are a highly collaborative effort spanning across teams, departments, contributors and community members. We will always engage with all relevant stakeholders as part of our decision-making process, and ensure a constant and open line of communication from the research phase all the way up until the vote is cast.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17206-public-acceptance-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17206-public-acceptance-5\"></a><strong>Public Acceptance</strong>:</h2>\n<p>Daedalus accepts Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct (<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a>) and Aligned with <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, Vision)</a></p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures</strong>:</p>\n<p>Over the past 3 years, Daedalus and its members have backed a number of promising teams and projects across web3 verticals.

Data on operational costs were collected from a sample of 20 Ethereum service providers, with projections made for a five-year period assuming a 20% year-over-year growth in membership (re: Node Operator participation).

For an average member spending $12,000 monthly on hosting services, this translates to annual savings of $21,600. Extrapolating to the initial 20 members, the total annual savings for the Ethereum ecosystem could reach $432,000 in the first year, potentially growing to $907,200 by the fifth year with 42 members (Table 1).</p>\n<p>Table 1: Projected Annual Savings</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>Members</th>\n<th>Annual Savings (USD)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>432,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>518,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>626,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>756,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>42</td>\n<td>907,200</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-17199-technological-implications-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17199-technological-implications-7\"></a>Technological Implications</h3>\n<p>The formation of the ESPBL may have significant implications for the technological development of the Ethereum network:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Network Resilience</strong>: By reducing operational costs, the ESPBL could enable a more diverse set of validators and node operators, potentially increasing the decentralization and resilience of the network⁴.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Accelerated Innovation</strong>: Cost savings could be reinvested into research and development, potentially accelerating technological advancements in areas such as scalability and energy efficiency⁵.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security Standardization</strong>: As a unified entity, the ESPBL could play a crucial role in developing and promoting technical standards for Ethereum infrastructure, potentially leading to improved interoperability and efficiency⁶.

We believe staking will play a crucial role for asset managers in the future and use validators as a way to get closer to the tech for the ecosystems we support and meet really strong builders that we can partner with on our venture business.</p>\n<p>Proof Group has been natively staking Ethereum since the merge and strongly believes in Ethereum’s role in the future of decentralized finance. We recently joined the SSV Testnet <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> and are looking forward to becoming a larger voice/ contributor in the Lido ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation, values and decision making</strong></p>\n<p>Why I think our participation in this Lido’s delegate program makes sense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although Proof Group is relatively new to the Lido ecosystem, we are extremely versed in Ethereum staking. Delegators can trust Proof Group as a voice for Ethereum staking because we truly have skin in the game and built our staking business by self-staking all of our own assets as opposed to just receiving delegations from others.</li>\n<li>We can provide a newer voice to the Lido community, especially through the DVT lens. Lido is actively looking to decentralize their operator set and improve their client diversity. Proof Group will be an excellent voice for newer operators and delegators looking to improve decentralization in the Lido set.</li>\n<li>Our engineering team prides ourselves on actively making core protocol contributions. We are actively making PRs to Github of ecosystems we support (IE: m3diumrare-GitHub).</li>\n<li>Governance in web3 can admittedly use a lot of work. Some of our team has a background in TradFi where we have observed how governance in the equity markets works. We have a lot of views on how we can take some of the best of what goes on with proxy voting at large asset managers and vastly improve on it for a web3 audience.</li>\n<li>We truly believe in Ethereum and envision much of the financial rails of the future to be built on it. Lido is the most important player in the Ethereum ecosystem and we feel it is our duty to support governance for the Lido &amp; Ethereum community at the grassroots level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public acceptance</strong></p>\n<p>We accept Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct and Aligned with Lido’s Mission Statement.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures</strong></p>\n<p>Proof Group holds liquid assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, &amp; other top 50 tokens as part of our investment business. We are also investors in several other Liquid &amp; Re-staking protocols such as Rio Network, Karak, &amp; Stader.</p>\n<p>None of this would affect our role as a delegate on Lido.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proof-group-delegate-thread/8190\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proof-group-delegate-thread/8190","pubDate":"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 20:53:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-8190"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proof-group-delegate-thread/8190.rss","#text":"Proof Group: Delegate Thread"}},{"title":"ProRelGuild Delegate Thread","dc:creator":"Marin","category":"Delegate Platform","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-17192-delegate-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17192-delegate-information-1\"></a>Delegate information:</h2>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>\nProRelGuild consists of four members who are actively contributing to Lido DAO and paving the road to stETH adoption, growth, and industry-wide collaborations.

The assets contributed by Lido Allies will be subject to legal checks-and-balances with the DAO and held in a transparent 4/7 multisigs staffed by the BORG Personnel. The BORG personnel hope to eventually transition these multisigs to MetaLeX’s forthcoming technology stack to provide a more full-featured set of onchain checks-and-balances mirroring the prescribed legal arrangements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This proposal seeks to inform Lido DAO and the broader Lido community of the details of the Lido Alliance BORG and to obtain a signal of the Lido DAO’s support for the structure through an approval of the proposal. If the proposal is approved, the Lido Alliance BORG will be incorporated as described herein.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17171-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17171-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Cybernetic Organization (CybOrg or ‘BORG’) is a new type of web3 legal structure–a traditional legal entity that uses autonomous technologies (such as smart contracts) to augment the entity’s governance and activities. Just as sci-fi cyborgs (‘cybernetic organisms’) augment humans (natural persons) with robotic organs and limbs or microchip or optics implants, BORGs augment state-chartered entities (legal persons) with autonomous software such as smart contracts. Crucially, legal entities that are BORGs do not merely use autonomous technologies as an incidental part of their business–instead, much like a human might have a robotic prosthesis surgically attached to his shoulder, BORGs are legally governed by autonomous technologies through tech-specific rules implanted in their charter documents. DAO-adjacent BORGs, like the proposed Lido Alliance BORG, require that all or most of the BORG’s assets be held in multisig smart contracts empowering the relevant DAO to directly provide feedback to, and exert certain checks and balances against potential misconduct by, the BORG’s human managers.</p>\n<p>The general reasons for using a DAO-adjacent BORG to ‘wrap’ DAO-related multisigs, committees, working groups and similar structures are summarized in Delphi Labs’ seminal article <a href=\"https://delphilabs.medium.com/assimilating-the-borg-a-new-cryptolegal-framework-for-dao-adjacent-entities-569e54a43f83\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Assimilating the BORG</a>.</p>\n<p>More specifically, in the case of the Alliance working group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There may be a need or desire to enter into legal agreements with Lido Allies (or related entities or individuals) in order to express and legally enforce each Lido Ally’s commitments to the Lido community and expectations of support from the Lido community. A legal entity is needed to serve as counterparty to such agreements as Lido DAO cannot enter in agreements itself as it lacks legal personality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Alliance working group may need to receive or hold tokens or certain rights in future tokens from pre-token Lido Allies—a legal entity may be needed to own/hold such rights.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For regulatory reasons, Lido DAO should avoid looking like an on chain ‘venture fund’ or ‘commodities pool’ that holds diversified assets, and thus such assets should be owned by a separate legal entity. (See e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/investreport/34-81207.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The SEC DAO Report</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If unincorporated, the Alliance working group runs a risk of receiving involuntary legal classifications, which may carry personal liability for the working group members.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If unincorporated, the Alliance working group may lack continuity as a result of personnel turnover. A legal entity enables the working group to remain a single cohesive legal person despite personnel changes over time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A legal entity can express all the rules and values that Alliance working group members should exert, and can make these rules and values transparent to Lido DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A legal entity can give the Lido community explicit legally facilitated powers to influence the Alliance working group and program in various ways, such as by requiring Lido DAO approval for new Lido Allies and enabling Lido DAO to initiate removal of directors and co-approve new directors.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The formation of the Lido Alliance BORG also serves the approved GOOSE proposals <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590\">here</a> as updated with the approved <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/regoose-updated-goals-for-lido-in-the-light-of-mvi-and-restaking/7462\">ReGOOSE proposal</a> goals as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>By defining the “Community” served by the BORG broadly, to include not only Lido DAO but also stETH holders and node operators.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By emphasizing pro-decentralization/autonomy values in the “Principles” BORG personnel must use for decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By fostering the creation of alliances with other key players in the ETH ecosystem for a broader use of Lido staking systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By including a “Guardian” role on the BORG multisig that is focused on security.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17171-implementation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17171-implementation-4\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Lido Alliance BORG is an exempted limited guarantee foundation company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The BORG does not have any members or beneficiaries, but rather is governed by a relatively change-resistant ruleset embodied in its legal documents (see <a>here</a>) and the associated multisig smart contracts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cayman foundation companies are a popular choice for DAO wrappers, protocol ‘foundations,’ and other crypto-/DeFi-/web3-related entities. The same features that make such entities useful in those contexts also render them suitable for a DAO-adjacent BORG such as the Lido Alliance Program, i.e.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tax-free status within the Cayman Islands;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Memberless” structure so that the entity need not be ‘owned’ by any person(s) and can therefore be operated for non-profit, community-aligned purposes;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Limited liability for managers and service providers of the entity (except in the event of fraud, crime, or the knowing and intentional breach of the entity’s rules or applicable laws);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Governance customizability capable of accommodating novel smart-contract-based rules and mechanisms; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A jurisdiction with a longstanding commitment to fostering digital asset endeavors and an ecosystem of law firms and other service providers deeply embedded in the crypto ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Lido Alliance BORG is requesting an initial budget of $125,000 for 2024, as part of the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/egg-st2024-v2-continuity-grant-funding-to-achieve-goose-goals/\">st2024 v2 EGG </a>request approved in July and is expected to require a yearly budget of $250,000 from 2025 to operate, which will be requested through subsequent EGG requests. The budget includes director fees, local law firm fees, contributor compensation and any other operational expenses, following the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ecosystem-grants-grequest-egg-a-budget-request-framework-in-the-service-of-goose/\">EGG budget requests framework</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Board of Directors of the BORG is responsible for running all aspects of the Lido Alliance program and is in charge of the BORG overall. The Directors must sit on all multisigs of the BORG. The initial Directors of the BORG would initially be <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/adcv\">@adcv</a> and dsm of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/steakhouse\">@steakhouse</a>. Any future Directors would be approved by Lido DAO and the Board. An individual Director can be removed either by the Board itself or by Lido DAO. An individual Director may also unilaterally resign.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Guardians of the BORG are additional members of the BORG’s multisigs appointed by the Board. They generally should follow the Board’s instructions but may refuse to sign a multisig transaction based on security or compliance considerations. The initial Guardians of the BORG would be shik_happens, mac3w, jenya_k, olga_k, alex_l</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All Lido Allies must be approved by the Board and Lido DAO, and the BORG would hold all tokens contributed by Lido Allies in the Alliance Multisigs, which will (at minimum) be 4/7 multisigs consisting of the Directors and the Guardians. Lido DAO’s co-approval is required for all usages of the Lido-Ally-contributed tokens as a security measure–this requirement is initially imposed by virtue of the BORG’s Bylaws, and Lido contributors and MetaLeX hope to create additional onchain enforcement of these rules as well, though the technical ability to do so may vary from chain to chain. The addresses and other details of all Alliance Multisigs must be published by the BORG for the Lido community. Operational funds would be held separately at the discretion of the Board and are currently expected to be held in 3/5 multisigs (also using EasyTrack on a quarterly schedule). Mentioned EasyTrack set is requested to be added with a following configuration for the operational multisig:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>AllowedTokensRegistry:<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4AC40c34f8992bb1e5E856A448792158022551ca\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> 0x4AC40c34f8992bb1e5E856A448792158022551ca</a></li>\n<li>TopUpAllowedRecipients: (address TBD)</li>\n<li>AllowedRecipientsRegistry: (address TBD):\n<ul>\n<li>allowedRecipients: 0x606f77BF3dd6Ed9790D9771C7003f269a385D942 (ops MS address);</li>\n<li>limit: 250,000 * 10^18 (i.e. $250K);</li>\n<li>periodDurationMonths: 3</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The permitted purposes of the BORG are to further the Lido Alliance Program as it was approved by Lido DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The BORG Personnel (including the Directors and Guardians) do not owe any direct duties to Lido DAO or Lido community members, but owe duties to the BORG entity, and the BORG entity’s purposes are restricted to fulfilling the Lido Alliance Program, which benefits the Lido DAO and broader Lido community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alliance Multisig Members have obligations to identify material conflicts of interest and, in certain circumstances, disclose them to the Lido community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lido DAO approval would be required for any liquidation of the entity or any amendment of the entity’s documents that adversely affect the Lido community or any sub-constituency thereof.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The BORG has a ‘supervisor’, which is a statutory role in the Caymans intended to monitor a foundation company’s compliance with the entity’s own rules. The initial supervisor, intended to be temporary, is MetaLeX Pro LLC, the same law firm that led the creation of the BORG in consultation with various Lido contributors. This role is currently un-compensated and MetaLeX has committed to perform the role without additional compensation for up to three months. The final supervisor is expected to be a “Lido OpsBORG” or similar entity, which is currently in ideation phase and will be separately proposed to Lido DAO once various details are finalized.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If an “Adverse Event” occurs, Lido DAO may directly appoint an “Emergency Supervisor” for the BORG. “Adverse Event” is defined to include egregious violations of law or the BORG’s own rules by the BORG or BORG Personnel in connection with the BORG’s activities, certain crimes independently committed by BORG Personnel (whether or not related to the BORG’s activities), and sustained deadlocks within the BORG’s governance/decision-making. The Emergency Supervisor would have broad powers under the BORG’s Bylaws and Caymans law, including the power to investigate the Adverse Event, bring lawsuits against BORG personnel in the name of the BORG and to remove and appoint Directors. The Emergency Supervisor role is intended to be temporary and the Emergency Supervisor must resign once the Adverse Event is handled or, in any event, the Emergency Supervisor’s tenure is automatically terminated after 12 months if not renewed by Lido DAO. Lido DAO also has the power to directly set the compensation of Emergency Supervisors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The BORG Personnel are indemnified by the BORG entity, within certain customary limits. This indemnification would be paid solely out of operating funds and not any of the Lido-Ally-contributed assets, unless Lido DAO approves to use additional funds of the BORG to indemnify the BORG personnel who acted on behalf of the BORG.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The BORG Personnel would not have personal liability to the BORG for their BORG-related activities except to the extent they engage in gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The BORG Personnel must satisfy various eligibility criteria including not being subject to sanctions, not having previous egregious criminal convictions, and being reasonably sophisticated regarding blockchain technologies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17171-additional-reading-references-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17171-additional-reading-references-5\"></a>Additional Reading / References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/publicDocs/tree/main/Lido-Alliance-BORG/coreDocs/coreDocs-08-20-24/pdfs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido Alliance BORG Bylaws, Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-alliance-an-ethereum-aligned-ecosystem/7475\">Proposal for Lido Alliance: An Ethereum-Aligned Ecosystem</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delphi Labs, <a href=\"https://delphilabs.medium.com/assimilating-the-borg-a-new-cryptolegal-framework-for-dao-adjacent-entities-569e54a43f83\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Assimilating the BORG</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://metalex.substack.com/p/the-metalex-whitepaper\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MetaleX Whitepaper</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://lawcom.gov.uk/project/decentralised-autonomous-organisations-daos\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UK Law Commission Scoping Paper on DAOs</a> (covering DAO-adjacent BORGs in substantial detail)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17171-voting-discussion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17171-voting-discussion-6\"></a>Voting &amp; Discussion</h2>\n<p>Note: The Lido Alliance program has already been approved by the Lido DAO.

Since early 2023, I have been a Lido token holder and a self-proclaimed Lido Ambassador on X and actively participated in several voting proposals within the Lido DAO.<br>\n<strong>Experience:</strong><br>\nI helped over 400 Dapps and EVM/non-EVM chains launch their token/cross-chain bridges during the peak of 2022. Additionally, an effort secured over $200 million in TVL for the protocol, despite the challenging market conditions of 2023.<br>\nInitiated the creation of a user-friendly support portal with an intuitive guide and ticket-based system on Zendesk, serving 3,000 daily users.<br>\nLastly, experience working on several DAO grant proposals in many crypto ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation &amp; Approach:</strong></p>\n<p>Lido is one of the most critical, irreplaceable component of Ethereum and DeFi, I understand the importance of reGoose 2024, especially in decentralized governance and the robustness of the protocol &amp; Ethereum-aligned. As a DAO participant, I’ve observed that past proposals are often voted on by a small group of familiar voters, which can create a perception of centralization and potential legal risks.<br>\nAs a token holder, I recognize the need for the Lido protocol to maintain stability for long-term success. I aim to represent the voices of token holders in the Lido DAO forum to promote an inclusive atmosphere.</p>\n<p>My approach involves engaging with token holders whenever possible to understand their motivations and represent their interests in Lido DAO discussions and future proposals that align with Lido’s Vibe. I will leverage my expertise in the cross-chain/interoperability field and ecosystem building to provide insights on implementing stETH across Layer 2 solutions and other chains. I aspire to serve as a point of contact and provide insightful feedback on future proposals.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, With my background in building interoperable protocols and experience in risk management through several past incidents, I believe I can significantly contribute to Lido DAO’s decentralization efforts.<br>\nTogether, we can keep Ethereum decentralized, accessible to all and resistant to censorship.</p>\n<p><strong>Proof of Participation in Lido DAO Voting Since 2023</strong>:<br>\nMy participation in 12 proposals can be viewed on my voting profile: Snapshot Voting Profile.<br>\n<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/profile/0x61Cc8f06F3B6e1a3Fba28CbEbc4c89304b1187D1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a></p>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance:</strong> I accept Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct (<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link 4</a>) and Aligned with `<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, Vision) 2</a></p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures:</strong> I own LDO</p>\n<p><strong>Waiver of Liability</strong> By delegating to me, you acknowledge and agree that I participate on a best-efforts basis and will not be held liable for any potential damages arising from participation in the Lido Protocol or this DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/mog-delegate-thread/8164\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/mog-delegate-thread/8164","pubDate":"Tue, 20 Aug 2024 13:18:09 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-8164"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/mog-delegate-thread/8164.rss","#text":"Mog -Delegate Thread"}},{"title":"Galaxy Infra - Aug 2024","dc:creator":"yorickdowne","category":"Node Operators","description":"<p>Our semi-regular updates on what we are up to with our infra</p>\n<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>\n<p>One of the Netherminds has been replaced with Reth.

My expertise is in staking, home node operations / solo staking, mechanism design, infrastructure and decentralization.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lido is an extremely important project for Ethereum. Lido’s focus, vision and execution has turned it into the single biggest controller of staked ETH. It’s easy to see how there are many decisions, by action or inaction, that are possible for Lido to take, that will shape both projects and protocol.</li>\n<li>Decentralized Governance is powerful, and can dangerous: governance attacks are happening due to plain token voting, unchecked processes and community apathy. Lido’s delegation approach is an important step to ensure that such an important project for Ethereum is governed properly while still following DAO principles.</li>\n<li>Considering my mission to protect and shape Ethereum to the best of my abilities, and the possibility of helping Lido take the right paths, and that the path of Lido is deeply entrenched with Ethereum’s future, I feel deeply compelled to give my best to steer Lido according to what I believe are the right values (see next section).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Values and Decision-Making Approach</strong> (Core Values, Decision-Making Process)<br>\nLido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, and Vision) asserts that Lido pursues the decentralization of Ethereum (understood as the coordination and value layer of the internet) by making staking simple, secure, and decentralized. This Vibe perfectly aligns with my values and the work I’ve been dedicated to for the past five years.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Decentralization focus</strong> Decentralization is a key component of what I value about Ethereum. But, what do I mean with Decentralization?<br>\nDecentralization is a spectrum where different desirable properties emerge. Such properties are resilience to government capture, boycott, censorship, zero-day exploits, power grid failures and other geographically bounded events… It is these properties which turn Ethereum into a desirable platform for running unstoppable applications (or becoming the co-ordination and value layer of the internet, as written in the Vibe)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Balancing Stakeholder Interests:</strong> When the interests of different stakeholders conflict, I will always anchor my decisions in Lido’s Vibe, which aligns with the broader mission of Ethereum’s decentralization. I believe that decisions should benefit both Lido and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. For example, if a proposal offers short-term gains for one group but could harm the long-term decentralization of Ethereum, I would lean towards a decision that prioritizes long-term, sustainable decentralization, ensuring that Lido remains aligned with its core mission. Should the mission change, I would consider my mandate as changed too and I would have to reevaluate whether I am the most appropriate person to pursue it and defend it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Leveraging Expertise in Staking and Infrastructure:</strong> Given my expertise in staking and decentralized infrastructure, I am well-positioned to contribute to Lido’s roadmap. I consult and draw from teams, facilitate strategic partnerships, and provide in-depth analysis of proposals related to staking and infrastructure. My experience with Dappnode in building a decentralized network of node runners will be invaluable in helping Lido become a stronger decentralizing force for Ethereum. I am committed to using this expertise to ensure that Lido’s infrastructure and governance practices contribute to a more robust and decentralized Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance</strong>:  I, Pol Lanski, accept the Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct (<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\">link</a>) and Aligned with <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\">Lido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, Vision)</a></p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures</strong>:<br>\nI am the project lead at Dappnode, who has received funding from LEGO grants.

My journey into staking began as a solo staker, driven by a deep interest in Ethereum and helping improve its decentralization. Over time, I recognized the limitations of solo staking—such as the lack of liquidity and flexibility—and switched to staking via stETH. This gave me a firsthand appreciation of the value that Lido brings to the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Driven by a desire to contribute more directly to Lido’s mission, I became a Lido Operator for the DVT router with <a href=\"https://ssv.network\">SSV</a>, where I’ve focused on increasing client diversity by adopting minority clients like <a href=\"https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth\">Reth</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2\">Nimbus</a> while maintaining exceptional performance.</p>\n<p>My goal is to push the limits of innovation in the staking ecosystem, not only by enhancing the security and resilience of Lido’s infrastructure but also by ensuring that Lido continues to set the standard as the premier, user-focused staking experience.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17106-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17106-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Ethereum is constantly evolving—there are ongoing proposals that would radically shift the staking landscape and greatly affect Lido: <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/sticking-to-8192-signatures-per-slot-post-ssf-how-and-why/17989\">SSF</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/increase-the-max-effective-balance-a-modest-proposal/15801/46\">Max EB</a>, <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/electra-issuance-curve-adjustment-proposal/18825\">MVI Adjustments</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353\">Preconfs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJLERWmQ2uw\">MCP</a>—just to name a few. This is a critical juncture in Lido’s timeline, and navigating these changes effectively will be pivotal to ensuring the protocol’s long-term success. Understanding these technical shifts is essential for making informed decisions that secure Lido’s future.</p>\n<p>As a Lido DAO delegate, I aim to leverage my experience as a developer and staker to navigate these challenges effectively. My goal is to ensure Lido remains a leader in staking, balancing innovation with stability, and making decisions that benefit both the protocol and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17106-values-and-decision-making-approach-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17106-values-and-decision-making-approach-3\"></a>Values and Decision-Making Approach</h2>\n<p>My approach to governance is guided by the following core values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Technical Excellence:</strong> I prioritize decisions that advance Lido’s technical infrastructure to <em>enhance security, scalability, and user experience</em>. My focus is on ensuring that Lido continues to lead in client diversity and protocol security while maintaining a robust and resilient staking environment, ultimately supporting the long-term success of the protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Holistic Perspective:</strong> My combined experience as a staker, operator, and developer provides a unique viewpoint on the ecosystem. This allows me to consider the needs and impacts on all participants, ensuring balanced and informed decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pragmatism and Integrity:</strong> I aim to balance forward-thinking innovation with practical, long-term solutions. My decisions will always prioritize the best interests of the protocol and its stakeholders, guided by a commitment to transparency and rationality.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17106-public-acceptance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17106-public-acceptance-4\"></a>Public Acceptance</h2>\n<p>I accept Lido DAO delegate <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\">Сode of Сonduct</a> and am fully aligned with Lido’s <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\">Purpose, Mission, and Vision</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17106-disclosures-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17106-disclosures-5\"></a>Disclosures</h2>\n<p>I work for <a href=\"https://x.com/succinctlabs\">Succinct</a>, a company specializing in zero-knowledge.

Additionally, they face external challenges like regulatory uncertainty.</p>\n<p>I believe in a decentralized future, even if it seems naive. However, the current state of crypto is plagued by misaligned incentives that prioritize short-term speculative gains over the core DeFi values of self-sovereignty and custody.</p>\n<p>Equally concerning is the trend of McKinsification in DAOs, where decisions are increasingly made by one or two professional consultant delegates. This discourages individual participation, as their opinions and votes have less impact.</p>\n<p>To make DeFi DAOs viable, we must align incentives to encourage active participation in governance from the broader crypto community.</p>\n<p>I see potential in Lido DAO’s incentivized delegation approach. It creates career opportunities for individual delegates while strengthening and decentralizing DAOs, making them less prone to corruption.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17092-values-and-decision-making-approach-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17092-values-and-decision-making-approach-4\"></a>Values and Decision-Making Approach</h2>\n<p>Community must be at the core of every DAO.</p>\n<p>Without giving the community a say in protocol governance, we’re no better than the Web2 companies we aim to replace—companies that view their “community” merely as users to extract value from.</p>\n<p>I will support initiatives that align token holders with the protocol, such as revenue sharing or other methods to bring value to the token.</p>\n<p>Token holders are frustrated with exploitative tokenomics that only benefit early insiders who acquired tokens at much lower prices, leaving no upside for new investors. Without incentives to buy and hold tokens, the attractiveness and health of DAOs decline.</p>\n<p>Finally, I will highlight key votes and decisions of the DAO on X and my blog, as I believe the general public is often unaware of important actions being taken.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17092-public-acceptance-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17092-public-acceptance-5\"></a>Public Acceptance</h2>\n<p>I accept Lido’s Public Delegate Code of Conduct and our Public Delegate Platform signals my alignment with the mission, vision, and purpose of Lido DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17092-disclosures-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17092-disclosures-6\"></a>Disclosures</h2>\n<p>I am the co-founder of Pink Brains at https:// pinkbrains. io, a DeFi creator studio dedicated to promoting DeFi projects through educational content.

Wintermute was founded in July 2017 by three Optiver veterans. Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO, was previously head of ETFs (screen and OTC) at Optiver Europe, one of the largest ETF market-making desks. Since our inception, we have traded over $4.9T USD in volume and expanded our presence across 80+ (de)centralised exchanges and various (non)EVM chains, continuously supporting the ecosystem for our partners and their communities.</p>\n<p>Alongside our trading arm, Wintermute Ventures and Wintermute Governance support and work with leading crypto projects &amp; DAOs with the goal of truly adding value, enabling partnerships, and helping shape a positive outcome for the ecosystem. We’re eager to bring our DeFi, Institutional, and Governance expertise to the Lido DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17086-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17086-motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>At Wintermute, we believe that a decentralized world needs robust and progressive governance systems. Our goal is to support DAOs along their journey towards such a state through objective, long-term value-add decision-making.</p>\n<p>We’ve been an active voter in Lido for some time now and have witnessed first hand the DAO struggle with voter apathy and in a few cases failure to meet quorum on important votes. Our Public Delegate Platform serves as our commitment to maintaining high voting participation and providing valuable feedback where necessary based on our expertise, ensuring we have a direct impact on improving governance efficiency.</p>\n<p>The DAO has a clear vision and talented service providers/contributors and our goal as a delegate is to ensure the former and empower the latter.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17086-values-and-decision-making-approach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17086-values-and-decision-making-approach-6\"></a>Values and Decision-Making Approach</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17086-long-term-value-creation-over-short-term-opportunism-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17086-long-term-value-creation-over-short-term-opportunism-7\"></a>Long-term value creation over short-term opportunism.</h3>\n<p>For example, we do not support short-term rent-seeking token distribution programs; or the redistribution of tokens that carry no positive second-order effects.</p>\n<p>In contrast, we do support and encourage purpose-driven mechanisms that incentivize positive behaviour and are value-maximizing; or that improve alignment between token holders and the protocol.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17086-transparency-alignment-and-proactivity-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17086-transparency-alignment-and-proactivity-8\"></a>Transparency, alignment, and proactivity.</h3>\n<p>We are proactive in providing clear and consistent reasoning behind our decision-making and proposals, ensuring the protocol’s sustainability is at the heart of all governance discussions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17086-objective-data-driven-decision-making-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17086-objective-data-driven-decision-making-9\"></a>Objective data-driven decision-making.</h3>\n<p>We use data and research to ensure our final decision is objectively value-accretive for the protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17086-public-acceptance-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17086-public-acceptance-10\"></a>Public Acceptance</h2>\n<p>We accept Lido’s <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Public Delegate Code of Conduct</a> and our Public Delegate Platform signals our alignment with the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-vibe-alignment-purpose-mission-vision/4380\">mission, vision, and purpose of Lido DAO</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17086-disclosures-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17086-disclosures-11\"></a>Disclosures</h2>\n<p>Wintermute participates in various DAOs across the DeFi ecosystem including dYdX, Optimism, Arbitrum, Aave, Compound, Uniswap, and other smaller DAOs.
