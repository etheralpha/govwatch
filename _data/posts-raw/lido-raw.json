I have been participating on all stages of the Aave DAO, from inception to a relatively good maturity at the current moment. Also, I contributed to the majority of the DAO verticals: from high-level discussions regarding DAO strategy and decentralisation, to low level implementation, passing through all types of operational aspects.<br>\nMy profile on the Aave governance forum is <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/eboado\">THIS</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I have important technical expertise in DeFi, governance systems and, in general, everything blockchain related. That means that 1) my opinions and decisions will have a rational base and 2) probably I can give meaningful operation feedback regarding both procedures and technology surrounding Lido.<br>\nAmongst others, on BGD Labs we created the Aave Governance v3 system, currently powering on-chain the Aave DAO. Also, we developed a.DI, bridging infrastructure <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/network-expansion-workgroup-initiative-governance-decision-forwarding-to-non-l2-networks-lip-24/7446\">currently used by Lido</a> to forward governance decisions to non-Ethereum networks.<br>\nFinally, we have an active role reviewing the majority of all proposals created on the Aave governance, and designed all tooling and procedures surrounding them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My main interest for participating in the program is because I’m aware of the good values of the Lido contributors I interacted with: aside from high technical competence, I perceive a clear focus within Lido on evolving its ecosystem in a way that benefits not only Lido as expected, but the industry itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I believe I am a very neutral party: I like the ethos and approach of Lido and even if I see no reason for that to happen, if I perceive clear derailing from them in the future, will stop being a delegate. Same time, I will not compromise my neutrality by participating in anything going clearly against Lido DAO’s interests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lastly, I compromise to seriously participate on the governance processes of Lido, including voting itself, but also discussions in this forum and providing rationales about my voting.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17009-public-acceptance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17009-public-acceptance-4\"></a>Public acceptance</h2>\n<p>I accept Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct (<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\">link</a>) and Aligned with <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\">Lido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, Vision)</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17009-disclosures-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17009-disclosures-5\"></a>Disclosures</h2>\n<p>Through BGD Labs, I’m currently an active contractual contributor to the Aave ecosystem, which should not create any type of conflict, as Aave and Lido have been pretty close partners since the very beginning.<br>\nAdditionally, I own $AAVE and other assets, but that should not have any type of influence in my Lido participation.<br>\nI expect that specific technical Lido contributors review the contents of governance proposals, and I assume no liability if those contents create damage I was not aware of.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/eboadom-delegate-thread/8079\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/eboadom-delegate-thread/8079","pubDate":"Wed, 14 Aug 2024 11:11:34 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-8079"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/eboadom-delegate-thread/8079.rss","#text":"Eboadom Delegate Thread"}},{"title":"Idea of Solo Staking Loyalty Points (SSLP)","dc:creator":"nana","category":"General","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-17002-abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17002-abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This post focuses on the issue of solo stakers quitting staking and joining Staking Service Providers (SSPs) as liquidity and cost structures improve through SSPs. As one of the solutions to a future where the staking market becomes centralized and imposes an inflation tax on users, we propose a community-based approach for solo stakers called Solo Staking Loyalty Points (SSLP) firming. Combining SSLP with the CSM module improves solo staker liquidity and reduces capital efficiency, adding an incentive for solo stakers to contribute honestly in the long term.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17002-problem-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17002-problem-2\"></a>Problem</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Solo stakers are under selection pressure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Delegated stakers may flatten the supply curve, inducing an upward trend in staking volume and forcing users to pay more costs than necessary. If the supply curve flattens, delegated stakers will be induced to take all by winners, and it may be more rational for solo stakers to transition to delegated stakers.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons for this situation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Benefit: Liquidity is improved by Liquid Staking Tokens (LST)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Endogenous yield y: The endogenous return obtained only by staking in consensus is the sum of issuance reward y_i and execution reward y_v (y_i + y_v).</li>\n<li>Exogenous yield y_c: The exogenous return from DeFi and restaking generated by LST has a total yield of y_c.</li>\n<li>Total yield Y: The sum of the staker’s total return introspective yield and exogenous return (y + y_c). Staking will not occur unless the total return Y (= y + y_c) is higher than a certain threshold Y_c at which there is a desire to lock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, assume that an ETH holder is willing to lock ETH when the total return Y exceeds 0.04. The situation in which a staker will lock the ETH they hold is:</p>\n<p>Y &gt; Y_c</p>\n<p>If we substitute 0.04 for Y_c:</p>\n<p>y + y_c &gt; 0.04</p>\n<p>This shows that the higher the value of y_c, the lower the introspective yield y_i required for staking can be, and vice versa.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Cost: The cost structure is simplified, including the reduction in capital efficiency (staking is possible even with less than 32 ETH) and long-term commitment.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial cost: The cost required at the start of staking. Generally, it includes technical skills, hardware, and collateral capital.</li>\n<li>Long-term cost: The long-term cost of protecting the locked ETH, the reduction in liquidity due to locking, taxes, and increased risk premium. This can also be seen as the time cost of updates, the high-speed line and data capacity for additional Internet connections, and the ongoing commitment of accurately exercising the protocol’s work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Long-term costs are likely to influence stakers’ ongoing decisions more than initial costs. Solo stakers bear all costs themselves. In the case of SSPs, the cost structure differs depending on the node operator and the participant (ETH holder).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSP node operators have a fixed cost for staking and receive a portion of the revenue earned by participants as a fee. In situations where costs are high and revenues are low, they can increase efficiency by reducing the number of nodes and increasing the number of validators on each node.</li>\n<li>Participants only delegate the amount of stake to the node operator, so there are no costs, but instead they pay a portion of the revenue as a fee. Since the issuance of LST does not affect the decrease in liquidity, the fees paid may not feel like a cost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this way, costs are equally borne by solo stakers and node operators, but the cost for users participating in SSPs is low. Since the barriers to solo staking are replaced by the SSP operator, users who use SSPs do not have a large increase in the costs required to make additional staking. In addition, if they can receive LST, liquidity increases, they can access additional yields, and there is no need for long-term commitments.</p>\n<p>As staking service providers simplify the staking experience (cost structure) and improve staking liquidity, the inequality Y &gt; Y_c’ becomes more likely to hold even if the introspective yield y becomes smaller.</p>\n<p>As a result, the amount of staked is induced to tend to increase, and more ETH than necessary is staked. The effect is that the protocol issues more rewards than necessary for security, forcing users to pay inflation taxes. Also, in a world where a lot of ETH is staked, solo stakers who do not have access to the exogenous yield y_c are at an even greater disadvantage.</p>\n<p>It is important for Ethereum to consider maintaining solo stakers, as they contribute greatly to the censorship resistance of the network.</p>\n<p>The community is discussing <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cut Issuance</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/dr-changestuff-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-mev-burn/17384\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MEV-burn</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/unbundling-staking-towards-rainbow-staking/18683\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Rainbow Staking</a>, and other ideas that target MVI. I am optimistic about these ideas, but there are complex tradeoffs, so in the short term I would like to look at simple solutions such as Lido’s CSM and Smoothing Pool as well.</p>\n<p>Lido’s CSM module is designed to significantly lower the node operation profitability and entry barrier for individual stakers by depositing about 2 ETH as collateral to Lido on Ethereum after creating the deposit data, and 32 ETH is assigned to the deposit key.</p>\n<p>At this time, the profits from node operation are distributed equally among validators who participated in attestations a certain threshold number of times according to the number of validators who operate each person’s rewards. In other words, it is likely that rewards earned by Curated Modules (36 professional node operators commissioned by Lido, such as Kiln) through MEV maximization, etc., are often returned to CSM participants. Thanks to this mechanism, even individual stakers can earn greater profits than with an individual 32 ETH stake.</p>\n<p>As a result, the CSM module opens the path to validators to more potential individual stakers, bringing decentralization and diversity to LoE validators. Solo Staking Loyalty Points (SSLP) firming is an additional idea based on CSM, and its purpose is to further contribute to the maintenance of solo stakers. In the short term, increasing the number of solo stakers through mechanisms such as the CSM module is important for improving the censorship resistance of the network.</p>\n<p>So, in addition to the MEV Smoothing pool mechanism such as the CSM module, I would like to consider ideas to incentivize solo stakers to behave honestly for a long time.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17002-so-what-to-do-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17002-so-what-to-do-3\"></a>So what to do?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Pointize access to variable rewards (MEV + Fee)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Solo stakers earn Loyalty Points. Points should measure the period a solo staker has been active and the validity of their attestations.</p>\n<p>Points accumulate over specific periods and are transferable. Points can be exchanged for variable rewards. However, the number of SSLPs earned increases in proportion to the length of time active. 1 month → 10 points, 2 months → 12.5 points, 3 months → 15 points…, n.</p>\n<p>The exchange of pooled variable rewards for points is designed with a base exchange rate called the pool base reward, and a weighting that increases proportionally to the number of points held. This provides an additional incentive for solo stakers to contribute to the network for a long time and continue earning SSLPs. Example: 10 points → pool base reward * 1, 20 points → pool base reward * 1.1, 30 points → pool base reward * 1.2,…n.</p>\n<p>These two simple mechanisms - awarding points for long-term honest behavior and increasing the access rate to variable rewards based on the number of points held - create a system where solo stakers can earn higher profits/year by contributing honestly to the network for a long time, accumulating points, and exchanging a large number of points for variable rewards at once, rather than accumulating points in a short period to access variable rewards.</p>\n<p>A simple prediction is that demand for trading points themselves may emerge. Solo stakers who want to earn variable rewards in the short term might be able to earn higher rewards than the pool base reward by exchanging points for tokens in the market, rather than exchanging points for variable rewards. Point buyers have an incentive to collect points, as the weighting of the exchange rate increases as they accumulate points.</p>\n<p>Increasing the incentive to earn points may lead to a tendency to become solo stakers and collect points.</p>\n<p>Overall, the point mechanism offers the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved liquidity: While solo staking cannot improve liquidity like LSTs, points may have a similar effect.</li>\n<li>Cost improvement: By integrating with the CSM module, solo staking becomes possible with 2ETH, lowering the capital requirements for short-term costs.</li>\n<li>Compatibility with the roadmap: As an additional idea, receiving SBTs along with SSLPs from the protocol to identify solo stakers could be beneficial, as it may allow for preferential treatment for solo stakers from consensus in the medium to long term.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By incorporating a point mechanism into the CSM module in this way, liquidity can be improved and the cost structure can be enhanced, which may lead to an increase in solo stakers. The only barrier to becoming a solo staker will be the long-term cost.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17002-concerns-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17002-concerns-4\"></a>Concerns</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>At what rate will points be awarded?</li>\n<li>How will the pool base reward be calculated when exchanging for variable rewards?</li>\n<li>How will the pool base reward be weighted by points?</li>\n<li>Can it really increase the execution reward y_v of solo stakers?</li>\n<li>Will it really be exchanged in the market at a higher price than the pool base reward?</li>\n<li>Can solo stakers using CSM truly fulfill their role as solo stakers?

I am an <a href=\"https://people.ucd.ie/paul.dylan-ennis\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">academic</a> with a research specialism in Ethereum protocol governance. I have written a book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Absolute-Essentials-Ethereum-Business-Economics/dp/1032334185\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Absolute Essentials of Ethereum</a> and a number of <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=rbkT1JgAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">academic articles</a> on Ethereum and Bitcoin culture. I teach the first Ethereum-only module at University level, called <a href=\"https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=MODULE&amp;MODULE=MIS41220\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Ethereum Ecosystem</a>. However, most of you probably know me as the author of a number of <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/author/dr-paul-j-dylan-ennis/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CoinDesk Opinion</a> columns on Ethereum culture and values.</p>\n<p>Ethereum address/ENS: 0x1f76a6Bf03429480472B3695E08689219cE15ED6</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Of all the DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem, my sense is that Lido DAO is the one that needs the most careful consideration of its proposals given the large amount of ETH staked with the protocol. In recent years, we have seen a certain professionalism of the DAO delegate role that I think has likely helped in terms of efficiency and participation. However, in this particular case, I believe it is important to be a delegate with few obligations elsewhere (I am a delegate for zkSync, but nowhere else). While I can’t promise you the polished documentation provided by professional DAO delegate operations, I can promise you my careful, cautious and well-researched assessment of proposals. I will bring to bear my academic mindset to consider proposals not just in terms of immediate concerns, but with Lido’s philosophy and Ethereum’s culture and history in mind. I also hope to use my experiences to teach Lido as an exemplary DAO in the classroom.</p>\n<p><strong>Values and Decision-Making Approach:</strong> My view is that Ethereum culture is ultimately undergirded by a commitment to cypherpunk values, which I consider to be decentralisation, permissionlessness, censorship resistance and credible neutrality. I consider these to be the lines that demarcate what is acceptable or not when it comes to Ethereum’s long term vision and that I have through my work a long history of defending their centrality. I will use these principles as a conceptual map in analysing any proposals and making decisions. I will always ensure my reasoning is clearly explained and contextualised and ensure that they are made in light of the ideas and not personalised or subjective. I believe this will be possible because as an academic I am afforded a certain freedom in terms of time to consider and think about these proposals.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance:</strong> I accept Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct (<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a>) and Aligned with <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, Vision)</a></p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures:</strong> None.

Our journey started with the belief that an open, inclusive ecosystem of digital money could change the world, little did we know that <em>programmable</em> money would be the leading candidate to doing this 13 years later.</p>\n<p>We are altcoin maximalists and we don’t believe there will be one coin to rule them all. But if there an ecosystem and the right philosophy to take over most daily use it Ether. Lido, is uniquely positioned, with stEth to <em>change the world</em> by allowing people to increase there returns and keep them liquid at the same time. This is just one aspect of Lido, but it is world changing and the economic tsunami of change that it will bring about over time. We want in.</p>\n<p><strong>Values and Decision-Making Approach</strong> (Core Values, Decision-Making Process)<br>\nWe have a team of 3 people an about half a dozen contractors that we use on an as-needed basis. We have an organized process which lays out our values, which can be summed up as: “The Network and its users come first”. We will always put network stability and milestones above our own month to month cost considerations, and we have established a reputation as reliable, long term minded partners and testnet operators. This is core to our culture.</p>\n<p>Our day to day operations are organized around this operating principle an core belief. Other long term goals are set by myself (Pablo) and the on-staff team is small and scrappy enought that daily communication and management of issues on a 1-1 basis is not just possible, but encouraged.</p>\n<p>FInally, our operating processes are well organized and testnets we are participating in are monotored 24/7 with response time under 30 minutes for major networ or operating incidents. We operate 24/7, 365 days a year.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance</strong>:  I Pablo Lema (Represnting <a href=\"http://NodeSoda.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">NodeSoda.com</a>) accept Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct (<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a>) and Aligned with <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, Vision)</a></p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures</strong>: We regularly work on other Ethereum network testnets and projects, mainly as infrastructure providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus: Past Projects</strong><br>\nNodeSoda’s experience extends beyond mainnets to a wide array of testnet environments, showcasing our adaptability and technical prowess:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Autonomys (Subspace) - Gemini 1-3:<br>\nValidator Address: st9JWnuSwUZRqqRo3eZ5fVvvHRnFhMBRy3bgCqsHW1exrTUec<br>\nParticipation: NodeSoda is actively engaged in the Autonomys Testnet, dedicating our expertise to ensure the network’s optimal performance and development.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quai Network (Paxos-2):<br>\nValidator Address: 0x7e3e40a4e3c9903e44794b32d9618994f855200f<br>\nParticipation: From our role as a validator in both Bronze Age and Iron Age testnets, NodeSoda has ascended to the elite “Node Wranglers” group.

The plan includes building the public platform, establishing a delegate incentivization program with a $150,000 fund, and organizing delegate rallies.

That comes with a natural rising interest in Lido, node running and staking boradly speaking—in fact some of the attendees already had experience and knew much of the topics beforehand. I learnt a lot myself from the arguments they were able to put together.</p>\n<p>Plus all the recent changes and narratives in the staking landscape (MVI, restaking, etc.) are very hot topics. There seemed to be rough consensus on the urgency/need of issuance targeting, and curiousity around restaking mechanics and opportunities for community stakers.</p>\n<p>It’s obvious to me that Lido must pay close attention to Argentina and keep supporting the rising community of stakers there, and in order to do that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I still stay in touch with some of the participants, some of whom have repeatedly expressed their willingness to eventually run nodes and participate in Lido CS initiatives.</li>\n<li>Continue supporting community-led projects, and open up new avenues for them to engage and contribute.<br>\nThis was a very good first engagement, followed by a community-led grant to build resources in Spanish and engage universities <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/seednode-lido/6641\" class=\"inline-onebox\">SEEDNode - Lido</a> and other leads coming our way, like the first Staking Day in Latam during Ethereum Argentina ‘24.</li>\n<li>Various institutions are exploring staking, and more now that regulatory clarity seems to be slowly appearing under Milei’s administration.

Commit-Boost has off-the-shelf monitoring and proactive tools to identify risks, limit the impact of bugs, and proactively alert teams when / if issues develop from opted-into validator services</li>\n<li>While Commit-Boost’s first use cases are commitments like preconfs, Commit-Boost is maximally neutral and does not limit innovation across the proposer commitment design space. It is proposer commitment agnostic, relay agnostic, transaction flow agnostic, commitment enforcement agnostic, etc. Nothing about Commit-Boost will limit stETH’s ability to be the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> collateral in the restaking market</li>\n<li>Commit-Boost is working with client teams, consultants, researchers, validators (including home stakers and sophisticated stakers), testing with operators in Holesky, helped stand-up devnets and persistent testnets for fast iteration, have a significant portion of the preconf teams already building modules on Commit-Boost, and been engaged with teams across the community who are eager to develop other validator services such as inclusion lists. To ensure Commit-Boost fits the needs of the Lido Community, we are keen to continue to expand this iteration / testing / feedback loop with the Lido Community, apply for a grant from the LidoDAO, and eventual consideration to be part of the Alliance</li>\n<li>In the design, development, sustainment, and governance around Commit-Boost, we have tried to embrace the values of the Lido Community and <a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/toward-an-open-research-and-development-process-for-mev-boost/464\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">previously voiced</a> by the broader community</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Background and What Risks Commit-Boost Addresses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to the call to actions outlined in ReGoose around validator services, most are starting to agree on a common denominator: in the future, beacon proposers will be presented with a broader set of options of what they may “commit\" to–be it inclusions lists or preconfs or other types of commitments such as long-dated blockspace futures–compared to just an external or local payload they see today</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/barnabe.eth/QJ6W0mmyOwjec-2zuH6lZb0iEI2aYFB9gE-LHWIMzjQ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">post</a> from Barnabe captures this well; during block construction, the validator “…creates the specs, or the template, by which the resulting block must be created, and the builders engaged by the proposer are tasked with delivering the block according to its specifications”</li>\n<li>While this all seems great, the challenge is that many teams building commitments are creating new sidecars driving fragmentation and risks for Ethereum and the Lido operator set</li>\n<li>For Ethereum, there are going to be significant challenges and increased risks during upgrades if there are a handful of sidecars that validators are running</li>\n<li>For validators, these risks potentially take us to a world where proposers will need to make decisions on which teams to “bet on” and which sidecars they will need to run to participate in what those teams are offering</li>\n<li>For homestakers, this is difficult and they likely will be unable to participate in more than one of these commitments</li>\n<li>For sophisticated actors, this increases the attack vector and operational complexity as more and more sidecars are required to be run</li>\n<li>Another side effect of this is validators are somewhat locked into using a specific sidecar due to limited operational capacity and the switching costs of running a different sidecar (i.e., vendor lock-in). The higher the switching costs, the more embedded network effects could become if these sidecars only support certain downstream actors / proposer commitment protocols</li>\n<li>This also could create a dynamic where core out-of-protocol infrastructure supporting Ethereum which should be a public good, starts being used for monetization, distribution, or other purposes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Commit-Boost Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Commit-Boost is a community-driven, open-source project developing an unopinionated validator platform to enable safe interactions with commitments. Some of its features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unification: Core devs will be able to interact and work with one standard during Ethereum forks / upgrades / when and if things go wrong</li>\n<li>Backward compatibility + more: Commit-Boost is not only backward compatible with MEV-Boost, but will improve the life of Lido operators who only run MEV-Boost through increased reporting, telemetry / other off-the-shelf tools validators can employ</li>\n<li>Opt-in without running more sidecars: Commit-Boost will allow proposers who want to opt into other commitments to do so without having to run multiple sidecars</li>\n<li>Tools and features to help reduce risks for Lido’s operator set: In the spirit of ReGOOSE, Commit-Boost is specifically designed with off-the-shelf monitoring and proactive tools to identify risks, limit the impact of bugs, and proactively alert teams of issues that may develop from validator services</li>\n<li>Robust support: Commit-Boost the software is supported by a not-for-profit entity. This team will be focused on security and robustness through policies and procedures with follow-the-sun type models where there is support 24/7 if / when things go wrong. This team will also be focused on testing and adjustments needed during hard forks and have a team to interact with to help during adoption, improvements, and sustainment</li>\n<li>Additional revenue: As part of the open innovation that Commit-Boost enables, potential validator services will continue to come online, to capture new revenue opportunities when making commitments</li>\n<li>Not VC-backed Public Good: This team and effort will not be VC-backed. There is no monetization plan. The entity will not sell itself and will not start any monetizable side businesses. As an example, the team is actively working on a grant application to the Lido Community, among other organizations across Ethereum</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Technical Roadmap</strong></p>\n<p>As noted in the Proposal section above, Commit-Boost is already live with an MVP product and heavily engaged with the broader community. We are continuing the development and feature set of Commit-Boost / onboarding new modules and targeting production-ready software and audits kicking off at the end of Q3. More details on the current roadmap are in the Commit-Boost <a href=\"https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client/issues\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">repo</a> and we are keen to get feedback from the Lido Community to prioritize and design features that would be required.</p>\n<p>Some near-term high-level highlights from the roadmap include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimized and functional MEV-Boost module including multiple metrics for reporting and extensions such as configurable timing for get_header / get_payload calls</li>\n<li>Pre-made dashboards on Grafana for all core services</li>\n<li>Improved reliability and integrations for incident response</li>\n<li>R&amp;D / spec signing mechanism to fit as many validator set-ups as possible</li>\n<li>Expanding modularity and optionality (i.e., supporting different types of signatures and modules)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>From the perspective of a Lido Operator</strong></p>\n<p>More details on what it takes to run Commit-Boost as a node operator can be found <a href=\"https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/get_started/overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. Please note that this has not been finalized and over the next few weeks we will be making updates (see roadmap / milestones above):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Commit-Boost client is a single sidecar that acts as a platform to interact with proposer commitment protocols</li>\n<li>Do not need to run multiple sidecars for new commitments</li>\n<li>Not backing one team building proposer commitment protocols letting open innovation happen at the protocol layer with low barriers for switching costs between commitment protocols for the Lido Operator</li>\n<li>No risk of monetization at the sidecar layer. Commit-Boost is a public good supported by a not-for-profit team focused solely on robust support, continued development, and sustainment of Commit-Boost</li>\n<li>Standardized way to provide a signature / opt into a commitment</li>\n<li>Helps monitor key attributes around that signature</li>\n<li>Creates constraints / condition sets and pass these constraints downstream</li>\n<li>Get insight into telemetry around the commitment flow and validator box that can be seen through dashboards such as a - Grafana</li>\n<li>Create bespoke process management logic to ensure safety when making commitments</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>From the Perspective of the Proposer Commitment Protocol</strong></p>\n<p>More details on what it takes to build a module / metrics can be found <a href=\"https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/category/developing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. Please note that this has not been finalized and over the next few weeks we will finalize moving parts that impact module creators (see roadmap / milestones above):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A modular platform to develop and distribute proposer commitments protocols</li>\n<li>A single API to interact with validators</li>\n<li>Support for hard-forks and new protocol requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Commit-Boost Design Principles</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built for validators: Platform that not only can help validators today (i.e., can improve the lives of validators even if they just run an MEV-Boost module) but allows validators to be ready for the market of tomorrow (i.e., preconfs, inclusion lists, etc)</li>\n<li>Neutrality: No opinions, the platform will be proposer commitment agnostic, relay agnostic, transaction flow agnostic, etc. The goal is to build a platform that doesn’t limit the design space downstream while reducing risks of fragmentation for validators and Ethereum</li>\n<li>Unified: Validators run one core sidecar with the ability to opt into many different commitments</li>\n<li>Safety: Open-source code developed with input by the community with community reviews / audits</li>\n<li>Reduce risks: Modularized and transparency are core to reducing risk / overhead for the proposer to manage commitments and their broader operational processes</li>\n<li>Values aligned: Public good with no plans for monetization. We will continuously ask ourselves: would Vitalik run Commit-Boost and can this be designed in a way to increase the decentralization of Ethereum block construction</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Architecture of Commit-Boost</strong></p>\n<p>More details can be found in the Commit-Boost <a href=\"https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documentation</a>. However, below is a schematic of Commit-Boost. It is important to note that the below depiction contains just a few examples of proposer commitment modules that can run on Commit-Boost. The design space for modules is completely open / not gated by the Commit-Boost software and proposers will be responsible for opting into the commitments they wish to subscribe to (i.e., a proposer is responsible for which modules they will subscribe to).</p>\n<p><strong>Terminology</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposer: entity, staking pool NoOp (i.e., Lido), or DVT cluster with the right to propose the next block</li>\n<li>Commitment: a constraint or condition that the proposer choses and agrees to via a signature</li>\n<li>Key Manager: some proposers use key managers or remote signers as part of their proposer / validator duties. Please note, that Commit-Boost is being designed in a way where it does not require validators to run key managers and working on solutions for monolithic set-ups</li>\n<li>Consensus Client: for example, Lighthouse or Teku (see <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Commitment Modules: community-built modules allowing proposers to make commitments, including some of the logic of the proposer commitment protocol</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Signer API: The signer API is one of the core components around Commit-Boost. This is used to provide signatures from the proposer to the proposer commitment protocol.

This will also allow for a bit of time for the market to play out, but via a public good, standardize the last mile of communication to help address the risks (discussed in the background section above) developing. Once the market does play out, and the community can observe some dynamics (the good and the bad), we can and should push for CL changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Robustness, Sustainability, and Security</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Commit-Boost is being developed as a fully open-source project with contributions from teams across the Ethereum tech stack including validators, client teams, relays, builders, consulting firms, researchers, and many others. This effort with input and support from these teams will help develop a robust product integrating many perspectives</li>\n<li>Commit-Boost will go through code reviews and audits once fully developed</li>\n<li>As noted below, there also will be a full-time team that helps maintain and upgrade the software with their core focus on 100% uptime and when there are bugs, robust processes to quickly address and fix</li>\n<li>The software stack is also built with the validator at the core and includes off-the-shelf tools for monitoring as well as reducing and proactively addressing any risks that may arise</li>\n<li>Last, this public good software will have minimal, but critical open governance around future upgrades with input across the Ethereum</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Team Supporting / Governance of Commit-Boost Software</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entity supporting the software: Not-for-profit entity</li>\n<li>Multiple-person team: Multiple devs that fully focus on transparency, sustainment / development, and research with an initial focus around Commit-Boost the software. Based on initial research we suspect this will cost $1m - $2m / year. This funding will largely be related to developer resources.\n<ul>\n<li>Transparency: Open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">repo</a> and governance calls (see below)</li>\n<li>Sustainment / Development: 24/7 follow-the-sun coverage and highly engaged with client teams around upgrades / early in getting testnet support</li>\n<li>Research: Helping with and being a resource for open-source research across the Ethereum staking roadmap</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Governance: This is still a WIP, but at a minimum will run a Commit-Boost, ACD-like calls (first one coming soon) to engage with stakeholders (would be great to have folks from the Lido Community involved) and drive consensus on upgrades / help coordinate around hard forks. A credibly neutral community member will lead these calls / this process and has experience with running governance processes over critical software within the Ethereum community</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reducing risks for Ethereum and the Lido Community</strong></p>\n<p>We are excited to present this effort to the Lido Community and believe the structure, design, and goals directly address key risks developing within Ethereum and for validators. We also see that it not only aligns with the Lido Community but also of the broader Ethereum community. We are excited with the opportunity to potentially be part of and directly work with the Lido Community to support a neutral platform.</p>\n<p>We look forward to feedback and engagement from the Lido Community and their consideration of this proposal.

This feature prevents proposers from participating in a “race to zero-margin”. By registering exclusively with relays that support the MEV Protect feature (currently just the bloXroute relays for the POC) and opting in to the Proposer MEV Protect feature, the proposer is guaranteed to only receive blocks where they receive over 80% of the block profit. Builders are alerted they can not submit blocks for these slots unless over 80% of the block profit goes to the proposer. The purpose of the POC is to determine the value added by feature, with larger block rewards. The goal is to get to 50K-100K pubkeys participating in the POC and we secured around 20K-30K already). We are hoping to get 20K Lido pubkeys to participate.</p>\n<p>To use this feature, the validator must exclusively be registered with bloXroute relays (until other relays support that feature) and set “proposer_mev_protect” to “true” as a query parameter in the relay URLs passed in to mev-boost as a startup argument.</p>\n<p><strong>Info</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Official documentation is available here: <a href=\"https://docs.bloxroute.com/apis/mev-solution/proposer-mev-protect\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Proposer MEV-Protect | bloXroute Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>URLs</strong></p>\n<p><em>Holesky</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proxy: <a href=\"http://54.164.127.218:18552/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://54.164.127.218:18552</a>?id=&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n<li>Relay: <a href=\"http://44.220.173.176:18550?id=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://44.220.173.176:18550?id=</a>&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Mainnet</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Max-profit relay: <a href=\"http://bloxroute.max-profit.blxrbdn.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://bloxroute.max-profit.blxrbdn.com</a>?id=&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n<li>Max-profit relay proxy: <a href=\"http://relay-proxy.blxrbdn.com:18550?id=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://relay-proxy.blxrbdn.com:18550?id=</a>&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n<li>Regulated relay: <a href=\"http://bloxroute.regulated.blxrbdn.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://bloxroute.regulated.blxrbdn.com</a>?id=&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n<li>Regulated relay proxy: <a href=\"http://relay-proxy.blxrbdn.com:18551?id=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">relay-proxy.blxrbdn.com:18551?id=</a>&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Meeting</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Meet call for interested node operators: Wednesday, July 31 · 19:00-20:00 UTC, <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/vgo-hmho-wcu\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://meet.google.com/vgo-hmho-wcu</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-proposer-mev-protect/7871\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-proposer-mev-protect/7871","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 20:26:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7871"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-proposer-mev-protect/7871.rss","#text":"Proposal: Proposer MEV Protect"}},{"title":"Proposal: BloXroute Relay proxy","dc:creator":"eric_bloxroute","category":"Proposals","description":"<p>Regarding using BloXroute relay proxies, we made a change to our architecture, where validators don’t need to run any local components, yet can still connect to a relay proxy. We now allow validators to use relay proxies in many regions throughout the world (US, EU, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, and Dublin) without having to run their own. These proxies communicate with the relay using gRPC, and are faster than communicating with the relay directly. Validators using relay proxies receive higher paying blocks than those who don’t, due to the validator being able to receive blocks built later in the slot because of the reduced builder-to-proposer latency. While the proxy appears as an additional relay, the backend relays are the two bloXroute relays that are approved by the Lido community.

Marketing activities (e.g. Twitter posts and perhaps spaces) will be held to promote delegation during this time.</li>\n<li><strong>Compiling the List of Eligible Delegates</strong><br>\nAfter the rally, a list of delegates eligible for incentivization within the pilot cycle will be compiled.<br>\n<strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong> be a part of a public delegate platform, and possess more than 2M LDO delegated in both Snapshot and Aragon (2M on Snapshot AND 2M on Aragon).</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluation and Incentives Disbursement</strong> - Delegates will be evaluated quarterly. The evaluation process will be transparent and will include assessments based on the following criteria:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Quantitative criteria</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vote Participation Rate</strong>: Delegates must participate in at least 70% of votes each quarter.</li>\n<li><strong>Number of Delegated Tokens</strong>: Delegates must maintain more than 2 million LDO tokens delegated on both Snapshot and Aragon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Qualitative criterion</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Participation in Proposal Discussions</strong>: Active involvement in discussions on proposals in the forum and other relevant platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The committee will assess the delegate’s fulfillment of key expectations (listed below).</p>\n<p>The committee’s evaluation will be publicly communicated on this forum. <strong>All participants meeting the criteria will receive equal shares of the allocated grants</strong> if not asked not to be paid at the delegate thread.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Expectations of Lido DAO Insetivized Delegate:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Representing Token Holders:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Read, analyze, ask questions, provide public feedback, and make decisions on Lido DAO proposals</li>\n<li>Ensure actions and decisions resonate with the interests of token holders and the community</li>\n<li>Ensure actions and decisions align with <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-vibe-alignment-purpose-mission-vision/4380\">Purpose, Mission, Vision</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Community Engagement and Transparency:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Spark and participate in discussions on forums, crypto Twitter, and other platforms.

A mandatory discussion and feedback 7 days period will follow before finalizing the decision.</p>\n<p>This final step ensures that any decision to exclude a delegate is transparent, deliberative, and open to community input, reinforcing the program’s commitment to fairness and accountability.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding Operations</strong><br>\nFor the pilot program, LEGO will fund a Delegate Oversight Committee after quarter evaluation, for continuous Delegate Incentivisation.</p>\n<p>This proposal will be suggested for approval by the Lido DAO via Snapshot vote. If accepted - $150,000 equivalent in LDO is to be transferred via Easy Track motion to the <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x12a43b049A7D330cB8aEAB5113032D18AE9a9030\">LEGO committee multisig</a> to be used as grants for delegates incentivization program during 01-SEP-2024 - 28-FEB-2025.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#conclusion-6\"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>In summary, this proposal aims to establish a robust framework for public delegate participation and incentivization within the Lido DAO. By creating an official public delegates platform and implementing a six-month Pilot Delegate Incentivization Program, we aim to increase active voting participation and improve the quality of discussions and feedback.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#next-steps-7\"></a><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Snapshot Vote</strong>: The proposal will be put to a Snapshot vote on July 25, if no objection from the community<br>\nIf passed:</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate Application Period</strong>: Applications for delegates will be open from August 2 to August 16.</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate Rally</strong>: The delegate rally will take place from August 19 to September 7.</li>\n<li><strong>Program Start</strong>: The first season of the incentivization program will commence on September 8.</li>\n<li><strong>First Quarter Incentives Distribution</strong>: Incentives for the first quarter of the pilot will be distributed from December 2 to December 8.</li>\n<li><strong>Second Quarter Incentives Distribution</strong>: Incentives for the second quarter of the pilot will be distributed from March 3 to March 7.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"qa-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#qa-8\"></a>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Can voters overwrite a delegate’s vote?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, a holder can always overwrite (mechanics allow tokenholder to change delegate vote after they cast it) a delegate’s vote if they have a different opinion. Even if they share the same opinion, they might overwrite to express personal support for a particular initiative.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is voting power only delegated to public delegates?</strong></p>\n<p>No, delegation is not limited to the public list. The public list and the list of compensated delegates are meant to guide those who need assistance choosing a delegate. You can delegate to yourself, a friend, or form a team and vote privately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Can the Committee automatically revoke voting power from a delegate?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no measure to automatically revoke voting power. All the committee can do is communicate and publicly announce if something is wrong with a delegate, whether they are inactive or behaving oddly. They do not have the authority to manage the tokens of a holder, including revoking delegation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What happens if a delegate who was removed for inactivity wants to return?</strong></p>\n<p>If a delegate is removed for not voting but becomes active again, we would welcome them back. Their previous removal does not prevent them from participating again if they resume their responsibilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How many delegates are expected to be in the incentivization program?</strong></p>\n<p>It is important to note that this is a personal estimate, as this is a pilot program and clarity will improve after its completion. However, it is anticipated that there will be approximately 4 to 6 delegates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Will the framework change in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, this is a pilot cycle, and there will certainly be opportunities to improve the framework based on the experience gained over six months. This is one reason for collaborating with the Agora team, as they are considered one of the strongest teams in user experience and governance in Web3.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>29 posts - 18 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/establish-a-public-delegate-platform-and-delegate-incentivization-program/7858\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/establish-a-public-delegate-platform-and-delegate-incentivization-program/7858","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 07:09:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7858"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/establish-a-public-delegate-platform-and-delegate-incentivization-program/7858.rss","#text":"Establish a Public Delegate Platform and Delegate Incentivization Program"}},{"title":"Rated Labs Replacement in the Oracle Set","dc:creator":"hhrated","category":"Node Operators","description":"<p>Rated Labs will be departing from the Lido oracle set, with the transition expected to occur in Q3 2024.

I am writing this post to provide more clarity to contributors of other projects who want to collaborate with Lido contributors and for the wider community to be able to cross-check if collaborations with protocols that claim collaborations with the DAO contributors are legit. Generally, those collaborations are listed on the <a href=\"https://lido.fi/lido-ecosystem\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Lido Ecosystem</a> page.</p>\n<p>In the attempt to create as safe as possible environment for community members and participants in DeFi, DAO contributors created primitives with a straightforward approach to collaborations.</p>\n<p>While security and technical compatibility practices are anchored and there is no flexibility, for community, alignment and usage metrics, most of the points should be covered but are not mandatory as it highly depends on the type or project in discussion.</p>\n<p>Please note these are unofficial guidelines for transparency and are not voted in by the DAO and are applicable for Protocol Relations Guild only.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#security-1\"></a><strong>Security</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thorough Security Audits:</strong> The project should have undergone comprehensive security audits by reputable firms. (For reference these are some of the auditing companies which Lido contributors have worked with and are considered high profile by the contributors: Statemind, Certora, Oxorio, ChainSecurity, SigmaPrime, Hexens, Trail of Bits, Halborn, and other similar reputable auditing companies). Any modification after the audit should be re-audited before it goes in the production.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparent Audit Reports:</strong> Audit reports should be publicly accessible and demonstrate a track record of addressing identified vulnerabilities promptly and effectively. Every smart contract needs to be verified on Etherscan (or similar block explorer where Etherscan is not present) and the code has to match the one from the commit hash mentioned in the latest audit report.</li>\n<li><strong>Strong Security Practices:</strong> Robust security measures should be in place for the minimization of risk and the effect in case of unwanted event. Where multisig is used as an admin role instead of a DAO, the signers should be transparent.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Bounties:</strong>(optional but highly recommended) Along with audits of the codebase, attractive bug bounty programs ensure that the code is regularly assessed by independent security professionals.
