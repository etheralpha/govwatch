This feature prevents proposers from participating in a “race to zero-margin”. By registering exclusively with relays that support the MEV Protect feature (currently just the bloXroute relays for the POC) and opting in to the Proposer MEV Protect feature, the proposer is guaranteed to only receive blocks where they receive over 80% of the block profit. Builders are alerted they can not submit blocks for these slots unless over 80% of the block profit goes to the proposer. The purpose of the POC is to determine the value added by feature, with larger block rewards. The goal is to get to 50K-100K pubkeys participating in the POC and we secured around 20K-30K already). We are hoping to get 20K Lido pubkeys to participate.</p>\n<p>To use this feature, the validator must exclusively be registered with bloXroute relays (until other relays support that feature) and set “proposer_mev_protect” to “true” as a query parameter in the relay URLs passed in to mev-boost as a startup argument.</p>\n<p><strong>Info</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Official documentation is available here: <a href=\"https://docs.bloxroute.com/apis/mev-solution/proposer-mev-protect\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Proposer MEV-Protect | bloXroute Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>URLs</strong></p>\n<p><em>Holesky</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proxy: <a href=\"http://54.164.127.218:18552/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://54.164.127.218:18552</a>?id=&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n<li>Relay: <a href=\"http://44.220.173.176:18550?id=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://44.220.173.176:18550?id=</a>&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Mainnet</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Max-profit relay: <a href=\"http://bloxroute.max-profit.blxrbdn.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://bloxroute.max-profit.blxrbdn.com</a>?id=&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n<li>Max-profit relay proxy: <a href=\"http://relay-proxy.blxrbdn.com:18550?id=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://relay-proxy.blxrbdn.com:18550?id=</a>&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n<li>Regulated relay: <a href=\"http://bloxroute.regulated.blxrbdn.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://bloxroute.regulated.blxrbdn.com</a>?id=&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n<li>Regulated relay proxy: <a href=\"http://relay-proxy.blxrbdn.com:18551?id=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">relay-proxy.blxrbdn.com:18551?id=</a>&amp;auth=&lt;AUTH CODE&gt;&amp;proposer_mev_protect=true</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Meeting</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Meet call for interested node operators: Wednesday, July 31 · 19:00-20:00 UTC, <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/vgo-hmho-wcu\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://meet.google.com/vgo-hmho-wcu</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-proposer-mev-protect/7871\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-proposer-mev-protect/7871","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 20:26:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7871"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-proposer-mev-protect/7871.rss","#text":"Proposal: Proposer MEV Protect"}},{"title":"Proposal: BloXroute Relay proxy","dc:creator":"eric_bloxroute","category":"Proposals","description":"<p>Regarding using BloXroute relay proxies, we made a change to our architecture, where validators don’t need to run any local components, yet can still connect to a relay proxy. We now allow validators to use relay proxies in many regions throughout the world (US, EU, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, and Dublin) without having to run their own. These proxies communicate with the relay using gRPC, and are faster than communicating with the relay directly. Validators using relay proxies receive higher paying blocks than those who don’t, due to the validator being able to receive blocks built later in the slot because of the reduced builder-to-proposer latency. While the proxy appears as an additional relay, the backend relays are the two bloXroute relays that are approved by the Lido community.

By creating an official public delegates platform and implementing a six-month Pilot Delegate Incentivization Program, we aim to increase active voting participation and improve the quality of discussions and feedback.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#next-steps-7\"></a><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Snapshot Vote</strong>: The proposal will be put to a Snapshot vote on July 25, if no objection from the community<br>\nIf passed:</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate Application Period</strong>: Applications for delegates will be open from August 2 to August 16.</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate Rally</strong>: The delegate rally will take place from August 19 to September 7.</li>\n<li><strong>Program Start</strong>: The first season of the incentivization program will commence on September 8.</li>\n<li><strong>First Quarter Incentives Distribution</strong>: Incentives for the first quarter of the pilot will be distributed from December 2 to December 8.</li>\n<li><strong>Second Quarter Incentives Distribution</strong>: Incentives for the second quarter of the pilot will be distributed from March 3 to March 7.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"qa-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#qa-8\"></a>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Can voters overwrite a delegate’s vote?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, a holder can always overwrite (mechanics allow tokenholder to change delegate vote after they cast it) a delegate’s vote if they have a different opinion. Even if they share the same opinion, they might overwrite to express personal support for a particular initiative.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is voting power only delegated to public delegates?</strong></p>\n<p>No, delegation is not limited to the public list. The public list and the list of compensated delegates are meant to guide those who need assistance choosing a delegate. You can delegate to yourself, a friend, or form a team and vote privately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Can the Committee automatically revoke voting power from a delegate?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no measure to automatically revoke voting power. All the committee can do is communicate and publicly announce if something is wrong with a delegate, whether they are inactive or behaving oddly. They do not have the authority to manage the tokens of a holder, including revoking delegation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What happens if a delegate who was removed for inactivity wants to return?</strong></p>\n<p>If a delegate is removed for not voting but becomes active again, we would welcome them back. Their previous removal does not prevent them from participating again if they resume their responsibilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How many delegates are expected to be in the incentivization program?</strong></p>\n<p>It is important to note that this is a personal estimate, as this is a pilot program and clarity will improve after its completion. However, it is anticipated that there will be approximately 4 to 6 delegates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Will the framework change in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, this is a pilot cycle, and there will certainly be opportunities to improve the framework based on the experience gained over six months. This is one reason for collaborating with the Agora team, as they are considered one of the strongest teams in user experience and governance in Web3.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>12 posts - 10 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/establish-a-public-delegate-platform-and-delegate-incentivization-program/7858\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/establish-a-public-delegate-platform-and-delegate-incentivization-program/7858","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 07:09:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7858"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/establish-a-public-delegate-platform-and-delegate-incentivization-program/7858.rss","#text":"Establish a Public Delegate Platform and Delegate Incentivization Program"}},{"title":"Rated Labs Replacement in the Oracle Set","dc:creator":"hhrated","category":"Node Operators","description":"<p>Rated Labs will be departing from the Lido oracle set, with the transition expected to occur in Q3 2024.

I am writing this post to provide more clarity to contributors of other projects who want to collaborate with Lido contributors and for the wider community to be able to cross-check if collaborations with protocols that claim collaborations with the DAO contributors are legit. Generally, those collaborations are listed on the <a href=\"https://lido.fi/lido-ecosystem\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Lido Ecosystem</a> page.</p>\n<p>In the attempt to create as safe as possible environment for community members and participants in DeFi, DAO contributors created primitives with a straightforward approach to collaborations.</p>\n<p>While security and technical compatibility practices are anchored and there is no flexibility, for community, alignment and usage metrics, most of the points should be covered but are not mandatory as it highly depends on the type or project in discussion.</p>\n<p>Please note these are unofficial guidelines for transparency and are not voted in by the DAO and are applicable for Protocol Relations Guild only.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#security-1\"></a><strong>Security</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thorough Security Audits:</strong> The project should have undergone comprehensive security audits by reputable firms.

Any modification after the audit should be re-audited before it goes in the production.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparent Audit Reports:</strong> Audit reports should be publicly accessible and demonstrate a track record of addressing identified vulnerabilities promptly and effectively. Every smart contract needs to be verified on Etherscan (or similar block explorer where Etherscan is not present) and the code has to match the one from the commit hash mentioned in the latest audit report.</li>\n<li><strong>Strong Security Practices:</strong> Robust security measures should be in place for the minimization of risk and the effect in case of unwanted event. Where multisig is used as an admin role instead of a DAO, the signers should be transparent.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Bounties:</strong>(optional but highly recommended) Along with audits of the codebase, attractive bug bounty programs ensure that the code is regularly assessed by independent security professionals.

Although various venture capital funds are also named defendants in the Complaint, none are responding as or on behalf of Lido DAO, and in fact they are denying they are part of Lido DAO. Thus, the risk of a default judgment against Lido DAO is real if a response is not filed by “Lido DAO”.</p>\n<p>Lido DAO has never characterized itself as a partnership, unincorporated association or other legal entity, and lacks many of the common features of a partnership (such as the alleged ‘partners’ knowing who one another are and a sharing of the profits and losses of an enterprise). There is no partnership agreement or other legal document providing for explicit mechanisms for Lido DAO to appear in or appoint a representative in a litigation. Nevertheless, because Lido DAO is alleged to be such an entity (specifically, a general partnership) in this complaint, Lido DAO tokenholders should pass this vote to enable someone to argue that Lido DAO has not been and cannot be served properly, is not a general partnership or other legal entity, is not a proper defendant to this lawsuit, and that the case should be dismissed.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, this proposal, without admitting and expressly disagreeing that Lido DAO is a partnership, association or other legally cognizable group or entity, is to appoint and fund Dolphin CL, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Dolphin”) to engage legal counsel (currently expected to be Brown Rudnick, led by partner Stephen Palley) and make a limited appearance as “Lido DAO” in the aforementioned case and, without admitting jurisdiction of the court or any other adverse legal fact (including but not limited to the notion that Lido DAO is a legal person), make all necessary or desirable legal arguments to cause the case to be dismissed against Lido DAO on any grounds deemed reasonable, appropriate and non-prejudicial by Dolphin and its counsel. The requested funding is 200,000 DAI, which is expected to be sufficient to pay Dolphin and its legal counsel for services sufficient to draft, file and argue in favor of a motion to dismiss the Complaint as it pertains to Lido DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>\n<p>There are two types of risks relating to the proposal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Risk of Not Passing the Proposal.<br>\nIf “Lido DAO” does not make filings in the case, there is a risk the court will enter a default judgment against “Lido DAO” due to no response to the Complaint being filed. While the ultimate implications of this would be unclear (in part because the legal status of ‘Lido DAO’ is unclear), in a recent case by the CFTC against Ooki DAO, the CFTC obtained a court order for the collection of damages from Ooki DAO and ordering “any third party providing web-hosting or domain-name registration services to shut down the Ooki DAO’s website and remove its content from the internet,” which has resulted in successful takedowns of Ooki-DAO-related web2 infra.<br>\nOn the other hand, a default judgment likely cannot be entered until the case is fully concluded against all parties, and the other parties to the litigation–if they are not dismissed from the case per their motions–would presumably continue litigating in their own defense for some time, even if Lido DAO does not appear to defend itself. However and even though those defendants have an excellent track record of supporting the blockchain industry, none of them are responding to the case as if they <em>are</em> part of Lido DAO, and due to potentially conflicting fiduciary duties there can be no guarantee their arguments will be crafted toward sustainability of Lido DAO and the systems it governs, versus being tailored to eliminate their own likelihood of liability or garnering an early dismissal of themselves from the case while leaving Lido DAO itself as a defendant.<br>\nIf a default judgment is ultimately entered against Lido DAO, we cannot predict whether the court would enter similar orders in this case to those in Ooki DAO (one notable difference is that the plaintiffs here are class-action attorneys, not a government agency), but it is a material risk–particularly if the default judgment is weaponized to cause third parties to deny Lido-DAO-related access to web2 infrastructure, to delist LDO from trading venues, etc.<br>\nFurthermore, third-parties could seek to use a default judgment against Lido DAO or other parties in other legal actions. This can occur via the doctrine of res judicata or non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel which has sometimes been used by the SEC and other regulators. These doctrines are complex so it is not guaranteed they will apply–for example, it could be argued that “Lido DAO” lacks a fair opportunity to litigate here or that the remedies are sufficiently different that res judicata principles would not apply. But a court may ultimately disagree and may apply such doctrines adversely to Lido DAO.<br>\nGenerally, a default judgment is a potential attack vector against Lido DAO and the systems it governs. While there may be various counterattacks to the judgment at various stages, and enforcing the judgment may be difficult for the plaintiffs, it is better if the attack vector does not materialize in the first place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Risks of Passing the Proposal<br>\nThe main risk of passing the proposal is that the claimant in this case might try to build an argument that Lido DAO is capable of being a litigant and therefore should be viewed as legal person that can ultimately suffer an adverse judgment. However, in the Ooki DAO case, the Ooki DAO took the strategy of having no one appear for the DAO, and this fact in itself did not help Ooki DAO—it was still deemed to be a cognizable legal person and still suffered a default judgment and had critical web2 infra dismantled by government orders levied against third parties.<br>\nA second general risk is that if Lido DAO appears and is not dismissed from the case, Lido DAO will face additional expenses and risks as the litigation proceeds. By contrast, if no response is entered for Lido DAO and the other defendants are not dismissed, the other defendants may keep litigating the case and Lido DAO could ‘free ride’ on their efforts to some extent (albeit there is no guarantee their arguments will be optimal for Lido DAO).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>About Dolphin CL, LLC</strong></p>\n<p>Entity Name: Dolphin CL, LLC<br>\nEntity Type: Limited liability company<br>\nJurisdiction: Delaware</p>\n<p><strong>About Brown Rudnick/Stephen Palley</strong></p>\n<p>Stephen Palley is a litigation partner and co-chair of Brown Rudnick’s Digital Commerce group and leads its Digital Assets disputes practice.

It employs the Interest Rate Swap model specifically for LRT assets.</li>\n<li>Maison aims to facilitate the integration of RYS (Re-Staking Yield Swap) assets with Symbiotic stETH LRTs and protocol-based stablecoins.</li>\n<li>Maison plans to launch a loyalty program for new stETH LRTs to ensure consistent liquidity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Background Overview</h2>\n<p>After the liquid staking era, there has been growth in re-staking assets and Pendle-like yield generation protocols. We also see different staked assets developed based on ETH with different yield generation models, etc. Here, we see an opportunity for alternative asset generations that help hedge risk, get yield, and not be frustrated with the choice of fixed or floating rates.</p>\n<p>Our solution is based on well-known and time-tested models.</p>\n<p><strong>1. First, let’s take a look at the Interest Rate Swap.</strong></p>\n<p>An interest rate swap is a forward contract in which one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for another based on a specified principal amount.</p>\n<p>Interest rate swaps usually involve exchanging a fixed interest rate for a floating rate, or vice versa, to reduce or increase exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or to obtain a marginally lower interest rate than would have been possible without the swap.</p>\n<p><em>Interest rate swaps (IRS) notional outstanding increased by 12.5% to $465.9 trillion, accounting for 81.2% of total IRD notional outstanding.</em></p>\n<p><strong>2. Second. It launched an Interest Rate Swap asset: Staking Yield Swaps from BitMEX.</strong></p>\n<p>It is a simple, elegant, and working model, but it was launched in lousy market conditions (it was announced less than a month after the FTX crash), with no market for such assets (no re-staking, no Pendle-like protocols)</p>\n<p><strong>3. Third, Symbiotic Re-Staking</strong></p>\n<p>Re-Staking introduces the next evolution in the Re-Staking Yield Swap markets. Over half of the staked ETH is managed by liquid Re-Staking providers, generating new assets fundamental to the emerging Re-Staking Yield Swaps market.</p>\n<h3>Integration Proposal</h3>\nWe propose launching the Maison protocol's derivatives, the Re-Staking Yield Swap solution, as part of the Lido Alliance. This would grant Re-Staking users access to a new derivatives market built on Symbiotic’s AVS project assets. Lido DAO can expect the usage of stETH as Maison collateral through loyalty programs or specific Symbiotic multipliers, enhancing utility and engagement.\n<h2>Protocol overview</h2>\n<p>This derivative lets traders swap the variable yield from staking LSTs or stablecoins on platforms like Symbiotic, Ethena, Etherfi, Swell, Mind, and others for a fixed interest rate and vice versa. Depending on their position, traders can either pay or receive the fixed rate, offering new opportunities for hedging and speculation on staking yields. Contracts expire quarterly and have specific trading conditions and fees.</p>\n<p>Generally, Re-Staking Yield Swaps (RYS) or Maison RYS are financial instruments that allow users to exchange the variable yield from staking cryptocurrencies for a fixed interest rate and vice versa. This helps traders and investors manage risks and speculate on staking yields.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Re-staking Protocols (Swell, Mind, Etherfi):</strong><br>\nUsers can swap the variable yields from these re-staking protocols for a fixed yield, offering hedging against yield volatility.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Stablecoin Projects (Ethena):</strong><br>\nSimilar swaps can be created for yields from stablecoin projects. Cross-swaps between ETH yields and stablecoin yields can provide diversified trading options.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\nVariable vs. Fixed Yields: Swap the variable staking rewards for a predictable fixed interest rate. The launch of RYS contracts introduces new avenues for trading and hedging, enabling users to speculate on the value of Re-Staking and rewards. This aligns with our commitment to enhancing platform versatility, with further expansions anticipated in the coming weeks and months.\n<p>During the life of a RYS contract, two interest rates are being “swapped” each day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The floating rate will be based on the variable yield from the staking. Every day at 12:00 UTC, a rebase happens – where staking rewards are accrued to the balance.</li>\n<li>The fixed rate represents a trader’s best guess of the average daily staking yield from the contract’s inception until maturity. It’s the rate that traders speculate on and will be annualized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Leverage: Potential to use leverage (e.g., up to 5x or higher) to amplify positions with careful risk management.</p>\n<p>In addition, traders can hold a position if they allocate enough margin to satisfy the maintenance margin requirement. Once this is not the case, the trader will be liquidated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quarterly Contracts: Standardized quarterly expiration for swaps.</li>\n<li>Risk Management: Strategies to handle yield fluctuations and ensure liquidity.\n<ul>\n<li>As for the slashing events, we can use the following event sequence:\n<ul>\n<li>Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitor validator performance to detect and respond to potential issues before they result in slashing.</li>\n<li>Alerting: We are presenting an alert about a slashing for a trader.</li>\n<li>Emergency position closing. Based on this event, we can execute emergency position closing with instant settlement based on the current market Funding position. The funding position recalculates at a moment’s notice of a slashing alert.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One main difference is that traders Pay or Receive the fixed rate on a swap contract rather than Buy or Sell:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Payer pays the fixed rate and receives the floating rate. In other words, the trader has entered a long position.</li>\n<li>The Receiver will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate. In other words, the trader has entered a short position.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p><strong>Symbiotic RYS:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variable Yield Source: Symbiotic staking returns.</li>\n<li>Swap Mechanism: Smart contracts allow users to receive a fixed yield in exchange for their variable yield.</li>\n<li>Leverage: Up to 5x leverage.</li>\n<li>Risk Management: Hedging strategies and collateral requirements.</li>\n<li>Expiration: Quarterly contracts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A trader who has staked wstETH on Symbiotic – and also received fixed on a swap contract – will net receive the fixed rate on their staked wstETH (thus converting the uncertain daily variable rate that is derived from staking wstETH on Symbiotic into a known fixed rate).</p>\n<p>So, say, a trader paid 3% on 1 ETH notional of wstETH RYS contracts. If the floating rate for a particular day is 3.5%, the net amount received by the trader will be:</p>\n<p><code>1 ETH x (3.5% – 3%) x (1 / 365) = 0.000013699 ETH.</code></p>\n<h2>Asset Specification</h2>\n<p>Maison Re-Staking Yield Swap (RYS) Contracts resemble traditional Interest Rate Swaps but differ significantly from perpetual swaps. Unlike perpetual swaps, RYS Contracts are not directly linked to an underlying index, allowing their trading prices to diverge considerably from the index value. This structure gives users unique opportunities and flexibility in trading and hedging strategies.</p>\n<h3>Mechanics of RYS Markets</h3>\nTraders can make or lose money when trading RYS through two mechanisms: PnL Realization and Floating Funding payments.\n<ul>\n<li>Multiplier: Defines the worth of one contract.</li>\n<li>Position Marking: Yield contracts are marked using the Last Price, which determines Unrealised PNL and liquidations.</li>\n<li>Initial and Maintenance Margin: These levels dictate allowable leverage and when liquidation occurs.</li>\n<li>Floating Funding: Positions open during Floating Funding (every 24 hours) will pay or receive funding settled against the Average Entry Price.\n<ul>\n<li>Long traders will pay a fixed rate (their average entry price) and receive the Floating Funding Rate.</li>\n<li>Short traders will receive a fixed rate (their average entry price) and will pay the Floating Funding Rate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Settlement: The expiry date varies per instrument, as the specifications show.</li>\n<li>Basis refers to the contract’s premium or discount compared to the underlying Reference Index due to future expected funding payments and settlements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Floating Funding Index: Observing this index provides insights into current and historical contract funding rates.</p>\n<h3>Position Size and Price Marking</h3>\n<p>The Position Value for RYS contracts depends on the number of days remaining on the swap and the Average Entry Price.</p>\n<p><code>Position Value = Number of contracts * Multiplier * Average Entry Price * days until expiry / 365</code></p>\n<p><code>Mark Value = Number of contracts * Multiplier * Mark Price * days until expiry / 365</code></p>\n<p><code>Unrealized PnL = Mark Value - Position Value</code></p>\n<p>When closing a position, the Pnl that is realized depends on the number of days remaining on the swap as well as on the Average Entry Price and Exit Price:</p>\n<p><code>PnL  = Position Exit Value - Position Entry Value</code></p>\n<h3>Floating Funding</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Funding Interval: Floating Funding is applied every 24 hours at 12:00 UTC. You are subject to Floating Funding only if you maintain an open position at this time. Closing your position before this interval means you won’t incur or receive any funding.</li>\n<li>Fees: Maison imposes a fee of 0.001% on Floating Funding transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use the (Asset) staking yield index (APR) we collect from protocols.</p>\n<p><code>APR = ((Last Reward - Previous Reward) / (Previous Reward)) * (1 / Time Elapsed)</code></p>\n<h2>Trading core specification</h2>\n<p>We have a <strong>mainnet Ethereum asset layer, and we are using an on-chain orderbook hosted on an Optimism-based Appchain with Celestia DA</strong> that manages the matching and settlement layer On-chain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Order Placement: Users sign and place orders through the Off-Chain Order Manager, which batches the orders and directs orders in one batch to the Order Management Contract.</li>\n<li>Off-Chain Order Manager sends events to lock balances on a collateral smart contract to prevent double-spending and balance withdrawal.</li>\n<li>The order Management Contract accepts batches, validates orders and forwards them to the OrderBook Contract for insertion. Also, the order Management Contract manages pairs of RYS assets.</li>\n<li>OrderBook Management: The OrderBook Contract maintains orders in separate bids and asks trees, allowing for efficient management and retrieval.</li>\n<li>Order Matching: The batch post triggers the Matching Engine Contract. It checks for matchable orders in the bid, asks for trees, executes trades appropriate to the collateral contract (settlement to update the balance), triggers the Off-Chain Order Manager to unlock collateral, and updates the order book.</li>\n<li>Order Querying: Users can query order data for display, analysis, or to inform trading decisions. While detailed order data might require interaction with the blockchain, much of the querying for display purposes can be offloaded to off-chain systems that listen to event logs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2> Security</h2>\n<p>We partner with esteemed security professionals and audit firms like Hallborn, Hacken, and Hypernative. We ensure that all code undergoes external audits before production deployment. For operational integrity, we employ real-time monitoring systems and alert systems, which also aid in diagnosing issues promptly.</p>\n<h2> Maison role</h2>\n<p>Our RYS may be ideal for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users who have staked on Lido and Symbiotic and wish to lock in a fixed yield</li>\n<li>Users who are using other methods to stake ETH and wish to use our ETH staking yield swap contracts as an indirect hedge</li>\n<li>Speculators who wish to take positions on the value of ETH staking or validator rewards</li>\n<li>Anyone with holdings – or interest – in ETH or Stablecoin staking protocols</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How will Maison help the Lido?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maison will top up interest in Symbiotic and all connected AVS solutions.</li>\n<li>Maison makes the ecosystem consistent by providing a unique trading protocol that connects all solutions that will be part of the staking and re-staking solution.</li>\n<li>Lido liquidity may increase as more assets generate yield, resulting in more interest in RYS contracts and vice versa.</li>\n<li>Enhanced flexibility allows users to hedge Lido staking yields and encourage longer-term staking.</li>\n<li>It provides tools for users to manage yield risk and promotes wider adoption of Re-Staking solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ll provide the Symbiotic protocol with the same benefits but even with a more significant effect.</p>\n<p>What we expect from Lido and Symbiotic</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptance of Maison as a member of the Lido Alliance and represent Maison as an official partner of Symbiotic.</li>\n<li>Access to a partnership network to enhance its business development efforts for liquidity provision within the system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Re-Staking yield swaps offer a robust financial instrument that benefits individual users and protocols like Lido and various Re-Staking solutions by enhancing liquidity, providing hedging opportunities, and enabling sophisticated investment strategies.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-onboard-maison-to-the-lido-alliance/7745\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-onboard-maison-to-the-lido-alliance/7745","pubDate":"Mon, 24 Jun 2024 17:41:20 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7745"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-onboard-maison-to-the-lido-alliance/7745.rss","#text":"Proposal: Onboard Maison to the Lido Alliance"}},{"title":"Discussion: The Decentralized Validator Vault","dc:creator":"KimonSh","category":"General","description":"<p>This post serves as a forum to discuss a potential strategy that could be implemented to increase the pace of adoption of Distributed Validators via the Simple DVT Module by utilizing incentives from DVT Infrastructure providers. Given the timelines of other parties that will potentially be involved, if the Vault moves forward, it is expected that the implementation will occur in an expedited manner.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"background-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#background-1\"></a>Background</h2>\n<p>In light of the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/regoose-updated-goals-for-lido-in-the-light-of-mvi-and-restaking/7462\">recently updated ReGOOSE goals</a> and as mentioned in the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549\">Simple DVT Expansion proposal</a>, research has been underway in regards to a strategy that could be used to increase the decentralization of the Lido Node Operator set and by leveraging the addition of DVT based validators from Obol &amp; SSV Network.</p>\n<p>Since SSV Network’s mainnet launch, the protocol has seen significant success, partially boosted by its mainnet incentives program. Currently, SSV Network has 24,992 active validators representing over $2.8B of ETH staked, all of which are eligible to receive SSV token incentives.</p>\n<p>In the coming weeks, the Obol team plans to announce a contributions program in conjunction with their <a href=\"https://blog.obol.tech/1-percent-for-decentralisation/\">1% for Decentralization retroactive funding initiative</a>. Stake that is deployed on Obol DVs will contribute 1% of their staking rewards to the retroactive fund. The expectation for Liquid Staking Protocols is that potential future Obol incentives will be allocated to stakers by taking into account the contributions made on the relevant staking platform.</p>\n<p>Within Lido Simple DVT, <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/41\">Obol clusters</a> are about to start the process of scaling their validators while the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/38\">first SSV Network clusters</a> are expected to go live in the coming weeks, with scaling to follow soon after.</p>\n<p>The Snapshot vote for Expanding the Simple DVT Module <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xaca2da3c932542e030db8bf5b6e4420bf4aa98bd57bd62b9b8008a4b7398abb2\">successfully passed through governance</a>, and an on-chain Aragon vote to raise the share limit of the module to 4% is expected in the next two weeks. This proposal has also greenlit the creation of Super Simple DVT clusters, that would allow for quicker scaling of both Obol- and SSV-based DVT clusters via the Simple DVT Module over the next two months.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposal-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#proposal-2\"></a>Proposal</h2>\n<p>Given the additional capacity soon to be available within the Simple DVT Module, the upcoming launch of Obol’s contributions program, and recent revamp of SSV’s incentive program, an opportunity has been presented that can 1. Quicken the adoption pace of DVT via the Simple DVT module, leading to a more <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549/9\">secure, resilient, and decentralized</a> Node Operator set and 2. Drive net-new deposits to the protocol.</p>\n<p>One way to manage the process is to use some intermediary “vault” solution to serve as a focal point for both user deposits and DVT provider incentives.</p>\n<p>The vault strategy would offer capital allocators (stakers) the ability to deposit ETH or WETH into what would be called the Decentralized Validator Vault. This (W)ETH would be staked via Lido, with stakers earning the normal staking rewards from the protocol. 90% of the incentives generated via the Lido protocol Obol &amp; SSV Network validators could be allocated to depositors of the vault, with the remaining 10% allocated to the Node Operators in their corresponding SSV &amp; Obol Simple DVT clusters.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"why-do-this-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#why-do-this-3\"></a>Why Do This?</h2>\n<p>The combination of the expansion of the Simple DVT Module, the launch of Obol’s contribution program, and re-work of SSV’s incentive program presents an opportunity for the DAO to increase the resilience of the Lido Node Operator set via DVT, drive a material amount of net-new deposits into the protocol, and offer capital allocators access to incentives that they otherwise would not receive (as SSV &amp; Obol incentives are based on running validators).</p>\n<p>With the Simple DVT Module expanded to 4%, there will be capacity for 11,868 validators evenly split between Obol and SSV over the coming months. Excluding the 60 active validators running through Simple DVT currently, this suggests capacity for an incremental 377,856 ETH of deposits into the protocol to fill the capacity of the Simple DVT Module.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"vault-mechanics-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#vault-mechanics-4\"></a>Vault Mechanics</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"structure-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#structure-5\"></a>Structure</h3>\n<p>The vault could be introduced and curated by a DeFi protocol, integrating functionality to drive deposits to the Lido protocol and the ability to show monthly snapshots of the allocated points to individual stakers utilizing the vault.</p>\n<p>The capacity of the vault would be controlled via the administrator of the vault (depending on the vault design), reflecting the current depositable capacity of the Simple DVT Module, with an up to 10% additional buffer. These parameter changes would reflect when key limits of clusters within the Simple DVT Module are raised, as explained in the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/1\">Simple DVT Proposal</a> and <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549/7\">Expansion Proposal</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"incentives-eligibility-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#incentives-eligibility-6\"></a>Incentives Eligibility</h4>\n<p>Similar to the current <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/rewards-share-program-2024/6812\">rewards share program</a>, and in order to dissuade possibly deleterious effects to the protocol due to farming incentives, it is suggested that analysis be conducted on vault depositors.

The incentives are calculated on the base of ETH deposited to and persisting within the vault during the relevant snapshot period minus any stETH withdrawn after the launch of the vault.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not sell existing stETH on DEXs/CEXs: this condition does not expel a depositor from all incentives, but reduce corresponding amount of capital provided by the volume of sold ETH. Similar to the above, the incentives would be calculated on the base of non-swapped ETH deposited to and persisting within the vault during the relevant snapshot period.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#summary-7\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>With the expansion of the Simple DVT module imminent, it is an opportune time to consider utilizing both Obol and SSV’s mainnet contributions and incentivization programs to quicken the pace of DVT based validators being added to the protocol.</p>\n<p>This strategy would allow for a faster flow of Simple DVT validators being activated, for capital allocators to access DVT provider incentives, and most importantly, hasten the pace that DVT is rolled out across the expanded Simple DVT Module.</p>\n<p>Parties interested in providing the infrastructure required for such a DVT vault are asked to respond to this post, noting that there is an expedited timeline due to the estimated launch of DVT provider incentive programs.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Lido Alliance with relevant infrastructure capabilities, the Mellow team has been made aware of this discussion post and asked to provide a public showing of interest if they believe they are capable of providing a solution that would cover the above listed requirements.

Commitments are backed by economic assurances, not by trusted intermediaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Credible</strong>: Because Bolt is proposer-centric, they can be fully held accountable for their commitments. In case of breaches, proposers can be penalized, which ensures the credibility of the commitments.</li>\n<li><strong>Permissionless</strong>: Any proposer can opt-in to the protocol, and any user can request commitments from them. No central authority is needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Compatible</strong>: Bolt is designed to be compatible with the existing PBS pipeline, and eventually ePBS. From the proposer’s perspective, the only change needed is an additional sidecar.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Guided by these principles, we believe Bolt is an effective preconf solution for Lido Node Operators and Ethereum as a whole.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For Ethereum:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bolt accelerates Ethereum’s roadmap</strong> towards stronger censorship resistance properties (Inclusion Lists, PEPC), de-fragmentation (based sequencing), and fast UX (preconfs), without relying on trusted intermediaries.</li>\n<li>Bolt’s <strong>permissionless nature makes it unopinionated</strong> in the current relay and builder market competition. Having an opinionated solution that could potentially favor specific relays or builders is fundamentally unhealthy for Ethereum.</li>\n<li>Bolt’s <strong>proposer-centric credibility</strong> ensures Ethereum does not increase its reliance on trusted entities within the block-production pipeline. This is important so as not to add to existing centralizing pressures.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>For Lido Node Operators:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bolt is economical and easy to integrate for node operators.</strong> Bolt is implemented out-of-protocol and is compatible with the existing block production pipeline.</li>\n<li><strong>Bolt is expressive and future-proof.</strong> Bolt is designed to cover multiple block-space use-cases, while also remaining compatible with the potential transition towards ePBS.</li>\n<li><strong>Bolt is fault-tolerant.</strong> Bolt has an embedded fallback block building mechanism as a last resort to ensure that relays and builders aren’t critical to the proposers’ operation.</li>\n<li><strong>Validators do not need to rely on trusted relationships</strong> to make commitments to further monetize their blockspace.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"bolt-v1-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#bolt-v1-4\"></a>Bolt V1</h2>\n<p>Bolt V1 will support inclusion preconfirmations.

To enable it, proposers must point their beacon node <code>builder-api</code> to the sidecar’s endpoint. From the perspective of the beacon node, the sidecar will look like a regular external block builder.</p>\n<p>The sidecar is responsible for the following tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receiving &amp; validating commitment requests from users through the <code>commitments-API</code></li>\n<li>Turning commitments into constraints and communicating them downstream</li>\n<li>Proposing a safe fallback block in case of any faults</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"modified-mev-boost-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#modified-mev-boost-6\"></a>Modified <code>mev-boost</code></h3>\n<p>The modified <code>mev-boost</code> client will implement the <code>constraints-API</code> and verify those constraints against incoming builder bids, which will have proofs attached. For more information on how proofs and verification will work, see the <a href=\"https://chainbound.github.io/bolt-docs/security/proofs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proofs</a> section.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"registry-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#registry-7\"></a>Registry</h3>\n<p>The Bolt Registry is the smart contract that keeps track of opted-in proposers and their associated stake. The responsibilities of the registry include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registering new proposers via an EOA, verifying their authenticity cryptographically (see the unfinalized <a href=\"https://chainbound.github.io/bolt-docs/architecture#opt-in-procedure-for-proposers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">opt-in procedure</a> below)</li>\n<li>Accounting for the proposer’s stake/collateral, potentially including restaked capital</li>\n<li>Removing proposers that no longer wish to participate in Bolt (with a cooldown period)</li>\n<li>Providing read access to the proposer set (useful for the Bolt RPC and Challenger components)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"bolt-rpc-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#bolt-rpc-8\"></a>Bolt RPC</h3>\n<p>The Bolt RPC will be a public RPC endpoint that will proxy requests from users to opted in proposers according to the lookahead and provide additional functionality like DoS protection and rate limiting. The Bolt RPC will be a separate process from the proposer, and anyone can run one. Proposers can configure the Bolt sidecar to point to their preferred Bolt RPC</p>\n<p>Please refer to our <a href=\"https://chainbound.github.io/bolt-docs/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">technical documentation</a> for more details about Bolt’s architecture, commitment types, use cases, and more!</p>\n<h3><a name=\"delegation-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#delegation-9\"></a>Delegation</h3>\n<p>Bolt’s architecture allows proposers to delegate the task of providing commitments to a trusted third party. This can be achieved by signing a permit message that allows the third party to submit commitments on their behalf. They then have to point their <code>builder-API</code> to the third party’s <code>bolt-sidecar</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>We defer to individual validators, larger node operators, and staking pools on their own policies towards delegation. For example, the allowance of delegation can be addressed within Lido’s <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/No2SULzlSVytoWOJ2Wqa7g?view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethereum Block Proposer Reward Policy.</a> It should be noted that delegation leads to a fully trusted relationship. If the operator commits a fault, the proposerr will get penalized.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"onboarding-process-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#onboarding-process-10\"></a>Onboarding Process</h3>\n<p>The onboarding process requires proposers to opt-into the Bolt protocol. This has two parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Off-chain Validator signature Authentication</strong></p>\n<p>Validators need a signature to validate preconfirmation requests. The exact authentication method is still an open research topic, but <strong>Bolt plans to support a variety of signing methods, such as the Commit Boost signing manager.</strong> Proposers, and their respective key managers, will interact with a commit-boost’s signing manager and proxy key scheme to both authorize respective validators and authenticate commitments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Opt-in Procedure</strong></p>\n<p>Once registered, proposers must post some form of collateral to guarantee economic credibility behind their preconfirmations. The specific method in which this is achieved is left as an open point for now.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are actively looking for validators to take part in Cohort 1 for testing and demoing Bolt. We believe Lido node operators would make ideal partners here. Please reach out if you would like to participate.</p>\n<p><em>Side-note: An experimental (not part of the poc) on-chain registration process could work as follows:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>The Proposer signs a message with their withdrawal address private key to signify that they are requesting to opt-in. The message will need to contain the Ethereum address that the proposer intends to use as signer to authenticate individual preconfirmation requests. This way, proposers in Bolt will have a separate identity from their validators private key.</em></li>\n<li><em>The Proposer sends a transaction to the Registry, requesting to opt-in to Bolt. The transaction must be sent from the same address that was specified in the signed message, which must be passed in the transaction’s data. This way, the ownership of this new ECDSA key-pair is proven on-chain.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"security-culture-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#security-culture-11\"></a>Security Culture</h2>\n<p>The Bolt protocol will be open-sourced and audited allowing for rigorous internal and external examination of all Bolt components. Bolt is designed to be simple and minimal. Along with a modified mev-boost client, Bolt only introduces 2 additional off-chain components: a sidecar and an RPC.</p>\n<p>Chainbound will collaborate with external parties for both on-chain and off-chain components. For example, Bolt can utilize existing battle-tested restaking modules.</p>\n<p><strong>Additionally, Bolt’s interface and standards will be a collaborative output from many teams thinking about similar solutions.</strong> Chainbound will provide maintenance, monitoring and, analytics for continued transparency, integrity, and security of Bolt.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"lido-alliance-chainbound-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#lido-alliance-chainbound-12\"></a>Lido Alliance &lt;&gt; Chainbound</h2>\n<p>Lido’s reGOOSE states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Internalize validator services that align with Ethereum’s roadmap, starting with preconfirmations, without exposing stakers to additional risk</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bolt is not only: (1) a generalized proposer commitments protocol that can facilitate a variety of potential validator services, but also (2) designed with preconfirmations as the primary use case, and (3) aligned with Ethereum’s roadmap towards stronger censorship resistance guarantees, better UX, and defragmentation.</p>\n<p>Bolt does, however, rely on economic security, placing additional slashing risk on proposers. We find this path necessary when introducing proposer-centric commitments so as not to rely on trusted intermediaries. With that said, there are ways to either reduce proposer risk (which can come in the form of insurance funds) or increase rewards (yield) to compensate for said risk.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"lido-alliance-support-for-chainbound-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#lido-alliance-support-for-chainbound-13\"></a>Lido Alliance Support for Chainbound</h3>\n<p>Acceptance into the Lido alliance would be a direct endorsement for Chainbound and Bolt. With this endorsement, Chainbound would appreciate the convergence from Lido stakeholders around Bolt as one of the preconfirmation solutions to test and iterate over. For the Lido working group, Chainbound would appreciate direct collaboration and feedback on Bolt’s design choices, suggestions around auditors and firms, and continuous testing of the software.</p>\n<p>Helping bootstrap Validator Cohort 1, in particular with Lido Node Operators, would be an incredible help, along with ongoing assistance around validator adoption down the line.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"lido-alliance-alignment-collateral-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#lido-alliance-alignment-collateral-14\"></a>Lido Alliance Alignment Collateral</h3>\n<p>We at Chainbound are open to discussing the possibilities here.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"towards-a-proposer-centric-future-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#towards-a-proposer-centric-future-15\"></a>Towards a Proposer-centric Future</h2>\n<p>We hope the design decisions around our protocol reflect our desire to support and grow Ethereum, and therefore, help support Lido, a key steward of the Ethereum community.

This will be done via various channels; podcasts, articles and events.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"objectives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#objectives-2\"></a>Objectives</h2>\n<p>The importance of Simple DVT and CSM in enhancing the decentralization of Lido, and by extension Ethereum, is significant. The goal of this initiative is to introduce various ways to get involved in the decentralization of Ethereum through Lido, with the introduction of Simple DVT and CSM being crucial components.</p>\n<p>More specifically, the aim is for individuals and community members who engage with the educational content created within this initiative or participate in the events held to set up their nodes and become solo stakers themselves, or if not, to contribute to Lido’s decentralization from different aspects.</p>\n<p>We are presenting a focused, short-term segment of a larger, long-term plan. Our intention is to start quickly and efficiently by requesting a more modest grant size, which will allow us to initiate our project with agility. We believe this approach will enable us to demonstrate the potential of our broader vision while ensuring a streamlined and effective implementation of the initial phase.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-activities-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#key-activities-3\"></a>Key Activities</h2>\n<p>These activities will continue to be executed in an appropriate form throughout all phases.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"educational-contents-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#educational-contents-4\"></a>Educational contents</h3>\n<p>Create educational content aimed at individuals and organizations to understand Lido.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Podcast series that covers topics below.</li>\n<li>Article series that covers topics below.</li>\n<li>Tutorials and detailed guides for setting up nodes using CSM/ Simple DVT.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"organizing-events-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#organizing-events-5\"></a>Organizing events</h3>\n<p>Organize an educational event that covers the topics below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of Lido and its underlying technology</li>\n<li>Simple DVT explained</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"activities-by-numbers-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#activities-by-numbers-6\"></a>Activities by numbers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>offline event: 1</li>\n<li>podcast: 6+\n<ul>\n<li>every week updates over 2 months</li>\n<li>several Lido-focused episodes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>article : 3</li>\n<li>tutorial/setup guide: 1</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"topics-to-be-covered-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#topics-to-be-covered-7\"></a>Topics to be covered</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction of Lido</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide basic information for listeners with varying levels of understanding of Lido, ensuring a consistent foundational comprehension.</li>\n<li>A brief review of Liquid Staking / The significance and benefits of Liquid Staking / Differences from other LSTs / Lido’s value, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Introducing (Re)GOOSE <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1:</span> The background</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on the reasons why ReGOOSE was needed.</li>\n<li>What is ReGOOSE in a nutshell? / Why was ReGOOSE needed?

Along with this position, and as the ecosystem continues to mature and be driven by its community, we will collaborate in the creation, iteration, and improvement of governance processes to ensure broader participation and that the system remains secure.</li>\n<li><strong>Community-Led Growth &amp; Sustainability:</strong> We will promote and support all initiatives that enable the growth, adoption, scalability, and innovation of Lido’s ecosystem. Our focus will be placed on ensuring that all growth initiatives are reliable, secure, and sustainable over time. We are willing to undertake “protocol activism” regarding Lido’s significance in the web3 ecosystem and our alignment with its guiding principles. We intend to focus and try our best efforts on onboarding and educating stakeholders, as well as advocating for Lido within the broader blockchain and DeFi communities.</li>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> We will always make sure that no DAO decisions will jeopardize the security of the protocol and thus harm users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"our-case-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#our-case-5\"></a><strong>Our case</strong></h1>\n<p>Lido’s innovative infrastructure has revolutionized staking by lowering barriers and boosting the entire crypto ecosystem. Its user-friendly design and elimination of asset locking have propelled Lido to hold ~30% of the <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ETH staking market</a>. This positions Lido’s future developments and challenges as potential tipping points for the entire ETH landscape. Being part of this space will enable us to be informed and continue understanding, building, and participating in the following verticals (among others):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Governance</strong>: The proposed Dual Governance framework -dynamic timelock and rage quit mechanisms- offers a promising balance between wstETH stakers and other stakeholders, ensuring an effective system of checks and balances and strong incentives alignment, representing LDO holders and protocol users’ interests. However, in search of achieving governance minimization, the social layer will remain a critical instance of the collective decision-making and consensus-building process, where a deep understanding of Lido will play a crucial role. Addressing and arbitrating potential disputes and misalignments between the different stakeholders is something that SEEDGov can help.</li>\n<li><strong>Alliances:</strong> We consider that the recently approved Lido Alliance framework comes as a solution in line with the current trends in the web3 ecosystem, effectively balancing efficiency and scalability. Allowing the community to decide on these partnerships ensures both transparency and tangible impact in the decision-making process. At this point, we can’t envision another solution that wouldn’t risk fracturing our ecosystem. SEEDGov consistently conducts research and maintains a global, comprehensive understanding of the DeFi ecosystem, enabling us to evaluate and assess potential partnerships for Lido.</li>\n<li><strong>L2 Expansion</strong>: From SEED we’re highly committed to advancing Lido’s mission of making staking simple, secure, and accessible to everyone. We consider that continuing to integrate wstETH native minting on diverse L2 ecosystems, including various rollups, can drive adoption and liquidity, enhancing an interconnected DeFi ecosystem. More presence on L2 protocols will enhance the overall UX, encouraging more users to stake their ETH and participate in Lido’s ecosystem.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"disclosure-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#disclosure-6\"></a><strong>Disclosure</strong></h2>\n<p>SEEDGov is a broad organization that not only encompasses communities in Latam, but also has high participation in some of the most prominent governances in the ecosystem such as <strong>Optimism, Arbitrum, Uniswap, Gnosis, Starknet, Everclear (Connext), and Maker</strong>.

With that direction in mind, we consider it critical and inevitable for node operators to appropriately participate in the governance, not just on the protocol upgrades but also on the meta-governance and DAO operations. We are aiming to be the one that promote the movement and the leading operator with the technical capability as a node operator and governance capability as an active delegate.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"tech-savvy-delegate-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#tech-savvy-delegate-7\"></a>Tech-savvy delegate</h3>\n<p>Our unique experience and expertises in the tech industries as product builders (entrepreneurs, software engineers, and product managers) should be able to contribute to critical feedback and comments on technical upgrades and issues to be discussed and implemented by collaborating with Lido contributors and external parties.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"japan-representative-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#japan-representative-8\"></a>Japan representative</h3>\n<p>There are many users and traders using crypto products in Japan, but there are no prominent delegates who actively participate in and contribute to DAO governance from Japan yet. We are aiming to be the one who represents the Japanese users and token holders by being active in the governance, leveraging the partnership with Japanese enterprises and making meaningful impacts on the protocols and the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"values-and-decision-making-approach-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#values-and-decision-making-approach-9\"></a>Values and Decision-Making Approach</h2>\n<p>We have established our Delegate Core Values as below and demonstrated our delegate activities and decision makings based on them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"integrity-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#integrity-10\"></a>Integrity</h3>\n<p>We value <strong>integrity</strong> a lot. We believe integrity is the most important virtue even in the industry that values trustless and permissionless. In fact, even though we should aim for governance minimization in the end, the protocols should still need governance and it requires capable and sincere participants. We should be the one of them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"diversity-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#diversity-11\"></a>Diversity</h3>\n<p><strong>Diversity</strong> is one of the most important values to achieve decentralization. We are very unique in various perspectives including the geographical diversity (Japan and Asia). We also value diversities provided by other actors and are willing to appreciate them and collaborations with them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"practicality-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#practicality-12\"></a>Practicality</h3>\n<p>We believe in the progressive decentralization. While considering the decentralization is the ultimate goal for crypto/blockchain projects to achieve, we sometimes value <strong>practicality</strong> and approaches that get things done rather than getting stuck in pursuing the “decentralization” too much from the start.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"transparency-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#transparency-13\"></a>Transparency</h3>\n<p>We believe <strong>transparency</strong> is the vital trait in the decentralized systems. We communicate our findings, feedback, opinions, disagreements and praises in a clear and constructive manner.

The auction is implemented on a L2 Rollup based off the OP Stack with minimal changes. The Auction is currently deployed and live on main net<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi#footnote-16018-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-16018-3\">[3]</a></sup> ethereum.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Validators simply need to connect to our new relay implementation, and run an updated Vouch or MEV Boost client. That is all the onboarding process really involves. There is no restaking, no risk to capital for the validators. This proposal would necessitate the adding of the new relay to the Relay must include the list for Lido validators. The onboarding process and current status is discussed more in the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#roadmap</span> section.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a name=\"call-market-mechanics-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#call-market-mechanics-3\"></a>Call Market mechanics</h3>\n<p>XGA facilitates the allocation of blockspace by dividing each block into two parts instead of selling it as a single monolithic entity. One part is designated for high-priority, time-sensitive transactions (⍺-blockspace), while the other is reserved for less urgent transactions (β-blockspace). This segmentation allows users to select the most cost-effective and suitable space for their needs, enhancing transaction efficiency and user value.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"mev-boost-compatibility-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#mev-boost-compatibility-4\"></a>MEV Boost compatibility</h4>\n<p>The second change includes the timing of sales. The first part of the block is sold through <em>mev-boost</em> as is common now for most blocks. The second part of the block is sold as a form of preconfirmation. That is, if a block gets minted at time <em>t</em>, the bottom part is sold in a pre-defined period before. This part is sold in a multi-unit way meaning that several bidders can win blockspace for this part.</p>\n<p>Winners of the <em>beta</em> part of block <em>b</em> can then submit their bundles before the block gets actually minted. <em>In effect, winners of the auction get an inclusion guarantee beforehand.</em> Winners simply “burn” their position on the L2 and submit their L1 transaction.</p>\n<p>In version 1.0, the final merging of alpha and beta portions of the block are handled by our specially designed relay.  This relay is live on mainnet at <a href=\"https://mainnet-auction.securerpc.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://mainnet-auction.securerpc.com</a>. Version 2.0 eliminates this privileged service requirement.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"validator-participation-without-slashing-or-loss-risk-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#validator-participation-without-slashing-or-loss-risk-5\"></a>Validator Participation without Slashing or Loss Risk</h2>\n<p>On the validator side, to participate, a validator must be permissioned to register with this service (the relay). Practically, the validator places the relay as a <em>privileged service</em>. This means that it will ignore bids from other relays during a defined time window, and if it fails to receive a valid response from our relay, it will then consider other bids from other relays. If the validator does not get a valid proposal from our relay, it then will pick the highest submitted block it has got from all other relays. Therefore, there is very little remunerative risk from the validator perspective. Any additional risk is covered by our “Captive Insurance” program, in which we cover any costs that are incurred due to assurance violations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This logic is to ensure against potential service disruptions causing losses for validators. It also provides an enforcement mechanism for the forward contracts to begin with without resorting to slashing. This is why validators must also be approved to register with the relay to participate for version 1.0.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a name=\"captive-risk-retention-protects-validator-revenue-and-capital-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#captive-risk-retention-protects-validator-revenue-and-capital-6\"></a>Captive Risk Retention protects Validator Revenue and Capital</h2>\n<p>Captive Risk Retention (or “Captive Insurance”) is our risk management protocol, which the primary purpose is to insure the risk related to the relay and auction. It provides a direct relationship between the insured and insurer, and is incentive aligned. The aim is to protect validator stake, earnings and market participants against service outages or other exogenous disruptions , ensuring continuity of potential profits and explicit protections for participating parties.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2.5% gross is taken from the ß-auction into the backstop fund. This amount can be adjusted. Should claims exceed the backstop fund, a pro rata charge is applied to the protocol vault of staked assets and liquidated into ETH to cover the shortfall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a name=\"coverage-scope-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#coverage-scope-7\"></a><strong>Coverage Scope</strong></h3>\n<h4><a name=\"service-downtime-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#service-downtime-8\"></a><strong>Service Downtime</strong></h4>\n<p>Provides compensation for any periods when the relay service is either inoperable or inaccessible.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"incorrect-or-malicious-proposals-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#incorrect-or-malicious-proposals-9\"></a><strong>Incorrect or Malicious Proposals</strong></h4>\n<p>Offers protection against losses arising from incorrect or malicious block proposals made by the relay.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"performance-degradation-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#performance-degradation-10\"></a><strong>Performance Degradation</strong></h4>\n<p>Ensures coverage in cases where the relay’s performance deteriorates significantly, affecting validator operations.</p>\n<p>The insurance protocol seeks to provide coverage against a validator not having access to both MEV Boost Auction and the XGA Auction. The MEV Boost auction is protected by failover capacity of 3rd party relays (as described earlier). So long as this mechanism is correctly working, this greatly limits the liability in terms of potential losses that  XGA could end up being on the hook for.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"additional-mev-improvements-and-integrations-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#additional-mev-improvements-and-integrations-11\"></a>Additional MEV Improvements and Integrations</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"buildersearcher-separation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#buildersearcher-separation-12\"></a>Builder/Searcher Separation</h3>\n<p>Searchers no longer need to vertically integrate with builders to enhance their inclusion rate. This is an important development in the market structure as it will lead to more truthful bidding (i.e. higher bidding). Searchers can now focus on their strategies without having to develop relationships with existing builder incumbents. Thus the barrier to entry is reduced, increasing competition overall and leading to higher validator MEV reward share.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"contract-bidding-strategies-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#contract-bidding-strategies-13\"></a>Contract Bidding Strategies</h3>\n<p>By utilizing smart contracts for bidding and introducing a novel tie-breaking rule that emphasizes competitive pressure over simple high bids, the platform encourages fairer pricing and maximizes the value obtained from each auction.

Mellow Protocol offers a series of vault smart contracts tailored to different risk profiles, managed by curators. These vaults rely on the inherent flexibility, composability and security of both Ethereum and restaking providers to mitigate AVS risks effectively.</p>\n<p>The architecture of Mellow Protocol is engineered to adapt to the varying needs of its users while maintaining a high standard of security and transparency. By allowing permissionless LRT curation, Mellow enables depositors more flexibility regarding their desired level of exposure to risk, while still benefiting from the liquidity of staked assets. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting strategies within each vault based on real-time risk assessments and market conditions.</p>\n<p>Mellow’s smart-contract framework is built to be extensible, allowing for the seamless introduction of new features and vault types with minimal changes to the existing codebase. This ensures a low attack surface while facilitating the development of additional products and services.</p>\n<p>To further enhance its robustness and functionality, Mellow Protocol integrates with a variety of DeFi primitives and infrastructures. This integration provides best user experience, enabling seamless interaction with other financial tools and services within the ecosystem. Future iterations of Mellow Protocol are planned to include advanced features such as dynamic rebalancing of vault allocations to optimize risk-adjusted returns and minimize potential losses due to market volatility.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overview of Restaking\n<ul>\n<li>Through restaking protocols, stakers can choose to accept additional slashing conditions on their staked ETH for rewards from protocols whose state is secured by stakers’ assets.</li>\n<li>Typical design enables the validation of various modules, including consensus protocols for L2s and appChains, data availability layers, virtual machines &amp; application layers, creating new revenue opportunities for restakers.</li>\n<li>Restaking protocols share the abundant security of Ethereum consensus by spilling it over to these modules, enhancing the reliability of their consensus and adding extra revenue source to restakers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Launching LRTs will be permissionless for curators/users\n<ul>\n<li>Although LRTs permit delegation to multiple AVS operators, permissioned LRT holders and LRT node operators have little to no choice in how these delegation sets are formed or how risks are managed.</li>\n<li>Holders can only make adjustments by changing the amount of LRT to which they are exposed.</li>\n<li>Allowing LRT curators to issue new LRTs with refined risk/reward ratios in a permissionless manner makes the possibility of malfunctions causing ripple effects and liquidation cascades across the entire ecosystem remote and unlikely.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fees mechanism for curators\n<ul>\n<li>LRT curators are incentivized to set a competitive fee on restaking revenue.

This allows for thorough testing of each module’s logic. We achieve 100% test coverage for each component and perform internal audits, ensuring high code quality and robust security for each component.</p>\n<p>Upon completion, we assess potential edge effects that may arise when integrating various components, including external modules. Previously, when implementing ALM (automated liquidity management) strategies in Mellow, we developed integrations with other DeFi protocols, requiring a deep understanding of not only our own architecture but also that of integrated protocols like Aave and Uniswap. We’ve never had a single security incident.</p>\n<p>We collaborate with renowned security experts and audit firms, including Chainsecurity, Statemind, and Spearbit, and we only release code to production after it has passed external audits.</p>\n<p>Maintaining security for our on-chain products is equally critical. We use real-time monitoring systems, Grafana dashboards and alerting systems to ensure operational integrity, provide tools for problem diagnosis, and also make it a prerequisite to have a public bug bounty program.</p>\n<p>Our Incident Response and Recovery Policy outlines the procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents. It also details recovery steps, such as reverting to secure contract versions and notifying affected parties.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that our products have been operational for over 1.5 years without a single security incident.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"how-will-mellow-help-the-lido-alliance-achieve-its-mission-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#how-will-mellow-help-the-lido-alliance-achieve-its-mission-5\"></a>How will Mellow help the Lido Alliance achieve its mission</h1>\n<p>New integration with Mellow will benefit the whole Lido ecosystem and stakers, making stETH a one-stop vehicle for delegation to operators and different AVSes. stETH liquidity may be increased in addition to becoming prime LST vehicle available for onboarding to Mellow LRT.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum-alignment and commitment to decentralize validation\n<ul>\n<li>By participating in the wide restaking ecosystem, Mellow would help to spread the geographical and technical decentralization efforts Lido does outside Ethereum validation.</li>\n<li>As ETH has moved from Lido to EigenLayer, the weighted average node operator set has <a href=\"https://x.com/enshriningplebs/status/1792304095950242075\">become significantly more concentrated</a>, presenting a risk to decentralized validation</li>\n<li>By encouraging users to use stETH in Mellow, we hope to increase the level of validator decentralization in restaking, positively influencing Ethereum integrity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Use-cases for stETH adoption and integration\n<ul>\n<li>stETH users will find new opportunities to deposit their assets in a restaking marketplace that is more transparent and offers more granularity with regards to risk exposure</li>\n<li>stETH holders may benefit from exclusive opportunities for earning Mellow points</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Opportunities for node operators\n<ul>\n<li>Lido node operators could launch their own composable LRT and take control of the risk management process by selecting AVS’ suitable for their needs rather than face their imposition by LRTs or restaking protocols</li>\n<li>They could also collaborate with curators to reach the same outcome and create bespoke LRTs for their customers, based on stETH</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-mellow-expect-from-lido-alliance-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#what-does-mellow-expect-from-lido-alliance-6\"></a>What does Mellow expect from Lido Alliance</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Endorsement\n<ul>\n<li>Lido DAO’s acceptance of Mellow as a member of the Lido Alliance</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Integrations\n<ul>\n<li>Mellow expects Lido to integrate descriptions and links to deposits in Mellow UI in stETH into the Lido landing page.

In recent years, the Interchain has experienced tremendous growth in user experience, developer functionality, and market cap.</p>\n<p>Throughout this time, the Interchain has maintained a close connection with Ethereum through both its cultural values (decentralization and credible neutrality) and its technology stack. Notably, the Interchain stack has inspired the Ethereum development community to work on single-slot finality, protocol-enforced proposer commitments, application-specific rollups, Ethereum IBC, liquid staking modules, and more.</p>\n<p>To address the challenges of building Interchain DeFi applications, a team spun out of P2P to form Hadron Labs and helped launch Neutron, a secure, feature-rich smart contract platform capable of hosting <a href=\"https://blog.neutron.org/neutron-the-integrated-application-network-2944b2e2cade\">Integrated Applications</a> like Drop.</p>\n<p>Taking Neutron to market, Hadron Labs, in collaboration with Lido contributors, spearheaded the introduction of wstETH into the Interchain while prioritizing security and safeguarding the DAO against vendor lock-in. As part of this initiative, Hadron Labs and Axelar collaborated to deploy the<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-cosmos-initial-deployment/5338/2\"> initial bridge solution</a> and incentivize the adoption of the canonical wstETH standard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://drop.money\">Drop</a> is the spiritual successor of the Lido for the Interchain vision. Its software was initially developed by Hadron Labs engineers, and an independent Drop Foundation was incorporated to support the protocol’s long-term growth and development.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"protocol-overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#protocol-overview-4\"></a>Protocol Overview</h1>\n<p>Drop is a cross-chain liquid staking protocol implemented as an <a href=\"https://blog.neutron.org/neutron-the-integrated-application-network-2944b2e2cade\">Integrated Application</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.neutron.org/\">Neutron</a> network. Its <a href=\"https://cosmwasm.com/\">CosmWasm</a> smart-contract architecture leverages the <a href=\"https://ibc.cosmos.network/main\">Inter-Blockchain Communication</a> (IBC) protocol and Neutron’s <a href=\"https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-txs/overview\">Interchain Transaction</a> (ICTX) and <a href=\"https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-queries/overview\">Interchain Queries</a> (ICQ) capabilities to read the state of other blockchains and adjust delegations made by the protocol’s remotely controlled accounts.</p>\n<p>This architecture enables Drop to provide trust-minimized liquid staking services and scale with minimal additional overhead and risk: provided they are compatible with the IBC protocol, new networks and assets can be onboarded to the solution in a single transaction. The smart-contract components can be reused to provide new products and services (such as alternative LST models - rebasing, auto-compounding, bLuna-esque, etc.) with minimal or no additional code or attack surface.</p>\n<p>Since on-chain performance metrics such as uptime and governance participation can be retrieved in a trust-minimized manner through ICQs, Drop’s validator set management baseline can be automated:</p>\n<p>This frees up resources that can be invested in the active curation of excellent validator sets for the supported network. To further the decentralization of stake and infrastructure, the Drop DAO may incorporate off-chain considerations such as geography, infrastructure, and signing setups into its curation policy.</p>\n<p>Future iterations of Drop Protocol will likely implement Scaling Delegations, distributing stake across validators dynamically to maximize stake/infrastructure distribution, and to minimize slashing risks if an operator’s performance degrades.</p>\n<p>As an Integrated Application, Drop is synchronously composable with an array of DeFi primitives, including Duality (Neutron’s in-protocol orderbook), Astroport (Curve v2 style AMM), Mars (credit protocol enabling lending/borrowing, margin trading, and perps), Levana (perps), Apollo (vault strategies), Fission (yield splitting), Amulet (self-repaying loans), and more. This ecosystem forms a strong, coordinated set of use cases for Drop’s LSTs and their initial distribution, and provides a streamlined, synchronous UX for more advanced use cases such as delta-neutral or leveraged staking/farming.</p>\n<p>Drop is being integrated into key infrastructure and distribution channels such as the Skip API (the most widely used cross-chain router in the Interchain), Nexus (the leading bridge for TIA to Celestia rollups), and more to facilitate 1-click access to Drop’s LSTs from any network or application in the Interchain.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"how-will-drop-help-the-lido-alliance-achieve-its-mission-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#how-will-drop-help-the-lido-alliance-achieve-its-mission-5\"></a>How will Drop help the Lido Alliance achieve its mission?</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"ethereum-alignment-decentralized-validation-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#ethereum-alignment-decentralized-validation-6\"></a>Ethereum alignment / decentralized validation</h2>\n<p>Firstly, through its validator set management, Drop could contribute to the decentralization of data-availability layers (e.g. Celestia) and bridges (e.g. Axelar) that Ethereum rollups and wstETH rely on.</p>\n<p>As a more nimble DAO, Drop is likely to be the first to implement technologies that could prove valuable to Lido on Ethereum, such as scaling delegations, generating strategic insight and data on their effectiveness and trade-offs, and helping design and prioritize improvements to the core protocol.</p>\n<p>More broadly, Drop will contribute to the success of the Interchain, which has consistently generated research, innovation, and technologies that benefit Ethereum and its ecosystem, such as single-slot finality, protocol-enforced proposer commitments, application-specific rollups, Ethereum IBC, etc.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"use-cases-for-steth-adoption-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#use-cases-for-steth-adoption-7\"></a>Use cases for stETH adoption</h2>\n<p>Drop already allocates significant resources to helping design and build distribution and use cases for LSTs in the Interchain. Onboarding Drop to the Lido Alliance would empower Drop to actively drive the distribution and integration of wstETH alongside dAssets, and reduce the operational overhead and focus cost on Lido DAO contributors.</p>\n<p>Drop will contribute to the security, resilience, and user experience of the bridges upon which wstETH and dAssets depend. Thanks to its strategic proximity with the Cosmos Hub’s security aggregation, Mesh Security, and other key projects, it is also well positioned to sponsor the adoption of wstETH as restaking collateral in the Interchain.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Lido Alliance, Drop would be an ideal partner to explore restaking opportunities for wstETH. Drop’s architecture minimizes systemic risk to Lido on Ethereum, and incentive alignment between Lido and Drop would prevent the incentive to vampire attack that other providers may be tempted with.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Lido DAO could use Drop’s protocol architecture as a local outpost for Lido on Ethereum, enabling ETH to be staked with Lido on Ethereum remotely and conveniently.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"opportunities-for-node-operators-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#opportunities-for-node-operators-8\"></a>Opportunities for node operators</h2>\n<p>While inclusion in Lido on Ethereum’s set does not guarantee node operators will be onboarded to Drop’s validator sets, excellent operators that are active in both ecosystems may apply and be onboarded to Drop’s validator sets in the Interchain, driving adoption and strengthening alignment between Lido and its ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-is-drops-security-culture-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#what-is-drops-security-culture-9\"></a>What is Drop’s Security Culture?</h1>\n<p>Drop’s <a href=\"https://github.com/hadronlabs-org/drop-contracts\">codebase</a> is open-source and open-licensed. As a cross-chain protocol, Drop’s architecture minimizes the complexity of asynchronous interactions by following the principle of encapsulated complexity:</p>\n<p>Most protocol functions are broken down into minimal components, which can interface with one another according to strictly defined interfaces. This makes the protocol and its components formally verifiable and helps create a library of secure, battle-tested contracts. This prevents the creation of large, complex, monolithic contracts, which are harder to audit and reason about, and minimizes the risk of human error. It also enables basic components to be securely reused in different combinations to provide new products while minimizing code changes.</p>\n<p>Drop’s codebase has, and will continue to be, thoroughly tested throughout its development cycle. Drop employs both unit tests and comprehensive E2E tests using <a href=\"https://github.com/neutron-org/cosmopark\">cosmopark</a>. The framework’s purpose is to set up the most realistic testing environment possible by spinning up multiple networks, each with its own nodes and the same software versions as their mainnet counterparts, along with IBC channels and relayers, before conducting a battery of tests on the protocol.</p>\n<p>Drop recently completed its first audit with <a href=\"https://www.oaksecurity.io/\">Oak Security</a>, a leading CosmWasm auditing firm. The final audit report will be attached to this proposal upon release from Oak Security. A second audit is being scheduled with <a href=\"https://osec.io/\">OtterSec</a> ahead of launch.</p>\n<p>Starting on the 27th of May, Drop will also undergo formal verification by <a href=\"https://informal.systems/\">Informal Systems</a> using <a href=\"https://github.com/informalsystems/quint\">Quint</a>. This process aims to increase confidence in Drop’s design by ensuring that the system’s behavior—defined within a formal model—satisfies specific properties, which are also delineated in the formal model.</p>\n<p>An early version of Drop is currently deployed on <a href=\"https://docs.neutron.org/deployment/testnet\">pion-1</a>, Neutron’s persistent testnet. The protocol’s instance is being updated to match changes made as part of the Oak Security audit. Once Drop is deployed on mainnet, any further code or protocol parameters changes will be required to undergo comprehensive tests using <a href=\"https://github.com/hadronlabs-org/rehearsal\">Rehearsal</a>, a mainnet forking and testing tool that ensures tests are conducted within the context of the network’s existing state. Drop’s development team has an established set of practices for any on-chain operations through the process of creating detailed launch policies with the set of actions to be performed, check-lists, and emergency scenarios.</p>\n<p>Drop contributors are also setting up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for balance states, code versions, processing of the protocol’s buffers, validator performance, IBC channel statuses, and more. Lastly, granular kill switches have been implemented into the protocol, and an emergency playbook is being developed for the DAO. These kill switches enable the pausing of specific protocol functions to properly respond to any incident without unnecessarily hindering the user experience or third-party integrations.</p>\n<p>A bug bounty program with Immunefi will be set up shortly after mainnet deployment.</p>\n<p>As an Integrated Application on Neutron, Drop inherits the full economic security of more than $2bn ATOM restaked on the Cosmos Hub through <a href=\"https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/\">Replicated Security</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-drop-expect-from-the-lido-alliance-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#what-does-drop-expect-from-the-lido-alliance-10\"></a>What does Drop expect from the Lido Alliance</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Endorsement - the DAO endorses Drop, and Drop becomes the first member of the Lido Alliance</li>\n<li>Integration and communication support - to the extent possible and where appropriate, integrate Drop with community distribution channels, such as websites, etc, and support large Drop announcements</li>\n<li>Liquidity bootstrapping - coordinate activities and research with LOL to support Drop/wstETH liquidity on Interchain</li>\n<li>Network - Lido DAO contributors support the adoption of Drop through their network of partners</li>\n<li>Consultation - Drop anticipates benefiting from the Lido contributor groups’ extensive expertise in different aspects of the ecosystem and technology</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All other core responsibilities will be handled by the Drop team.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"how-much-alignment-collateral-will-be-locked-in-the-alliance-legal-vehicle-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#how-much-alignment-collateral-will-be-locked-in-the-alliance-legal-vehicle-11\"></a>How much alignment collateral will be locked in the Alliance legal vehicle?</h1>\n<p>100,000,000 DROP tokens (10% of the total supply) will be sent to a Lido Alliance legal entity after TGE, with a 12 months lock followed by 24 months linear vesting with no cliff.</p>\n<br>\n<p>May 2024</p>\n<p>Author: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/d_argunov\">@d_argunov</a>, with thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/kai\">@kai</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/adcv\">@adcv</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/spaydh\">@spaydh</a> for their thoughts and comments</p>\n<p>Edit:</p>\n<p>Modified the collateral lock requirement based on the community feedback</p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-onboard-drop-to-the-lido-alliance/7556\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-onboard-drop-to-the-lido-alliance/7556","pubDate":"Fri, 24 May 2024 14:17:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7556"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-onboard-drop-to-the-lido-alliance/7556.rss","#text":"Proposal: Onboard Drop to the Lido Alliance"}}]}}}
