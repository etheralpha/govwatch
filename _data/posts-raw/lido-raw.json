This change aims to directly align staker rewards with the protocol’s primary activity and revenue source, enhancing value accrual to $LDO token holders and improving the overall Lido ecosystem’s health.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To enhance the $LDO token utility, align incentives across the Lido ecosystem, and provide direct, tangible benefits to $LDO stakers through $ETH rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Revenue Sharing Mechanism Adjustment</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Previous Proposal</strong>: A portion of Lido DAO revenue is redirected to buy back $LDO tokens, distributing them to $LDO stakers. (Awful idea, don’t think of it again, thanks)</li>\n<li><strong>Proposed Change</strong>: Redirect a configurable percentage (40-50%, governed by Lido DAO voting) of Lido DAO’s revenue from the protocol treasury directly to $LDO stakers in the form of $ETH.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Implementation of ETH Distribution</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distribute $ETH to $LDO stakers on a weekly basis, proportional to their staked $LDO tokens.</li>\n<li>Maintain the proposed vesting period of 14 days for the distributed $ETH to ensure long-term alignment and commitment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Insurance Fund Considerations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uphold the establishment of a minimum threshold for the LidoDAO insurance fund.</li>\n<li>In the event of a fund reserve shortfall, prioritize fund replenishment through the same revenue redirection mechanism, temporarily pausing $ETH distributions if necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Staking Terms and Conditions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retain the proposed 14-day unstaking cooldown period for $LDO stakers to support protocol stability.</li>\n<li>Implement a risk mitigation mechanism that aligns with industry standards, ensuring the sustainability of the rewards system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Benefits of the Proposed Change</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Direct Value</strong>: $LDO stakers receive rewards in $ETH, offering immediate and tangible value from their participation in the protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Aligned Incentives</strong>: Rewarding stakers in $ETH ensures alignment between the protocol’s success and the stakers’ benefits, fostering a healthier ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>We propose initiating a discussion period of 7 days for community feedback, followed by a signaling vote on Snapshot.</p>\n<p>This period will allow us to refine the proposal further and ensure it meets the community’s needs and expectations.</p>\n<p>By adjusting the rewards mechanism to distribute $ETH, we aim to provide a more compelling and beneficial staking proposition for $LDO token holders, ensuring the Lido protocol’s continued growth and success.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-for-lido-staking-eth-rewards-for-ldo-stakers/7123\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-for-lido-staking-eth-rewards-for-ldo-stakers/7123","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 23:19:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7123"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-for-lido-staking-eth-rewards-for-ldo-stakers/7123.rss","#text":"Proposal for Lido Staking: $ETH Rewards for $LDO Stakers"}},{"title":"Holesky Safe - Q2/2024 Budget Provision - Support & Maintenance","dc:creator":"Eduardo_Protofire","category":"Community Grants / Initiatives","description":"<p>Hi team, I hope everyone is well!</p>\n<p>Following the proposal made by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/ivan_protofire\">@Ivan_Protofire</a> (<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/safe-ex-gnosis-safe-deployment-on-holesky/5726\">Safe (ex.

In the worst case of false-positive (pause contracts if no vulnerability is present), the potential downside is limited (only withdrawals get paused, and only by limited time). In that case, leaving the protocol the option to react faster-than-governance-flow seem to be a good call. In the future, committee-driven safety mechanics could be changed to a permissionless zk-proof system. Still, that future is quite far away: it requires both the maturing of production-level zk-based tech and the ossification of withdrawals part of the Lido on Ethereum.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposed-decision-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#proposed-decision-3\"></a>Proposed decision</h3>\n<p>It’s proposed to use the new instance of the GateSeal Blueprint, deployed with GateSeal Factory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GateSeal Blueprint: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xEe06EA501f7d9DC6F4200385A8D910182D155d3e\">0xEe06EA501f7d9DC6F4200385A8D910182D155d3e</a></li>\n<li>GateSeal Factory: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x6c82877cac5a7a739f16ca0a89c0a328b8764a24\">0x6c82877cac5a7a739f16ca0a89c0a328b8764a24</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GateSeal Factory and GateSeal Blueprint contracts were audited during the V2 upgrade: <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/?tab=readme-ov-file#04-2023-statemind-gateseals-audit\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - lidofinance/audits</a></p>\n<p>The new instance of GateSeal will be deployed and announced under the post.

Tokens are transferred from the DAO Treasury to the Stonks instance via Easy Track top up factories or Aragon vote.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Order placement. TMC requests Stonks to deploy a new Order contract via placeOrder function and it automatically sends all available assets there. After deployment the Order emits an event about it’s creation, sets an allowance to the CoW vault relayer contract and waits until this order is completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Order creation. Easy Track UI checks for <code>Order Created</code> events and if it detects one, allows TMC to create an offchain order on Cow Protocol. This UI is trustless and can be used by anyone. The order price is checked against price tolerance parameters to simultaneously provide some margin to cover CoW Protocol fees + minor price fluctuations, but restrict from executing significantly unfavourable swaps (more details are in the <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/6fmMnLqoQcq3LqFYcIdMwQ?view#Price-checking\">specification</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>.

The idea is to create a canonical version of <code>stETH</code> on these networks, being wrapped on top of <code>wstETH</code> (sort of ‘wrapped twice’). This approach will streamline the process of moving <code>stETH</code> across Ethereum rollups, making use of the existing <code>wstETH</code> infrastructure and liquidity venues on L2 networks.</p>\n<p>As a practical example, explore a design of upgrading the <code>wstETH</code> custom bridge on the Optimism network. The design relies on the previously presented <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2/tree/main/contracts/optimism\"><code>lido-l2</code></a> reference architecture and can be easily re-used for the OP-stack compatible networks or fairly simply adjusted for diverge rollup solutions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-on-wsteth-vs-steth-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#motivation-on-wsteth-vs-steth-2\"></a>Motivation on wstETH vs stETH</h2>\n<p>The wstETH token has been successfully integrated on various L2s: Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, zkSync Era, Linea, Mantle providing the ultimate easiness for DeFi integrations being a straightforward value-accruing token using the ‘lock-and-mint’ L1→L2 bridging approach.</p>\n<p>In contrast to wstETH, stETH depends on the rate changes to recalculate each user’s balance (e.g., perform a <a href=\"https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/lido#rebase\">rebase</a>). There is an essential UX property: the stETH token balance represents the underlying Ether value expected to be redeemed 1:1 via the protocol upon a withdrawal request.</p>\n<p>Beyond just updating an account’s balance in the wallet, having rebasable stETH on L2 hypothetically unlocks the following use cases and scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>staking/withdrawal requests originated from L2s with accuracy accounting for the stETH rebases that occurred during the bridging period</li>\n<li>performing gas payments in <code>stETH</code> with amounts corresponding to ether on rollups that opted in to support token gas payments (e.g., following the Account Abstraction)</li>\n<li>cross-domain <code>stETH</code> deposits/withdrawals (L1 and L2s) for CEXes</li>\n<li>custodians and service providers to support L2s directly (DeFi interactions, deposits/withdrawals) as they can charge fees with each rebase while users still see their balance changing each day</li>\n<li>once main routine user activity migrated from L1 to L2, there should be UX available as it was previously (rebasable token)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-and-flows-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#abstract-and-flows-3\"></a>Abstract and flows</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/e/e58452e98b584c6a44b8c2f3cfe97536f6eb71f9.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wKoQhL7JGpJW6VW314UsY8RkAbf.png?dl=1\" title=\"threeNewFlows\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/e/e58452e98b584c6a44b8c2f3cfe97536f6eb71f9_2_679x500.png\" alt=\"threeNewFlows\" data-base62-sha1=\"wKoQhL7JGpJW6VW314UsY8RkAbf\" width=\"679\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/e/e58452e98b584c6a44b8c2f3cfe97536f6eb71f9_2_679x500.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/e/e58452e98b584c6a44b8c2f3cfe97536f6eb71f9_2_1018x750.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/e/e58452e98b584c6a44b8c2f3cfe97536f6eb71f9_2_1358x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"212940\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The ‘lock-and-mint’ wstETH bridge extension (i.e., <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2/tree/main/contracts/optimism\"><code>lido-l2</code></a>) introduces a set of the new bridging flows:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"bridging-steth-from-l1-to-l2-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#bridging-steth-from-l1-to-l2-4\"></a>Bridging stETH from L1 to L2</h4>\n<p>User locks stETH, and the bridge contract wraps it into wstETH.

Therefore, the L2 bridge mints wstETH and wraps it back to stETH.</p>\n<p>The design facilitates the L2 stETH bridged amount is being the same as was sent from L1 in most cases by attaching the token rate data with each bridging request.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"bridging-back-steth-from-l2-to-l1-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#bridging-back-steth-from-l2-to-l1-5\"></a>Bridging back stETH from L2 to L1</h4>\n<p>The bridge transfers stETH from a user upon request,  unwraps it to wstETH, and burns that wstETH on L2 side. The amount of burned tokens is then forwarded through the established path with the goal of receiving stETH on the L1 end. To achieve this, the L1 bridge, in turn, unlocks wstETH and unwraps it to stETH.</p>\n<p>Since the withdrawal process can take up to a week (a common case for optimistic rollups), it’s expected that the stETH amount will be different on the L1 side upon the withdrawal completion due to rebases happened during the withdrawal delay (i.e., challenge period) of a rollup, and user rewards/penalties will be attributed properly.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"forwarding-the-wstethsteth-in-protocol-rate-from-l1-to-l2-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#forwarding-the-wstethsteth-in-protocol-rate-from-l1-to-l2-6\"></a>Forwarding the wstETH/stETH in-protocol rate from L1 to L2</h4>\n<p>Include the token rate as a part of the calldata in each L1 to L2 bridging request.

To achieve this, the same approach of <code>L1-&gt;L2</code> messaging is used, while the inclusion itselft is guaranteed when the sequencing window duration passes (e.g., 12h for Optimism, 24h for Arbitrum).</p>\n<p>It’s also assumed that general rollup failures and communication loss of <code>L1-&gt;L2</code> messaging would mean that L2 blocks are not produced and the L2 state is not going forward.

Each delegate will be able to use the voting power of multiple delegated voters.</p>\n<p>Alongside that, it’s proposed to add <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lidodao-token-rewards-plan-trp/3364\">TRP (Token Rewards Plan)</a> participants the ability to delegate their LDO rewards.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"projects-objective-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#projects-objective-4\"></a>Projects objective</h2>\n<p>Three vectors can be directly or indirectly solved through on-chain delegation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Activate the voting power of the voters who are already involved in the governance process and have delegated their voting power on off-chain <a href=\"http://snapshot.org/\">snapshot.org</a> but have never participated in on-chain voting.</li>\n<li>Ease the on-chain voting process for those who are already involved in the governance process and participate in on-chain voting but irregularly. There are various reasons for this: limited and complex access to cold wallets given the short 48-hour voting phase or multi-sig as a token holder.</li>\n<li>Attract those willing to participate in the governance process when Lido DAO determines an open delegation mechanism with a list of delegates.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Contributors to the DAO operations value stream are targeting a 20-30M LDO increase in the quarterly active voting power participation for on-chain votes (for Q4 2023, the quarterly active VP on on-chain votes accounted for ~90M LDO, and on off-chain <a href=\"http://snapshot.org/\">snapshot.org</a> ~120M LDO).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"design-requirements-and-trade-offs-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#design-requirements-and-trade-offs-5\"></a>Design Requirements and trade-offs</h2>\n<p>A proper full-fledged delegation mechanism involves maintaining an accounting to track actual delegated voting power at any moment accurately. Implementing this is a complex and time-consuming project.</p>\n<p>The current solution is a simplified version that addresses three basic requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is a mapping of token holders’ and delegates’ addresses; the token holder can set a delegate and cancel the delegation, and the delegate can obtain the addresses of all those who have delegated to them.</li>\n<li>A delegate can vote on behalf of a token holder or a list of token holders.</li>\n<li>A token holder has an ultimate authority, they can override the delegate’s decision on a vote.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/mag_right.png?v=12\" title=\":mag_right:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":mag_right:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> You can dive into the design description of the solution in the <strong>specification: <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-21.md\">LIP-21.

The Original Program consists of sharing some of the middleware usage fees with selected applicants who have demonstrated their commitment to furthering the adoption of stETH.</p>\n<p>The Original Program was detailed in<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/tiered-rewards-share-program-a-sustainable-approach-to-steth-growth/4851\"> this forum post</a> and approved by<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x9279cd4addefdd9185d024f471f1a29561f61556ae209cdda5dffb1fd73b181e\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Snapshot</a> (end date June 30, 2023).</p>\n<p>While test driving the Original Program since its launch, the Rewards Share Committee (the “<strong>Committee</strong>”) noticed that the Original Program was not as effective as hoped. It found that Participants that had not previously attracted large levels of stETH adoption (in the range of 40,000 - 50,000 stETH) did not attract new stETH adoption after being onboarded to the Program, meanwhile it produced stress and load on the contributors to keep it alive.</p>\n<p>Based on this experience, the Committee has identified a number of changes that are required to enable the Original Program to operate more effectively.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#proposal-2\"></a>Proposal</h1>\n<p>On behalf of the Committee, I propose the following new Rewards-Share Program to replace the Original Program:</p>\n<p>As with the Old Program, the new program helps spread awareness about liquid staking technology and liquid staking tokens like stETH. The program consists of sharing some of the middleware usage fees with selected applicants who have demonstrated their commitment to furthering the adoption of stETH.</p>\n<p>The program operates in three-phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Onboarding</strong>: This phase involves the initial application and evaluation process. Prospective participants need to meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the proposal below. The Committee will review and vote on applications, then add the accepted addresses to the program. As part of this phase the Committee shall be free to and may negotiate bespoke terms with promising prospective participants (the “<strong>Agreed Terms</strong>”).</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards-Share</strong>: Once onboarded, participants who attract new ETH are eligible for rewards-share. The Committee will monitor participants’ stETH contributions and calculate rewards based on the Agreed Terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Offboarding</strong>: The program is designed with defined termination points for all participants. The offboarding phase happens either when a participant voluntarily leaves the program, does not renew their participation, gets disqualified due to violation of the program’s rules or the Agreed Terms, is discontinued by a DAO vote, or the rewards pool for rewards-share is exhausted and not renewed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of these phases is explained in detail below.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"onboarding-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#onboarding-3\"></a>Onboarding</h1>\n<p>Prospective participants can be wallets, institutions, protocols, crypto services, neobanks, and custody services, or other types of participants with solutions that are capable of integrating the Lido middleware solution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minimum Threshold</strong>: Participants must demonstrate that they have already driven at least 40,000 ETH in stake coming from users of the Lido Middleware .</li>\n<li><strong>Committee Discretion</strong>: If an applicant does not meet the Minimum Threshold, the Committee can still assess applications from projects that show potential for driving stETH adoption. Evaluating factors may include the uniqueness of the product or any other qualities that the Committee recognizes as indicative of future growth potential. All Committee decisions are final and are not subject to review.</li>\n<li><strong>Commitment</strong>: Participants must not breach applicable laws and have to resort only to legal means when advocating for the further adoption of the stETH liquid staking token. Participants are free to advocate for the adoption of alternative liquid staking tokens (ALSTs) and liquid staking solutions, but must not do this in a way that shows the middleware or stETH in a bad light, must not use derogatory language when referring to the middleware solution or stETH and/or should use the same or very similar amounts of efforts to spread awareness about stETH as it does for ALSTs.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing compliance with the program</strong>: As described below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Application Process</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Committee will review applications and make a decision on whether to reject or accept an applicant.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The identity of participants will not be public, however participants’ addresses and rewards-share amounts may be publicly disclosed.</li>\n<li>The applicants will be eligible to earn rewards from the date they are accepted.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Applications must have the following information and be submitted to the Committee:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Platform name</li>\n<li>Background information</li>\n<li>Evidence that the Minimum Threshold has been met</li>\n<li>How you intend to make use of the program</li>\n<li>Ethereum address and if it is an externally owned account (EOA) or smart-contract (this will determine how transfers are made)</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Update a public record with the participant’s address (only addresses, no names).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Applicants (both successful and unsuccessful) will not be reimbursed for any time, costs or expenses incurred in applying for the program. Decisions of the Committee are final.</p>\n<p><strong>Program compliance and conditions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Participants are expected to comply with the rules of the program on an ongoing basis and not just on the date they apply to be included.

The percentage is determined by the Committee during the application process and applies for a period of 12 months, or such other period as may be agreed by the Committee in exceptional cases (the “<strong>Rewards Share Percentage</strong>”). The maximum Rewards Share Percentage that the Committee may agree to is 50% of the DAO’s 5% share of staking rewards - i.e. 2.5%).</p>\n<p>For each individual ETH staked as a result of the rewards share program participants’ efforts, those participants shall be entitled to rewards for a period of 12 months starting from the date the ETH was staked, or such other period agreed by the Committee in exceptional cases. The amount of rewards-share is determined by the total cumulative ETH staked by the participant and/or by users via participants’ products and services.</p>\n<p>A participant’s rewards share will be determined by the amount of ETH originating from a participant’s products and services. A necessary prerequisite for the recognition of the staked amount is that the staking transactions must be unambiguously attributable to the participant’s products and services based on the on-chain data. This might be achieved by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The integration of a unique referral code provided to the participants of the previous referral programs that tracks staked ETH</li>\n<li>Or by using on-chain data from a router smart contract that interacts exclusively with the participant’s own tokens and/or tokens belonging to the users of the participant’s products and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Committee can disqualify any staking transactions if they are too ambiguous or difficult to attribute to a participant’s products and services with a sufficient level of confidence.</p>\n<p><em>For example, let’s say prior to enrollment, the amount of ETH staked through participant A’s products and services is 60,000 ETH and the Committee agreed to a 25% Rewards Share Percentage.</em></p>\n<p><em>If as a result of the 60,000 ETH stake a middleware usage fee in the amount of 1,000 ETH is programmatically collected, Participant A would receive 250 ETH as their share (25% of 1000 ETH). This reward-sharing continues for each ETH staked, starting from the date each ETH is staked, and generally lasts for 12 months. If Participant A decides to stake additional ETH during this period, each new ETH will also earn rewards for 12 months from the date it was staked.</em></p>\n<p><em>The actual reward amount could be higher or lower depending on the actual staking rewards generated during this period.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Rewards-Share Calculation</strong></p>\n<p>All participants will be provided a unique referral code, that can be integrated at the website or protocol level, to track ETH they stake using Lido protocol. The Committee will check activity within calendar months (ex. Jan 1st-31st) and will share rewards with participants quarterly or such other period as may be agreed by the Committee.</p>\n<p>These actions determine the amount of rewards-share:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ETH Contribution</strong>: The total amount of ETH staked by relevant users of the Lido middleware, meaning the participants themselves and/or users of their products and services (for avoidance of doubt this does not include swapping ETH for stETH through crypto exchanges).</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards Share Percentage</strong>: the Rewards Share Percentage agreed by the Committee, up to a staking duration: Rewards share lasts 12 months from the time each ETH was staked, unless otherwise agreed by the Committee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>For example, Participant A initially staked 40,000 ETH and the Committee has agreed to a 20% Rewards Share Percentage. Later, they staked an additional 20,000 ETH. Rewards are earned per ETH staked and last for 12 months from the staking date. Thus, Participant A earns rewards for both the initial and additional ETH stakes based on the agreed Rewards Share Percentage.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Rewards-Share Disqualification Activities</strong></p>\n<p>Listed below is a non-exhaustive list of samples of activities that are detrimental to the program and can result in disqualifying ETH from being included in rewards-share. Only ETH involved in disqualification is excluded, not all ETH. The Committee will filter for all new staked ETH within calendar month checking periods. These activities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unstaking: If ETH has been staked and unstaked in a period, then only net amount will be counted towards rewards-share</li>\n<li>Selling stETH on DEXs/CEXs: Trading stETH on decentralized or centralized exchanges</li>\n<li>Cycle-staking: Repeatedly staking ETH, selling or unstaking the resulting stETH, and then staking again</li>\n<li>One-sided stETH liquidity provisioning on DEXs: Providing liquidity for only one side of a decentralized exchange pool</li>\n<li>Secondary leveraged staking: Engaging in leveraged staking on platforms like Aave, Compound, or Spark are eligible for rewards-share. However, rewards-share for stETH originating from leveraged staking will be disqualified if the position risk ratio (borrowed funds/borrow limit) is above 0.95 or if the corresponding staking transactions take place:\n<ul>\n<li>While the deviation of the stETH:ETH swap rate from 1:1 is greater than 1%</li>\n<li>When a temporary increase of the liquidation threshold for (w)stETH collateral is enacted</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>For example, Participant A has contributed 60,000 ETH and the Committee has agreed to a Rewards Share Percentage of 25% of the DAO’s 5% share of staking rewards. However, 10,000 ETH from Participant A are associated with disqualifying activities, such as providing liquidity only on one side of a DEX pool, or repeatedly cycle staking (staking ETH, unstaking it, staking again), the 10,000 ETH associated with this activity will no longer be eligible for the rewards-share.</em></p>\n<p>These activities do not disqualify the participant from the program outright, just the ETH directly involved in disqualification activities. However, if ETH originating from a participant is repeatedly involved in disqualification activities, the Committee can disqualify a participant from the program completely.</p>\n<p>The Committee can disqualify participants if it has reason to believe that a participant is involved in illegal or fraudulent activities.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"unstaked-eth-and-the-social-unstake-deduction-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#unstaked-eth-and-the-social-unstake-deduction-6\"></a>Unstaked ETH and the Social Unstake Deduction</h3>\n<p>Unstaked ETH will be deducted from the amount of tokens eligible for rewards-share. For unstaked ETH that is difficult to track directly to its source <em>(mixed with tokens from other sources, or split between different addresses etc.)</em> - we created the social unstake deduction.</p>\n<p>This technique indirectly adjusts eligible ETH for rewards-share by considering the total unstaked ETH during a calendar month and the proportion of that unstaked ETH contributed by rewards-share participants. This mechanism was invented to overcome limitations imposed by stETH fungibility - it is hardly possible to determine the origin of a particular unstaked token.</p>\n<p><em>For example, imagine a total of 10m ETH staked with 1M ETH coming from the rewards-share program. Participant A is responsible for 900k ETH, and participant B is responsible for 100k ETH. If users unstake 1k ETH with an uncertain origin, the social unstake deduction is applied. In this case, 10% of the 1k unstaked (100 stETH) is used as the deduction and is proportionally deducted from each participant’s share of tokens eligible for rewards-share.</em></p>\n<p>The social unstake deduction will not be enabled by default. It will be used as an emergency brake in case of mass unstaking of participants in the rewards-share program.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the total amount of withdrawals that are difficult to attribute directly to participants in a month exceeds 40% of the average monthly new stake for the last three months, then the social unstake deduction will be applied. By default, the deduction will be disabled the next month if withdrawals don’t exceed the threshold.</li>\n<li>The social unstake deduction will be enabled on a permanent basis if multiple participants are systematically cheating through cycle staking to get higher rewards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"avoiding-the-social-unstake-deduction-with-whitelisted-addresses-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#avoiding-the-social-unstake-deduction-with-whitelisted-addresses-7\"></a>Avoiding the Social Unstake Deduction with Whitelisted Addresses</h3>\n<p>The whitelisted address is a way for participants to avoid the social unstake deduction. stETH sent to the whitelisted address will be exempt from the social unstake deduction but will be subjected to direct unstake deduction instead if withdrawals take place.</p>\n<p><em>For Example, let’s say participant A requests to have their Ethereum address (<code>0x123abc...</code>) whitelisted by the Committee, which is granted. Initially, they decide to stake 60,000 ETH through Lido protocol and send it to the whitelisted address. For as long as the 60,000 stETH is in the whitelisted address, the social unstake deduction is not applied for that 60,000 stETH.</em></p>\n<p>This process allows the Committee to easily track a participant’s contribution.</p>\n<p>The process for creating and defining a whitelisted address is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Request for Whitelisting: A participant submits a request to the Committee to have an address whitelisted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Address Verification: Verifying a participant’s address and identity is used through telegram and discord channels, on-chain analytics, and other sources (ie, social media accounts)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Eligible addresses can be:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Externally owned account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proxy contract</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smart contract</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any Ethereum address that can verify the existence and balance of stETH by the Committee over a rewards period</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"offboarding-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#offboarding-8\"></a>Offboarding</h1>\n<p>The Rewards-Share Program is designed with a predetermined termination point, marking the onset of the offboarding phase. This phase can be triggered under several circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voluntary Departure: Participants may decide to leave the program at their own discretion.</li>\n<li>Non-renewal: After expiry of the agreed period of active participation, participants must reapply for the program. If a participant does not renew their participation, they automatically enter the offboarding phase.</li>\n<li>Disqualification: If a participant violates the program’s rules stipulated herein, they can be disqualified and pushed into the offboarding phase.</li>\n<li>Rewards Share Discontinuation: The DAO reserves the right to vote for the conclusion or non-renewal of the Rewards Pool. If such a vote passes, all participants are moved to the offboarding phase.</li>\n<li>Exhaustion of Rewards Pool: If the Rewards Pool for rewards-share is exhausted and not renewed, all participants will no longer receive rewards-share.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a participant’s status in the program is terminated and is no longer earning rewards-share going forward, stETH before termination will still be earning rewards (e.g. for 12 months from time of actual staking).

This means $LDO token holders can leverage their holdings to engage in strategic trades and potentially increase their returns.</p>\n<p>Revolutionary Interest Rate Model: The new interest rate model dynamically adjusts rates to maintain optimal utilization, maximising lender revenue and minimising borrower costs. This model benefits $LDO token holders by potentially offering higher yields on their deposits.</p>\n<p>Repay Using Collateral: V2 allows users to repay loans and margin trade positions using the position’s collateral. This feature provides flexibility for $LDO token holders, enabling them to manage their investments more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Expanded Asset Availability: Fringe Finance V2 supports a wide range of assets across multiple chains, including $LDO on the Ethereum network. This broad asset support, combined with features like multi-asset lending and integration of advanced price feeds, opens up new avenues for $LDO token holders to diversify their DeFi activities and enhance their earning potential.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"incentive-program-a-catalyst-for-lender-profits-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#incentive-program-a-catalyst-for-lender-profits-2\"></a>Incentive Program: A Catalyst for Lender Profits</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/18QKcLgEMU60sjjCCtJMdtkmKe4.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"18QKcLgEMU60sjjCCtJMdtkmKe4\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_690x388.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"6A694B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This program directly rewards lenders for their deposits, creating a cycle that benefits all participants in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The incentive program is structured around five lender Total Value Locked (TVL) milestones, with rewards issued as each target is met and sustained.</p>\n<p>The rewards, issued in FRIN tokens, are calculated based on the proportion of interest earned by a lender’s deposits relative to the total interest earned on the platform.

This integration will utilize the advantages of distributed validation to significantly enhance security and decentralization. It aims to streamline the onboarding process for new, permissionless operators, with a particular focus on home-stakers, thereby fortifying Lido’s network against potential threats and further decentralizing its operations.

I recently developed and deployed a new primitive for assisting blockchain users with gas fees called <em>Nani EntryPoint Ether</em> (<code>NEETH</code>). The V1 is deployed on the Arbitrum L2 at the verified contract code address: <code>0x0000000000000dea230e8078fb8512969d02f886</code>. And it uses Lido to power smart accounts.</p>\n<p>The way it works is that users deposit ether into NEETH and this is swapped across the UniswapV3 pool for stETH/WETH on Arbitrum. Their output NEETH tokens then represent their stETH contribution to the pool (held in NEETH).</p>\n<p>When users want to pay for transactions from a standard ERC4337 smart account, they can just put the NEETH address as their paymaster (by sending this address (20 bytes) as the <code>paymasterAndData</code> in the 4337 userOp).</p>\n<p>This selection will then trigger NEETH to swap their stETH to ETH to pay for their gas (refunding the 4337 EntryPoint), and burn the same amount of NEETH from their smart account.</p>\n<p>A de minimus mint fee (0.0000333 ether) is sent to a DAO for purposes of assisting in locating security researchers and partners in scaling the NEETH system. Happy to unpack all of this a bit more, but initially, wanted to introduce the V1 implementation to Lido DAO for comment and consideration for deeper integrations.</p>\n<p>Cheers, ross (z0r0z)</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/introducing-neeth-using-lido-to-pay-for-all-your-gas-on-l2/6761\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/introducing-neeth-using-lido-to-pay-for-all-your-gas-on-l2/6761","pubDate":"Thu, 29 Feb 2024 12:58:46 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-6761"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/introducing-neeth-using-lido-to-pay-for-all-your-gas-on-l2/6761.rss","#text":"Introducing NEETH: Using Lido to Pay for All Your Gas on L2"}},{"title":"Blockops Network Proposal for CSM and SDVTM Integration","dc:creator":"haroldsphinx","category":"Community Grants / Initiatives","description":"<p>This is a proposal to extend Blockops Support for Lido CSM in line with <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/request-for-proposal-csm-and-sdvtm-integration/6225\">Lido Request for Proposal</a></p>\n<p>Blockops is a platform that makes it extremely easy for builders, solo-stakers and node-operators to deploy, maintain and manage their nodes ANYWHERE with complete observability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H29mwbwplGBEXNHKps-HtnXp-nKGQ5Yc/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Our Proposal Doc can be found here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Proposal TL;DR</strong></p>\n<p>This is a proposal to extend Blockops Support for Lido CSM and integrating OBOL and SSV DVT for seamless Node Setup, we currently have an integration for Obol Network in our beta version and will like to integrate Lido CSM and SDVTM for Obol and SSV.</p>\n<p>Key Features Blockops currently offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One Click Node Deployment ANYWHERE (only GCP is active in our Beta version)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Node Fleet Management support (client upgrades, upscaling and downscaling of nodes with NO Slashing and Zero Downtime)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customizable Alerts to multiple notification channels</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upstream and Downstream Observability with Telescope: this allows operators to gain full visibility into the performance of their nodes and also allows DVT gains full observability into the performance of the node operators and validators running their client</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>14 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/blockops-network-proposal-for-csm-and-sdvtm-integration/6754\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/blockops-network-proposal-for-csm-and-sdvtm-integration/6754","pubDate":"Thu, 29 Feb 2024 01:24:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-6754"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/blockops-network-proposal-for-csm-and-sdvtm-integration/6754.rss","#text":"Blockops Network Proposal for CSM and SDVTM Integration"}},{"title":"Dappnode Proposal for CSM and SDVTM integration","dc:creator":"Lanski","category":"Community Grants / Initiatives","description":"<p>Answering the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/request-for-proposal-csm-and-sdvtm-integration/6225\">CSM and SDVTM integration RFP</a>, here is Dappnode’s proposal:</p>\n<h1><a name=\"dappnode-overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#dappnode-overview-1\"></a>Dappnode Overview</h1>\n<p>Dappnode is Free Open Source software with the purpose of making deploying, operating and maintaining web3 infrastructure accessible to anyone, regardless of their technical level.</p>\n<p>Its design principles uphold self-sovereignty, privacy and ease of use.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of highly enhancing the ease of use, the Free Open Source Software Dappnode also comes preinstalled in plug-and-play hardware under the name of “Dappnode Home”. This solution is a hardware + software bundle that users can purchase and start using right away.</p>\n<p>The project was born in 2018 and has, since the start of Ethereum PoS, testnets been most likely the most used solution for home stakers to run validators.</p>\n<p>Its users are then assumed to be enthusiasts, solo and home stakers, but also companies and infrastructure providers. Due to the open source nature of the software and the principles of privacy and self-sovereignty that drive the project, there is no telemetry and therefore the picture of Dappnode users is bound to be incomplete.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"dappnodes-approach-on-staking-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#dappnodes-approach-on-staking-2\"></a>Dappnode’s approach on staking</h2>\n<p>Dappnode is a docker-based platform running on top of linux and entirely manageable by the user via GUI, without need of command line, docker knowledge, bash and other DevOps knowledge often associated with running infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Dappnode’s UI connects to a Smart Contract repository on Ethereum in order to populate the “Dappstore”, making the usage of Dappnode independent of Dappnode’s team and unstoppable to the extent the Ethereum network is.

By searching the proposed blocks for validators that have used this graffiti we can assume that they were, at that point, validators running on Dappnode. <a href=\"http://Ethseer.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethseer.io</a> identifies right now around 3300 validators on Dappnode by this metric.

A new, unified UI will allow accessing information about and managing validators while using Dappnode’s preexisting capabilities of deploying the validator stack.</p>\n<p>It includes changes in how Dappnode currently operates to accommodate Lido’s requirements and it puts together a flow that is aimed to be the easiest solution for participating in Lido’s SDVT and CSM modules, just like Dappnode currently aims to be the easiest solution to run a validator.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"integration-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#integration-overview-6\"></a>Integration overview</h2>\n<p>In the spirit of being an end-to-end solution for users, Dappnode aims for integration at the 4 described tiers in the RFP. Mostly the tiers describe CSM-related features, but we have included SDVTM in Tier 0.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"tier-0-software-setup-helper-csm-sdvtm-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#tier-0-software-setup-helper-csm-sdvtm-7\"></a>Tier 0. Software Setup Helper - CSM &amp; SDVTM</h3>\n<p>Dappnode already includes most of the capabilities described in the Tier 0 by default. The Lido module will piggyback on this implementation.</p>\n<p>Dappnode will manage the setting up of CL and EL nodes, validator client and MEV-boost, as well as a web3signer and a UI to manage the keys and facilitate changes of consensus client.</p>\n<p>Since all this functionality is already existing in Dappnode, it is possible that existing validators are already in operation using the system, so a keystore tag structure will be implemented for Lido validators so the FeeRecipient is fixed to Lido’s without user’s intervention. This facilitates the usage for the user and reduces possibility of error.</p>\n<p>Dappnode currently offers users a choice of MEV Boost relays that might or might not coincide precisely with Lido’s allowed relay list. This relay list will be fetched and offered to the user, as well as relays not included in the list will be deactivated when there are Lido active keys in the web3signer.</p>\n<p>We don’t consider the key creation suitable to be integrated in Dappnode because there exist perfectly viable tools that cover that need splendidly, but instead we prefer to guide users to use such tools (like wagyu.gg) and perform checks that the Withdrawal Key has been set correctly. This is a tried and tested approach as this is how currently Dappnode functions. Due to Dappnode’s nature of being a 100% online system, it would be not best practise to generate the keys and provide the mnemonic within itself.</p>\n<p>Within the scope of Tier 0 would be the installation of extra software depending on the module (SSV or Obol for SDVTM) and most likely lido-specific software that would run adjacent to the validator infrastructure stack that offers handy functionality like automatic exit signing - minimizing again the chances for solo stakers to “forget” to check for exits and being penalized, as well as delaying the normal functioning of the Lido system.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Dappnode already includes a configurable telegram bot for alerts that users could use to receive alerts when an exit is required. Integration of these alerts to the bot would be a mix between Tier 1 and 0.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"tiers-1-to-3-csm-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#tiers-1-to-3-csm-8\"></a>Tiers 1 to 3 - CSM</h3>\n<p>Tiers 1 to 3 are not necessarily separated in Dappnode’s suggested implementation: a UI that can serve the 3 tiers of operation.</p>\n<p>Users would log into this UI with a wallet access, which would then enable several displays of information and the possibility of interacting with the CSM, like alerting of exit requests or of bond disadjustments and need for top-up.</p>\n<p>Tier 1. Operator Statistics Monitor mainly consists of “read” functions from the CSM - system information that can be retrieved without log in, and specific information for validators that would be available after log in. This Tier relates closely with the next one as information will be retrieved that needs user action.</p>\n<p>Tier 2. Operator Manager. Helps the user interact with the CSM after logging in, being able to add bond, keys, claim reward and set up reward and manager addresses.</p>\n<p>Tier 3. Full-featured operator UI. Because displaying information and allowing the user to interact with the CSM is no guarantee that the user is guided properly to join the steps, guiding flows and instructions will be provided along the way. The UI will include helpful explanations and user flows through modals for the most common actions (adding a validator - from adding bond to upload into the web3signer through guidance for key generation and sanity checks on such keys).</p>\n<p>The integration in the existing Dappnode UI could also be considered Tier 3, since it is what enables the full flow without the use of command line.</p>\n<p>In prevision for more Modules to be created, a potential implementation of how users would access Lido-related modules could be as follows:</p>\n<p>Packages would be able to be found in the Dappstore, and a special section would be set up for Lido-specific packages.</p>\n<p>The images below are meant to be illustrative and not binding to a particular design. The final deliverable might be different.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/4/4b43ea8103429254627591ccb419e09fd82ae2fa.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/aJPjOXEhTm0XcQzF1cvgMj2yvMK.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/4/4b43ea8103429254627591ccb419e09fd82ae2fa_2_624x311.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"aJPjOXEhTm0XcQzF1cvgMj2yvMK\" width=\"624\" height=\"311\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/4/4b43ea8103429254627591ccb419e09fd82ae2fa_2_624x311.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/4/4b43ea8103429254627591ccb419e09fd82ae2fa_2_936x466.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/4/4b43ea8103429254627591ccb419e09fd82ae2fa_2_1248x622.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C7D0D1\"></a></div><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/9/9a8e2cde3d33094db6e73bac56459d2b61ea27ac.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/m3g8Er8bVWPcfNexDT172SIyZs0.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/9/9a8e2cde3d33094db6e73bac56459d2b61ea27ac_2_624x308.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"m3g8Er8bVWPcfNexDT172SIyZs0\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/9/9a8e2cde3d33094db6e73bac56459d2b61ea27ac_2_624x308.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/9/9a8e2cde3d33094db6e73bac56459d2b61ea27ac_2_936x462.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/9/9a8e2cde3d33094db6e73bac56459d2b61ea27ac_2_1248x616.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F6F3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Expanding beyond Tier 3, it is important to consider that there is Dappnode hardware (Dappnode Home) that comes with the software pre-installed, meaning that <strong>simply by realizing this integration there will be a plug-and-play solution to run SDVTM and CSM</strong>.

While the definition of the CSM integration interfaces is an excellent document that sheds light on a lot of the intricacies of the CSM, it offers no guidance on how such a referral program should work.</p>\n<p>We believe another interface should be prepared to include a referral identifier that can be injected by the integrator, and that the cost of the referral should never affect the Node Operator, echoing <span class=\"mention\">@Alexandra_g</span>’s thoughts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"teamstaking-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#teamstaking-14\"></a>TeamStaking</h3>\n<p>Another Dappnode project with ties to Lido would be the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#TeamStaking</span> initiative. In Team Staking, we propose an end-to-end solution for teams and communities that includes everything needed for them to validate. The initiative bridges through diverse partners, including hardware, DVT software and liquidity. Given Lido’s dominance in the liquidity aspect, we would like to highlight that should the currently discussed proposal be accepted, participants in TeamStaking could opt in to SDVTM and CSM for the liquidity provision should the partner in question have a need for access to this liquidity:</p>\n<p>When we are assessing the needs of the Team to provide them with the end-to-end solution, there might be the case where they either don’t have their own liquidity or they want to leverage the hardware with extra validators to increase the return of the initiative.</p>\n<p>We will then assess their options and guide them to apply for SDVTM tests so they can get whitelisted, or to use CSM if they have a minimum amount of liquidity for a bond.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/dappnode-proposal-for-csm-and-sdvtm-integration/6739\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/dappnode-proposal-for-csm-and-sdvtm-integration/6739","pubDate":"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 21:29:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-6739"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/dappnode-proposal-for-csm-and-sdvtm-integration/6739.rss","#text":"Dappnode Proposal for CSM and SDVTM integration"}},{"title":"Activate Lido Protocol Governance with Revenue Share Staking","dc:creator":"Lidosaviour","category":"Proposals","description":"<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduce the $LDO staking module and buyback program.</li>\n<li>Allow token holders to stake $LDO in exchange for a proportion of Lido DAO revenue (via an $LDO buyback and distribution program).</li>\n<li>Increase $LDO utility by having $LDO stakers serve as insurance providers of last resort.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n<p>Over the past few years, Lido has grown from an early-stage DeFi protocol to the dominant leader in the liquid staking space with over 30.19b in TVL.</p>\n<p>Despite Lido’s success, $LDO token holders don’t directly benefit from the revenue generated by the protocol and $LDO has no direct utility. These points are a principal concern for current and prospective token holders.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to catalyse a discussion and propose a solution to the utility and value-accrual issues facing $LDO.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Introduce $LDO token utility and align protocol incentives between all Lido-associated parties.</p>\n<p><strong>Exact Parameters/Mechanism:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Revenue Share</strong></p>\n<p>a. Redirect 20-50% (toggle-able parameter based on governance) of future Lido DAO revenue from the protocol treasury to stakers of $LDO</p>\n<p>b. The Lido DAO currently has a treasury exceeding [$482m] at the time of writing, including, $127m in major assets.<br>\ni. Since DAO operating costs are an estimated ~$16m annualized 59, the Lido DAO currently has an estimated runway of 30 years, suggesting minimal-to-no operational impact from revenue redirection.</p>\n<p>c. Distribute Lido DAO revenue to $LDO stakers in $LDO tokens weekly through a buyback and distribute mechanism (exact mechanics will be determined separately)<br>\ni. This mechanism allows all $LDO holders (not just stakers) to benefit from the revenue generated by the protocol<br>\nii. All stakers will ‘receive’ tokens every week. All ‘earned’ tokens will be vested for 6-months before distribution.<br>\niii. I propose the buyback be executed on-chain via a VWAP or TWAMM</p>\n<p><strong>2. Set minimum size for the LidoDAO insurance fund</strong><br>\na. As previously discussed, set minimum size of the Lido insurance fund at ~6k stETH<br>\nb. If insurance fund reserves dip below the minimum threshold due to a slashing event, the protocol will redirect all revenue from stakers to the insurance fund until the minimum reserve is re-established.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Staking Terms</strong><br>\na. 14-day unstaking cooldown for all stakers<br>\nb. Potential loss of up to 30% (industry standard) of staked $LDO in the event of a major slashing event<br>\ni. Similar to stAAVE, staked Lido will be auctioned off to the market<br>\nii. Loss waterfall will initially be as follows: insurance fund (once exhausted) → $LDO stakers (up to 30% staked tokens slashed) → socialized loss via stETH holder negative rebase</p>\n<ol>\n<li>While this may make staking $LDO seem high-risk, the Lido staking program will be improved in the future to include NOs, especially after permissionless validators and DVTs are integrated with the staking router. In this case, I’d anticipate NOs will take most of the slashing risk themselves.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Simulation/Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>Source: TokenTerminal, Dune</p>\n<p><code>[Staking APR](https://imgpile.com/i/xaw6wx)</code></p>\n<p>Staking yields will be as depicted in the attached estimations, three cases are assumed with different combinations of $lido staked &amp; revenue share agreed upon.</p>\n<p>In the base case, the staking yield can be expected to be 9.15% (approx) on the basis of 40% revenue share &amp; it is expected that for a conservative Eth bull case of 5k, this could potentially float around 20%.<br>\nNote: It is assumed TVL will grow at 30% in Y+1 &amp; Y+2.</p>\n<p><strong>FAQ/Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Q: Wouldn’t this cause $LDO to face additional regulatory scrutiny (especially from US regulators)?<br>\nA: Perhaps, but the proposed model is an industry-standard, with several DeFi protocols adopting a similar standard over the past 5-yrs including Maker, Aave, and Yearn.</p>\n<p>Q: Is this proposal likely to increase the potential of SEC enforcement action?<br>\nA: The Lido DAO is a fully decentralized organization with no legal entities. Lido DAO’s only tie to the US is the employment of US-based persons as contractors. Lido has not received any enforcement or warning communication from any US-based regulatory body to date.</p>\n<p>Q: This proposal doesn’t quite address additional utility for the LDO token.<br>\nA: Token holders are more aligned with node operators’ success and the protocol’s general success. I also believe that node operators need to be more aligned with the protocol</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>After 7 days of discussion, I propose moving this proposal to a signaling vote on the snapshot.</p>\n<p>I am in the process of drafting a second proposal that will impose an obligation on NOs to stake $LDO. Staked $LDO will ensure validators have skin in the game if they get slashed. IMO this is a necessary strategic move to fortify the alignment of incentives across the protocol. I will share the new proposal in the coming week.</p>\n<p>I’m excited about the future of $LDO and believe that this advancement will help underscore the protocol’s commitment to $LDO token holders as well as continued growth and resilience.</p>\n            <p><small>23 posts - 11 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/activate-lido-protocol-governance-with-revenue-share-staking/6738\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/activate-lido-protocol-governance-with-revenue-share-staking/6738","pubDate":"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 17:16:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-6738"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/activate-lido-protocol-governance-with-revenue-share-staking/6738.rss","#text":"Activate Lido Protocol Governance with Revenue Share Staking"}}]}}}
