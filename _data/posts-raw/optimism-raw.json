By offering gamified experiences, builders are more likely to explore and become interested in the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skill Development</strong>: These games can be designed to incorporate educational elements that teach developers about the Optimism platform, its capabilities, and best practices for building on it. This hands-on learning approach helps developers gain the necessary skills and knowledge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Community Building</strong>: Onchain games foster a sense of community by encouraging collaboration and competition among developers.

However, developers may lack the marketing expertise or resources needed to promote their dApps effectively. Without proper visibility and user engagement, even the most promising projects may struggle to gain traction. By supporting the marketing efforts of these projects, we can help developers reach a wider audience, increase user adoption, and create a feedback loop that drives more developers to join and contribute to the ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39793-mission-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39793-mission-summary-3\"></a>Mission Summary:</h3>\n<p>This mission focuses on not just the development of Optimism dApps but also on ensuring their adoption by providing marketing support. By helping developers handle the marketing side of their projects, we aim to increase the visibility and usage of dApps within the ecosystem. As these applications gain more users, developers will see the growth and success of their efforts, which will further incentivize them to continue developing on the Superchain. This will also attract more developers who see the potential for growth and success in building on Optimism.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39793-goal-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39793-goal-4\"></a>Goal:</h3>\n<p>To support both the development and marketing of Optimism dApps, increasing their adoption and visibility.

By providing marketing support, developers can focus on creating high-quality applications while ensuring that their projects reach their target users.
