For this reason, it is important to understand <strong>how Badgeholders compare to typical active OP users</strong>. This knowledge will help governance make informed decisions in the design and expansion of the Citizen’s House while providing transparency to the public about the voters in the OP Collective. When looking at Badgeholders from the first three rounds of Retro Funding voting, we found that a higher percentage of OP Badgeholders are active in other DAOs, are involved in the creation of NFTs and Smart Contracts and have verified Farcaster accounts in comparison to a control group of active users.</p>\n<p>This study was done in conjunction with the Optimism Foundation as part of a <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1?pane=issue&amp;itemId=63765444\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Foundation Grant</a>.

Through these votes, they have been responsible for distributing over 50 million OP tokens during Retro Funding (RF) rounds. This makes their participation crucial in rewarding impactful work and encouraging continued contributions within the OP Collective. To better understand the influence of Badgeholders and ensure governance decisions are made transparently and equitably, it is important to compare them to typical active OP users. Here we explore OP Badgeholder’s transaction activity, governance participation, social app usage and smart contract deployment to better understand the characteristics of OP Badgeholders.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-40146-methods-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-40146-methods-4\"></a>Methods</h2>\n<p>Our work includes the 132 Badgeholder addresses that acted as voters for Round 3. It is important to note that Badgeholders may hold other addresses and may not exclusively conduct their blockchain activity using the address linked to their Badgeholder status. Indeed, four Badgeholders had only one transaction associated with their address, and 17 had fewer than 10 transactions. However, a substantial portion—31 Badgeholders—were highly active, with more than 1,000 transactions linked to their address.</p>\n<p>We built a representative control group by selecting all non-Badgeholders addresses that conducted at least five transactions on Optimism in the last three months. This threshold was chosen to capture active users while avoiding including inactive or irregular participants. This resulted in a control group of approximately 1,160,000 addresses. We decided to use relatively broad qualifications for the control group to see best how Badgeholders compared to typical active Optimism users. For finer-scale comparisons and statistical tests, we used a random subset of 1,000 users from the control group. This subset was randomly selected from the larger control group.

However, to date, neither Token House nor Citizens’ House has the power to execute code. In fact, governance does not even control its own governance contract. Optimism governance governs exactly nothing in its own right today, relying upon the Foundation to even create proposals. This stands in stark contrast to Optimism’s main competitor, Arbitrum, where the ARB token has complete system control over Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.</p>\n<p>Optimism governance launched more than two years ago. Over this time, governance has matured considerably, with increased capacity for decision making, increasingly robust checks and balances, and professionalization of many elected positions. While there was some early value in the Foundation and OP Labs having all system access powers, that time has passed as both the promised decentralization of power and the business strategy of Optimism have underperformed expectations.</p>\n<p>Transferring all system powers, resources, and access to governance can relieve OP Labs and the Foundation from their burdens, and allow them to focus on the tasks they do best. It will also offer rejuvenation to a system that is currently stagnating with only de minimis progress towards decentralization, and a business strategy that appears to be high in cost and low in benefit.</p>\n<p>Like an aging parent whose own capabilities are no longer growing, we hope Foundation and Labs will embrace our view that it is time to let the Optimism governance provide the vigor, clear direction, and focus on delivering value to tokenholders that they cannot. This is not an attempt to push either entity into irrelevance or diminish their contributions that have helped raise governance to a level of maturity and responsibility that it is ready to take the lead.</p>\n<p>With that goal in mind, we have divided this plan into three phases of decentralization, to be completed by summer of 2025. Phase I, which governance contributors desire to see immediately, consists of resources that are ostensibly owned by governance and governance infrastructure. The immediate handover of control over funds and governance assets does not put any user funds at risk in any way, and does not insert governance into the core smart contracts.</p>\n<p>Phase II consists of items that, while not core contracts of the protocol, are essential infrastructure that will require an orderly handover and cannot realistically be done immediately. They can, however, be accomplished swiftly.</p>\n<p>Phase III is all remaining privileges, access, and control of onchain contracts and assets, and represents a complete decentralization of governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-40129-phase-i-immediate-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-40129-phase-i-immediate-2\"></a><strong>Phase I (Immediate)</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>OP Token Contract Ownership</strong><br>\nUnlike some competitors (like Arbitrum), the OP token has no established rights to execute code, make proposals, share in revenue, or anything else.</p>\n<p>This manifests itself as a lack of interest in OP as a governance token, making it a struggle to convince some users to delegate or vote. In some circles, OP is actually referred to as a meme coin, and not jokingly so.</p>\n<p>Of particular embarrassment is that the OP token does not even own its own contract. Transferring ownership of the token contract to governance is an essential first step in a credible plan to make the OP token serve its intended purpose of governing Optimism.</p>\n<p>Putting the token contract under onchain governance oversight also ensures that basic tasks will get done, like deploying standardized OP token contracts on Superchain member chains and a reliable, quick mint-burn bridge between those chains. This is of particular urgency with the Superchain grants program scheduled to dispense 12,000,000 OP tokens to member chains, but with no way to reliably get those tokens to those chains.</p>\n<p><strong>Governance Contract Ownership</strong><br>\nMuch like with the OP token, the governance contract used for voting is not under governance control. This leaves governance dependent upon the Foundation’s approval to present proposals for a vote. Lack of governance control has also resulted in episodes where the governance contract <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/request-for-information-recent-upgrades-to-governor-contract/7535\">has been upgraded without the knowledge, much less the consent, of governance</a>.</p>\n<p>Because the governance contract currently controls no parameters of Optimism mainnet, giving onchain control of this contract to OP tokenholders can be enacted immediately.</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, governance ownership of the governance contract includes a permissionless way for delegates to submit proposals for a vote.</p>\n<p><strong>Governance Fund Ownership</strong><br>\nThe OP tokens in the Governance Fund should be transferred to an address controlled by the governance contract.</p>\n<p><strong>ETH Collected on Behalf of Optimism Collective Comes Under Governance Control</strong><br>\nThere is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1XtyBu5lvCI6MtMBQPC6ZOnjZ5nbbPw4bOH7WO2Pn7cI/htmlview?pli=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">currently 15,397 ETH collected</a> for the benefit of Optimism governance, spread across several addresses under Foundation or Optimism Labs control. This ETH, minus a buffer for operational costs recommended by Labs, should be transferred to an address on L1 controlled onchain by Optimism governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-40129-phase-ii-concluding-end-of-q1-2025-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-40129-phase-ii-concluding-end-of-q1-2025-3\"></a><strong>Phase II (concluding end of Q1 2025)</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Bridge L1 Escrow Comes Under Governance Control</strong><br>\nOP Bridge currently holds several billion dollars in assets that could be deployed across Ethereum mainnet to generate revenue for Optimism governance. Utilizing bridge assets is being made common by other chains, most notably Blast, Mantle, and Gnosis, with <a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/call-for-feature-requests-polygon-pos-pilani-upgrade/14235\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Polygon looking like it will follow suit</a>.</p>\n<p>While we do not propose a plan for utilizing these assets or any immediate changes in where they are held on L1, we do believe it is a decision for governance to make. This is particularly important from a sustainability perspective, since the current vision for Optimism revenues are tied to sequencer revenues on Optimism and Superchain members. As sequencer revenues trend towards zero over time in an intensely competitive marketplace, the bridge is an obvious way to permanently create sustainable revenue streams over the long term for governance and the maintenance of Optimism.</p>\n<p><strong>Sequencer Decentralization Roadmap</strong><br>\nOP Labs and/or the Foundation should present a plan to decentralize the Optimism mainnet sequencer before the end of March 2025. This plan should include specific actions to take and requirements. The plan also must include a target date to decentralize the sequencer for Optimism before the end of Q2 2025.</p>\n<p>If this date to decentralize the sequencer is determined to be unfeasible within the decentralization plan, then the plan should also present specific actionable steps to ensure the current sequencer operator is directly accountable to governance for major parameters.</p>\n<p><strong>Revisions and Re-Ratification of the Law of Chains</strong><br>\nThe Law of Chains was not drafted by governance, though governance ratified it. The Law of Chains will be reviewed for conflicts with this roadmap and other governance priorities, and revised, or re-ratified as is by governance. A schedule to periodically revisit the Law of Chains will also be established to ensure that it serves the needs of governance in its task to protect, grow, and generate value for Optimism stakeholders.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-40129-phase-iii-concluding-q2-2025-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-40129-phase-iii-concluding-q2-2025-4\"></a><strong>Phase III (concluding Q2 2025)</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Full Control of Optimism by Optimism Governance</strong><br>\nComplete technical control over the Optimism protocol should be handed over to Token House, Citizen’s House, and various bodies appointed or elected by Token and Citizen’s House.

Round by round, the decision on reward distribution is decided by a vote in the Optimism Citizens House.</p>\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/188#issuecomment-2153325539\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GovXS team</a></strong> was chosen to evaluate voting designs for Optimism Retro Funding through the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/188\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Foundation Mission Request: Evaluating Voting Design Tradeoffs for Retro Funding</a>.<br>\nThe objective: Improve Optimism governance accessibility and grow the Optimism Collective’s understanding of optimal voting designs to encourage diverse, informed, and values-aligned voting behavior.<br>\nDelivering on this objective, GovXS developed a new voting evaluation framework drawing from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_theory\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Social Choice Theory</a>. We apply theoretical analysis and agent-based simulations to assess past Retro Funding voting designs across six dimensions:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Resistance to malicious behavior and collusion:</strong> Measure to what extent a malicious voter (or a group of coordinated malicious voters) can impact voting outcomes<br>\n<strong>2. Incentive compatibility:</strong> Prove or disprove that the voting design is<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive_compatibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> incentive compatible</a> (”every participant can achieve their own best outcome by acting according to their true preferences”)<br>\n<strong>3. Simplicity for Voters &amp; Expected Outcome:</strong> Measure if voters can easily understand how the voting design works and how to best achieve their goals<br>\n<strong>4. Majority &amp; Diversity:</strong> Measure if results represent preference of majority or diversity of voters<br>\n<strong>5. Incentives Alignment:</strong> Measure how well the incentives of voters and the Optimism Collective are aligned<br>\n<strong>6. Alignment with Ground Truth in Impact = Profit:</strong> Measure how well the voting design supports finding the objective truth in “impact = profit”.</p>\n<p>The GovXS Voting Evaluation Framework is now available to evaluate voting designs in Retro Funding rounds. Its metrics enable straightforward comparisons, helping select the best-fit designs for each round’s scope while ensuring strong and reliable voting outcomes. Optimism Badgeholders and GovNERDS will be among the first to access and explore the GovXS Voting Evaluation Framework by <a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIqcOGpqDwuGdRw3_Tx4bDB6rW_jrkA9ZGC#/registration\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">registering to attend our workshop on Monday, September 23, 2024, at 5pm UTC</a>.</p>\n<p>In this session, the GovXS team will walk you through the key components of the framework, and showcase the results reviewing past voting designs from Rounds 1–4.

The Foundation is assigning a minimum OP Amount for the round of 1.1M OP and a maximum OP amount of 3.5m OP. Citizens will be able to vote for an OP amount within the range of minimum and maximum which they believe appropriately rewards the impact within the round. The round allocation will be decided by taking the median of Citizens’ votes.</p>\n<p>The voting on the rounds OP allocation is an experiment in community-lead budget allocation.<br>\nThe outcomes of this experiment will inform the evolution of the budgeting process in the future, which is subject to change based on learnings.<br>\nThe following are considerations for the minimum and maximum values set by the Foundation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Retro Funding 3 benchmark</strong>: Approximately 1.1M OP was allocated to Optimism Governance Contributions in Retro Funding 3 at the end of 2023. The minimum round allocation for Retro Funding 6 matches this value, under the assumption that impact within Optimism Governance has been consistent or has increased since the last round.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimism Governance growth</strong>: Within the scope period of October 2023 until September 2024, Optimism Governance has grown significantly. Within the timeframe a number of new governance leadership roles, such as the Developer Advisory Board, Security Council, TH &amp; CH Feedback Commissions, Anticapture Commission have been introduced. The infrastructure and tooling which Optimism Governance relies on has been extended, introducing approval ranking in the Token House, partial delegation, Citizens’ House Protocol upgrade veto rights, Retro Funding sign up tooling and more. To reflect his growth, the Foundation set a maximum OP allocation of 3.5m OP.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-40075-voting-design-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-40075-voting-design-7\"></a>Voting Design</h3>\n<p>For the round, a number of guest voters will be selected to further drive understanding on how different voter selection methods impact resource allocation decisions.
