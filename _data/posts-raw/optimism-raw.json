For four long years, I entrusted my hard-earned savings and aspirations for financial security to this company, only to be manipulated and ultimately betrayed. It all began with what seemed like a promising opportunity in online trading. The allure of potential profits and the promise of expert guidance drew me in, and I began my journey with optimism and cautious enthusiasm. However, as time passed, I began to notice unsettling patterns. My assigned account manager, entrusted with guiding my investments, consistently steered me towards trades that ended in substantial losses. Initially, I attributed these setbacks to market volatility and the inherent risks of trading. Yet, upon closer scrutiny and painful realization, I discovered the truth—I was being manipulated for the benefit of my account manager and the company. Each loss I incurred translated into gains for them, amplifying their profits at my expense. Despite these revelations, I persisted, hoping that prudent decision-making and diligence would eventually turn the tide in my favor. The turning point came when, after making a substantial deposit of £120,000, my account was summarily closed, and all avenues for withdrawal were abruptly restricted. It was a devastating blow, compounded by the callousness of losing my entire fortune during the global pandemic—a time already fraught with uncertainty and hardship. The sense of betrayal and helplessness was profound, prompting me to seek recourse and justice. In my desperate search for answers and restitution, I fortuitously stumbled upon Cyber Constable Intelligence—an organization specializing in recovering funds from deceitful brokers and financial fraudsters.

As part of Retro Funding 5 a new kind of experiment will be run that aims to increase our collective knowledge around Citizenship selection mechanisms.</p>\n<p>In Retro Funding 5, a random sample of ~90 existing Citizens will be asked to participate in voting. Randomly sampling participants is a way to keep the Citizen workload manageable despite an increased number of rounds, and is a well established method of forming a representative sample of a larger population. In addition to these Citizens, ~30 Guest voters will participate in voting.</p>\n<p><strong>Guest voters</strong></p>\n<p>Guest voters are temporary participants able to vote in a single Retro Round. This new concept allows the Collective to <a href=\"https://community.optimism.io/docs/citizen-house/experimentation-with-citizenship/\">experiment with different selection mechanisms without making any permanent changes to Citizenship</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How to become a guest voter for Retro Funding 5</strong></p>\n<p>Applications to become a guest voter are open until July 14th 2024 to developers contributing to the Optimism ecosystem. Of all applicants, ~30 will be selected to participate as guest voters using a ‘Proof of Work’ selection mechanism (see below). Part of this mechanism will involve an analysis of public GitHub account activity before June 27th 2024. The algorithm will be shared publicly after the selection process has taken place to avoid influencing the experiment.</p>\n<p>If you are a developer and you want to participate in voting for Retro Funding 5, please create your Optimist Profile and submit an application <a href=\"https://retrofunding.optimism.io/\">here</a> by July 14th 2024. Any developer can apply, the algorithm will rank and select the top applicants based on their code contributions to relevant repositories. Therefore, please apply even if you are unsure whether your contributions are significant. Please do not apply if you are not a developer.</p>\n<p><strong>Proof of Work</strong></p>\n<p>The hypothesis behind Proof of Work is that individuals who have contributed work and impact to the Collective will demonstrate relevant competencies and understanding of the Optimism ecosystem. Voting in Retro Funding 5 will benefit from a technical understanding of the OP Stack, which is why this particular opportunity was taken to test a selection mechanism aimed at identifying voters with relevant technical competencies.</p>\n<p>In the context of this experiment, the Proof of Work selection mechanism is being tested across only a single dimension - code contributions. However, the concept of Proof of Work can be applied to other areas and is not limited to technical contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>What does this mean for future Citizen selection?</strong></p>\n<p>The development of Citizenship is reliant on knowledge gathered from experimentation - this is the first in a series of Citizenship selection experiments designed with this end in mind. To read more about experimentation with Citizen selection, see <a href=\"https://community.optimism.io/docs/citizen-house/experimentation-with-citizenship/#\">this gov docs post.</a></p>\n<p>Learnings from this series of experiments will help the Collective gather knowledge about a variety of selection methods which is an important step in empowering Citizens to make informed choices about Citizenship criteria in the future.</p>\n<p>This experiment should not be taken to imply that future Citizen selection will focus on developers or the Proof of Work mechanism. Future Retro Funding Rounds may experiment with other methods of Citizen selection targeted at different Optimism participants.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393","pubDate":"Thu, 27 Jun 2024 14:23:31 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8393"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393.rss","#text":"Retro Funding 5: Announcing Guest Voter Participation"}},{"title":"Can incentives be a good mechanism to improve Optimism governance?","dc:creator":"Cotabe","category":"Governance  Design 📐","description":"<p>GM Optimists! <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/star2.png?v=12\" title=\":star2:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":star2:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>I don’t usually write forum posts, so please bear with me…</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/7/7621ebff70d00fd15f9ad61e64f416b348c475b8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gR31ab0VaFDKn6j0HWfDoZCboik.png?dl=1\" title=\"Its my first day meme\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7621ebff70d00fd15f9ad61e64f416b348c475b8_2_328x250.png\" alt=\"Its my first day meme\" data-base62-sha1=\"gR31ab0VaFDKn6j0HWfDoZCboik\" width=\"328\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7621ebff70d00fd15f9ad61e64f416b348c475b8_2_328x250.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7621ebff70d00fd15f9ad61e64f416b348c475b8_2_492x375.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/7/7621ebff70d00fd15f9ad61e64f416b348c475b8_2_656x500.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"5D5459\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>I’m also not sure if this is the right category.

The profit calculation will deduct past transfers, such as grants and funding, to determine the final award in OP for each voter’s impact assessment. A deliberative process involving badgeholders determined the profit definition, with a proposed deduction weight applied only to Optimism Grants. Badgeholders are called to vote on ratifying this definition which will automatically be applied to the voting result calculation in Round 4, with a fallback definition proposed by the Foundation if not ratified.

The goal is to design a “curriculum” for the best way for new governance participants to engage in meaningful governance activities, which can hopefully be expanded in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>What are GovNFTs?</strong><br>\nGovNFTs are a general-purpose governance primitive built by the Velodrome team. As many of you know, tokens for builders’ grants have a 1-year lock. Delegations have been made on these locked tokens in the past but require manual work from the foundation to do so. GovNFTs are an audited smart contract that can keep the tokens “locked” while at the same time allowing the builder to fluidly participate in Optimism Governance.</p>\n<p><strong>What is this program?</strong><br>\nTo test this primitive before expanding to the broader set of Optimism builder’s grantees, we are creating a pilot program as outlined in <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/velodrome-finance-governance-participation-23531902138656102\">this grant</a>. This pilot program makes available 25K OP to incentivize and reward existing GovNFT holders for valuable participation in Optimism governance. The initial set of users is 200+ users and protocols who have previously earned GovNFTs through previous grants on Velodrome. A series of activities will be assigned a point value. The 25k OP will be distributed among participants in the pilot based on a weighted average of points. The activities and their potential point values are as follows.</p>\n<p><em>This is a draft; the goal is to improve the following based on feedback from the community.

While the Grants Council will otherwise support application developers on OP Mainnet, this Mission will support the distribution of grants to spur developer growth across the Superchain, an important component of Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3:</span> Grow application developers across the Superchain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What is required to execute this Mission Request?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Grants Council will process applications from OP Chains requesting tokens to run their own grants program but will not process individual grant applications for other OP Chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While grant decisions will ultimately be determined by the Grants Council, the Foundation suggests an objective framework like the below for relative allocation under this Mission Request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We suggest allocating 65% of the Intent 3B Budget to OP Chains already in the Superchain, distributed pro-rata based on contribution to the Collective to date (excluding OP Mainnet).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We suggest reserving the remaining 35% of the Intent 3B Budget for new OP Chains, defined as having launched mainnet within the last six months, joining the Superchain throughout the Season. In the case of new Chains, we recommend budget be allocated according to the Foundation’s Chain Health Framework (more information to be provided as soon as possible.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We suggest a cap of 3M OP for any individual L2 OP Chain, to prevent winner takes all dynamics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains should be able to apply in any grants cycle throughout Season 6 to accommodate new chains coming online.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Requirements for participating chains:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains are expected to disclose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(i) the amount of tokens they’ve received to date from the Foundation, and</li>\n<li>(ii) the total amount of their Foundation grant size.</li>\n<li>no additional Foundation grant deal terms are to be disclosed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Qualifying OP Chains do not have to have an existing public grants program in order to apply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains should brand these grants as “supported by the Optimism Governance Fund.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Participating OP Chains are encouraged to make grants consistent with approved Mission Requests under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3A</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Participating OP Chains are highly encouraged to coordinate with the Grants Council on best practices to create a consistent grants application process across the Superchain and to avoid repeating mistakes we’ve already learned from. The Grants Council may design mechanisms to facilitate shared learnings and/or OP Chains applying to this program may be required to collaborate with the Grants Council to adapt best practices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Grants made by OP Chains will also be subject to the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833\">Collective Grant Policies</a>. These policies include standard lock-up policies and stipulate that OP Chains must not use their grants to run grant programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g. making grants to migrate protocols or users from Mainnet to another chain).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains participating in this program will be required to sign an agreement with the Foundation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Milestones:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grants to OP Chains will be subject to the typical milestone based delivery and assessment process. The Milestones and Metrics committee will assess completion of milestones, as usual.</li>\n<li>Any tokens not granted via OP Chain grants programs at the end of 12 months shall be returned to the Governance Fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Metrics:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Participating OP Chains must publish a retrospective at the soonest of the completion of their grant or within 12 months of grant delivery demonstrating the impact of grants made on the target metric under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span> (number of active developers.)</li>\n<li>OP Chains are required to capture the contracts deployed by each grant recipient so impact analysis is possible. It is recommended that grant recipients also create a project in the Retro Funding app.</li>\n<li>[We suggest collecting information on the Foundation’s metric menu to facilitate comparable analysis.]</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The impact of OP Chain grants programs should be assessed relative to outperformance on the metrics stated in the application and relative to the impact generated by the Grants Council under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3A</span>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Has anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?</strong> The Foundation has received feedback from the Season 5 Grants Council and the Collective Feedback Commission.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-request-intent-3b-support-the-superchain-draft/8296\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-request-intent-3b-support-the-superchain-draft/8296","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Jun 2024 12:07:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8296"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-mission-request-intent-3b-support-the-superchain-draft/8296.rss","#text":"Season 6 Mission Request: Intent #3B: Support the Superchain [DRAFT]"}},{"title":"Developer Advisory Board Season 6 Nomination + Election Process Feedback","dc:creator":"system","category":"Feedback  💬","description":"<p>Feedback thread for any feedback relating to the Season 6 Developer Advisory Board self-nomination process and election process.</p>\n<p>Relevant links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-nominations-developer-advisory-board/\">Season 6 Nominations: Developer Advisory Board </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-s6-election-town-hall/\">Developer Advisory Board S6 Election Town Hall </a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-season-6-nomination-election-process-feedback/8288\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-season-6-nomination-election-process-feedback/8288","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 19:05:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8288"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-season-6-nomination-election-process-feedback/8288.rss","#text":"Developer Advisory Board Season 6 Nomination + Election Process Feedback"}},{"title":"Grants Council Season 6 Nomination + Election Process Feedback","dc:creator":"system","category":"Feedback  💬","description":"<p>Feedback thread for any feedback relating to the Season 6 Grants Council self-nomination process and election process.</p>\n<p>Relevant links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-nominations-grants-council/\">Season 6 Nominations: Grants Council </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-s6-election-town-hall/\">Grants Council S6 Election Town Hall </a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-season-6-nomination-election-process-feedback/8287\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-season-6-nomination-election-process-feedback/8287","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 19:03:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8287"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-season-6-nomination-election-process-feedback/8287.rss","#text":"Grants Council Season 6 Nomination + Election Process Feedback"}}]}}}
