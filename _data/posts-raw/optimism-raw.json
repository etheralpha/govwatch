This process is facilitated by <span class=\"mention\">@simonapop</span>. The findings and refined results of this  engagement with badgeholders will be shared shortly as we continue to iterate these processes in a meaningful way.<br>\nThe final list of metrics available in the voting interface will be curated by badgeholders around mid-July.

A final draft will be ratified by the Token House in Season 6. For more context on the Blockspace Charter Framework, see <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133\">here.</a></em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>The Standard Rollup is the Optimism Collective’s flagship, high-security blockspace product. The Standard Rollup targets the Collective’s highest bar for security, uptime, and decentralization, with Optimism Governance responsible for upholding the protections outlined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">Law of Chains</a>. Further, the Standard Rollup should have all potential changes treated with careful consideration by the governance community, to enable long-term, sustainable projects to be built around Standard Rollup blockspace with confidence.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"criteria-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#criteria-3\"></a>Criteria</h1>\n<p>The criteria for being a Standard Rollup consist of a set of deterministic onchain criteria to ensure that chains are well-configured, up-to-date, and secured by the Optimism Security Council, as well as a set of lightweight offchain criteria initially checked by the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"deterministic-onchain-criteria-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#deterministic-onchain-criteria-4\"></a>Deterministic (Onchain) Criteria</h2>\n<p>The deterministic criteria for Standard Rollups consist of 3 primary components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Version Check</strong>: ensuring that all L1 smart contracts are the most up-to-date, governance-approved version of the OP Stack codebase, and, if the chain has been upgraded in the past, that the previous versions were a standard release of the codebase.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Configuration Check</strong>: ensuring that all configuration values for the chain are within high-security, well-tested bounds, and that all administrative roles are set correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Solvency Check</strong>: ensuring all of the chain’s L1 outputs are correct, preventing historic malicious withdrawals from causing the bridge to become undercollateralized.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The precise code which can be used to perform these checks can be found <code>[here]</code>, and should be considered the canonical, deterministic criteria for what blockspace is governed via this charter. However, some of the key points are included here for readability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The chain’s genesis state and predeploy (<code>0x420000...</code>) contracts are standard, uniform implementations with no malicious code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The protocol parameters are constrained to high-security, high-stability, well-tested values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Security Council (currently in Phase 0) for the chain’s L1 bridge contracts, and any other roles .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A standard fee split to the Collective is enforced by smart contracts, as specified <code>[here]</code> and implemented by <code>[this contract]</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"offchain-criteria-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#offchain-criteria-5\"></a>Offchain Criteria</h2>\n<p>In addition to the above deterministic criteria, the Optimism Foundation will perform a limited set of manual, offchain checks at its discretion before inclusion as a Standard Rollup. These checks are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>ChainID check</strong>: ensuring that the Chain ID is unique and does not collide with a pre-existing EVM chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gas Limit check</strong>: ensuring that the Chain’s initial GasLimit is configured to a reasonable value based on the then-current status of OP Stack performance testing. (see below for additional context on Gas Limit policy)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security Monitoring</strong>: ensuring certain standard monitoring tools have been deployed for every chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Governor/Servicer verification</strong>: verifying at the social layer that the chain is indeed deployed and operated by the parties in question, and are not being impersonated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Other checks:</strong> running necessary checks related to compliance with applicable laws.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Optimism Foundation’s final inclusion of a chain in the <code>superchain-registry</code> repo will be the canonical indicator of passing the offchain criteria. Thus, in summation, the community can determine whether a given chain falls under the scope of this charter by checking that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Chain passes all Deterministic Criteria checks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Chain has been included by the Optimism Foundation in the <code>superchain-registry</code> repo.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over time, it should be expected that the Foundation’s subjective checks are either eliminated, or transitioned to a process run directly by the community, so that inclusion may be determined purely by onchain data.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"governing-policies-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#governing-policies-6\"></a>Governing Policies</h1>\n<p>The Standard Rollup’s governing policies implement additional “reactive” procedures in the event that one or more stakeholder protections in the Law of Chains are violated in such a way that the protocol cannot naturally handle them. Each of these governing policies include reference to a specific protection in the Law of Chains.</p>\n<p>In its current form, all governing policies’ relevant enforcement actions would be taken by the <code>L1ProxyAdmin</code> role, which is held by the Phase 0 Security Council. As such, all enforcement actions will follow the standard Protocol Upgrade vote procedure, which is the existing path used for governance to exercise the <code>L1ProxyAdmin</code> role. In the future, policies may include different enforcement mechanisms (e.g. via unilateral action by other councils, or via direct onchain governor outcomes given explicit authority in the protocol.)</p>\n<h3><a name=\"governor-key-recovery-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#governor-key-recovery-7\"></a>Governor Key Recovery</h3>\n<p>In the current version of the OP Stack, the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> is permitted to change certain chain configuration values. According to the Law of Chains, control of some of these values are afforded to the Chain Governor (e.g. transaction fee margin), and others are afforded to the Chain Servicer (e.g. the batcher hotkey).</p>\n<p>For convenience, the Configuration Check in the above criteria permits either the Chain Servicer or the Chain Governor to be the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code>, so that Chain Governors can delegate all configuration updates to Servicers. However, because the Chain Governor is also protected by the Law of Chains to <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=This%20should%20include%20the%20ability%20for%20the%20Chain%20Governor%20to%20change%20the%20Sequencer%20on%20its%20OP%20Chain\">be able to switch between Chain Servicers</a>, ultimate control of the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role should belong to the Chain Governor.</p>\n<p>In the event that a Chain Servicer stops fulfilling the wishes of the Chain Governor for those values which the Law of Chains states they should be able to control, or refuses to transfer control of the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role in the event that the Chain Governor desires to switch to a different servicer, then the Chain Governor may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to have the Phase 1 Security Council recover the role to an account they control.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"sequencer-censorship-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#sequencer-censorship-8\"></a>Sequencer Censorship</h3>\n<p>In the event that a sequencer is determined to be intentionally censoring valid user transactions, or experiencing unreasonable downtime impacting applications on the chain, they are violating the User Protection of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=a%20timely%20manner.-,Security%2C%20Uptime%2C%20and%20Liveness,-%3A%20Block%20production\">Security, Uptime, and Liveness</a> in the Law of Chains.</p>\n<p>In the event that a Chain Governor refuses to change its sequencer in reaction, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and appoint a new sequencer.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"responsible-gaslimits-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#responsible-gaslimits-9\"></a>Responsible GasLimits</h3>\n<p>The OP Stack is rapidly evolving and the boundaries of its performance continue to be pushed. As such, the protocol currently does not implement a hardcoded upper bound on the Gas Limit for a chain. However, this ability must be responsibly exercised to ensure <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md.\">fulfillment of User Protections.</a> Thus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Before any GasLimit increase, Chain Governors should submit to the community a public load test which demonstrates stability at that limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After any GasLimit increase, if the chain experiences a significant degradation in performance or stability, the GasLimit should promptly be lowered back to its previous value.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a Chain Governor fails to take these steps, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and lower the GasLimit.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"responsible-batch-submission-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#responsible-batch-submission-10\"></a>Responsible Batch Submission</h3>\n<p>The current version of the OP Stack allows for batches to be submitted with up to a 12 hour delay after initial reception by the sequencer (the “sequencing window”). However, Sequencers are expected to submit at least twice as frequently (i.e. every 6 hours). This affords sufficient time to batch submit in the case of failures or downtime, fulfilling the User Protection to <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=a%20timely%20manner.-,Security%2C%20Uptime%2C%20and%20Liveness,-%3A%20Block%20production\">Security, Uptime, and Liveness</a>.</p>\n<p>In the event that a Chain Governor refuses to change its sequencer which repeatedly and intentionally violates this practice, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and appoint a new compliant sequencer.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"fee-margins-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#fee-margins-11\"></a>Fee Margins</h3>\n<p>The Law of Chains affords Chain Governors the ability to set fee margins for the chain. However, setting the fee margin significantly high can be a form of economic censorship — by making transactions prohibitively expensive to submit, the Governor could <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">effectively violate the User Protection to censorship resistance.</a> A Chain Governor that configures the OP Chain in such a way that Users indirectly cannot transact (e.g.%2C by setting a prohibitively high gas markup.)</p>\n<p>The Standard Rollup should allow a maximum fee margin of 50% (i.e., the average cost of transactions should not exceed twice the cost of batch submission). If a Chain Governor sets the fee margin in excess of this, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and lower the Fee Margin.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"resourcemetering-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#resourcemetering-12\"></a>ResourceMetering</h3>\n<p>The <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role is currently able to modify the <code>ResourceMetering</code> struct, a low-level set of values which set certain properties of L1→L2 message rules. This is a low-level variable with no reason to be changed outside of a protocol upgrade.</p>\n<p>If a <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> (either Servicer or Governor) changes this value, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the relevant party and revert the change.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"precommitments-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#precommitments-13\"></a>Precommitments</h1>\n<p>This section commits to anticipated changes (or lack thereof) for future upgrades to this charter.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"collective-fee-take-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#collective-fee-take-14\"></a>Collective Fee Take</h3>\n<p>The current Blockspace Charter specifies a fee split to the collective of the greater of 1) 2.5% of transaction fee revenue and 2) 15% of chain profit (fee revenue - L1 submission cost). It is extremely important to provide Stakeholders in the Collective with a reliable economic model on which they can build reliable, sustainable long-term projects. By ratifying this Blockspace Charter, the Collective is signaling its precommitment to <strong>all standard rollups</strong> that it will not modify the fee split parameters outlined above for 5 years, until [June] 2029.</p>\n<p>This does not preclude changes or improvements to the implementation of the fee split contracts, so long as they preserve the original spirit. In the event that new sources of fees (or operating costs) are introduced to the protocol, the economics should be updated with minimized impact to the existing expectations and projects on the Superchain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"governorservicer-role-separation-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#governorservicer-role-separation-15\"></a>Governor/Servicer Role Separation</h3>\n<p>Some policies above (e.g. Governor Key Recovery) arise from an overloading of the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role to control configurability options which the Law of Chains affords separately to Governors and Servicers. In a future upgrade, the Collective expects to transition to a model which establishes independent roles for the Governor and Servicer, allowing them to modify the configuration values afforded to them independently. This change would also remove controllability of the Resource Metering Config without a protocol upgrade.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ossified-gaslimits-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#ossified-gaslimits-16\"></a>Ossified GasLimits</h3>\n<p>Because the OP Stack’s performance is rapidly improving, the GasLimit configurability is unbounded (subject to the relevant Governing Policy above). However, as the rate of change slows, the Collective expects to set a hard upper bound, which can only be changed via upgrade.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"direct-fee-margin-controls-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#direct-fee-margin-controls-17\"></a>Direct Fee Margin Controls</h3>\n<p>Today, the “fee margin” discussed in the relevant Governing Policy above is only indirectly influenceable via the control of multiple other configuration variables. In the future, the Collective anticipates a protocol improvement which allows the margin to be set more directly, and which imposes a strict upper bound of 50%, to remove the ability to perform economic censorship even temporarily.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 10:44:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8135"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135.rss","#text":"Season 6: [DRAFT] Standard Rollup Charter"}},{"title":"Season 6: [Draft] Charter-Aware Upgrade Proposal Template","dc:creator":"system","category":"Policies  and Templates 📌","description":"<h1><a name=\"season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template-1\"></a>Season 6: [Draft] Charter-Aware Upgrade Proposal Template</h1>\n<hr>\n<p><em>// This is a draft Upgrade Proposal Template for community feedback.

This post will serve as an introduction to Blockspace Charters, explaining what they are and what their purpose is. We will also present, and eventually seek ratification for, the first charter—the <em><strong>Standard Rollup Charter</strong></em>—in a parallel post. An initial draft of the Standard Rollup Charter for community feedback can be found <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The Reflection Period will be used to build understanding of the underlying concepts presented below. Ratification for the Standard Rollup Charter will occur during Season 6, and updates to the corresponding Protocol Upgrade framework will follow. In the meantime, the Foundation will conduct an AMA as part of the Token House Community Call on Tuesday, May 14 to answer any questions and collect community feedback. Followup calls may be scheduled as necessary.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The Superchain is quickly blossoming into a robust ecosystem of OP Stack-based chains. However, these chains are not all technically equivalent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Different chains may use different <em>versions</em> of the OP Stack—some projects have made modifications to the stack, and others are on outdated versions of it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Even within chains that are on the same version, some may be <em>configured</em> differently — that is, deployed with different values for various parameters, admin roles, and so on.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Open source, permissionless innovation is key to the Collective’s success. At the same time, ecosystem fragmentation also poses challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Users and developers need an easy way to understand what blockspace has which properties and guarantees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optimism Governance needs to understand how to make decisions about these different forms of blockspace, which may make different commitments and have different control structures.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">The Law of Chains</a> is a neutrality framework designed to provide a guiding light for the Superchain and its stakeholders to make decisions and uphold protections. However, the Law of Chains is intentionally agnostic to any specific details of the protocol. This allows for it to be <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=It%20is%20further%20understood%20that%20the%20Law%20of%20Chains%20will%20require%20adaptation%20to%20changing%20circumstances%20as%20the%20Collective%20defines%20itself%2C%20evolves%2C%20and%20grows%20iteratively%20over%20time.%20Accordingly%2C%20the%20Law%20of%20Chains%20adopts%20additional%20interpretive%20principles%3A\">applicable over many iterations of the protocol</a>, but also means that it can fail to provide clear guidance at the granularity described in the above bullets.</p>\n<p>This makes the Law of Chains analogous to the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55\">Working Constitution of the Optimism Collective</a>. It defines the guiding principles for the Collective’s governance, but it does not define the specific mechanisms of voting cycles, quorums, and so forth.  Blockspace Charters are the equivalent to the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md\">Operating Manual</a>, providing the specific implementation details for different types of Superchain blockspace.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-is-a-blockspace-charter-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#what-is-a-blockspace-charter-3\"></a>What is a Blockspace Charter?</h1>\n<p>At a high level, a Blockspace Charter consists of three primary components: <strong>Criteria</strong>, <strong>Governing Policies</strong>, and <strong>Precommitments</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criteria</strong> are the specific technical parameters which define which chains are under the scope of a given charter.  The charter’s criteria should provide an <em>objective definition</em> for which chains are under its scope.  Generally, there are two components to blockspace criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Version:</strong> The version of the OP Stack which the chain is using, as determined by commit-hash/release. This refers to the specific protocol code powering the blockspace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Configuration:</strong> the accepted range of parameterizations of the software in the OP Chain’s deployment. Configuration can include static variables defined at genesis, like the Chain ID, and dynamic variables, like the chain’s sequencer or upgrade keys. Configuration bounds state what values those options must fall within to satisfy the charter’s criteria.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Solvency:</strong> This involves ensuring that a chain’s history does not include any invalid withdrawals, or invalid outputs, which could cause the bride to be undercollateralized.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Governing Policies</strong> are the specific rules, procedures, and principles which stakeholders participating in the charter’s blockspace follow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Generally, Governing Policies will be related to how the different <strong>configured roles</strong> should behave or interact, and how that is <strong>enforced</strong>.  For example, if a charter’s blockspace criteria requires that upgrade keys configured be held by the Security Council, and allows the chain’s sequencer to be configured to be anybody, then the governing policies could define:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The required behavior of the sequencer, which, if violated, would be grounds for removal, and the methods by which the community can check for violations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The governance process (i.e. proposal type) by which governance could vote to remove a sequencer found in violation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The signing procedure which would be subsequently taken by the Security Council to remove the offending sequencer.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As you will see in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135\">Standard Blockspace Charter draft</a>, governing policies should be mapped back to the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">Law of Chains</a> guiding principles.  For each protection in the Law of Chains, the governing policies make explicit how those protections can be upheld for the charter’s blockspace.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Precommitments</strong> serve as a commitment mechanism, outlining anticipated changes (or anticipated consistency) for future upgrades to the charter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>They are designed to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the long-term vision and stability of the governance framework. By committing to specific parameters or outlining planned evolutions of the charter, Precommitments help mitigate uncertainty and foster a stable environment for growth and innovation within the Superchain ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Precommitments can address various critical aspects of OP chains, such as <strong>fee split models</strong>, <strong>role separations</strong>, and <strong>technical parameters</strong> like gas limits and fee margins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The specificity of Precommitments can vary from extremely specific anticipated changes to protocol code, to anticipated changes to Governing Policies’ enforcement procedures, to implementation-independent economic guidance or principles.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"how-will-blockspace-charters-be-rolled-out-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-will-blockspace-charters-be-rolled-out-4\"></a>How will Blockspace Charters be rolled out?</h1>\n<p>Blockspace Charters will be rolled out alongside two supporting components: the <strong>Superchain Registry</strong>, a Github repository which manages addition of new chains according to Charters’ Criteria, and an <strong>improved upgrade proposal process</strong> which maps upgrade proposals to a particular Charter (see <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template/8134\">here</a>.)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"superchain-registry-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#superchain-registry-5\"></a>Superchain Registry</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Superchain Registry</strong> will play a crucial role in the Blockspace Charter framework by serving as an accessible index of what chains are a part of the Superchain. It acts as the source of truth for which chains have been accepted under a specific charter and documents the specific configuration values which have been chosen for each chain. This registry is essential for maintaining transparency and accountability within the Superchain ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The Superchain Registry implements the <strong>validation logic</strong> referenced in Charters’ Criteria via an automated test suite. This ensures that all chains meet the criteria outlined in their respective Blockspace Charter before being added, ensuring consistency and security across the Superchain.</p>\n<p>As a public index, the Superchain Registry also serves as <strong>unified, accessible documentation</strong> for what OP Chains exist, and what kind of blockspace they implement (i.e.—what charter, if any, they fall under). Note that the Superchain Registry may include different chains in the superchain which meet different charters’ criteria (or which meet no charters’ criteria). This means that <em>inclusion in the Superchain Registry only implies inclusion in the Superchain.</em> The Superchain Registry implements an extensible categorization system to clearly delineate which chains fall under which criteria (and therefore which Blockspace Charter), which further implies what “part” of the Superchain it is in.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"incremental-rollout-beta-registry-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#incremental-rollout-beta-registry-6\"></a>Incremental Rollout (Beta Registry)</h3>\n<p>While the process outlined in this document brings a great deal of clarity to Superchain governance, the Collective already votes on protocol versions independent of the chains in question. As the Security Council currently enacts all Protocol Upgrades, we do not view it as strictly necessary for the Standard Rollup Charter to be ratified before the Phase 1 Security Council becomes responsible for upgrades on additional OP Chains.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in close coordination with the Security Council and relevant Chain Governors and Servicers, we plan to roll out a “beta registry” and begin onboarding some initial chains to the Phase 1 Security Council and Superchain Registry, if we know they are on the governance-approved version of the OP Stack.  We plan to use this as an opportunity to iron out any frictions and get the Security Council comfortable with the end-to-end process, before before the charter is ratified and the process is scaled.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"improved-upgrade-proposal-process-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#improved-upgrade-proposal-process-7\"></a>Improved Upgrade Proposal Process</h2>\n<p>Corresponding to Blockspace Charters being able to rigorously define specific types of blockspace, upgrade proposals will now be changed to correspond to specific charters. Together with the Superchain Registry, this will allow the Collective to clearly understand exactly which chains are in the scope of an upgrade, and rigorously consider the impact on stakeholders.</p>\n<p>The updated Upgrade Proposal template can be found <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template/8134\">here</a>.  The template is relatively similar to that in previous seasons, with the difference that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Upgrade proposals now specify a Blockspace Charter to be upgraded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgrade proposals must link to a pull request for an updated charter. This will be the version of the charter that, if successful, applies post-upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Impact Summary</code> section of the upgrade proposal now must provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Justifications for all changes to the Blockspace Charter not covered in other sections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A comprehensive justification that all Precommitments in the previous Charter are preserved by the upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This enhanced upgrade proposal process, by aligning closely with Blockspace Charters and the Superchain Registry, ensures a transparent, accountable, and stakeholder-focused approach to evolving the Superchain. It supports to goal that every upgrade is carefully considered, justified, and aligned with the long-term vision and commitments of the Optimism Collective, fostering a stable and innovative ecosystem.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 10:28:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8133"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133.rss","#text":"Season 6: Introducing Blockspace Charters: Superchain-first Governance"}},{"title":"Season 6: Anticapture Commission Amended","dc:creator":"system","category":"Metagovernance","description":"<h1><a name=\"season-6-anticapture-commission-amended-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-anticapture-commission-amended-1\"></a>Season 6: Anticapture Commission Amended</h1>\n<p><em>This is an amended version of the original <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889\">Anticapture Commission Charter</a> approved in Season 5.

It’s a very important role and we know it’s not easy. Optimism delegates are asked to continuously experiment and constantly iterate; it’s never easy to be the first to do something and delegates do it everyday.</p>\n<p>While the Collective depends on a community of high context, highly engaged delegates, we also understand the realities of part-time contribution and the demands of outside commitments.

It is suggested this post include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resignation period (whether short term or long term)</li>\n<li>Reason for resignation</li>\n<li>Any plans to remain active in the Collective in a different capacity</li>\n<li>Please tag <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/lavande\">@lavande</a>, from the Optimism Foundation, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/zcf\">@zcf</a>, from Agora, so we’re aware of your resignation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re a large delegate, whose inactive voting power might block quorum, please encourage your delegators to redelegate their tokens while you’re away. You may suggest a specific delegate(s) towards which your delegators should consider redelegating.</p>\n<p>Advanced delegation allows a delegate to pass-through their delegation to another delegate and would be an ideal feature to utilize in the case of short-term absences. However, while Agora has begun rolling out advanced delegation to select delegates, this feature only works on a go-forward basis and, therefore, isn’t applicable for delegations made before the feature was enabled. Broader roll-out and retroactive applicability of advanced delegation would be subject to a one-time upgrade to the token contract, which comes with serious considerations.</p>\n<p>We recommend sharing long-term resignation plans on additional platforms such as Farcaster or in the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#gov-general</span> or <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#delegate-discussion</span> channel in Discord to broaden the audience aware of your long-term resignation.

These include:<br>\nHere’s a refined version of the suggested Internal Operating Procedures (IOP) changes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Streamline Intake and Preliminary Review:</strong> Consolidate intake and preliminary review into a single process to enhance efficiency and rigor. This unified process should be more stringent to pass, ensuring that only high-quality proposals proceed to the next stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shorten Review Process:</strong> Reduce the duration of the review process from 6 weeks to 3 weeks to expedite decision-making and minimize delays in applicant feedback and final selections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Perpetual Finalist Status:</strong> Grant perpetual finalist status to non-elected applicants of the final review to allow sufficient time (2 weeks) for integration of feedback and revisions, reducing the need for repetitive resubmissions and administrative overhead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mid-Week Review Assignment:</strong> Implement a mid-week deadline for initial review assignments. Applications not yet reviewed by this deadline will be open for any reviewer to pick up, ensuring a balanced workload distribution and fair rewards based on individual review contributions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mandatory Feedback Focus:</strong> Make feedback regarding mission request alignment and formal application process mandatory, emphasizing alignment with established criteria rather than the viability of the project idea itself. This ensures consistency and clarity in the review process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Buffer:</strong> Incorporate a 12 to 24-hour buffer between review steps to allow the Grants Council Lead and Operations team to perform necessary operational actions, such as second assignment, application declination, and report formulation. This buffer enhances operational efficiency and responsiveness to review outcomes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Proponent Communication:</strong> Promote improved feedback mechanisms, communication channels, and contact with proponents to foster greater transparency and collaboration throughout the grants process.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Suggested Adjustments to the Charter:</strong></p>\n<p>The suggested adjustments to the Charter aim to optimize the structure and functionality of the Grants Council. These include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Audits Subcommittee Inclusion:</strong> Introduce an audits subcommittee along with its designated reviewers to enhance oversight and accountability in the audit process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Streamline Subcommittee Structure:</strong> Remove the builders and growth subcommittees as separate entities, and maintain a unified pool of reviewers to ensure equitable distribution of workload and resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible Reward Model:</strong> Implement a system to adjust rewards based on workload, providing opportunities for reviewers with lighter responsibilities to receive proportionate rewards during the season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Internal Reviewer Grouping:</strong> Internally categorize reviewers based on interests, performance, and availability to facilitate efficient assignment allocation and optimize team dynamics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mission Request Authorization:</strong> Enforce the acceptance of only those mission requests authorized by the Grants Council to mitigate potential principal-agent problems and uphold governance integrity.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What improvements to the team’s mandate would you suggest for next Season?</strong></p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the next season, it is recommended to continue the team’s operations with a focus on refining processes and enhancing transparency. Additionally, the review of budget allotment mid-season for Token House voting is proposed to further align the grants process with broader governance responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Grants Council has demonstrated commendable performance and remains committed to serving the needs of the Optimism Collective. Through continuous improvement and adaptation, we strive to uphold transparency, efficiency, and accountability in our operations.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-retrospective-season-5/8126\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-retrospective-season-5/8126","pubDate":"Fri, 10 May 2024 15:42:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8126"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-retrospective-season-5/8126.rss","#text":"Grant Council - Retrospective Season 5"}},{"title":"Season 6: Chain Delegation Program Amendment","dc:creator":"system","category":"Metagovernance","description":"<p><em>Special thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/brichis\">@brichis</a>,<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/kaereste\">@kaereste</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/porter_smith\">@Porter_Smith</a> for review and feedback on these amendments as part of the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863\">Feedback Commission</a></em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"season-6-chain-delegation-program-amendment-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-chain-delegation-program-amendment-1\"></a>Season 6: Chain Delegation Program Amendment</h1>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"chain-delegation-program-amendment-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#chain-delegation-program-amendment-2\"></a>Chain Delegation Program Amendment</h2>\n<p>The Chain Delegation Program was not utilized in Season 5 due to longer than expected timelines on the partnership side and due to the ongoing evolution of what it means to be part of the Superchain. However, the Chain Delegation Program is expected to play a meaningful role in our plans to onboard the next ~15 OP Chains. Below we propose an amendment to the original proposal, based on changes that have occurred over the course of Season 5. This program pertains only to L2’s as governance controls protocol parameters at the L2 level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains that meet the below criteria will be eligible for 250k OP in delegation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133#superchain-registry-5\">Superchain Registry</a> (or similar)</li>\n<li>Committed to contribute revenue back to the Collective and generating &gt; 1 ETH / month in sequencer revenue, for at least 2 consecutive months</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally, chains the meet the below requirement will be eligible for an additional 750k OP in delegation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1M in transaction volume per month, for at least 2 consecutive months (qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on this metric at the beginning of each Season.) This metric more closely ties to private grant milestones, replacing the previous revenue generation metric (in part due to the impact of 4844).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Chains operating on the Standard Configuration would be eligible for an additional 500k OP in delegation (a total of 1.5M OP for these chains.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on these metrics at the start of each Season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The size of the program would be increased to 20M, to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation. All delegation formulas and caps remain the same.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The duration of the program would be extended, to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation, on a rolling basis until, all qualifying chains have gone through the program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All delegations made through this program will continue to be capped at the point at which an OP Chain reaches a total possible delegation equal to 9% of the votable supply. OP Chains that would be able to self-delegate up to 9% of the votable supply to themselves but have not done so yet are not eligible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No delegations have been made through this program to date. Any delegations that are made will be noted as a comment to this forum post.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains will not be added to this program until they opt-in and verify they are able to uphold the below participant expectations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains must maintain a &gt;70% voting participation rate during the Season, calculated at the start of each Season, or their delegation will be removed at the start of the next Season</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delegates should set an ENS Primary Name to their delegation address and create a delegate statement on <a href=\"http://vote.optimism.io\">vote.optimism.io</a>.

The Foundation has consulted the Anticapture Commission on several related matters, as has Agora.

Teams can apply for a grant to fulfill a Mission Request and the Grants Council evaluates which applicants will receive grants.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>In Season 6, Delegates will be asked to approve Mission Requests proposed by the Grants Council and the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863\">Collective Feedback Commission</a>.</p>\n<p>Mission Requests will be proposed under each Intent in a suggested rank order. Delegates may either follow this suggested order, by voting down the line, or they may chose to override these suggestions and vote in their own preferred order. Below is an example of how ranking works.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-does-approval-ranking-work-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-does-approval-ranking-work-3\"></a>How Does Approval Ranking Work?</h3>\n<p>Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of “Yes” votes they receive. Approval ranking is a voting mechanism that allows each delegate to cast a vote with their full voting power, on as many options as desired.</p>\n<p>Each Mission proposal must receive a minimum number of “yes” votes, equal to 51% of the 30% quorum. Any Mission Request that does not receive &gt; required number of “yes” votes will not be approved.</p>\n<p>The top ranked Mission Requests, above the minimum number of “yes” votes, will be accepted in rank order until the Intent Budget is fully allocated. If a Mission Request would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included and neither will any of the budget requests ranked beneath it.</p>\n<p>The main point of approval ranking is to prioritize work, not to optimize for complete allocation of the budget. Prioritization is a larger challenge for DAOs than fully allocating budgets as DAOs typically struggle to allocate budgets <em>sustainably</em>, allocating insufficient resources to core work and allocating too many resources to non-core work.</p>\n<p>Intent Budgets will be calculated based on the total amount of OP that could be allocated via the Request. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine the following scenario:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Votable supply = 20M OP</li>\n<li>Quorum = 6M OP (30% votable supply)</li>\n<li>Minimum yes vote requirement = 3.1M OP (51% of quorum)</li>\n<li>Total budget for Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#10</span> = 200k OP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>–-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission Request 1: Ask for 50k OP, 5M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 2: Ask for 50k OP, 2M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 3: Ask for 50k OP, 3.4M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 4: Ask for 75k OP, 3.3M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 5: Ask for 35k OP, 3.2M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 6: Ask for 25k OP, 3.1M OP votes (all are Yes votes.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Mission Request 1, 3, and 4 would move forward, as they were all above quorum and within the 200k OP budget. Mission Request 2 did not meet the quorum requirement. Mission Request 5 met quorum but was over the budget allocated to this Intent (including Mission Request 5 would have pushed the total to 210k OP rather than the approved 200k OP). Mission Request 6 wasn’t ranked high enough to qualify.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If an Intent Budget is over/underallocated, it should be viewed as an opportunity to assess several potential factors to improve future decision making, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether or not reasonable/appropriate budgets were proposed for each Intent</li>\n<li>Whether or not the Governance Fund is the optimal mechanism through which to support the initiatives proposed under each Intent</li>\n<li>Whether or not there were quality Mission Requests proposed under each Intent</li>\n<li>Whether or not any high impact initiatives did not move forward as a result of under/over allocation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"how-should-delegates-think-about-casting-votes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-should-delegates-think-about-casting-votes-4\"></a><strong>How Should Delegates Think About Casting Votes?</strong></h3>\n<p>This vote utilizes approval ranking. You may place a vote to approve any number of Missions Requests you would like to approve with your full voting power. That means, in the above example, if I am a delegate with 1M OP voting power, I could cast votes as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission Request 1: 1M OP (approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 2: Abstain (don’t approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 3: 1M OP (approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 4: Abstain (don’t approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 5: 1M OP (approve)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a voter, you should vote “Yes” on the Mission Requests you think most deserve to move forward, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think deserve to move forward. Delegates should not vote on their own proposals, including Mission Requests they have authored and/or sponsored.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"when-evaluating-mission-requests-please-keep-in-mind-they-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#when-evaluating-mission-requests-please-keep-in-mind-they-5\"></a>When evaluating Mission Requests, please keep in mind they:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>should describe a start-to-finish initiative, not ongoing services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>shouldn’t specify the team that should complete the Request</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>shouldn’t rely on any Foundation action or support   - should not propose metagovernance changes and/or structures (such as the creation of committees and/or Councils).

To this end, the below non-binding, guidelines provide a suggested framework to think about Collective rewards, and are not meant to serve as a rigid or binding policy encapsulating all possible scenarios.</p>\n<p>The primary use case will be in the Token House’s evaluation of prospective budgets, but these guidelines can also help ensure more consistency and predictability for voter rewards (delivered retroactively at the end of each Season, based on governance participation.) They are not necessarily meant to be used in Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) rounds.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-will-this-framework-evolve-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-will-this-framework-evolve-3\"></a>How will this Framework Evolve?</h2>\n<p>This suggested framework is a step towards transitioning more allocation decision making to the community. In Season 7, we plan to introduce a Budget Board to make recommendations to the Collective about allocation parameters. The Budget Board may use these guidelines as a starting point from which they propose a rewards framework or policy to be ratified by governance. Our recommendation is that any future policy be kept as streamlined as possible. The more complexity and/ or the more variables involved, the more difficult forecasting and budgeting will be for the Collective in the future.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"general-guidelines-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#general-guidelines-4\"></a>General Guidelines</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It is important to remember that the Governance Fund is a temporary mechanism and that most* governance operations will need to transition to be supported by Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding).</li>\n<li>Distributing rewards retroactively solves many of the compensation and budgeting problems prevalent in other DAOs. However, until the Retro Funding mechanism is reliable enough to support the entire Collective, we recommend setting budgets with a target of 20% of rewards coming from Retro Funding, understanding this ratio should transition towards ~100% for most contributions in the long term.

Impact Ratings are conceptual, to be used as a non-binding guide in determining budgets or rewards for various contributions.</p>\n<p>This framework does not imply rewards will or should be made for all contributions that fall under an Impact Rating. Conversely, contributions that fall outside these examples may still be rewarded. Governance participants should use this framework to reason about which rating a given contribution would fall under and/or whether a given contributor should receive above/below the amount suggested by the corresponding Impact Rating (ie. leadership positions on a Council.) Impact Ratings will not be officially assigned or tracked as they are merely a decision making tool for the community to better assess budget requests and understand voter rewards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"why-impact-ratings-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#why-impact-ratings-7\"></a>Why Impact Ratings?</h3>\n<p>It is a design principle of the Collective to focus on outputs (impact) rather than inputs (amount of work) and we believe this approach should be reflected in a Collective Reward Framework. This framework also allows for the flexibility required to be adaptive over time while preserving the integrity of OP as a governance token (1 OP = 1 OP.) Given the need to be adaptive and the Collective’s approach to iteration and learning, each Season, the amount of OP suggested for each Impact Rating will be adjusted, and ratified, as appropriate.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Below are the suggested Impact Ratings for Season 6. Suggested rewards are on a per contributor basis.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Impact 1</strong> = <em>Contributes to the <strong>accessibility</strong> of the Collective; no specialized skills or context needed</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Engaging in behaviors that promote <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-values/6985\">Collective Values</a>, such as disclosing conflicts of interest, promoting long term decision making, or empowering community members to make better decisions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suggested Season 6 Rewards: 250 OP per Season</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Impact 2</strong> = <em>Contributes to the <strong>accessibility</strong> of the Collective; some specialized skills and context needed</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Completing actions or tasks that require some understanding and or specialised skill.

What is your assessment of any benchmark milestones and/or impact KPIs that were set in your Budget Proposal or Charter at the start of the Season? Have you made progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase votable supply<br>\n<strong>Assessment:</strong><br>\nThe delegation to the ACC multisig on January 17 resulted in a significant increase in the votable supply, rising from 72,639,280 to 89,035,209 OP. However, since January 17, the votable supply only increased slightly to 90,049,387 OP by May 8. While the initial increase indicates a positive impact, subsequent growth was limited, and this was not solely due to the ACC existence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Define and uphold standards for top delegates<br>\n<strong>Assessment:</strong><br>\nThe first ACC’s charter introduced responsibilities such as maintaining a percentage of approvals or providing reasons for non-approvals. However, these requirements sparked discussions among members regarding the relevance of this type of responsibilities, likely leading to changes for Season 6. ACC members, who are naturally some of the most engaged contributors in the Collective, accounted for 165 of the 269 approvals given during Cycles 16 and 19, which covered the mission requests. While these requirements are likely to change for the next season, the activity level of these top delegates will probably remain unaffected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Retention of top individual delegates as OP Chains and protocols gain voting power<br>\n<strong>Assessment:</strong><br>\nMost delegates who met the membership criteria and opted in have consistently participated in the collective throughout Season 5. However, further strategies could focus on organically increasing delegation to these high-impact individuals to ensure continued engagement. Also, a detailed analysis should be conducted when Season 6 is over.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Establish a process and bridge for communication between Token House and Citizens’ House<br>\n<strong>Assessment:</strong><br>\nDuring this cycle, we didn’t need to create any reports as there were no capture attempts. Consequently, we have not had direct contact beyond the fact that some members are part of both the ACC and the Citizens’ House.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Impact assessment - how well did your team’s outputs support the Intent they were authorized under?</strong><br>\nThe Commission utilized the delegation it received to vote on all protocol upgrades, except during Voting Cycle 19, when we encountered issues while experimenting with different voting methods. Additionally, the work conducted this season has been significantly influenced by Intent 4 as we strive to ensure that internal processes remain as decentralized, transparent, and accessible as possible.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this experiment has led to extremely rich discussions about Governor upgrades and the need for greater decentralization in governance. These discussions have undoubtedly had a significant impact on the Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What changes would you make to the Internal Operating Procedures (IOP’s)?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clarify the voting windows now that we have established a voting method.</li>\n<li>Improve the definition of the forms of notification for upcoming votes.</li>\n<li>Set the default call length to 30 minutes, which can be extended under certain exceptions.</li>\n<li>Create an additional position alongside the Lead to share some of the responsibilities held during Season 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Suggested adjustments to the Charter?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modify the member responsibilities to better define our role as a group that acts in response to a capture attempt.</li>\n<li>Eliminate the mid-season membership recalculation, as it was time-consuming and did not result in significant changes to the number of members. In general, we should aim for minimization and strive to simplify the Charter as much as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. What improvements to the team’s mandate would you suggest for next Season? If you don’t believe the team’s operations should continue next Season, please explain why here.</strong></p>\n<p>I recommend continuing the team’s operations into next season. Although interaction with OP chains was limited this season, it’s expected to change in Season 6. If conditions remain the same, we should reconsider the future of the ACC. However, the Commission’s relevance is likely to grow with each season, so it’s essential to maintain and adapt our efforts as needed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To close this post, I want to thank everyone who engaged with the Anticapture Commission—whether by asking a question or joining an Office Hours.</p>\n<p>Thanks you Dane for taking the time to guide me when I felt lost.</p>\n<p>A special thanks to the Governance team from the Foundation, who provided invaluable support throughout this period.

Consistent with Optimism’s approach to governance, we will evaluate this Mission Request as an experiment to learn we can best support developer growth across the Superchain. The approach in future seasons may change based on learnings, feedback, and iteration.</p>\n<p>Under this Mission Request, L2 Chains listed in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133#superchain-registry-5\">Superchain Registry</a> will be able to request OP to make grants within their own ecosystems. This is similar to Distributed Domain Allocation and creates a scalable strategy to support the broader Superchain by empowering OP Chains to leverage their ecosystem specific expertise.</p>\n<p>If this Mission Request is approved, the Grants Council will process applications from OP Chains requesting tokens to run their own grants program but will not process individual grant applications for other OP Chains.  Qualifying OP Chains do not have to have an existing public grants program in order to apply.</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested framework for relative allocation under this Mission Request:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We suggest allocating 65% of the Intent 3B Budget to OP Chains already in the Superchain, distributed pro-rata based on contribution to the Collective to date (excluding OP Mainnet)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We suggest reserving the remaining 35% of the Intent 3B Budget for new OP Chains, defined as having launched mainnet within the last six months, joining the Superchain throughout the Season. In the case of new Chains, we recommend budget be allocated according to the Foundation’s Chain Health Framework (more information to be provided as soon as possible.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We suggest a cap of 3M OP for any individual L2 OP Chain, to prevent winner takes all dynamics</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Participating OP Chains are encouraged to make grants consistent with approved Mission Requests under Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3A</span>. OP Chains should not use their grants to run grant programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g. making grants to migrate protocols from Mainnet to another chain).</p>\n<p>Participating OP Chains are also encouraged to coordinate with the Grants Council on best practices to create a consistent grants application process across the Superchain and to avoid repeating mistakes we’ve already learned from. For the sake of shared learning, it is highly encouraged that all participating OP Chains publish a retrospective at the end of the Season.</p>\n<p>Any tokens not granted via OP Chain grants programs at the end of the Season shall be returned to the Governance Fund. Grants to OP Chains will be subject to the typical milestone based delivery and assessment process. Grants made by OP Chains will also be subject to the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833\">Grant Policies</a>. <strong>OP Chains participating in this program will be required to sign an agreement with the Foundation to this effect.</strong></p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107","pubDate":"Thu, 09 May 2024 23:51:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8107"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-suggested-mission-requests/8107.rss","#text":"Season 6: Suggested Mission Requests"}}]}}}
