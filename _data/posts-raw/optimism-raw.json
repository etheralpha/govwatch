One area that could be further improved is liquidity management, particularly for assets with interest-bearing features, such as sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>\n<p>sDAI is a synthetic stablecoin that aims to track the price of DAI. However, its price can experience periods of volatility due to factors such as market conditions, changes in the underlying collateral, demand for the asset, and its <strong>interest-bearing</strong> nature. This volatility can make it challenging for liquidity providers to maintain a healthy balance of USDC (or other stablecoins) and sDAI in their pools.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n<p>I propose an automated liquidity management (ALM) system for Velodrome that would use a dynamic range to adjust the ratio of USDC to sDAI in liquidity pools based on the interest rate of sDAI. The range would increase gradually as the price/interest rate of sDAI increases, helping to protect liquidity providers from impermanent loss and capturing the additional yield generated by sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed ALM system would offer several benefits, including:</p>\n<p>Reduced impermanent loss: The dynamic range would help to reduce impermanent loss for liquidity providers, as it would adjust the pool‚Äôs composition to account for changes in the volatility, price, or interest rate of sDAI.</p>\n<p>Increased capital efficiency: The system would allow liquidity providers to make better use of their capital by automatically adjusting the pool‚Äôs composition.</p>\n<p>Improved liquidity: The system would help to improve liquidity for sDAI, making it easier for traders to buy and sell the asset.</p>\n<p>Captured yield: The system would allow liquidity providers to capture the additional yield generated by sDAI, increasing their overall returns.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>The ALM system could be implemented using a smart contract that would monitor the price, volatility, and interest rate of sDAI and adjust the pool‚Äôs composition accordingly. The smart contract would need to be carefully designed and audited to ensure its security and reliability.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>An automated liquidity management system with an increasing range would be a valuable addition to Velodrome. It would help to reduce impermanent loss for liquidity providers, increase capital efficiency, improve liquidity for sDAI, and allow liquidity providers to capture the additional yield generated by sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Details</strong></p>\n<p>The following are some additional details about the proposed ALM system:</p>\n<p>The range would be calculated using a formula that takes into account the price, volatility, interest rate, and other relevant factors of sDAI.</p>\n<p>The range would be updated periodically, such as every hour or every day.</p>\n<p>Liquidity providers would be able to choose whether or not to participate in the ALM system.</p>\n<p>The ALM system would be open source and auditable.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>This proposal is still under development, and I am open to feedback and suggestions.

Yes, the proposed solution addresses the DMR.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible? I believe the proposal is <em>partially</em> feasible. I feel that the most valuable part of this proposal is high-quality open source tooling for creating, operating, and upgrading an OP Stack chain without the need for a RaaS provider. Creating this tooling and making it amazing will set the foundation for a decentralized RaaS in the future. Additionally, there are technical limitations on the protocol that make a truly decentralized RaaS less feasible at the moment. By removing the marketplace aspect of this proposal and doubling down on the high-quality tooling, I believe this work would be much more successful long term.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? Not strictly, see comment above.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team? Unsure. I cannot find any evidence that this team has the understanding of the OP Stack or the experience with cloud infrastructure required to deliver this project.

However, I am concerned that this project would conflict with existing planned work for the fault proof. Other changes like updates to the fault proof required to support Superchain interoperability and support for multiple proof types likely take precedence over this work. Given the security-critical nature of this code path, the proposed changes would likely have to involve engineers from OP Labs whose time would probably consumed by other projects. It is possible that the fault proof protocol changes before this proposal can be accepted into the protocol.<br>\nIt is additionally worth noting that the underlying concern that the proposal is addressing has not been sufficiently analyzed. Although the proposal does increase the cost of censorship, the community currently lacks the research to demonstrate that the censorship risk posed by the current 40-transaction model is unacceptable for Stage 2.<br>\nGiven the above, I would recommend against carrying out this proposal not on technical merits but on strategic ones. I‚Äôm mostly worried that the team will spend time on this project and the end result will not be included in the final protocol. Instead, I would encourage the team to submit an alternative proposal that focuses on carrying out the underlying research to demonstrate the censorship risk relative to the number of transactions required as part of the game. Specifically, it would be valuable to understand the exact cost and feasibility of an attacker to execute a censorship attack as the number of transactions required as part of the proof increases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 2:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I am excited to see the proposal. I think that it would be high leverage to work on and it‚Äôs completion would really improve the efforts to decentralized the OP stack. The team is strong with a good track record and the proposal is well thought out. I think the collection of individuals who have a strong understanding of the dispute game and fault proofs is small and given me personal expertise i believe this applicant has a strong understanding. I think the requested amount is modest and more than reasonable. I believe that stage two decentralization for for the OP stack and that improvements to the dispute game (currently bisection) should be a priority and I endorse this proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 3:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I am a fan of any kind of meaningful performance improvement, especially if it‚Äôs an introduction of new algorithm for the dispute game.

Yes. This moves the OP Stack towards one of its main goals of decentralized fault proving. One could argue that this is less of a research project as it has concrete produce outputs, but it probably fits best of any of the DMRs.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible? Yes, although more research is needed to understand if their prover is fast enough to accomplish the goals.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? No obvious ones other than the open question of whether their prover is fast enough to support this use case. While they do include some speedups regarding witness generation, it would be nice to see an estimated trace length for proving a block and some estimate of how long it would take to prove said trace based on smaller benchmarks.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team?

I think as superchain vision is realized there will be way more OP Stack L2s that won‚Äôt receive support from Etherscan and can‚Äôt pay for an integration.

The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, and facilitated by the Foundation, based on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by the Collective. It is at this point that the Foundation becomes just one of many ‚ÄúCore Delegates‚Äù proposing design changes to the system (metagovernance).</p>\n<p>As outlined in <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728/2\">The Path to Open Metagovernance,</a> the path to open metagovernance will occur gradually over multiple phases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To date, we‚Äôve been primarily in <strong>Phase 0: community informed design.</strong> The Optimism Foundation open-sources our internal research and proposes designs based on active feedback from governance participants. We receive feedback on late-stage drafts from high-context stakeholders informally, usually after designs are complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now we are ready to start entering <strong>Phase 1: Community consulted design process.</strong> That means will we continue open-sourcing more of our design principles, process, and goals to the community to build shared context while also consulting community members earlier in the design process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will do this via two primary mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Frequent polls on low-context design parameters, open to any community member‚Äôs input.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Higher context feedback requested of an experimental Collective Feedback Commission. The Commission mostly formalizes what has, to date, been an informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance participants such as Council Leads, top delegates, engaged Citizens, external teams, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) recipients.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Please note all existing avenues for community feedback will remain in place, allowing any member of the community to share their input for incorporation by the Foundation, as always. The goal of Phase 1 is to bring more people into the design process, not keep anybody out. The Feedback Commission is an addition to the existing feedback channels, not a replacement for any of them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"collective-feedback-commission-cfc-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#collective-feedback-commission-cfc-2\"></a>Collective Feedback Commission (CFC)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Collective Feedback Commission will consult the Foundation on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Collective Feedback Commission will include 10 highly engaged Citizens and 15 high-context delegates, selected based on the qualifying criteria outlined below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>10 highly engaged Citizens have been selected based on their contributions, specifically as they relate to governance design, in Retro Funding Rounds 2 &amp; 3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth\">Carl Cervone</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/ccerv1\">@ccerv1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/launamu.eth\">LauNaMu</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/launamu\">@LauNaMu</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/MMPx9GNZ0mHXgMsTuOmBsmpBnLt31faqIayrD2R1EGs\">Spencer</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/spengrah\">@spengrah</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/lefteris-rpgf-3-voting-rationale-learnings-and-feedback/7213\">Lefteris</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/lefterisjp\">@lefterisjp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@msteph/ByG23qs2T\">Matt Stephenson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/joans-rpgf3-reflections/7221\">Joan</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/joanbp\">@joanbp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/simulating-retropgf3-voting-and-funding-allocations/7274\">Amy Jung</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/amy\">@amy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/revs-rpgf3-retro/7290\">Rev Miller</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/revmiller\">@revmiller</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03530\">Sarah Allen</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/saraha\">@saraha</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177/151\">Griff Green</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/griff\">@Griff</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All (Season 5) Council/Board/Commission Leads qualify to participate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alisha.eth <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/alisha.eth\">@alisha.eth</a></li>\n<li>Teresa <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/teresacd\">@teresacd</a></li>\n<li>Brichis.eth <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/brichis\">@brichis</a></li>\n<li>Gonna.eth <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth\">@Gonna.eth</a></li>\n<li>Brock <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/brockelmore\">@brockelmore</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The top 10 disclosed Token House delegates, as per Agora on 3/6/23 (end of Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#19</span>) qualify to participate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/a16zs-continued-participation-in-optimism-governance/7562\">a16z</a></li>\n<li>L2BEATs <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/kaereste\">@kaereste</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/sinkas\">@Sinkas</a></li>\n<li>Linda Xie <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/linda\">@linda</a></li>\n<li>Polynya <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/polynya\">@polynya</a></li>\n<li>Olimpio <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/olimpio\">@olimpio</a></li>\n<li>GFX Labs <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/gfxlabs\">@GFXlabs</a></li>\n<li>Lefteris <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/lefterisjp\">@lefterisjp</a></li>\n<li>SNX Ambassadors <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/mattl\">@MattL</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/mastermojo\">@mastermojo</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/moneymandoug\">@MoneyManDoug</a></li>\n<li>Scott Moore <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/ceresstation\">@ceresstation</a></li>\n<li>Jack Anorak <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/jackanorak\">@jackanorak</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"how-it-works-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-it-works-3\"></a>How it Works</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All CFC members must opt-in to participate.</strong> Any open positions as a result of someone choosing not to opt-in will remain unfilled.

In scoping retro rounds in 2024, the Foundation aimed to identify the types of contributions which are most impactful to the Collective and where Retro Funding is best suited to support. The detailed scope of each retro round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"sizing-retro-rounds-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#sizing-retro-rounds-3\"></a><strong>Sizing retro rounds</strong></h3>\n<p>The aim for sizing round rewards is to provide OP rewards which accurately reflect the impact within the scope of a retro round and provide a strong incentive for contributing to the Collective. The amount of rewards for each round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.<br>\nThe Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 &amp; 5, and will proposes round sizes for Retro Funding 6 &amp; 7 to be ratified by the Citizens‚Äô House. In the future, the goal for this process will be to gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"citizen-workload-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#citizen-workload-4\"></a><strong>Citizen workload</strong></h3>\n<p>While the number of retro rounds is increasing, the goal is for individual citizen workload to not increase and possibly be reduced. In previous retro rounds, citizens‚Äô provided feedback on the time intensive labor of participating and shared concerns that increasing the number of rounds will increase the required time commitment of individual citizens. Retro Funding is actively exploring designs &amp; experiments which enable an increase in the number of rounds while not impacting individual citizens workload.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"more-rounds-more-experiments-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#more-rounds-more-experiments-5\"></a>More rounds, more experiments</h2>\n<p>Running multiple types of rounds allows us to run different experiments on the best ways to scale and improve Retro Funding.

Not all impact is the same, and different types of impact are best measured via different approaches. Below you find a summary of the framework which the Foundation applies to explore appropriate approaches to measuring different types of impact.</p>\n<p>Contributions to Optimism can be categorized as either upstream or downstream of Optimism blockspace.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upstream contributions improve Optimism itself, this includes improvements to the OP Stack and Optimism Governance</li>\n<li>Downstream contributions improve the experience of Optimism users, such as builders and consumers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fFEmdxO2Ej1MuutFh7MR4SXftu5.png?dl=1\" title=\"Untitled\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_690x105.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" data-base62-sha1=\"fFEmdxO2Ej1MuutFh7MR4SXftu5\" width=\"690\" height=\"105\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_690x105.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_1035x157.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_1380x210.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F2F2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"upstream-impact-is-measured-via-the-aggregate-utility-of-optimism-users-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#upstream-impact-is-measured-via-the-aggregate-utility-of-optimism-users-7\"></a>Upstream impact is measured via the aggregate utility of Optimism users</h4>\n<p>To evaluate impact which is upstream, we need to understand how the contribution has increased the aggregate utility of all users of the Optimism Platform.

The first step towards this vision was <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-base-to-optimism-governance/6689\">welcoming Base to the Collective</a>. In addition to being an important contributor to the Collective, Base has set the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/manifesto-how-base-will-participate-in-optimism-governance/7361\">standard</a> for active governance participation among OP Chains.</p>\n<p>In 2024, we plan to bring 5-10 more OP Chains into the Collective increasing the number of high impact contributors building the Superchain. For example, <a href=\"https://x.com/fraxfinance/status/1755386510474347002?s=20\">Frax</a> is an early committer to the Superchain vision and we expect to welcome many more such OP Chains over the coming months.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"onboarding-op-chains-to-governance-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#onboarding-op-chains-to-governance-2\"></a>Onboarding OP Chains to Governance</h3>\n<p>Increasing the number of OP Chains not only benefits the ecosystem but further decentralizes the core protocol and governance system by adding additional, high impact contributors. Importantly, OP Chains provide particularly relevant insight into Protocol Upgrades, a core responsibility of the Token House. Given the <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY\">design</a> of Optimism governance, which supports capture resistance and effective resource allocation, the addition of OP Chains should strengthen the overall governance system.</p>\n<p>To support this goal, it is likely that new OP Chains receive grants from the <a href=\"https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/\">Ecosystem Fund</a> to incentivize long term alignment with the ecosystem and active participation in Optimism Governance. It‚Äôs important that OP Chains have skin in the game and participate in the governance system to which they‚Äôve entrusted the future of their chains. That said, an important property of our governance system is that no one stakeholder gain unilateral decision-making power. As with Base, the Foundation is taking a thoughtful approach to aligning incentives as we facilitate the onboarding of OP Chains as active participants in Optimism Governance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"encouraging-aligned-participation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#encouraging-aligned-participation-3\"></a>Encouraging Aligned Participation</h3>\n<p>Some proactive measures include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directing initial governance participation to occur through the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889\">Chain Delegation Program</a>, which includes important accountability mechanisms and will help new Chains build a track record of participation before unlocking voting power through their grants. A proposal to adjust and/or extend this program to better support this goal may be put forward to the Token House in the upcoming Reflection Period.</li>\n<li>Voting caps, based on % of votable supply, may be applied when appropriate. These caps may consider planned voting participation and delegation.</li>\n<li>The Foundation will recommend OP Chains delegate all or a portion of their voting power.</li>\n<li>In instances in which an OP Chain plans to vote directly, the Foundation will provide onboarding support to promote active participation.</li>\n<li>Base serves as an example of what <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-base-will-participate-in-optimism-governance/6690\">active participation</a> can look like. All OP Chains will be strongly encouraged to take community feedback, attend community calls, and publish voting rationale and/or delegation frameworks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, it‚Äôs important to ensure all governance participants remain accountable to the Collective.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All OP Chain delegates should uphold <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241\">Optimist Expectations</a> and will be subject to the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751\">Code of Conduct</a> and <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728\">Rules of Engagement</a>, along with all other voters</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889\">Anticapture Commission</a> was established in Season 5 to monitor the Token House for signs of capture and alert the Citizens‚Äô House, the ultimate check on imbalances in the Token House, to any concerns</li>\n<li>Token grants do not confer any rights to participate in the Citizens‚Äô House</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>2024 will be an exciting year for the Superchain and Optimism governance!

If we look into <em>why</em> this is, I think we end up coming to the revelation that it is foundationally based on the fact that creating a token on this chain is both extremely cheap and extremely easy‚Äìperhaps even more so than most other chains, resulting in a higher than average concentration of scam tokens.<br>\nIn fact, I personally just spent the past 48 hours experiencing this firsthand. I have spent this entire time‚Äìsince the virality of DOGE‚Äìpurposely refusing to invest in utility-less ‚Äúmemecoins‚Äù. However, I chose to change course a few days ago, just as an experiment, and invested the most amount of money I have ever invested in that short of a period. The result was <strong>not</strong> attractive‚Äìfor me, or for ETH/OP as a community. After having put money into a total of 9 different ‚Äúmemecoins‚Äù on ETH/OP (and more on others), 6 of those ended up being rugpulls, and one ended up going severely in the red for whatever other reasons. The one <em>successful</em> token has, to this moment, only given me like a 28% gain in total. <strong>THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE</strong>! The other 2 chains I invested in coins on for the last 2 days have only totaled in <strong>one</strong> (of three) of the whole number of tokens. If we put a grain of trust in this experience, that means on ETH/OP there were 66% of tokens that were rugs, whereas only 33% on other chains were. IDK about the rest of you, but I‚Äìas a member of this community‚Äìam not even somewhat satisfied with this. It <strong>HAS</strong> to change. <strong>NOW</strong>.</p>\n<p>I propose that we start focusing on ways to prevent this from continuing or reoccurring, and I suspect that we would do well to begin looking at the simplicity with which anyone can create and launch a token. IDK if there should be any technical barriers created for creating and launching a token, or what, but <strong>something</strong> has to be fixed. I have two primary concepts that I am personally working on, which I think would serve this purpose in a clean, practical, understandable way. However, these are nowhere beyond the ideological stage, so it will take time to spin them up. I also encourage others look into doing the same.</p>\n<p>I guess since I did decide to post this here, I will mention that I would like to propose‚Äìand get input on‚Äìthe thought that I receive a small chunk of compensation to continue working on the two concepts that I have. I will mention in all fairness, that I have posted similar proposals on the forums of the other two chains aforementioned, and will ultimately choose to direct my work towards whichever project is willing and able to pay me for my efforts, but for now I am working on the concepts as if they were going to be leveraged for all three communities.</p>\n<p>I would love to hear any and all input in response to this issue, potential solutions, and the thoughts about my request for compensation for such.<br>\nI appreciate any readers‚Äô time and consideration, and hope to engage with many of you soon!</p>\n<p>‚Äìlex</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts -

$1M into a favela in Brazil as an experiment to see community managed funds used on public infrastructure</p>\n<p>Project:</p>\n<p>Another friend created Sikana, an educational video platform with tens of millions of views based in Rio.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the project could be something like producing an instructional video in Portuguese on how to cheaply and sustainably construct bathrooms.<br>\nI would love to walk through the location with a friend from Brazil and ask residents their thoughts no the whole initiative and crowdsource ideas from the locals on the best projects, and perhaps for QF and prizes they add their ideas for people to vonate towards.</p>\n<p>Community and timing:</p>\n<p>A group called Blockful was also considering running a Zuzalu style pop up village in Q1 of 2025 in Florianopolis in Brazil, and I know IpeCity network state group was also considering doing a pop up village, and Dweb Brazil has great experience running community gatherings. Perhaps I can connect all three groups and see if they wish to join forces.</p>\n<p>Research:<br>\nA friend of mine co-founder of Gitcoin and advisor to Metagov researchers group mentioned how there really should be a research paper for the effectiveness of quadratic funding so we have already discussed putting out a prize for this.<br>\nAnd of course Dr. Hanson and the economics professors of George Mason University have an amazing network of researchers.</p>\n<p>Media:<br>\nKai of Adrianople helped organize one of the largest beach clean ups in history in Brazil and so has an amazing media/marketing network</p>\n<p>Location:</p>\n<p>Then Hugo of Tools for the Commons discussed how he knows people who work in Rosinha, the largest favela in Brazil which is located just outside of Rio.</p>\n<p>Rocinha has 100,000-300,000 people packed within 1 km^2. For reference, the most densely populated city on earth Manila has only 46,000 people per km^2 (and downtown NYC has 27,000).<br>\nThe police do not enter there, the infrastructure is all built through the decentralized efforts of residents, and it is generally disconnected from the public services in the rest of the country.</p>\n<p>This is despite being a 30 minute walk from a fashion mall, a country club golf course, and a Sheraton hotel.</p>\n<p><strong>In Memoriam</strong></p>\n<p>When I was in Rio as an 18 year old backpacker, my savings from juggling shows became a fortune in the country. I ate Acai in Copacabana beach to my heart‚Äôs content, went hanggliding with a German friend, and raved in a discoteca out in a favela. People warned us we might get stabbed or robbed or drugged there, but that we had to visit because people in that area were the best dancers who knew how to have a good time.</p>\n<p>Then the next day, I walked through downtown and found the most extreme financial inequality I had ever witnessed. I had seen waves of tent encampments and shared meals under crowded bridges in the USA which is where I had seen the most inequality before this. The homeless in the USA are mostly immigrants saving up to send more funds to their kids back home, elderly who pushed away or were abandoned by their families, and drug addicts and the mentally ill. In Rio as I walked amongst the shining skyscrapers of the financial district, I saw families.</p>\n<p>I remember standing at one intersection and watching as waves of men in suits holding a phone to their ear with one hand and a laptop bag in the other rushed the marble floors lined with cardboard. On one patch of cardboard, a young mother and father were playing with their toddlers.</p>\n<p>I knew right then that I would relentlessly pursue every opportunity that I had the good fortune to come across. Now I run a tech company that provides an economic mechanism that I believe can empower people to support their families and one another and that this can scale up to neighborhoods, nations, and civilizations. Not only that, I have a network of friends who also are working for the same goals with their platforms.<br>\nLet‚Äôs test it and see if we can really make a difference.</p>\n<p>I would like to dedicate this idea in memory of my friend Antonio, who‚Äôs gentle smile and raucous laughter made my first time in Brazil a wonderful experience.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think I have some messages to send to see if there are people who wish to work together and help lead this initiative. I cannot put this together myself but if others are excited for it then it could happen.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-find-the-best-way-to-fund-public-goods-a-potential-study-on-funding-strategies-in-a-favela-in-brazil/7853\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-find-the-best-way-to-fund-public-goods-a-potential-study-on-funding-strategies-in-a-favela-in-brazil/7853","pubDate":"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 23:30:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-7853"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-find-the-best-way-to-fund-public-goods-a-potential-study-on-funding-strategies-in-a-favela-in-brazil/7853.rss","#text":"How to Find The Best Way To Fund Public Goods - A Potential Study On Funding Strategies in a Favela in Brazil"}},{"title":"Token House participation and incentives: Season 5 (Cycle 16-19)","dc:creator":"Joxes","category":"üèõ Token House Governance","description":"<p>During the previous season, we conducted a report that served as a reference for measuring participation in Governance (you can see it <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-participation-and-incentives-an-extended-analysis/6479\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>First of all, we want to acknowledge the contributions of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/dmars300\">@dmars300</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/brichis\">@brichis</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/lavande\">@lavande</a>, whose insightful feedback has enriched this report.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Season 5</strong>, our team lead by Joxes and members <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/pumbi\">@Pumbi</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/axlvaz\">@AxlVaz</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/delphine\">@delphine</a> have been working on this report, which, like the previous one, aims to provide information to evaluate the progress of our Optimism Collective processes and to detect any increase in governance participation during this season.</p>\n<p>Special recognition goes to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/pumbi\">@Pumbi</a>, who has worked diligently on tracking MissionsV2, collecting and analyzing a large volume of data (manually).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"disclaimer-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#disclaimer-1\"></a>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p><em>All the relevant data was collected manually.

With each vote, the collective has demonstrated an ability to improve decision-making processes, making Optimism a leading DAO for the rest of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Remaining true to this ethos, Season 5 witnessed not only the introduction of new councils but also changes to the missions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"missions-v2-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#missions-v2-8\"></a>Missions V2</h3>\n<p>Season 5 began on January 4, 2024. The novelties introduced during this season include the fact that, unlike Season 4, the Top 100 Delegates were required to propose or <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/seeking-mission-request-sponsorship/7130\">sponsor</a> Missions. This means that only through delegates each mission request could be proposed.</p>\n<p>Similar to Season 4, for each Mission to go to a vote in Agora, it had to receive 4 votes, and explicit support from delegates in the forum. Additionally, delegates and any community member could provide feedback to improve the mission. Once voted on in Agora, the approved proposals became the responsibility of the Grants Council, which would be tasked with selecting the teams to execute the missions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"participation-and-voting-data-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#participation-and-voting-data-9\"></a>Participation and Voting Data</h2>\n<p>The selection of mission requests requires significant activity from delegates to provide feedback, sponsor them or provide approvals to go a vote (called ‚Äúsoft approval‚Äù in the next sections). We have tracked this activity during this season.</p>\n<p>A topic was created within the forum for people to share their Mission ideas and seek sponsorship. A total of 74 missions were sponsored, which we categorized by the 4 intents:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/98465291872542951214209322719211107762519739238690458061430483715486199997958\"><strong>Intent #1</strong></a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>12 Mission Requests were

From here, we can highlight that during S5 there were more requests to carry out missions than actual missions in S4.</li>\n<li>Active delegate participation increased by 59.26% this season (27 delegates in S4 vs. 43 delegates in S5).</li>\n<li>This season, out of the 43 delegates who gave approvals 62.8% (27) provided feedback by commenting on the proposals in the governance forum. On the other hand, (16) 37.2% participated only by approving mission requests.</li>\n<li>From the total of 74 Mission Requests submitted:\n<ul>\n<li>16.22% of the missions were created for Intent 1</li>\n<li>27.03% of the missions were created for Intent 2</li>\n<li>28.38% of the missions were created for Intent 3</li>\n<li>28.38% of the missions were created for Intent 4</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Of the 74 missions proposed, if we take into account sponsorship (48) 64.9% were driven by delegates outside the top 25 with the most VP.</li>\n<li>During seasons 4 and 5, a nearly equal number of mission requests were approved by the DAO, with 27 approved in S4 and 26 during S5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusions-stay-optimistic-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#conclusions-stay-optimistic-18\"></a>Conclusions: <em>stay Optimistic!</em></h1>\n<p>After analyzing all the compared data regarding the previous season, we can notice at a glance a slight increase in delegate participation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Migrating from the 0.25% VP system to a list of Top 100 Delegates had a positive impact and contributed to the inclusion of delegates who were eager to collaborate more extensively.</li>\n<li>If the requirement to participate were extended to the Top 150 Delegates, would the % of total participation also increase?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It‚Äôs also important to note that in Season 5, the number of councils/committees increased due to the iterative and experimental nature of Optimism‚Äôs governance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the Grants Council we went from having 2 subcommittees to having 3 subcommittees, and 4 additional new councils/committees were introduced.</li>\n<li>The number of members increased from 9 in Season 4 to 47 in Season 5. It‚Äôs important to clarify that among the 47 members during this S5, there are 8 individuals who hold positions in multiple sectors such as ACC, Grants Council, govNERDs, Code of Conduct Council, among others. Therefore, to clarify, 47 positions are filled by 38 individuals, excluding individuals who hold more than one position or role.</li>\n<li>We believe this shows that the % of active involvement within the Optimism Collective is increasing and this is very important for the decentralization of governance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regarding Missions, while the number of approved missions at the end of the process remained similar between seasons, it is interesting to note that the final % passed decreased (55.1% in S4 vs 35.1% in S5).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hypothesis: as the Collective learns which type of Mission has a real positive impact on the ecosystem, the final approval rate will decrease over time as a result of specialization.</li>\n<li>It‚Äôs worth highlighting that there was a significant increase in the number of proposals created this season (49 Missions in S4 vs 74 Mission Requests in S5). A possible interpretation after analyzing this recent data is that crafting a Mission Request in S5 might be a bit easier, as the creator of the proposal isn‚Äôt necessarily the one executing it. This setup potentially fosters a freer flow of ideas and facilitates proposing with more liberty. Moreover, the applicant‚Äîwho later creates a mission based on the mission request and applies through Charmverse‚Äîcan also focus their ideas based on the mission requests and undergo the regular grants review process without the complexity that may come with participating in a forum. This is why we believe both processes maximize creativity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One not insignificant detail is that the process in Season 5 was somewhat confusing initially regarding the sponsorship by delegates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many community members were unsure about the flow from creation to approval of the proposal.</li>\n<li>Having a forum thread with + 170 messages is not a pleasant experience for someone unfamiliar with governance operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It was also observed that it was complex and an additional workload for the Top 100 delegates to review all the missions, analyze them, provide feedback, and subsequently approve them due to their quantity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assigning the review of specific missions to interested delegates was a process that greatly helped expedite the work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It‚Äôs truly amazing to participate in these processes and see more people engaging with Optimism governance. <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728\">Exciting challenges</a> lie ahead for governance, and we believe we are on the right path.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Additional resources</strong><br>\nAs we mentioned at the beginning of this report, these data and numbers were collected entirely manually.

The overwhelming interest in contributing to the Optimism ecosystem has been truly remarkable, with a total of 314 applications received for 28 mission requests.</p>\n<p>The reviewers evaluated each mission application, paying particular attention to the scope of the mission requests. Using the adapted rubric for each intent and subcommittee, assessments were made to ensure thoroughness and fairness. Looking ahead, we encourage authors to suggest additions to the standard rubric to further streamline the evaluation process. Your valuable feedback on rubrics for the upcoming round can be shared <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-rubrics-feedback-thread/7649\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This cycle showcased the unwavering dedication of every member of the grants council, as evidenced by the record number of applications reviewed. Each Growth reviewer assessed an average of 100 applications, while each builder reviewer did an average of 150 submissions. Despite the increased workload and having one less reviewer from the original design (I had to take Grant Council Lead), the commitment of the builder‚Äôs subcommittee was impeccable, and the growth subcommittee provided vital support in evaluating hybrid mission requests (Locked and liquid OP within the same application).</p>\n<p>Special acknowledgment is due to the Charmverse team for their instrumental role in providing the necessary tools to facilitate the review process. Leveraging the rubric, workflow, and form tools for the first time, we achieved an impressive success rate of 97.2% out of 314 applications without errors and solved any issues on a 12-hour gap.

For now basic functions like trading, listing, making offers, making offers based on price, filters etc. is there, but we have much more to build such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysis dashboard</li>\n<li>Easier listings</li>\n<li>Buyer‚Äôs market (e.g. \"Buy until 100k veVELO, from $0.06/veVELO)</li>\n<li>Emergency sales</li>\n<li>Divide and sell option</li>\n<li>DCA option</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?</strong> :</p>\n<p>Optimism and Base‚Äôs hub of liquidities are Velodrome and Aerodrome, therefore dominated by financial NFTs. Current marketplaces have shortcomings because they are optimized for traditional NFTs.</p>\n<p>There is a total 878,661,086 veVELO staked in total, but only 2M of it is liquid. It‚Äôs even worse for Aerodrome, as there are total of 552,442,060 veAERO, but only 700k of it is liquid.</p>\n<p>Decode is built to tackle the liqudity issue of FNFTs, aiming to be hub of FNFTs, and create a mutualist relationship with projects like Velodrome and Aerodrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how</strong> :</p>\n<p>Yes. The trend of staking mechanism is locking it and turn it into an NFT, and the biggest problem for a lot of protocols is making that NFT liquid. By simply removing that hurdle, it becomes easier for users to stake and lock, as they will know that the NFT they have can be sold any time.</p>\n<p>It also enables protocols like DYAD to deploy their protocols on Optimism, as those projects need an adapted frontend to facilitate their trading.</p>\n<p><strong>Provide us with links to any of the following for the project</strong> :</p>\n<p>Website : <a href=\"https://decode.market\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://decode.market</a><br>\nDiscord : <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RJu2y7M7sw\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Decode</a><br>\nTwitter : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Decode_NFT\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/Decode_NFT</a></p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any metrics on the project currently?</strong> (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>Who are your competitors?</strong> :<br>\nOpenxSwap, OpenSea</p>\n<p><strong>What differentiates you from your competitors?</strong> :</p>\n<p>Our singular focus is on Financial NFTs unlike our competitiors.

As the <a href=\"https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5edebbdae7b5c79a69aacf7873796bb1ec664db8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">transactions</a> ramp up and we plan to attend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Optimism/status/1770554463482216611\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the demo</a> tomorrow, I‚Äôd like to share some background of Matters Town and the perspective from a community quite different from the ones already on Optimism.</p>\n<p>In 2018, there was widespread recognition of the collapse of the media ecosystem in Chinese, a language used by 1/5 of the world population. As in the English world, social media outcompete traditional media, especially the small and independent ones, and then fill the void with viral and manipulative content controlled by algorithms. For Chinese users, things were hugely exacerbated by an authoritarian government that has fine-grain control over what you can publish and read.</p>\n<p>In the debris emerged Matters, a global community of writers, creators, and builders seeking a better way to distribute and sustain valuable content, a new space in the digital world to practice democratical self-governance. We turned to p2p protocols and the nascent blockchain technology, hoping to build a censorship-resilient network that can sustain content with great public value. The main application Matters Town quickly fit into the need and grew to over 120k creators and 600k monthly readers. It also spread into other languages, first to Russian and Farsi where users have similar needs, then to more than 40 other languages.</p>\n<p>We later realized that starting from practical needs, the problems we need to overcome are uncommon in the Web3 world that is shaped by cycles of ups and downs. For instance, we combined ActivityPub, the most widely adopted social protocol, with IPFS for p2p data transfer; we utilized donation, the most common financial relation between reader and creator, as the on-chain <a href=\"https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5edebbdae7b5c79a69aacf7873796bb1ec664db8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">curation signal</a>; we designed from scratch an <a href=\"https://matterslab.notion.site/On-chain-Billboard-for-Decentralized-Content-Ecosystems-aa10959b6258456ebbf7f5f49eb9f0fd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">on-chain advertisement protocol</a> to sustain the underserved creators.</p>\n<p>This year we started to apply to the Optimism mission grants, after which the uncommonness of our situation became more apparent. It is hard to find a mission that is suitable for a project like ours, one that does not focus on crypto for its own sake, but instead uses it for other needs. The only mission that was relevant was <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-to-vote-onboarding-existing-communities-organizations-to-optimism-solving-real-world-problems/7433\">a draft about onboarding communities</a> that eventually failed to pass.</p>\n<p>However, this uncommonness seems to reveal a problem if what we want is advancing digital public goods. Financial instruments do not create value directly, instead, they redistribute value and enable value-creating endeavors. The most common form of value in the digital world is content, ranging from articles to videos, from ebooks to games. Therefore, to grow an ecosystem for public goods, we have to enable valuable public content, creating systems for them to be discovered and sustained. Viewing from growth and impact, public content is also highly valuable for the Optimism ecosystem. There are only a small fraction of people who trade assets directly, but almost everyone engages with online content one way or another. These engagements shape how we feel and think as individuals and as a society.</p>\n<p>We will keep building on Optimism, using it as the incentive system and content index. I also advocate that we should together push Optimism beyond a financial engine, into the backbone of content ecosystems that can benefit the general society. Projects like Wikipedia, Internet Archive, Project Gutenberg, and Library Genesis are the treasury of the internet that have shaped a generation of brilliant minds. If we build such great projects now, I am hopeful they will be fairer and more sustainable. I am also hopeful that they will happen on Optimism.</p>\n<p>I would love to hear your opinions.

OP Stack has implemented a seamless cross-chain transaction call between L1 and L2 layers: A transaction call happens on the source chain and will be fully executed on the target chain. Introducing the custom gas token will fundamentally change the meaning of the <strong>value</strong> field in the tuple: the different gas tokens on L1 and L2 mean that the value of gas tokens is no longer equal. By adjusting the token handling logic in the cross-chain communication layer(<strong>Portal</strong> and <strong>L2toL1MessagePasser</strong>), OP Stack can keep the semantic of cross-chain transaction calls the same, reducing the impact on other components.</p>\n<p>The fee of cross-chain transactions is influenced by custom gas tokens due to the different prices of gas tokens. By implementing a token price oracle and considering token prices for fee calculations, the system can still maintain financial balance even if the income and expenses are two distinct tokens.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-3motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-3motivation-3\"></a>3.Motivation</h2>\n<p>Many projects aspire to deploy their own layer2 or even layer3 solutions for various reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Low Transaction Fees</strong>: Scenarios like GameFi, SocialFi, and DEX platforms demand extremely cost-effective transaction fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Customized Chain Requirements</strong>: Projects often require customized features and rapid iterations such as precompiled contracts, shorter block times, and customized Abstract Account solutions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>They often want to enhance project value by issuing tokens that can serve as gas tokens on Layer 2. However, OP Stack currently lacks support for this feature. Therefore, this draft focuses on enabling custom gas tokens on the OP Stack codebase.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-4specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-4specification-4\"></a>4.Specification</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3e9f3095ae1284df5723e70700a5e44e8a028f81.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8VYFgYBHjIlJzDhuutsMuZdukLf.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3e9f3095ae1284df5723e70700a5e44e8a028f81_2_624x188.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"8VYFgYBHjIlJzDhuutsMuZdukLf\" width=\"624\" height=\"188\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3e9f3095ae1284df5723e70700a5e44e8a028f81_2_624x188.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3e9f3095ae1284df5723e70700a5e44e8a028f81.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/3/3e9f3095ae1284df5723e70700a5e44e8a028f81.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDEEE9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The current OP Stack‚Äôs cross-chain communication follows a layered model comprising <strong>application layer</strong> and <strong>communication layer</strong>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-41-communication-layer-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-41-communication-layer-5\"></a>4.1 Communication Layer</h3>\n<p>The communication layer is accessible without permission.

This is achieved through the collaboration of <strong>Portal</strong>, <strong>MessagePasser</strong> contracts on two chains, along with <strong>op-node</strong>. The cross chain call can be represented as <strong>{from, to, mintValue, value, data, gaslimit}</strong>, the <strong>mintValue</strong> means the amount of minted L2 gas token when deposit to L2, the <strong>value</strong> means the the transfer amount of L2 gas token to the to account.</li>\n<li>Verification of Cross-Chain messages. In the process of L1 to L2, the op-node observes the events on L1 and includes deposit transactions into blocks, verification passes only if it can reach state consensus. The tx from L2 to L1 is verified through Merkel proofs and fraud proofs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The introduction of custom gas tokens mainly impacts the ‚Äò<strong>value</strong>‚Äô field in cross-chain transaction calls.

Option 2 is a simple and lightweight solution, however, its capability is slightly weaker than option <strong>1. Overall, the architecture of option1 is better .</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-42-application-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-42-application-layer-9\"></a>4.2 Application Layer</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Messenger</strong> and <strong>Bridge</strong> modules together form the entire application, enabling tokens to flow freely between two chains. <strong>Messenger</strong> manages message nonces and failure retry mechanisms. <strong>Bridge</strong> acts as the gateway, providing user interfaces and managing token mapping relationships.</p>\n<p>The introduction of custom gas primarily impacts the <strong>Bridge</strong> module in two aspects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>interfaces changed; Introduce two new interfaces <strong>depositGasToken</strong> and <strong>withdrawGasToken</strong> to reduce confusion, along with their corresponding <strong>finalize</strong> interface on the other chain.</li>\n<li>the processing logic of gas tokens on both chains changed. Because the gas token is an ERC20 token on the other chain, this part should be properly handled.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"h-43-l1-to-l2-fee-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-43-l1-to-l2-fee-10\"></a>4.3 L1 to L2 Fee</h3>\n<p>When a user initiates a deposit transaction on Layer 1 and specifies a gas limit, this transaction will ensure that an equivalent amount of gas limit is executed or burned on Layer 1 as a form of fee charge. This mechanism serves to prevent DoS attacks on Layer 2 through cross-chain transactions.</p>\n<p>If L2 adopts the custom gas token solution, there will be no need to charge fees by burning gas tokens on L1. When the gas limit exceeds a certain threshold, an amount of <strong>gaslimit * L2 base fee</strong> of L2 custom gas token will be transferred from the user‚Äôs account to a treasury account in ERC20 format. In the ResourceConfig contract of L1, there are two parameters: <strong>minimumBaseFee</strong> and <strong>maximumBaseFee</strong>. By considering the prices of two gas tokens, setting these two parameters appropriately can make <strong>gaslimit * L2 base fee</strong> approximately equal to the cost of executing this transaction on L2. The operator of L2 subsequently has the authority to withdraw L2 custom gas tokens from the treasury.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-44-l2-to-l1-fee-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-44-l2-to-l1-fee-11\"></a>4.4 L2 to L1 Fee</h3>\n<p>When users send transactions on L2, they are required to pay an <strong>L1Fee</strong> to cover the costs of DA and fixed overhead. The calculation formula for <strong>L1Fee</strong> is: <strong>L1Fee = L1GasUsed * L1GasPrice * FeeScalar</strong>. The <strong>L1GasUsed</strong> is related to the length of transaction raw data and compression rate.</p>\n<p>Considering the different prices of gas tokens on two chains, a new operator will be introduced: <strong>TokenPriceRatio</strong>. The formula will be:</p>\n<p><strong>L1GasPrice = L1GasPrice * TokenPriceRatio</strong></p>\n<p><strong>L1Fee = L1GasUsed * L1GasPrice * FeeScalar</strong></p>\n<p>However, the value of <strong>TokenPriceRatio</strong> cannot be automatically calculated by the system; it requires an Oracle mechanism where an off-chain service feeds the price into the L2 contract. Price feeds come in different forms and algorithms, OP Stack can leave it to the maintainer of L2. Even if the price feed lags or is inaccurate, it won‚Äôt cause major financial losses, but may create an imbalance between income and expenses in a short period.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-45-wrap-gas-token-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-45-wrap-gas-token-12\"></a>4.5 Wrap Gas Token</h3>\n<p>Since the gas token is a wrapped ERC20 token on another chain, the ERC20 needs to be deployed in advance and maintained as globally unique. Typically, the gas token wrapped in L1 already exists, so all that‚Äôs required is to pre-deploy the ERC20 format contract of the L1 gas token on L2. The issue of other L2 tokens remains unchanged.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/enable-custom-gas-token-on-op-stack/7834\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/enable-custom-gas-token-on-op-stack/7834","pubDate":"Tue, 19 Mar 2024 09:29:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-7834"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/enable-custom-gas-token-on-op-stack/7834.rss","#text":"Enable Custom Gas Token on OP Stack"}},{"title":"Open Source Contributors - A promising alternative to idea based funding","dc:creator":"lovegrovegeorge","category":"üèõ Token House Governance","description":"<p>We‚Äôve recently finished a proposal outlining the opportunity to experiment with an open source contributor funding process.

Many voters lack the sufficient context, skills and experience required to be well informed and effectively participate in these decisions. The selection process can be highly time consuming and complex for the voters. Voters can rarely express their exact preferences with their voting decisions and also do not have enough accountability or incentives to be expected to spend a meaningful amount of time on voting to make more optimal and well informed decisions.</li>\n<li>For Web3 ecosystems, ideas are often treated as ephemeral yes or no funding decisions rather than being a collaborative process that looks to discuss and explore different solution approaches. In larger funding processes it can also become easier for innovative ideas to be ignored due to being less well understood or known. The allocation of assets can also be more inefficient in situations where the allocated funds are not actively being used to generate contribution outcomes, this can increase the percentage of deadweight assets that are not being fully utilised at a given point in time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To understand these problems in more detail you can review our analysis on the current funding landscape - <a href=\"https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/current-funding-landscape\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Current funding landscape | Contributors</a></p>\n<p>The good news is that most of these problems can be either greatly reduced or fully resolved! An open source contributor funding process can help with resolving these problems and also could become a highly reliable and effective process for maintaining and improving Web3 ecosystems over the long term.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dfVGL3faJmTg9b9msENXyJpbhnE.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"web3-open-source-contributor-funding\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996_2_690x365.jpeg\" alt=\"web3-open-source-contributor-funding\" data-base62-sha1=\"dfVGL3faJmTg9b9msENXyJpbhnE\" width=\"690\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996_2_690x365.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996_2_1035x547.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996_2_1380x730.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D1DEE6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Our proposal outlines the suggestion of experimenting with directly funding a small number of open source developers that would help with developing any open source initiatives - this could include improving any existing pieces of software used in the ecosystem or creating entirely new tools and libraries.</p>\n<p>The advantages and long term opportunities for adopting a contributor funding approach are numerous. We‚Äôve covered the advantages and opportunities of this suggested funding process in more detail in our proposal - <a href=\"https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/open-source-contributor-funding\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open source contributor funding | Contributors</a></p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"experimentation-in-optimism-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#experimentation-in-optimism-1\"></a>Experimentation in Optimism</h1>\n<p>The Optimism ecosystem already has some idea based funding processes with Collective Grants and Retroactive Grants (RetroPGF). These grants processes are great for people that already have an idea to execute but does not help with situations where developers are keen to join the ecosystem but do not have an idea to execute at the moment.</p>\n<p>Experimenting with an open source contributor funding process could simply mean adding in an extra form process to enable software developers to indicate their interest in contributing to the Optimism ecosystem as a contributor. These individuals could then help with existing open source solutions being built or new ones that the Optimism Foundation suggest to them.</p>\n<p>The immediate opportunity with experimenting with a contributor focused funding approach would be that it would make it easier for software developers to indicate their interest in working in the Optimism ecosystem. The Optimism Foundation could then identify if there are any promising candidates that could be suitable for contributing towards any relevant initiative in the ecosystem. Contributor funding proposals could end up bringing in impactful talent that otherwise might not have got involved due to the more time consuming upfront idea proposal process. The idea process can make it more difficult for these individuals to just express their interest in working in the ecosystem. A contributor focussed process could provide a more collaborative path for identifying promising talent and matching them with ongoing work that could create impact in the ecosystem.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"experiment-facilitation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#experiment-facilitation-2\"></a>Experiment facilitation</h1>\n<p>If any ecosystem was interested in experimenting with this suggested funding process but doesn‚Äôt want to handle the process fully themselves I am eager to collaborate with them and help wherever I can with setting up and running any of these experiments that are focussed on contributor funding.</p>\n<p>In either event, contributor funding experiments across many ecosystems could be highly beneficial for the wider industry. The outcomes from these experiments can be analysed to better compare the strengths and weaknesses of this suggested approach against the widely adopted idea based funding approach that we see being more widely used across Web3 ecosystems today. Analysing and documenting these experiment outcomes is something that we intend to work on at the Web3 Association</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"community-discussion-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#community-discussion-3\"></a>Community discussion</h1>\n<p><strong>General thoughts &amp; feedback</strong><br>\nThere‚Äôs likely going to be many opportunities and problems that could be better explored and addressed.

As Optimism is central to enhancing Ethereum‚Äôs scalability, it is imperative to ensure $OP tokens are broadly available and accessible in a secure manner. The upcoming bull market and strategic movements by platforms like Coinbase to direct new users towards their L2 solution, Base, amplify the necessity of this initiative. Addressing this need is vital for fostering a positive user experience, securing the ecosystem, and preparing for an influx of users to superchains.</p>\n<p><strong>Context and Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>The scalability solutions provided by Optimism, through optimistic rollups, have catalyzed the growth of an ecosystem that includes significant projects like Mode and Coinbase‚Äôs Base. The constrained liquidity of $OP tokens across superchains, paired with the potential for unofficial and insecure liquidity pools, presents a substantial risk to users‚Äîespecially newcomers to the blockchain space. There are already liquidity poos being created on Aerodrome that have axlOP as a pair with extremely low liquidity ($90K) and there is also the risk that malicious actors will create liquidity pools with fake $OP tokens to try and scam newer users. The anticipation of a bull market and Coinbase‚Äôs initiative to onboard new users to Base underscores the urgency to develop official and trusted liquidity solutions for $OP tokens. These steps will ensure user safety and enhance the overall user experience across the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Solutions</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Native $OP Support on Superchains</strong>: Investigate the feasibility of natively integrating $OP tokens across superchains. This could involve foundational research and development, potentially funded by the Optimism Foundation, to explore secure, efficient mechanisms for $OP token interoperability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Official Bridge Partnerships</strong>: Identify and collaborate with a select number of bridge partners, such as Axelar and LayerZero, to facilitate $OP token transfers. Providing substantial liquidity to these bridges can ensure a secure, seamless experience for users moving between chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sponsorship of Official Liquidity Pools</strong>: Either directly sponsor or incentivize the creation of official liquidity pools for $OP against popular stablecoins like USDC and major assets like WETH on all L2 solutions within the Superchain ecosystem. This approach would guarantee reliable, safe access to $OP tokens for users across different platforms.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The need for official and trusted $OP token liquidity solutions has never been more pressing, with the anticipated bull market and strategic user onboarding initiatives by platforms like Coinbase. By prioritizing native support, official bridge partnerships, and sponsored liquidity pools, Optimism can safeguard its ecosystem, enhance user experiences, and solidify its position as a leader in scalable blockchain solutions. Implementing these strategies will prepare the Optimism ecosystem for the influx of new users, ensuring security, trust, and ease of access to $OP tokens across superchains.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-for-enhancing-op-token-liquidity-across-superchains/7827\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-for-enhancing-op-token-liquidity-across-superchains/7827","pubDate":"Mon, 18 Mar 2024 01:18:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-7827"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-for-enhancing-op-token-liquidity-across-superchains/7827.rss","#text":"Proposal for Enhancing $OP Token Liquidity Across Superchains"}},{"title":"WakeUp Labs - General Comms Thread Our Journey on Optimism","dc:creator":"WakeUp_Labs","category":"üì¢ Updates and Announcements","description":"<h2><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#tldr-1\"></a>TL,DR.</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wakeuplabs.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">WakeUp Labs</a> is a studio offering advanced development services to EVM-Compatible Chains, DAOs, and businesses.

During the Final Review, each reviewer in a given sub-committee will consider each remaining application and assign it a score. After each application has been scored by each reviewer, the sub-committee will rank the list by average score and choose the number of applications (‚Äún‚Äù) that will receive a grant. Applications 1-n will be finalists eligible to receive grants.</p>\n<p>Applicants will be permitted to make edits to their applications based on reviewer feedback; however, all edits should be made by Monday, March 18th, to ensure reviewers have time to consider any updates. Applicants should make sure to comment on their CharmVerse application confirming that they have made updates in order to notify reviewers as well.</p>\n<p>Significant attention will be paid to all factors listed on the rubric. The Council will look to grant size requests and attendant plans, along with milestones, particularly closely. Applicants are reminded that Experiments grants greater than 150k OP require a majority vote of all twelve council reviewers (rather than a simple majority vote of the relevant sub-committee) to pass, which presents a higher bar than the typical sub-committee process.</p>\n<p>During the preliminary assessment of this cycle, a prominent observation was the commendable professionalism and dedication exhibited by the grant reviewers with more than 70 applications each to score during two weeks (ETH Denver included). Despite a significant influx of applications, all submissions were thoroughly evaluated within the designated timeframe. The sub-committees provided substantial feedback and recommendations regarding the assessment criteria and review procedures for the subsequent cycle.</p>\n<p>The Grants Council applications whose submissions didn‚Äôt meet the initial criteria or advance to the final review stage within the upcoming week will be marked as declined in Charmverse. As customary in previous cycles, attention will soon shift towards the final review phase. However, proposers who believe they can enhance their proposals are encouraged to reapply for the next round.</p>\n<p>Application submission will be open tomorrow March 14th at 7 PM GMT.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-cycle-19-s5-r1-preliminary-review-roundup/7812\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-cycle-19-s5-r1-preliminary-review-roundup/7812","pubDate":"Thu, 14 Mar 2024 04:57:01 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-7812"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-cycle-19-s5-r1-preliminary-review-roundup/7812.rss","#text":"Grants Council - Cycle 19 (S5 R1) Preliminary Review Roundup"}},{"title":"Chaingate: network & contract adding tool","dc:creator":"0xilh","category":"‚ú® General","description":"<p><strong>Chaingate</strong> is a tool designed to simplify the exploration of the cryptocurrency world. It streamlines the process of connecting various crypto networks to your wallet and managing tokens across these networks, making it quick and straightforward.</p>\n<p><strong>With Chaingate, you can:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add new networks to your wallet with just a few clicks, avoiding the hassle of complex setup processes.</li>\n<li>Easily import coins and tokens from these networks into your wallet, granting you full access to your assets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The advantages of using Chaingate include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ease of use: It can be used without the need for complex technical knowledge.</li>\n<li>Speed: Adding networks and managing tokens are processes that are completed within seconds.</li>\n<li>Security: It does not compromise the security of your wallet since it does not require any wallet permissions.</li>\n<li>Broad network support: Compatible with every network you can think of, including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What Makes Us Different?</strong><br>\nThe cryptocurrency market is constantly growing and evolving. With this growth, different blockchain networks are also gaining popularity. However, transacting on multiple networks can be a complex and time-consuming process for users.</p>\n<p>Existing new network adding platforms offer users the convenience of adding different networks to their Metamask wallets. However, on these platforms, after adding the network, extra steps are required to add the tokens on that network to the wallet.</p>\n<p>Chaingate is here to solve this problem.
