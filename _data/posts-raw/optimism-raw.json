However, developers may lack the marketing expertise or resources needed to promote their dApps effectively. Without proper visibility and user engagement, even the most promising projects may struggle to gain traction. By supporting the marketing efforts of these projects, we can help developers reach a wider audience, increase user adoption, and create a feedback loop that drives more developers to join and contribute to the ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39793-mission-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39793-mission-summary-3\"></a>Mission Summary:</h3>\n<p>This mission focuses on not just the development of Optimism dApps but also on ensuring their adoption by providing marketing support. By helping developers handle the marketing side of their projects, we aim to increase the visibility and usage of dApps within the ecosystem. As these applications gain more users, developers will see the growth and success of their efforts, which will further incentivize them to continue developing on the Superchain. This will also attract more developers who see the potential for growth and success in building on Optimism.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39793-goal-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39793-goal-4\"></a>Goal:</h3>\n<p>To support both the development and marketing of Optimism dApps, increasing their adoption and visibility.

Despite these challenges, we received 50 applications and managed to review 100% of them at each milestone. However, only three reviewers had full context for final decision-making due to time constraints. As a result, all non-approved applications were pushed to the next cycle, giving applicants time to incorporate feedback and refine their proposals.</p>\n<p>Cycle 26 Progress: For Cycle 26, we made several improvements to address the issues from the previous cycle:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rubrics and Feedback: Rubric comments are now integrated directly into each application, allowing applicants to view scores and comments for each rubric section. This feature was swiftly implemented by the Charmverse team, and it will significantly enhance the transparency and clarity of the review process.</li>\n<li>Review Process: To improve the decision-making process, we divided the review into two groups of six Grants Council members each. This allowed for a more thorough and balanced evaluation of each application.</li>\n<li>DAB Involvement: The Developer Advisory Board (DAB) played a crucial role in this cycle by providing valuable feedback during the preliminary review. We acknowledge that incorporating their input within 24 hours was a challenge, so we have adjusted our timeline to provide preliminary review lists earlier in the process. Grants Council reviewers had a week to incorporate DAB feedback on each application and edit their scores.</li>\n<li>Application Review: We received 29 new applications in Cycle 26, along with 24 applications carried over from the previous cycle. We maintained a preliminary cutoff at 30 points and set the final cutoff for grantees at 40 points after analyzing two cycles of scores. This new threshold ensures that only applications with strong potential are considered for grants.</li>\n<li>Final Decisions: In Cycle 26, 12 new grants were approved using a top-rank priority and mission request budget limitation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new review process. Applications that did not meet the 40-point threshold have been declined.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Looking Ahead to Cycle 27</strong>: We will continue to refine our processes to ensure that the review and decision-making are as thorough and fair as possible. Submission for Cycle 27 will remain open until Monday, 2nd at 7 pm UTC. We encourage applicants to use the additional feedback provided when re-applying, to strengthen their proposals and aim to meet the 40-point cutoff for consideration as finalists.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd like to extend special congratulations to Derive (formerly Lyra) and Fraxtal for being awarded the first-ever Superchain grants. Their applications have set a high standard for future grant recipients, and we look forward to seeing how they will further strengthen the Superchain ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We extend our thanks to <strong><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/devtooligan\">@devtooligan</a></strong> for serving as the audit application reviewer from the DAB for this cycle. The audit requests were thoroughly evaluated by 2 members from the Grants Council and 1 member from the DAB. Together, they scored 8 requests and approved 5 of them.</p>\n<p>Below is the list of applications and you can find a detailed database <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13oAA3j_0sXaQOWFXB4CCAqXrXBK_gpqMfsdkyRh98es/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Intent 1</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Cross Chain Voting</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>OP Stack Cross Chain Voting</td>\n<td>Declined</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Cross chain voting with Snapshot and Herodotus</td>\n<td>Asked reduction to acomodate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Aragon &lt;&gt; RISC Zero -

We build dev tools for developers and a user-friend app (app.namespace.tech) for individual ENS name owners, to easily issue Subnames.

This is achieved by utilizing the CCIP protocol, which allows storing ENS subnames and records on L2 chains. The chains are resolved through an offchain gateway application, which verifies the stored data. Furthermore with the introduction of the EVM Gateway by ENS, the data can be stored and verified trustlessly, meaning that the Gateway cannot manipulate the data.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-39712-milestones-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39712-milestones-overview-3\"></a>Milestones overview</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrate CCIP (EVM Gateway) <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></li>\n<li>Deploy Minting and Listing contracts on OP <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\n2.1 Testnet <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\n2.2 Mainnet</li>\n<li>Audit <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></li>\n<li>Write developer documentation for easy integration <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></li>\n<li>Integrate new OP Contracts with the Namespace platform <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> (only testnet)</li>\n<li>Completion, User Testing User adoption + Feedback loop for improvement</li>\n<li>Launch the code and initiate OP expansion</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39712-milestone-1-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39712-milestone-1-4\"></a>Milestone 1</h2>\n<p>The overview of the architecture that outlines the implementation of the CCIP protocol using the EVM Gateway and fault proofs:<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/897460ecdaa2201bb42f7a003e752417abad7b10.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/jBYKInVBwlxtgcyciCOdK5PgpaM.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/897460ecdaa2201bb42f7a003e752417abad7b10_2_690x414.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"jBYKInVBwlxtgcyciCOdK5PgpaM\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/897460ecdaa2201bb42f7a003e752417abad7b10_2_690x414.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/897460ecdaa2201bb42f7a003e752417abad7b10_2_1035x621.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/897460ecdaa2201bb42f7a003e752417abad7b10_2_1380x828.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F3F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In the CCIP architecture the clients, such as wallets, need to be able to support CCIP, which requires handling the callback response from the resolver contract.
