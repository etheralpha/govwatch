Would love any feedback on this first step towards achieving Retro Funding nirvana.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs dive in.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-public-goods-funding-problem-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#the-public-goods-funding-problem-1\"></a>The Public Goods Funding Problem <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/dizzy_face.png?v=12\" title=\":dizzy_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":dizzy_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h3>\n<p>Optimism‚Äôs founding was spurred by the realization that in order to achieve the Ethereum vision we would need to solve the public goods funding problem. In our <a href=\"https://medium.com/plasma-group/on-to-new-beginnings-e9d76b170752\">post announcing the transition</a> from <a href=\"https://medium.com/plasma-group/deployplasma-dd1cf0b2ab55\">Plasma Group</a> to Optimism we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scalability is still a priority ‚Äî but another critical issue has become clear to us: <strong>the problem of funding and sustaining public goods</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As open source Ethereum developers, we could see the disproportionate investment in speculative <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sticker-Vinyl-Bumper-Decal-Waterproof/dp/B08K2HQSSN\">applications</a> and <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html\">protocol security</a> when compared to core development &amp; the creation of Ethereum ecosystem public goods.</p>\n<p>We need in-protocol mechanisms for sustaining open source to feel confident that we could create a decentralized internet that would stay decentralized and open source indefinitely. This meant scaling Ethereum wasn‚Äôt enough, we would also have to create a mechanism for funding the public goods it is based upon.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"retro-funding-flywheel-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#retro-funding-flywheel-2\"></a>Retro Funding Flywheel <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/recycle.png?v=12\" title=\":recycle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":recycle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h3>\n<p>We‚Äôre making a bet that <a href=\"https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c\">Retro Funding</a> is the most credible mechanism to create an incentive loop that maintains decentralization of the protocol.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/1/15cb0a470611974feb8da02fbf87056c08492ef6.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"36N2nyzEz1IJcQaPKPggoIz7l8W\" width=\"275\" height=\"249\"></p>\n<p>One goal of Retro Funding for Optimism is to make open source contributions to the OP Stack an economically rational strategy for everyone from individuals to large teams. It‚Äôs not a replacement, but an alternative to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model\">closed source</a> or extractive business models. Imagine the impact and velocity we could achieve if building open source was not just the most fun and impactful but also the most profitable!</p>\n<h3><a name=\"retro-funding-op-labs-contributions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#retro-funding-op-labs-contributions-3\"></a>Retro Funding OP Labs‚Äô Contributions <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/key.png?v=12\" title=\":key:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":key:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h3>\n<p>Now that the Collective is growing and becoming more self sufficient, it seems like a perfect time for Labs to put its money where its mouth is and prove Retro Funding really works. If OP Labs doesn‚Äôt believe in Retro Funding enough to rely on it as a purely open source business model, then how can we expect others to take the plunge?</p>\n<p>OP Labs is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation\">Public Benefit Corporation</a> (PBC) and has thus far been sustained by VC Funding. However, being a PBC means that while being for-profit, Labs is bound by its charter to ‚Äúenshrine fair access to public goods with open source software.‚Äù Today <a href=\"https://www.oplabs.co/\">OP Labs</a> receives grants from the <a href=\"https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/what-is-the-optimism-foundation/#\">Optimism Foundation</a> to work on the core protocol, but the goal since OP Lab‚Äôs inception has been to write OSS while being fully sustained by and reliant on decentralized governance. We now have an opportunity to realize this goal, show that Retro Funding works, that impact=profit, and that <a href=\"https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/ethers-phoenix-18fb7d7304bb\">Ethers Phoenix</a> is really a global attractor.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"a-baby-step-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#a-baby-step-4\"></a>A Baby Step <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/baby.png?v=12\" title=\":baby:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":baby:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h3>\n<p>We are taking a very small step towards this vision with applying to Retro Funding 5 for the Custom Gas Token feature. This feature was developed without a grant from the Foundation but we think it‚Äôs still had a really positive impact on the Collective. Anyway, more specifics on that coming soon!</p>\n<p>In the meantime, would love any and all community feedback on our first steps towards participating in Retro Funding and, in the process, addressing the problem we set out to solve years ago‚Äî<strong>the problem of funding and sustaining public goods</strong>.</p>\n<p>Oh and here‚Äôs a lil‚Äô <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html\">quote from Vitalik</a> <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12\" title=\":heart:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":heart:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>this is not just another slight improvement to what exists.

We‚Äôre eager to start but have encountered a challenge with project selection.</p>\n<p>In the first version of the proposal, we proposed to handle vetting projects ourselves. During the review process, the reviewers asked for a change so that the Grants Council does the selection instead (see <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/bleu-builders/link_to_proposal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">approved proposal</a>), which got incorporated into our final grant scope. Despite the grant‚Äôs approval, though, we haven‚Äôt received any project assignments from the Grants Council so far.</p>\n<p>We understand that the Grants Council is currently managing a high workload, which may have contributed to the delay in project assignments. Given this situation, we reached out to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth\">@gonna.eth</a> to discuss potential solutions, and he proposed.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-approach-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#proposed-approach-2\"></a>Proposed Approach</h2>\n<p>After discussing with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth\">@gonna.eth</a>, he proposed an alternative that doesn‚Äôt require the Grants Council‚Äôs direct involvement given their current workload:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>50% of our services to existing grantees</li>\n<li>50% to projects we select independently, based off the selection criteria below</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We like this suggestion because it potentially allows us to start working promptly, supporting both vetted grantees and new initiatives without additional Grants Council intervention.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"considerations-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#considerations-3\"></a>Considerations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Selecting and negotiating with projects will require time that wasn‚Äôt accounted for in the original grant.

We want to ensure this change aligns with the community‚Äôs expectations and Optimism‚Äôs governance standards, hence why this forum post.</li>\n<li>The 50/50 split is not based on any specific reason.

Snapshot Space votes will be determined by a simple majority of the provided member votes. Quorum is achieved when more than 40% of the members vote. If the commission cannot reach a consensus on a matter, the proposal will not pass and the required action cannot be taken.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-512-onchain-vote-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-512-onchain-vote-12\"></a>5.1.2 Onchain Vote</h4>\n<p>An onchain vote is executed by the Commission on identified Optimism Governance Token House proposals where the ACC should vote, by utilizing the voting weight delegated to the<a href=\"https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3EEe61B92C36e97Be6319BF9096A1ac3c04a1466\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Anticapture Commission Multisig</a>. This will exercise the Commission‚Äôs vote directly on the Optimism Agora proposal through an onchain vote.

The hypothesis that round 5 is aiming to test is if experts make better OP allocation decisions on OP Stack contributions compared to non-experts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"research-questions-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#research-questions-1\"></a>Research Questions</h3>\n<p>The Retro Funding 5 governance experiment is designed around the following research questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are there significant differences in how experts versus non-experts vote to allocate resources to technical contributions?</li>\n<li>Are there significant differences between existing badgeholders and new guest voters, both in how they vote to allocate resources and in other characteristics?</li>\n<li>Will sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications improve the voter experience?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"expertise-measurement-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#expertise-measurement-2\"></a><strong>Expertise Measurement</strong></h3>\n<p>Expertise is measured via a score assigned to each individual based on their past Github activity relating to the OP Stack. The GitHub accounts of guest voters are collected in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393\">application flow to become a guest voter</a>. Badgeholders are invited to add their GitHub account to their <a href=\"https://retrofunding.optimism.io\">Optimist Profile</a> in the process of completing Season 6 onboarding. The scores are assigned using an algorithm developed through a collaboration between <a href=\"https://karma3labs.com/\">Karma3Labs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.opensource.observer/\">Open Source Observer</a>, and is based on <a href=\"https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/Lecture4/lecture4.html\">Hubs and Authorities</a>. The algorithm is more complex than <a href=\"https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/eigentrust.pdf\">EigenTrust</a>, because it incorporates two entities: GitHub Repos and GitHub Users, both of which can have ‚Äòtrust‚Äô and give ‚Äòtrust‚Äô to each other. The algorithm used to rank expertise will be open sourced after the conclusion of Round 5 to avoid influencing the experiment.

Random sampling does not guarantee that a particular sample is a perfect representation of the population, but rather allows for valid conclusions to be drawn about the entire population based on the sample. Another way of saying this is that the random sample approximates the full population. This is due to the equal probability of selection. Read more here <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Experimenting with Random Sampling in the Citizens' House</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"treatment-and-control-groups-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#treatment-and-control-groups-5\"></a>Treatment and control groups</h3>\n<p>Retroactive Public Goods Funding is an ongoing experiment, in which the Collective tests and validates different voting designs based on how well they perform at rewarding impact. Previous experiments were largely product iterations based on learnings from previous rounds and hypothesised improvements. For future rounds, experimentation will become more scientific to better understand cause and effect of different design choices. We believe this approach will allow the Collective to develop an industry-leading approach to metagovernance that will strengthen the design of the system over time.  Retro Funding 5 introduces the concept of treatment and control groups. In experimental design, the ‚Äútreatment group‚Äù participates in the experiment, while the ‚Äúcontrol group‚Äù does not (representing the status quo.) This allows hypotheses to be validated or invalidated by comparing the results of the treatment group to the control group. Specifically, taking this approach in Round 5 will allow the Collective to generate actionable insights about the performance of expert voters compared to non-expert voters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"voting-process-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#voting-process-6\"></a>Voting Process</h3>\n<p>An iteration on Retro Funding voting design is the allocation of voters into subgroups. Each subgroup only votes on a specific category of projects (e.g. Ethereum Core Contributions, OP Stack Research &amp; Development, OP Stack Tooling). This has been a popular experimentation request and is one proposed methodology by which the Retro Funding voting process can be scaled to reward more projects. This change can be understood as a product iteration, as its validation largely relies on the change in performance data compared to previous rounds and badgeholder feedback, while there is no control group which would allow for more scientific comparison.</p>\n<p>Process Overview:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Subgroups are established</strong>: voters are (randomly) assigned into subgroups, the subgroups are equal in size and remain representative of the different voter groups.</li>\n<li><strong>Category allocation</strong>: All voters vote on the allocation of OP among the three categories of the round scope. These votes will be public.</li>\n<li><strong>Impact Evaluation</strong>: Each voter votes on the amount of retro rewards all projects within their assigned category should receive. Votes will be private to prevent intimidation and coercion, promote unbiased decision-making and protect against bribery.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"voting-design-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#voting-design-7\"></a>Voting design</h3>\n<p>The Foundation Mission ‚Äú<a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/188\">Evaluating Voting Design Tradeoffs for Retro Funding</a>‚Äù is expected to deliver relevant insights into voting design tradeoffs, which will inform the selection of a voting mechanism for round 5. Further details on the implementation of impact = profit within the round, and the policy for conflicts of interests among badgeholders, will follow.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2024 10:51:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8613"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613.rss","#text":"Retro Funding 5: Expert voting experiment"}},{"title":"Retro Funding 5: OP Stack - round details","dc:creator":"system","category":"Retro  Funding üî¥","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/601921ef4339aad2e29c73a73cd3ca40e0b5929c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dI7Gn3JxX4n0PqWvv3E128B4X6c.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/601921ef4339aad2e29c73a73cd3ca40e0b5929c_2_690x387.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"dI7Gn3JxX4n0PqWvv3E128B4X6c\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/601921ef4339aad2e29c73a73cd3ca40e0b5929c_2_690x387.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/601921ef4339aad2e29c73a73cd3ca40e0b5929c_2_1035x580.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/601921ef4339aad2e29c73a73cd3ca40e0b5929c_2_1380x774.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FEAABB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) 5 will reward contributors to the OP Stack, including core Ethereum infrastructure that supports or underpins the OP Stack, advancements in OP Stack research and development, and tooling which supports its accessibility and usability.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"timeline-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#timeline-1\"></a>Timeline</h3>\n<p>Please note that all dates are preliminary and might change.

Here are the key updates:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unified Rubric</strong>: This season, we will be using a single, general rubric that can be adapted to all Mission requests. The Grants Council has designed this rubric to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for all applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Discretionary Slots</strong>: Reviewers will now have three discretionary slots instead of one. These slots allow reviewers to assign a score between -2 and 4 to specific aspects of the application. When applying discretionary scores, reviewers must provide a clear explanation for their decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Final Scoring System</strong>: The final score for each Mission application will be calculated as the sum of all reviewer scores, divided by the number of reviewers who evaluated the application. This ensures that the scores are fair and representative of the overall consensus.</li>\n<li><strong>Preliminary Review</strong>: The preliminary review will be conducted by a single reviewer. This step aims to provide an initial assessment and identify any major issues before the full review takes place.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedback and Cycle 25</strong>: Any feedback received during the review process will be incorporated into the evaluation for Cycle 25. We encourage applicants to provide their feedback to the Grants Council by the designated deadline.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We believe these changes will lead to a more efficient and equitable review

However, the Milestone and Metrics Committee may consider requests to review individual milestones in certain cases.</li>\n<li>Absent an approval for a greater amount of time, critical milestones will be considered past due twelve months from the locking of the grant for Builders applications.</li>\n<li>Milestones and Metrics votes shall be recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Other procedures</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In cases where a project has failed to complete its critical milestones in the allotted time, the Committee will default to recommending against proceeding with any further steps of the grant. Projects are free to voluntarily recuse themselves from a grant if they are unable to finish before the deadline.</li>\n<li>In the case where a proposer makes a proposal to change the substance (or extend the time) of a critical milestone, the Committee may consider the change only if (a) the Committee determines that there is substantial good reason to support the request and (b) a super-majority of all of the Council reviewers vote in favor of the proposal.</li>\n<li>When relevant, the Committee shall wait for the Developer Advisory Board to confirm the completion of the critical milestones prior to confirming completion to the Foundation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The guidance in this section yields to any contrary rule, guidance, or vote from Token House or the Foundation.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"reviewer-metrics-accountability-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#reviewer-metrics-accountability-5\"></a>Reviewer Metrics Accountability</h4>\n<p>Similar to Season 5, the committee will ensure grant council reviewers communicate effectively with the grant applicants and are accountable for their work. For Season 6, specific metrics and processes as mandated by the charter will again include: reviewer comment frequency on substantive rubric components, reviewer comments on failed intake applications, reviewer attendance of committee meetings, reviewer voting on committee and full council polls.</p>\n<p>The metrics as a whole will possibly be adapted over the course of the season as best practices reveal themselves in this trial run period. The goal will not be to micromanage each reviewer but more so to identify and allocate additional support for those reviewers that need such, while also offering comparison between reviewers for delegates and token house members.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"official-record-and-rule-changes-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#official-record-and-rule-changes-6\"></a>Official Record and Rule Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Council will maintain a tracker of applications considered, finalists named, milestones for finalists, and the progress / completion of milestones.</li>\n<li>On a bi-weekly basis, the Council may review the effectiveness of its internal procedures and make proposals for improvement. The Committee can amend the internal procedures by a simple majority vote of the members of both Committees (provided that any vote to amend the rubric comports with the procedures described above). Amendments will be recorded as a comment to this post.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"rules-of-decision-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#rules-of-decision-7\"></a>Rules of Decision</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If one or more Committee members abstains from a vote, a vote will pass by the simple majority vote of the remaining members, provided there are more than one voting members remaining. If only one member of a Committee votes, the result will be to take no action on the proposed matter. For instance, if the matter being voted on relates to whether or not to include an application in the final review, the result will be not to include the application in the final review.</li>\n<li>Any Council-wide votes must include members of each Committee to achieve a quorum.</li>\n<li>The Grants Council Lead may correct any clear errors in the Internal Procedures or resolve any conflicting provisions. For resolving conflicts, the Lead may submit a question of the best resolution to a vote of the Committee members, the results of which may be recorded on the Landing Page.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/milestone-assessments-for-s6/8598\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/milestone-assessments-for-s6/8598","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 13:39:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8598"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/milestone-assessments-for-s6/8598.rss","#text":"Milestone Assessments for S6"}},{"title":"Season 6: Security Council Nomination Template - Cohort A","dc:creator":"system","category":"Elections","description":"<h1><a name=\"season-6-security-council-nomination-template-cohort-a-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-security-council-nomination-template-cohort-a-1\"></a>Season 6 Security Council Nomination Template - Cohort A</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"please-paste-your-completed-nomination-herehttpsgovoptimismiotseason-6-security-council-cohort-a-nomination-thread8588-following-the-instructions-at-the-top-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#please-paste-your-completed-nomination-herehttpsgovoptimismiotseason-6-security-council-cohort-a-nomination-thread8588-following-the-instructions-at-the-top-2\"></a>Please paste your completed nomination <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-security-council-cohort-a-nomination-thread/8588\">here</a>, following the instructions at the top.</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"security-council-member-self-nomination-template-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#security-council-member-self-nomination-template-3\"></a>Security Council Member <strong>Self-Nomination Template</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Please keep your answers as concise as possible while conveying all relevant information.</em><br>\n<em>All nominations will require 8 Top 100 delegate approvals.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Please indicate if you are running to be the Council Lead or a Council Member:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Does this nomination represent an individual or organization:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Candidate country of residence (or, if an entity, incorporation and principle place of business):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Have you previously served on Optimism‚Äôs Security Council:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Have you previously served on any other Council or Board in the Collective:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Are you a representative of OP Labs:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Are you a representative of another OP Chain:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you are a delegate, please provide the link to your delegate profile:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you are a member of the Citizens‚Äô House, please link to your most recent attestation here:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please outline your contributions, and their impact, to the Optimism ecosystem to date:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please demonstrate any non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this role:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your technical background, including your expertise score (more info on this shortly):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md\">Operating Manual</a>:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand that election is subject to successful completion of a Foundation screen which</strong> <strong>may include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract:</strong> [No/Yes]</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities.

There is no limit to the number of terms a Security Council participant may serve.</p>\n<p>Top 100 delegates may provide approval by pasting the below language as a comment under a candidate‚Äôs nomination:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>‚ÄùI am an Optimism delegate [link to your <a href=\"https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/your_address\">delegate commitment</a>] with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a name=\"eligibility-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#eligibility-considerations-5\"></a><strong>Eligibility Considerations</strong></h3>\n<p>Participants on the Security Council may be either individuals or entities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Entity requirements:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Active and offers a service that benefits the blockchain community</li>\n<li>Operating for at least one year with sufficient runway to continue for at least one year</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All participants on the Security Council, whether individuals or entities, should be selected in accordance with the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reputation.</strong> Known, trusted individuals or entities that have demonstrated consistent alignment with the Optimistic Vision.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical competency.</strong> Baseline proficiency with the OP Stack and secure key management and signing standards. <em>Additionally, candidates may be asked to sign into the OP Atlas app, connect GitHub, verify their wallet and calculate an expertise score. There is no minimum requirement for an expertise score, but it can serve as an indicator to help delegates evaluate a candidate‚Äôs technical expertise.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Alignment.</strong> Participants should not possess conflicts of interest that will regularly impact their ability to make impartial decisions in the performance of their role. Potential conflicts of interest could be, but are not limited to, affiliations with direct Optimism competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects or self-dealing, etc. There should be no more than 3 members serving on other Security Councils. There are 3 members serving on other Security Councils in Cohort B, which means <strong>candidates serving on other Security Councils are not eligible for this election (Cohort A)</strong> and delegates should not provide approvals on ineligible nominations.</li>\n<li><strong>Ability to participate.</strong>  A candidate‚Äôs willingness and ability to actively participate and fulfil the member responsibilities, dedicating an average of approximately 5 active hours per month hours per month, should be considered. Please note that there is an ‚Äúon-call‚Äù aspect to this role that is not fully encompassed in the active hours estimate.</li>\n<li><strong>Geographic diversity.</strong> The number of participants that reside in any country should be less than the quorum required for multisig action.  The Foundation is responsible for ensuring this criteria is met. If a new member would surpass the threshold of signers from any one country, the next qualifying runner up will fill their place.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversity of interests.</strong> No more than 1 elected member is associated with a particular entity, or that entity‚Äôs employees or affiliates. The Foundation is responsible for ensuring this criteria is met. If multiple members from the same entity are elected, the next qualifying runner up will fill the place of any duplicate positions held by the same entity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Optimism Foundation may appoint nominees after the self-nomination deadline, or take such other administrative steps as necessary or appropriate, if there are fewer than 7 eligible member nominees and 1 Lead nominee.</p>\n<p>As with other Councils, the Foundation will facilitate a town hall to help delegates assess candidates. The town hall will take place Tuesday, August 20th at 2pm EST / 6pm GMT.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"elections-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#elections-6\"></a>Elections</h3>\n<p>Elections will run from August 22nd - 28th at 19:00 GMT. Elections use approval voting. Approval voting is set up such that delegates can place a vote for any number of nominees with their full voting power. In the case of approval/ranked choice votes, delegates may vote for themselves, so long as they also cast votes for the remaining elected positions.</p>\n<p>Once elected, all participants will be required to pass an eligibility screening process before being added to the Council. This process may include KYC/AML and sanctions screening, and a requirement that the member sign a standard contract, which will be implemented at the discretion of the Optimism Foundation. If a candidate fails the screen after being elected, the next qualified runner up to pass the screening may take their place.</p>\n<p>Newly elected members that pass the Foundation‚Äôs screen will begin their 12 month term on February 9th.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"removal-of-council-members-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#removal-of-council-members-7\"></a><strong>Removal of Council members</strong></h3>\n<p>All members are subject to removal via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating Manual.
