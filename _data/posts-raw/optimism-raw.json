A week before the first submission round, LundVenturesllc appointed me as the Grants Council Lead and I kept the reviewer rewards I had assigned, as lead rewards. I am proposing 40.000 instead of 0 because the latest RetroPGF design is not synched with the Grants Council Season (personal opinion). During Seasons 4 and 5 there was a division between Ops Manager and Grants Council Lead. The work between both positions is very intertwined and requires someone with deep knowledge of all the steps and things happening during the process, this is why I recommend unifying them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Communications manager</strong> = 5.000 OP (same)</li>\n<li><strong>Council-related requests for grants</strong> = 40k OP (same)\n<ul>\n<li>40k OP will be set aside for grants specifically designed to enhance Council operations (e.g., knowledge management platform, front-end, developer contributions, etc).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Breakdown</strong>: There are 18 sports in the council, 12 reviewers, 3 Milestones and Metrics subcommittee members, 2 for Audits reviewers and the Grants Council Lead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Superchain Mission Reviewers = 90.000 OP</li>\n<li>Optimism Mission Reviewers = 270.000 OP</li>\n<li>Additional members = 50.000 OP (if needed)</li>\n<li>Audit and Special Mission Reviewer = 30.000 OP</li>\n<li>Milestones and Metrics Reviewer = 60.000 OP</li>\n<li>Ops Manager and Lead = 40.000 OP</li>\n<li>Communications manager = 5.000 OP</li>\n<li>Council-related requests for grants = 40.000 OP (if needed)</li>\n<li>Total = 605.000 OP (90.000 OP returns to Gov Fund if not needed)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How should governance participants measure the Council‚Äôs impact?</strong></p>\n<p>Builder Experience KPIs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NPS of finalists &gt; 9/10</li>\n<li>Quality applicants, the Grants Council is unable to support less than 5%\n<ul>\n<li>‚ÄúUnable to support‚Äù Qualified applications are those that meet the criteria but weren‚Äôt supported due to budget constraints, tier limitations requiring Foundation intervention, or applications lost during the review process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Grant Performance KPIs:</p>\n<p>The Foundation suggests the below measures, or similar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intent 1 Commit a 5% increase on the votable supply</li>\n<li>Intent 3, increase active developers driving the network by 150 (pending revision of how this is measured)</li>\n<li>5 OP Chain grants programs launched</li>\n<li>Number of grants that have to be clawed back for failure to meet milestones less than 5%</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-grants-council-operating-budget/8171\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-grants-council-operating-budget/8171","pubDate":"Sun, 19 May 2024 11:34:56 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8171"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-grants-council-operating-budget/8171.rss","#text":"Season 6 Grants Council Operating Budget"}},{"title":"[DRAFT]: Proposed Grants Council Charter - Season 6","dc:creator":"Gonna.eth","category":"‚ú® General","description":"<p><em>Note: Huge thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/danelund.eth\">@danelund.eth</a> for publishing an <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-opensource-draft-charter/8146\">open-source charter</a> designed for season 6 for anyone to use as a lead proponent.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"goals-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#goals-1\"></a>Goals</h2>\n<p>In short, the goals of the Grants Council, as outlined by the Foundation in Season 3, are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create a streamlined and consistent process for grant applicants</li>\n<li>empower high context delegates to make high context grant decisions</li>\n<li>reduce the workload required of non-Council delegates so that they have more time to weigh in on high impact votes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Season 6, the Collective will aim to bring the grants program to the Superchain.

The Grants Council will be comprised of a Lead and [15] Reviewers sitting across four review teams. The Council will have full decision-making authority as to which projects are named finalists for Governance Fund grants. Each team will have a clear mandate and be tied to a specific grant objective, as outlined below.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"superchain-review-team-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#superchain-review-team-3\"></a>Superchain Review Team:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goal</strong> : Review grants programs applications for Superchain programs</li>\n<li><strong>Format</strong> : proposers receive grants that are used to perpetuate the grants programs for Superchain protocols</li>\n<li><strong>Reviewers</strong> : 3</li>\n<li><strong>Consensus</strong> : 2/3 vote required to approve a list of finalists</li>\n<li><strong>Notes</strong> : Superchain reviewers can join the Mission Review Team if and when they complete the review of relevant Superchain proposals.</li>\n<li><strong>Election</strong> : There will be no separate election for the Superchain Review Team. The top 3 reviewers in the election for the Optimism Mission Review team will be included by default. If the elected reviewer opts not to be a member of the Superchain Review Team or if they become unable to perform their duties as part of the team, the reviewer with the next highest number of votes in the Optimism Mission Review Team election will be added to the Superchain Review Team.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"optimism-mission-review-team-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#optimism-mission-review-team-4\"></a>Optimism Mission Review Team:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goals</strong>: (1) maximize the number of builders building projects within a specified Intent; (2) maximize the number of users interacting with applications that further a specified intent defined by the Optimism Collective. These goals are of equal weight.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-goals</strong> : retroactive airdrops; retroactive funding</li>\n<li><strong>Format</strong>: proposers receive direct grants that are locked or unlocked according to the Collective Grants Policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Reviewers</strong>: 7 to 12 (counting Superchain and Audit and Special Mission Team reviewers)</li>\n<li><strong>Consensus</strong>: Minimum 3 supporting votes for a proposal to be considered a finalist.

Notes: The Optimism Mission Review Team will publish proposed missions for community feedback at the beginning of Season 6 (in accordance with the governance calendar).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"audit-and-special-mission-team-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#audit-and-special-mission-team-5\"></a>Audit and Special Mission Team:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goals</strong>: Review proposals and select finalists for Mission Requests or Legacy Requests for Grants that require ongoing review. The Audit and Special Mission Team will develop review standards in line with the goal of the particular mission.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-goals</strong>: retroactive airdrops; retroactive funding Format: proposers receive grants or allocations from previous grants that have been designated for a specific purpose pursuant to a Mission Request.</li>\n<li><strong>Reviewers</strong>: 2 elected to the Grants Council and 1 reviewer from the Developer Advisory Board (assigned in agreement between the Grants Council Lead and the Developer Advisory Board Lead)</li>\n<li><strong>Consensus</strong>: 2/3 vote is required to name a finalist or validate a proposal.</li>\n<li><strong>Notes</strong>: the grant‚Äôs lead will have the ability to declare a mission a ‚ÄúSpecial Mission‚Äù with a simple majority vote of the Optimism Mission Review Team. Successful past mission proposals that require ongoing incremental proposals (e.g., Season 4-5 audit proposals), will automatically be assigned to the Audit and Special Mission Team without a necessary council vote.</li>\n<li>Members of the Audit and Special Mission Team may conduct intake reviews for the Optimism Mission Review team.</li>\n<li>This Team may handle highly technical material and should consist of reviewers with a technical background.

In this case, the reviewer with the next most votes (after the elected reviewer with the least votes) (Selected Reviewer) shall be provided the option to join the Optimism Mission Review Team with rewards pro-rated for the time that has elapsed in Season 6 prior to joining the Grants Council. Should the Selected Reviewer decline, the reviewer with the next highest number of votes after the declining Selected Reviewer shall become the Selected Reviewer.

You can find the retrospective of the Season 5 Code of Conduct Council <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-retrospective-season-5/8064\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Follow this next thread If you would like to know about the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-elections-code-of-conduct-council/8120\">election</a> process or <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-nominations-code-of-conduct-council/8118\">nominate</a> yourself to this council in season 6.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Councils may be authorized by the Foundation for an initial pilot period -at least one Season- (season 5) After this pilot, representative structures must be renewed by governance for a subsequent Season (the Code of Conduct Council is in this stage.) If successfully renewed this Season, the CoCC will become a persistent structure in the Collective, assumed to continue unless/until a Council Dissolution proposal is put forward.</p>\n<p>Given the above rescoping, if renewed for Season 6, the Code of Conduct Council would have a scope limited to enforcing the Rules of Engagement, which govern the usage of all Optimism hosted platforms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If delegates believe an elected Code of Conduct Council should enforce the Rules of Engagement, delegates should vote to approve a Code of Conduct Council Operating Budget. If delegates do not believe an elected Council is necessary to enforce the Rules of Engagement, they should not approve any associated operating budget.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the event that an operating budget is not approved for a Code of Conduct Council, the supportNERDs will continue to monitor the forum and enforce the Rules of Engagement as they previously have. supportNERDs are not selected by the Foundation, but rather operate as an open contribution path. If any decisions made by the supportNERDs are questioned, they may be appealed to a third party (likely the party contracted to provide mediation services.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All prospective Leads may propose a Code of Conduct Council Operating Budget for Season 6. Delegates that believe the Council should be renewed, should only vote to approve one Code of Conduct Council Operating Budget. The budget proposal with the highest proportion of ‚ÄúYes‚Äù votes will be approved. Delegates are effectively electing the Lead who has authored an approved budget.

Agora is the governance software company contributing to the Optimism token house governor and its frontend at <a href=\"http://vote.optimism.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vote.optimism.io</a>. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<p>This Governor upgrade introduces improvements to the Alligator allowance storage system that enabled partial delegation and sub delegation for OP voters. Since it‚Äôs launch in December of 2023, delegates using advanced delegation, especially those who received delegation using absolute and relative amounts, could have ended up with less voting power than they should have had. We identified this and other related cases where recorded votes were preventing correct calculation of voting power, which resulted in the additional tests and the logic refactor being proposed.</p>\n<p>If this vote passes, the Optimism foundation will upgrade the governor contract to the new implementation Agora deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>As part of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/64\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the v2 upgrade of the token house</a>we shipped in December, we enabled a new feature called ‚Äúadvanced delegation‚Äù, which allows token holders to delegate their voting power to multiple delegates without splitting their balance. This facilitates governance participation for large funds, partners and the foundation, who have complex token storage requirements.</p>\n<p>This improvement builds on the real world experience of using advanced delegation and Alligator in the wild and covers scenarios that we did not capture during testing, especially situations such as:</p>\n<p>A partially delegates to B and C<br>\nC partially delegates to D and E<br>\nE partially delegates to F</p>\n<p>Y partially delegates to W and Z<br>\nZ partially delegates to A and F</p>\n<p>Without this change, depending on how these votes were partially delegated either via absolute or relative weights, there is a chance that F‚Äôs voting power would have been less than it should have been. It‚Äôs important to note that this hasn‚Äôt happened in production, and this update to make sure it doesn‚Äôt.</p>\n<p>We identified this and other related cases where recorded votes were preventing correct calculation of voting power, which resulted in the additional tests and the logic refactor being proposed.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"impact-to-voters-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#impact-to-voters-3\"></a>Impact to voters:</h3>\n<p>Delegates with advanced voting power will have a better user experience especially if they find themselves in complex delegation states where some users delegated to them with relative power, and other delegated to them with absolute power.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"note-on-timing-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#note-on-timing-4\"></a>Note on timing:</h3>\n<p>We‚Äôre aware that delegates were previously asked to vote on another advanced delegation upgrade proposal, so some may be wondering why these updates were not batched. The reason for this is that, due to auditor availability, we could only ship the full scope of changes several weeks after they were completed. Some of the changes included improvements to the voting experience ‚Äì so we worked out a deal with the audit team to audit that part first so that voters may benefit from that change asap. This current vote is for the rest of the changes.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"contract-changed-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#contract-changed-6\"></a>Contract Changed</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/voteagora/governor/pull/23/files\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism Governor</a> would be changed as part of this upgrade.

I now feel a certain civic duty and obligation to continue to participate with a renewed vigor in the hopes of advocating for the participation and inclusion of other voices who have not had the privilege and pleasure of contributing to governance activities and considerations directly.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/gene-delegate-communication-thread/8163\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/gene-delegate-communication-thread/8163","pubDate":"Fri, 17 May 2024 12:59:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8163"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/gene-delegate-communication-thread/8163.rss","#text":"Gene - Delegate Communication Thread"}},{"title":"Introducing $REGEN","dc:creator":"revmiller","category":"‚ú® General","description":"<p><em>This forum post aims to get a temperature check &amp; feedback from the community on $REGEN, a memecoin focused on public goods on Optimism, Superchain and beyond.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#overview-1\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>$REGEN is a culture coin for Optimists that captures regen energy; the spirit of having fun and creating impact.</p>\n<p>Regen as a project is being grown as a grassroots cultural movement on the right curve of memes and impact. Through the power of memes, the goal is to empower more regen activity; things like public goods, open source software, educational initiatives, growing communities, banking the unbanked, or supporting environmentally mindful initiatives.</p>\n<p>There is enormous potential for memes like degen and regen to be more than just memes, as exhibited by the Degen project on Base. There is even greater potential when degen and regen energies are combined. $REGEN will be grown on Optimism to serve as a culture coin and impact token that can fuel this; making being a regen fun and rewarding at the same time.</p>\n<p>Check out<a href=\"https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xe310175e4e0945b278d951e693bde66eecc8af68/1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> The degensü§ùregens Manifesto</a> representing this vision.</p>\n<p>This will involve onboarding regen individuals (fun-gis and fun-gals) and projects by leveraging new possibilities for concentrated and incentivised coordination through decentralized social graphs such as Farcaster. Regen will naturally emerge from the <a href=\"https://warpcast.com/~/channel/regen\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">/regen channel</a> on Farcaster, which is intended as a key hub for regens to coordinate and grow. Incentive mechanics have been designed to encourage growth and decentralization across the mycelial network on Optimism and Superchain towards utopia.</p>\n<p><strong>$REGEN</strong></p>\n<p>$REGEN will be a fun rewards system to encourage regens to be and bring more regens. The token will primarily be distributed via iterative airdrops; programmed to follow lunar cycles, which reward certified regens (often retroactively) for their regen activity onchain.</p>\n<p>In the first phase, rewards will be predominantly allocated based on previous ‚ÄòProof-of-Regen‚Äô as well as engagement in specified channels on Farcaster (e.g. /regen /degensxregens, /publicgoods, /green-pill)</p>\n<p>In the first phase, people will accumulate points that will turn into an initial airdrop based on the basic  ‚ÄòProof-of-Regen‚Äô (mainly Gitcoin, and Giveth donations) as well as engagement in specified channels on Farcaster (e.g. /regen /degensxregens, /publicgoods, /green-pill).</p>\n<p>The second phase will enable a tipping system that gives users an allowance based on the extended ‚ÄòProof-of-Regen‚Äô. Similarly to $DEGEN, users will be able to comment on aligned Farcaster posts an amount + $REGEN to tip that user.</p>\n<p>The ‚ÄòProof-of-Regen‚Äô mechanic will leverage onchain data, for example: Optimism ecosystem contributors, RPGF recipients, Gitcoin grants donors, etc. Allocating regen points via the ‚ÄòProof-of-Regen‚Äô mechanic will help ensure that the initial token distribution is allocated predominantly to verified regens. Plans are already underway to collaborate with regen projects to add additional onchain data points for people to accumulate points for the first airdrop, and tipping allocation for future airdrops.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/1/19c983f2158ffbeaf04237c58bbfa87bfbfbe267.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3G7GfQsHMkbC8wvycVUTetTBezd.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"regen meme\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/19c983f2158ffbeaf04237c58bbfa87bfbfbe267_2_483x374.jpeg\" alt=\"regen meme\" data-base62-sha1=\"3G7GfQsHMkbC8wvycVUTetTBezd\" width=\"483\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/19c983f2158ffbeaf04237c58bbfa87bfbfbe267_2_483x374.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/19c983f2158ffbeaf04237c58bbfa87bfbfbe267_2_724x561.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/1/19c983f2158ffbeaf04237c58bbfa87bfbfbe267_2_966x748.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F5F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>To grow the Regen movement, incentivising meaningful onchain activity together with the (offchain) tipping mechanic will fuel and reward greater engagement not only within /regen and aligned channels, but across the Internet and IRL.

OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<p>This protocol upgrade reduces the trust assumptions for users of OP Mainnet by enabling permissionless output proposals and a permissionless fault proof system. As part of a responsible and safe rollout of Fault Proofs, it preserves the ability for the guardian to override if necessary to maintain security. As a result, withdrawals no longer depend on the privileged proposer role posting an output root, allowing the entire withdrawal process to be completed without any privileged actions. The trust assumption is reduced to requiring only that the guardian role does not act to intervene. Combined with the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-guardian-security-council-threshold-and-l2-proxyadmin-ownership-changes-for-stage-1-decentralization/8157\">Guardian, Security Council Threshold and L2 ProxyAdmin Ownership changes</a> proposal, we believe this satisfies the criteria to have OP Chains reach Stage 1 status.</p>\n<p>If this vote passes and becomes the new governance-approved version of the OP Stack, the upgrade will be deployed to OP Mainnet by the Security Council (currently in Phase 0, which is a joint 2/2 multisig between the Security Council Safe and the Foundation‚Äôs Safe) shortly after the end of the veto period.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#motivation-2\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>Securing withdrawals with a Fault Proof system is a key requirement for meeting the <a href=\"https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe\">stage 1</a> decentralization milestone with the ultimate goal of enhancing the security of user assets.</p>\n<p>This upgrade enables a permissionless Fault Proof system which allows anyone to propose output roots and participate in the dispute system. As a result, users will be able to withdraw assets from L2 to L1 without relying on the sequencer or any other centralized infrastructure.</p>\n<p>As part of a responsible and safe rollout of Fault Proofs, it is required that at this stage, the existing <a href=\"https://docs.optimism.io/chain/security/privileged-roles#guardian\">Guardian role</a> capabilities are carried over to this new version, meaning that the Guardian can disable the Fault Proof system in the event of emergency. While this means the system is still not fully trustless - as is the nature of Stage 1 designation - it reduces the trust assumption to requiring only that the Guardian role does not act maliciously, rather than requiring a single permissioned proposer to actively propose. This proposed upgrade extends the Guardian role‚Äôs pause ability to be able to disable the fault proof system, an extension of its existing capabilities in the fault proofs context. For more info on how the Guardian role is expected to be permissioned, see <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-guardian-security-council-threshold-and-l2-proxyadmin-ownership-changes-for-stage-1-decentralization/8157\">this post</a>.</p>\n<p>This upgrade also includes a smart contract framework that provides a solid basis for a future multi-proof system, allowing additional proof systems to easily be added. This will further reduce trust assumptions in later upgrades as the OP Stack moves towards achieving Stage 2 decentralization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specifications-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#specifications-3\"></a><strong>Specifications</strong></h3>\n<p>The full specifications for the fault dispute system are available <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/index.html\">from the specs repo</a>. If this proposal is approved, the fault dispute system specs will be promoted from the experimental section of specs, to be part of the canonical spec.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Details</strong></p>\n<p>This upgrade does not affect the node or execution client software.</p>\n<p>Prior to the upgrade, the fault dispute system contracts have been deployed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>DisputeGameFactory</code> (implementation: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xc641A33cab81C559F2bd4b21EA34C290E2440C2B\"><code>0xc641A33cab81C559F2bd4b21EA34C290E2440C2B</code></a> proxy: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xe5965Ab5962eDc7477C8520243A95517CD252fA9\"><code>0xe5965Ab5962eDc7477C8520243A95517CD252fA9</code></a>) - a factory for creating dispute games that can be used by the upgraded <code>OptimismPortal</code> as the source of proposed output roots.</li>\n<li><code>FaultDisputeGame</code> (<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4146DF64D83acB0DcB0c1a4884a16f090165e122\"><code>0x4146DF64D83acB0DcB0c1a4884a16f090165e122</code></a>) - an implementation of a dispute game that uses permissionless, interactive bi-section of the chain state</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>This is initialized with an <code>ABSOLUTE_PRESTATE</code> of <code>0x037ef3c1a487960b0e633d3e513df020c43432769f41a634d18a9595cbf53c55</code>.

If these games resolve that the output root is valid, the <code>AnchorStateRegistry</code> will be updated with the new value. The validity of the current value of the <code>AnchorStateRegistry</code> will be manually verified as part of the upgrade process.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><code>DelayedWETH</code> (implementation: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x97988d5624F1ba266E1da305117BCf20713bee08\"><code>0x97988d5624F1ba266E1da305117BCf20713bee08</code></a> proxy: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xE497B094d6DbB3D5E4CaAc9a14696D7572588d14\"><code>0xE497B094d6DbB3D5E4CaAc9a14696D7572588d14</code></a>) - an extension to WETH9 that allows for delayed withdrawals. This introduces a time delay before bonds posted as part of a <code>FaultDisputeGame</code> can be withdrawn, allowing the Guardian role to change the allocation of bonds if there is a bug in the <code>FaultDisputeGame</code> to preserve incentive compatibility.</li>\n<li><code>PreimageOracle</code> (<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xD326E10B8186e90F4E2adc5c13a2d0C137ee8b34\"><code>0xD326E10B8186e90F4E2adc5c13a2d0C137ee8b34</code></a>) - stores validated pre-images that can be retrieved by hash.

(<a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/stage-one/bridge-integration.html\">spec</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>proveWithdrawalTransaction</code> method is modified, retaining the same signature function but with the second argument now providing an index within the <code>DisputeGameFactory</code>‚Äôs list of created games.</li>\n<li>Enforces an air-gap requiring a period of time (<code>DISPUTE_GAME_FINALITY_DELAY_SECONDS</code>) to have elapsed since the game resolved before the game can be used in a call to <code>finalizeWithdrawalTransaction</code>.</li>\n<li>The Guardian role can blacklist dispute games or change the <code>RESPECTED_GAME_TYPE</code> to invalidate dispute games in the event of failures in the fault proof system.</li>\n<li>Users are now able to reprove their withdrawals at any time. Previously, a user could only reprove their withdrawal if the output root was removed from the <code>L2OutputOracle</code> by the guardian, but with this upgrade users will be able to reprove their withdrawal at any time. This allows users to change the dispute game their withdrawal is proven against if needed without waiting for the game to actually resolve as invalid. The 7 day withdrawal finalization delay resets when a user reproves their withdrawal to ensure there is still a full 7 day air-gap between proving and finalizing the withdrawal.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The <code>L2OutputOracle</code> contract is no longer used</li>\n<li>The <code>SystemConfig</code> contract (<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xF56D96B2535B932656d3c04Ebf51baBff241D886\"><code>0xF56D96B2535B932656d3c04Ebf51baBff241D886</code></a>) is updated to reference the <code>DisputeGameFactory</code> address instead of the <code>L2OutputOracle</code> address.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These contracts are tagged in the optimism repo at commit <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/commit/547ea72d9849e13ce169fd31df0f9197651b3f86\"><code>547ea72d9849e13ce169fd31df0f9197651b3f86</code></a> (tagged as release candidate <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-contracts%2Fv1.4.0-rc.4\"><code>op-contracts/v1.4.0-rc.4</code></a> <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/4c0c7a1222d54129bf405e408d5eecdd?pvs=21\">).</a></p>\n<p><strong>Security Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Our design philosophy has been to focus on fundamental safety mechanisms first. We acknowledge that gaining certainty in the correctness of the complex logic found within the FaultDisputeGame contract, its dependencies, and the offchain op-challenger software will take time. Therefore, we have included a number of fallback mechanisms designed to maintain the safety of the system even in the event of a complete failure of those complex components - in particular the ability for the Guardian role to pause withdrawals and disable the Fault Proof System.</p>\n<p>The Sherlock community completed a <a href=\"https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/205\">successful bug hunt</a>, focused on issues which would allow these fundamental safety mechanisms to be subverted. See the <a href=\"https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/205/report\">final report</a> for further details. The reported issues have been addressed. As none of the reported issues circumvented the fundamental safety mechanisms we decided not to pursue a fix review.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact Summary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>As part of the upgrade, all pending withdrawals will be invalidated. Users with pending withdrawals will need to re-prove their withdrawals against an output proposal submitted in the form of a <code>FaultDisputeGame</code> which will restart the withdrawal delay period. <strong>This means that withdrawals initiated less than one week before the upgrade is executed will only be finalized one week after the upgrade is complete.</strong> For example, a withdrawal initiated 6 days before the upgrade would take a total of 13 days to finalize.</li>\n<li>Users reading output roots from the <code>L2OutputOracle</code> contract will need to update to read from the <code>DisputeGameFactory</code>.</li>\n<li>OP Labs does not anticipate any down time due to this upgrade, and node operators are not affected.</li>\n<li>While the normal case for dispute games allows them to resolve within the 7 day withdrawal delay period, the maximum possible time for a dispute game to resolve is 16 days which may lengthen the withdrawal delay for withdrawals proven against that dispute game. Extending a game to this point incurs a significant cost and users may reprove their withdrawal against a different output root at any time. The <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/stage-one/fault-dispute-game.html#game-clock\">Game Clock section of the specs</a> provides further details.</li>\n<li>Tooling that performs withdrawals will need to be updated to use the new <code>DisputeGameFactory</code> as the source of output roots when proving withdrawals. New versions of the Optimism SDK and viem have already been released with this support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"action-plan-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#action-plan-4\"></a><strong>Action Plan</strong></h3>\n<p>If this proposal passes a Token House vote, the L1 contracts will be upgraded following the completion of the Citizens‚Äô House Veto Period following Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#23a</span>. Prior to upgrading, the anchor state in the <code>AnchorStateRegistry</code> will be validated manually. If the value is invalid due to a game having resolved incorrectly prior to full deployment, a replacement version of the <code>AnchorStateRegistry</code> will be deployed using the starting anchor in this proposal, before upgrading contracts. The upgrade will be completed atomically such that all affected L1 contracts will be upgraded within a single transaction.</p>\n<p>This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets and the op-sepolia testnet.</p>\n<p>As this is a L1 contracts-only upgrade, no action is required by node operators.</p>\n<p>To prepare infra and the community for withdrawal flow changes, we will be rolling out mainnet messaging starting this week. This will expand on the <a href=\"https://docs.optimism.io/builders/notices/fp-changes\">preparation for breaking changes</a> implemented with contributors for OP Sepolia, which we coordinated with ~30 infra teams and several rounds of public posts. Mainnet communication will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Comms</em>: At least two rounds of public messaging on OP social channels notifying users of the changes to withdrawal flow, and of the impact on withdrawals during the upgrade window.</li>\n<li>Contributors: Coordinate with bridge infra contributors, including maintainers of popular frontends to the standard bridge, to post banners notifying users of the changes.</li>\n<li><em>Support</em>: Prep developer support team for inbound support tickets about transactions that need to be reproven due to not finishing the first proof in time before the changes.</li>\n<li><em>Bridges:</em> Notify bridges and other infra contributors whose operations might be impacted due to the withdrawal flow changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a critical security issue is discovered before upgrading, OP Labs will collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade will no longer occur.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#conclusion-5\"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>The deployment of a permissionless Fault Dispute System to OP Mainnet is a major step forward on the path to decentralization. This proposal is a responsible approach to the roll out, preserving the safety checks and functionality of the Guardian role while still benefiting from permissionless output proposals and laying a foundation for reaching stage 2 decentralization.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-fault-proofs/8161\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-fault-proofs/8161","pubDate":"Thu, 16 May 2024 23:14:18 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8161"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-fault-proofs/8161.rss","#text":"Upgrade Proposal: Fault Proofs"}},{"title":"Joint House Call will be [Tuesday, May 21st @ 10:00PT / 13:00 ET / 17:00 GMT / 19:00 CET]","dc:creator":"Michael","category":"Community Calls","description":"<p>Hey Everyone!</p>\n<p>Join us at this Joint House call where we will be having an AMA on future upgrades (fault proofs FTW) with OP Labs engineers &amp; Retrofunding Round 4 discusssion!</p>\n<p>Meeting link: <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/vme-ovto-jcn\">https://meet.google.com/vme-ovto-jcn </a><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/6/63d5d178bd01788b189e56807760133506371572.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/efbn82t5fT9vxiDb6T9keO5hNjc.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"joint house 21st-1\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/63d5d178bd01788b189e56807760133506371572_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"joint house 21st-1\" data-base62-sha1=\"efbn82t5fT9vxiDb6T9keO5hNjc\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/63d5d178bd01788b189e56807760133506371572_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/6/63d5d178bd01788b189e56807760133506371572.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/6/63d5d178bd01788b189e56807760133506371572.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EAD1DA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>See you there.<br>\nMichael</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/joint-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-21st-10-00pt-13-00-et-17-00-gmt-19-00-cet/8160\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/joint-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-21st-10-00pt-13-00-et-17-00-gmt-19-00-cet/8160","pubDate":"Thu, 16 May 2024 22:43:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8160"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/joint-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-21st-10-00pt-13-00-et-17-00-gmt-19-00-cet/8160.rss","#text":"Joint House Call will be [Tuesday, May 21st @ 10:00PT / 13:00 ET / 17:00 GMT / 19:00 CET]"}},{"title":"Upgrade Proposal: Guardian, Security Council Threshold and L2 ProxyAdmin Ownership changes for Stage 1 Decentralization","dc:creator":"maurelian","category":"Protocol Upgrade","description":"<p>Hi Maurelian here, I‚Äôm a protocol security engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"executive-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#executive-summary-1\"></a>Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>The protocol upgrade is intended to increase the security and decentralization of the Superchain by meeting the following requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Increasing the Security Council Safe‚Äôs signing threshold, from 4 to 10, out of 13 owners. This meets the 75% threshold requirement for a Stage 1 rollup outlined in <a href=\"https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2Beat‚Äôs Stages framework</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reassigning the role of Guardian from the Foundation to a new Guardian Safe with the Security Council Safe as its sole owner. This moves the Superchain closer to satisfying the 1 week <a href=\"https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">exit window</a> requirement for Stage 1.</p>\n<p>Additionally the Foundation is appointed to the new DeputyGuardian role which is able to act as Guardian through the Guardian Safe. This appointment can be revoked by the Security Council Safe at any time.</p>\n<p>Even though the appointment of the DeputyGuardian is closer to a change in configuration than version, it is a fundamental component of the Superchain‚Äôs security model and thus we are requesting governance approval (as would, we believe, any decision to use the Security Council Safe to modify the DeputyGuardian).</p>\n<p>Note that the Guardian role is generally authorized to enforce ‚ÄòSafety over Liveness‚Äô in the system, meaning that it can currently pause and unpause withdrawals, and following the Fault Proofs upgrade will be able to intervene in the event that a bug would allow an invalid L2 output to be finalized.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reassigning the owner of the L2ProxyAdmin contract from the Foundation to the Security Council (currently in Phase 0, which is a joint 2/2 multisig between the Security Councils Safe and the Foundation Safe). This ensures the Security Council Safe has a blocking vote for L2 predeploy upgrades and is a requirement for Stage 1.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If this vote passes, we recommend the upgrade be deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#specifications-2\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<p>The full specifications for the Liveness Extension and Deputy Guardian system are available <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/security-council-safe.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">from the specs repo</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"technical-details-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#technical-details-3\"></a><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n<p>This upgrade does not affect the node or execution client software.</p>\n<p>The following outlines the full set of changes to the existing system:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>SecurityCouncilSafe</code> is modified to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Increase its threshold from 4 to 10.

Should an owner not be live during that time, the Module will enable that owner to be removed without requiring a threshold of owners to sign. The duration of 14 weeks is chosen to be slightly longer than 3 months, so that liveness can be demonstrated on a regular quarterly cadence.<br>\nIn the unlikely event that enough owners are removed to reduce the total number of owners below 8, then the module will enable all owners to be removed and be replaced with the Foundation as the sole owner.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code>GuardianSafe</code> is deployed, which has a threshold of 1, and the Security Council Safe as its only owner.</p>\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.5.0-rc.1/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/Safe/DeputyGuardianModule.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>DeputyGuardianModule</code></a> is enabled on this <code>GuardianSafe</code>.

The Optimism Foundation, aware of the challenges facing the governance structure‚Äîambiguous processes, delegate workload overload, and underlying conflicts of interest‚Äîdecided to introduce an innovative reform: <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945\">The Grants Council.</a></p>\n<p>During <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x37fc8a6ae60cff2e4e72fe9c0567f739bb9a78262c2ada236892fcbc7af2c32d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Special Voting Cycle #9a</a>, the Token House approved the incorporation of the Grants Council and elected its first 8 members. They were organized into two subcommittees: <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xdcff47b93fb17a11411bda1809e22cba72e5131d31624e4c0f2b9dbee6811f5c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Builders</a> and <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xa9457a5344747a6c272de786419fc7a4e83fcf0f927ef9b1ce767452faa9b453\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Growth Experiments</a>. While the members were part of the community, the Council leader was selected directly by the Foundation, an external figure with a primarily administrative role and no voting rights on grant approvals.</p>\n<p>Since its beginning, the Grants Council has focused on operational efficiency and transparency. Its main objective was to streamline the proposal selection process, creating a more predictable environment for proposers and setting a regular rhythm in fund distribution. Clear scopes were set, distinguishing Partner Fund operations and improving accountability through milestone-based distributions and smaller-sized grants. This approach not only improved Governance Fund management but also eased the workload of delegates, allowing them to focus on other governance areas.</p>\n<p>Today, the Grants Council continues its initial approach but has evolved to play an even more multifaceted role within Optimism‚Äôs governance. With the expansion to three subcommittees‚Äî<a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-13972604474186334\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Builders</a>, <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6101609328023982\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Growth Experiments</a>, and <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/milestones-and-metrics-sub-committee-missing-48524816566608164\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Milestones and Metrics</a>‚Äîand a total of 13 members. This reflects the Optimism Collective‚Äôs ongoing commitment to efficient and responsible fund allocation, essential for the sustainable development of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This strategic effort to integrate the grants process within the broader Token House governance framework not only underscores the Council‚Äôs commitment to continuous improvement but also ensures a lasting impact on strengthening and growing the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the Council Structure, Goals and Responsibilities <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"grants-council-the-journey-of-growth-in-optimism-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#grants-council-the-journey-of-growth-in-optimism-3\"></a>Grants Council: The Journey of Growth in Optimism</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-season-3-launch/4833\">Season #3</a>: Habemus Grants Council</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/4Hw152Ibn5GDXHVVwTyMJZJlp0u.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_438x375.jpeg\" alt=\"2\" data-base62-sha1=\"4Hw152Ibn5GDXHVVwTyMJZJlp0u\" width=\"438\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_438x375.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_657x562.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_876x750.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DEBFC2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In this season, the Grants Council came to life, its foundations were laid and its first members were elected.

Since its beginning, we have observed significant changes in fund distribution. In the first two seasons, before the Council was established, fund distribution was disorganized with large amounts of OP tokens allocated to a limited number of applicants. However, with the implementation of the Council in Season 3, the situation improved dramatically: the number of applicants increased by 261.9%, and the number of beneficiaries rose by 54.8%.</p>\n<p>In Season 4, we continued to see progress, with a 101.9% increase in the number of applicants and a 60.41% increase in beneficiaries. The allocated funds increased moderately, by 7.5% compared to Season 3. The positive trend continued in Season 5, where the number of applicants grew by 78.5% and beneficiaries by 68.9%. Additionally, the allocated funds also increased by 47.48% compared to the previous season. It is worth mentioning that in latest season the Grants Council evaluated both the Grants Program and Mission Requests Program.</p>\n<p>Regarding the budget, we can see that each season a portion of the initially approved budget has not been allocated and it was returned to the Government Fund Treasury. This suggests that funds are allocated meticulously and responsibly, avoiding exceeding the initially assigned budget. Similarly, when it was necessary to allocate more budget, such as in Season 4, it was increased by 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>During Cycle 19, out of the 314 applications the Grants Council received, 252 were evaluated by 2 randomly selected reviewers based on the respective subcommittee involved, following the specified rubric. After passing the intake filter, approximately 40 proposals were ultimately approved, including 31 for the builders subcommittee and 12 for the Growth subcommittee. Meanwhile, in Cycle 22, the Grants Council received 234 applications. Out of these, 37 applications were declined during intake, leaving 197 to be evaluated by two randomly selected reviewers, depending on the subcommittee handling the mission request. Among these, 64 proposals were assigned to the builders subcommittee and 26 to the Growth subcommittee. This data was gathered from the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ul8iMTsOFUKUmqz6MK0zpgt8Ki8tFtoWKGlwXj-Op34/edit#gid=970075255\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism GovFund Grants: Public Delivery Tracking</a>.

We also suggest that this subcommittee have its own framework, schedule and timeline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As we saw, the number of applicants increases each season, and to maintain this momentum while assisting diverse groups of developers, communities, and protocols in applying to the Grants Program and Mission Requests Program, we suggest establishing a broader marketing and communications task force. Perhaps <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/katie\">@katie</a>, who led communications for the Grants Council, can provide insights on whether this makes sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also believe that a working group could be established to provide initial feedback on proposals; this group would ensure that proposals meet the template and established requirements.

We define Token Bridges, Messaging Bridges and the rest of the components in the interoperability stack as we will be discussing which parts of the stack Optimism should focus on and why.</p>\n<p>We then dive into various stakeholders like Users, dApp Builders and Chain Builders, and what are their preferences are when it comes to interoperability. For example,</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Users</strong> care about user experience, costs of interoperability and the security of the tokens they are holding</li>\n<li>Whereas <strong>dApp Builders</strong> care about interop standards, composability and abstraction of permissions, etc.</li>\n<li>And <strong>Chain Builders</strong> care about the sovereignty, MEV extraction (or prevention) and reorg dependencies, etc.<br>\nOptimism needs to satisfy each of these stakeholders before making major changes to the Superchain stack.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then we look at how other ecosystems similar to Superchain have approached the interop problem and how they are planning to. We also compare how these solutions affect each of their stakeholders (users, dapp builders, and chain builders).</p>\n<p>We believe shared sequencing is a powerful solution that can solve many of our problems. The next evolution of shared sequencing, which is based sequencing, is the best solution to the Ethereum interop problem. We believe this decision is an important one that should be made with a lot of discussions.</p>\n<p><strong>The Main Part</strong><br>\nWe later make suggestions on the directions Superchain should take. There are many directions Superchain can choose to go into. Every option we list <strong>trades off</strong> one factor for another.<br>\n1. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">No Changes to the Base Layer</a>: We explore what it would look like to let the market figure it out for themselves. Interop will be solved one way or the other. Superchain may choose to solve it or let new teams pop up to solve it. Chain builders benefit here the most as they get to retain their sovereignty. We do not recommend this, for the sake of our industry.<br>\n2. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Asynchronous Composability</a>: In this approach, Superchain chooses to offer <strong>trustless</strong> interop between chains thus solving interop to a very good extent, but does not offer the complete solution. This may limit what dApp Developers can build on Superchain.<br>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Shared Validity Sequencing</a>: This seems to be the approach Optimism is taking <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/interop/overview.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">right now</a>. Although a great approach, we believe it trades off permissionless interop with all the old and new OP Stack chains. Chains will have to be super vary about who they interop with as there can be frequent rollbacks via fraud proofs.<br>\n4. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">zk-Aggregation Layer</a>: If OP Stack chooses to turn into a zk-rollup, this solutions seems to be the best option available. The main tradeoff is giving up the benefits of Optimistic rollups. On the other side, it is possible to achieve secure atomic execution natively across all of the aggregated chains.<br>\n5. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Shared Sequencer Networks</a>: A shared sequencing network solution built to offer interoperability as a feature. The chain builders lose part of their sovereignty if they opt in. But gain interop and decentralization.<br>\n6. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Based Sequencing</a>: Based Sequencing is about interop with the L1. We believe this should be the ultimate goal for rollups. With this approach, Ethereum can work as a monolithic chain while retaining the benefits of the fragmented rollups.</p>\n<p>Finally, we roughly gauge the amount of effort required by various stakeholders to offer the monolithic experience to their stakeholders.</p>\n<p>This TLDR version just scratches the surface.

Psychological theories of trust and decision-making suggest an important role of social identity and social norms, due to a fundamental human need to find a sense of belonging. First insights suggest that behaviour in crypto may be highly motivated by this need, just as it is offline.</p>\n<p>In this scientific study, we thus examine how users perceive Optimism, what they like or dislike about it, and how they form connections with the network through the lens of ‚Äúidentity fusion‚Äù, i.e., the tendency for individuals to merge their sense-of-self with that of a social group to which they belong.</p>\n<p>Through the lens of identity fusion, blockchain ecosystems represent a collective of individuals, similar to different ‚Äúsocieties‚Äù with distinctive characteristics. Accordingly, this study will provide insights into Optimism‚Äôs perceived identity and characteristics from the mind‚Äôs eye of the users, and shed light on the underlying mechanisms that drive people‚Äôs <em>fusion</em> with Optimism.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rocket.png?v=12\" title=\":rocket:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rocket:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <strong>RELEVANCE AND IMPACT</strong></p>\n<p>Understanding how individuals perceive Optimism and how they develop strong ties to the Optimism network is central for Optimism‚Äôs long-term growth.

Despite the hurdles, the Grants Council demonstrated adaptability and resilience, reviewing a remarkable surge in applications with efficiency. Season 5 saw a 73.2% growth in applications compared to the previous season, receiving a total of 530 Mission Request applications. The Council adapted well to changes, including handling a transition in the Builders Subcommittee. Subcommittees refined Rubrics tailored to each intent, with 8 Rubrics applied to 27 Mission Requests. The review process for Season 5 has concluded, and a detailed list of 74 Finalists for Cycle 22 has been provided. The Finalists represent grants totaling approximately 4.56M OP, with the total recommended grants for Season 5 amounting to around 7.12M OP. There was a proposal to change the use of unused rewards, and the Council expects a surplus of 1.87M OP to be returned to the Gov Fund. The Council aims to make Optimism the top destination for builders and hopes their efforts will contribute to the community‚Äôs goals.

This move aims to streamline the calculation process and enhance predictability for contributors. Instead of individual assessments, a collective definition of profit will be determined through a deliberative process and subsequently ratified by the Citizens‚Äô House. This definition will be applied universally to all projects, simplifying the voting process and reducing voting complexity for badgeholders. The aim is to foster a more productive and sustainable ecosystem by rewarding positive impact on the collective. Through a deliberative process set up for Retro Funding 4, a randomly sampled subset of 50 citizens will deliberate on the definition of profit, guided by facilitated sessions and balanced information. The outcomes of this deliberation will influence the Retro Funding rewards allocated to projects, creating a more streamlined and predictable process for contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"foundation-s6-ama-token-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-14th-1100-pt-1400-et-1800-gmt-1900-cethttpsgovoptimismiotfoundation-s6-ama-token-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-14th-11-00-pt-14-00-et-18-00-gmt-19-00-cet8087-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#foundation-s6-ama-token-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-14th-1100-pt-1400-et-1800-gmt-1900-cethttpsgovoptimismiotfoundation-s6-ama-token-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-14th-11-00-pt-14-00-et-18-00-gmt-19-00-cet8087-9\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/foundation-s6-ama-token-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-14th-11-00-pt-14-00-et-18-00-gmt-19-00-cet/8087\">Foundation S6 AMA / Token House Call will be [Tuesday, May 14th @ 11:00 PT / 14:00 ET / 18:00 GMT / 19:00 CET]</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-05-08<br>\n<strong>Author</strong>: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/michael\">@Michael</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nThe Token House Community Call is scheduled for next Tuesday and will feature a Season 6 AMA with @ lavande and the Foundation, as well as a surprise talk from @ ben-chain.

Various iterations and experiments with governance enforcement mechanisms, such as the creation of a Council, have been discussed. The focus has been on reducing governance overhead while ensuring accountability. The updates include shifting grant-related violations enforcement to the Grants Council, promoting self-dealing policies via incentive design and free market delegation, and establishing various voting and metric-based controls. The discussion also addresses the continued enforcement of Rules of Engagement and the potential role of a Code of Conduct Council for future enforcement. The decentralization of accountability through mediation, delegation, grants oversight, expectation setting, and voting design is emphasized. The changes are slated for Season 6 and flexible for reassessment based on feedback and outcomes. Appreciation is extended to the Code of Conduct Council for their contributions towards innovative solutions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"season-5-missions-v2-retrospectivehttpsgovoptimismiotseason-5-missions-v2-retrospective8103-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-5-missions-v2-retrospectivehttpsgovoptimismiotseason-5-missions-v2-retrospective8103-16\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-missions-v2-retrospective/8103\">Season 5: Missions v2 Retrospective</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-05-09<br>\n<strong>Author</strong>: system</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nThe discussion provides a retrospective on Season 5: Mission Requests, focusing on feedback from various stakeholders to inform the redesign of Mission Requests for v2.5. The retrospective delves into key areas such as drafting, sponsoring, approving, voting, applying to, and selecting Mission Applications.

Mission Requests now involve fewer delegates drafting them, sponsorship by eligible delegates, and the elimination of the delegate approval process for Season 6. The voting process has been refined to address under-allocations and improve delegate experience. Application cycles have been adjusted to provide grants more frequently, addressing past issues of application processing delays. The retrospective highlights achievements, challenges, and areas for improvement, with Season 5 feedback and insights shaping the design of Missions v2.5.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposing-a-new-metric-pairwise-community-signaling-in-retro-funding-4httpsgovoptimismiotproposing-a-new-metric-pairwise-community-signaling-in-retro-funding-48091-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#proposing-a-new-metric-pairwise-community-signaling-in-retro-funding-4httpsgovoptimismiotproposing-a-new-metric-pairwise-community-signaling-in-retro-funding-48091-17\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposing-a-new-metric-pairwise-community-signaling-in-retro-funding-4/8091\">Proposing a New Metric: Pairwise Community Signaling in Retro Funding 4</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-05-09<br>\n<strong>Author</strong>: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/zeptimus\">@Zeptimus</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nPairwise is introducing a new version focused on making signaling RetroPGF accessible to the Optimism Community. The open-source voting dapp streamlines community signaling by allowing users to choose between two options and aggregates their choices into quantifiable results. The intention is to amplify community voices, increase project discovery, and network effects. Pairwise aims to engage token holders, delegates, RetroPGF recipients, and badgeholders in community signaling. The platform offers a user-friendly experience, minimizes the cost and cognitive burden of voting, and converts subjective inputs into measurable outputs.</p>\n<p>To encourage engagement, the new version includes features like mobile optimization, voter feedback, Tinder-style filtering, sound effects, and pseudonymous account abstraction. Instead of allocating tokens, users will rank projects to streamline the voting process. Challenges to overcome include tight timelines and engagement levels, with a marketing campaign planned to maximize participation. Four metrics are proposed for different stakeholder groups, and voting power distribution details are provided.</p>\n<p>The Pairwise ranking will aggregate input from Badgeholders, Recipients, Delegates, and Holders, with engagement requirements for each group to qualify as a metric for voting. The app‚Äôs timing will align with the project‚Äôs finalization, and reward distribution is structured to promote stakeholder engagement. An anti-gaming strategy will ensure the integrity of the voting process, and transparency will be maintained throughout the reward calculation and distribution steps. The community is encouraged to share feedback to shape this experiment collectively, with a prototype set to launch internally on May 15.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"season-6-intents-ratificationhttpsgovoptimismiotseason-6-intents-ratification8104-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-intents-ratificationhttpsgovoptimismiotseason-6-intents-ratification8104-18\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104\">Season 6: Intents Ratification</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-05-09<br>\n<strong>Author</strong>: system</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nThe discussion revolved around the upcoming Season 6 of the Optimism Collective, where significant changes are being made to the setting of Intents and budgets.

A final draft will be ratified by the Token House in Season 6. For more context on the Blockspace Charter Framework, see <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133\">here.</a></em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>The Standard Rollup is the Optimism Collective‚Äôs flagship, high-security blockspace product. The Standard Rollup targets the Collective‚Äôs highest bar for security, uptime, and decentralization, with Optimism Governance responsible for upholding the protections outlined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">Law of Chains</a>. Further, the Standard Rollup should have all potential changes treated with careful consideration by the governance community, to enable long-term, sustainable projects to be built around Standard Rollup blockspace with confidence.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"criteria-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#criteria-3\"></a>Criteria</h1>\n<p>The criteria for being a Standard Rollup consist of a set of deterministic onchain criteria to ensure that chains are well-configured, up-to-date, and secured by the Optimism Security Council, as well as a set of lightweight offchain criteria initially checked by the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"deterministic-onchain-criteria-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#deterministic-onchain-criteria-4\"></a>Deterministic (Onchain) Criteria</h2>\n<p>The deterministic criteria for Standard Rollups consist of 3 primary components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Version Check</strong>: ensuring that all L1 smart contracts are the most up-to-date, governance-approved version of the OP Stack codebase, and, if the chain has been upgraded in the past, that the previous versions were a standard release of the codebase.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Configuration Check</strong>: ensuring that all configuration values for the chain are within high-security, well-tested bounds, and that all administrative roles are set correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Solvency Check</strong>: ensuring all of the chain‚Äôs L1 outputs are correct, preventing historic malicious withdrawals from causing the bridge to become undercollateralized.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The precise code which can be used to perform these checks can be found <code>[here]</code>, and should be considered the canonical, deterministic criteria for what blockspace is governed via this charter. However, some of the key points are included here for readability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The chain‚Äôs genesis state and predeploy (<code>0x420000...</code>) contracts are standard, uniform implementations with no malicious code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The protocol parameters are constrained to high-security, high-stability, well-tested values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Security Council (currently in Phase 0) for the chain‚Äôs L1 bridge contracts, and any other roles .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A standard fee split to the Collective is enforced by smart contracts, as specified <code>[here]</code> and implemented by <code>[this contract]</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"offchain-criteria-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#offchain-criteria-5\"></a>Offchain Criteria</h2>\n<p>In addition to the above deterministic criteria, the Optimism Foundation will perform a limited set of manual, offchain checks at its discretion before inclusion as a Standard Rollup. These checks are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>ChainID check</strong>: ensuring that the Chain ID is unique and does not collide with a pre-existing EVM chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gas Limit check</strong>: ensuring that the Chain‚Äôs initial GasLimit is configured to a reasonable value based on the then-current status of OP Stack performance testing. (see below for additional context on Gas Limit policy)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security Monitoring</strong>: ensuring certain standard monitoring tools have been deployed for every chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Governor/Servicer verification</strong>: verifying at the social layer that the chain is indeed deployed and operated by the parties in question, and are not being impersonated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Other checks:</strong> running necessary checks related to compliance with applicable laws.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Optimism Foundation‚Äôs final inclusion of a chain in the <code>superchain-registry</code> repo will be the canonical indicator of passing the offchain criteria. Thus, in summation, the community can determine whether a given chain falls under the scope of this charter by checking that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Chain passes all Deterministic Criteria checks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Chain has been included by the Optimism Foundation in the <code>superchain-registry</code> repo.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over time, it should be expected that the Foundation‚Äôs subjective checks are either eliminated, or transitioned to a process run directly by the community, so that inclusion may be determined purely by onchain data.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"governing-policies-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#governing-policies-6\"></a>Governing Policies</h1>\n<p>The Standard Rollup‚Äôs governing policies implement additional ‚Äúreactive‚Äù procedures in the event that one or more stakeholder protections in the Law of Chains are violated in such a way that the protocol cannot naturally handle them. Each of these governing policies include reference to a specific protection in the Law of Chains.</p>\n<p>In its current form, all governing policies‚Äô relevant enforcement actions would be taken by the <code>L1ProxyAdmin</code> role, which is held by the Phase 0 Security Council. As such, all enforcement actions will follow the standard Protocol Upgrade vote procedure, which is the existing path used for governance to exercise the <code>L1ProxyAdmin</code> role. In the future, policies may include different enforcement mechanisms (e.g. via unilateral action by other councils, or via direct onchain governor outcomes given explicit authority in the protocol.)</p>\n<h3><a name=\"governor-key-recovery-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#governor-key-recovery-7\"></a>Governor Key Recovery</h3>\n<p>In the current version of the OP Stack, the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> is permitted to change certain chain configuration values. According to the Law of Chains, control of some of these values are afforded to the Chain Governor (e.g. transaction fee margin), and others are afforded to the Chain Servicer (e.g. the batcher hotkey).</p>\n<p>For convenience, the Configuration Check in the above criteria permits either the Chain Servicer or the Chain Governor to be the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code>, so that Chain Governors can delegate all configuration updates to Servicers. However, because the Chain Governor is also protected by the Law of Chains to <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=This%20should%20include%20the%20ability%20for%20the%20Chain%20Governor%20to%20change%20the%20Sequencer%20on%20its%20OP%20Chain\">be able to switch between Chain Servicers</a>, ultimate control of the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role should belong to the Chain Governor.</p>\n<p>In the event that a Chain Servicer stops fulfilling the wishes of the Chain Governor for those values which the Law of Chains states they should be able to control, or refuses to transfer control of the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role in the event that the Chain Governor desires to switch to a different servicer, then the Chain Governor may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to have the Phase 1 Security Council recover the role to an account they control.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"sequencer-censorship-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#sequencer-censorship-8\"></a>Sequencer Censorship</h3>\n<p>In the event that a sequencer is determined to be intentionally censoring valid user transactions, or experiencing unreasonable downtime impacting applications on the chain, they are violating the User Protection of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=a%20timely%20manner.-,Security%2C%20Uptime%2C%20and%20Liveness,-%3A%20Block%20production\">Security, Uptime, and Liveness</a> in the Law of Chains.</p>\n<p>In the event that a Chain Governor refuses to change its sequencer in reaction, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and appoint a new sequencer.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"responsible-gaslimits-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#responsible-gaslimits-9\"></a>Responsible GasLimits</h3>\n<p>The OP Stack is rapidly evolving and the boundaries of its performance continue to be pushed. As such, the protocol currently does not implement a hardcoded upper bound on the Gas Limit for a chain. However, this ability must be responsibly exercised to ensure <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md.\">fulfillment of User Protections.</a> Thus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Before any GasLimit increase, Chain Governors should submit to the community a public load test which demonstrates stability at that limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After any GasLimit increase, if the chain experiences a significant degradation in performance or stability, the GasLimit should promptly be lowered back to its previous value.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a Chain Governor fails to take these steps, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and lower the GasLimit.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"responsible-batch-submission-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#responsible-batch-submission-10\"></a>Responsible Batch Submission</h3>\n<p>The current version of the OP Stack allows for batches to be submitted with up to a 12 hour delay after initial reception by the sequencer (the ‚Äúsequencing window‚Äù). However, Sequencers are expected to submit at least twice as frequently (i.e. every 6 hours). This affords sufficient time to batch submit in the case of failures or downtime, fulfilling the User Protection to <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=a%20timely%20manner.-,Security%2C%20Uptime%2C%20and%20Liveness,-%3A%20Block%20production\">Security, Uptime, and Liveness</a>.</p>\n<p>In the event that a Chain Governor refuses to change its sequencer which repeatedly and intentionally violates this practice, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and appoint a new compliant sequencer.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"fee-margins-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#fee-margins-11\"></a>Fee Margins</h3>\n<p>The Law of Chains affords Chain Governors the ability to set fee margins for the chain. However, setting the fee margin significantly high can be a form of economic censorship ‚Äî by making transactions prohibitively expensive to submit, the Governor could <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">effectively violate the User Protection to censorship resistance.</a> A Chain Governor that configures the OP Chain in such a way that Users indirectly cannot transact (e.g.%2C by setting a prohibitively high gas markup.)</p>\n<p>The Standard Rollup should allow a maximum fee margin of 50% (i.e., the average cost of transactions should not exceed twice the cost of batch submission). If a Chain Governor sets the fee margin in excess of this, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and lower the Fee Margin.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"resourcemetering-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#resourcemetering-12\"></a>ResourceMetering</h3>\n<p>The <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role is currently able to modify the <code>ResourceMetering</code> struct, a low-level set of values which set certain properties of L1‚ÜíL2 message rules. This is a low-level variable with no reason to be changed outside of a protocol upgrade.</p>\n<p>If a <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> (either Servicer or Governor) changes this value, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the relevant party and revert the change.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"precommitments-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#precommitments-13\"></a>Precommitments</h1>\n<p>This section commits to anticipated changes (or lack thereof) for future upgrades to this charter.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"collective-fee-take-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#collective-fee-take-14\"></a>Collective Fee Take</h3>\n<p>The current Blockspace Charter specifies a fee split to the collective of the greater of 1) 2.5% of transaction fee revenue and 2) 15% of chain profit (fee revenue - L1 submission cost). It is extremely important to provide Stakeholders in the Collective with a reliable economic model on which they can build reliable, sustainable long-term projects. By ratifying this Blockspace Charter, the Collective is signaling its precommitment to <strong>all standard rollups</strong> that it will not modify the fee split parameters outlined above for 5 years, until [June] 2029.</p>\n<p>This does not preclude changes or improvements to the implementation of the fee split contracts, so long as they preserve the original spirit. In the event that new sources of fees (or operating costs) are introduced to the protocol, the economics should be updated with minimized impact to the existing expectations and projects on the Superchain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"governorservicer-role-separation-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#governorservicer-role-separation-15\"></a>Governor/Servicer Role Separation</h3>\n<p>Some policies above (e.g. Governor Key Recovery) arise from an overloading of the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role to control configurability options which the Law of Chains affords separately to Governors and Servicers. In a future upgrade, the Collective expects to transition to a model which establishes independent roles for the Governor and Servicer, allowing them to modify the configuration values afforded to them independently. This change would also remove controllability of the Resource Metering Config without a protocol upgrade.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ossified-gaslimits-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#ossified-gaslimits-16\"></a>Ossified GasLimits</h3>\n<p>Because the OP Stack‚Äôs performance is rapidly improving, the GasLimit configurability is unbounded (subject to the relevant Governing Policy above). However, as the rate of change slows, the Collective expects to set a hard upper bound, which can only be changed via upgrade.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"direct-fee-margin-controls-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#direct-fee-margin-controls-17\"></a>Direct Fee Margin Controls</h3>\n<p>Today, the ‚Äúfee margin‚Äù discussed in the relevant Governing Policy above is only indirectly influenceable via the control of multiple other configuration variables. In the future, the Collective anticipates a protocol improvement which allows the margin to be set more directly, and which imposes a strict upper bound of 50%, to remove the ability to perform economic censorship even temporarily.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 10:44:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8135"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135.rss","#text":"Season 6: [DRAFT] Standard Rollup Charter"}},{"title":"Season 6: [Draft] Charter-Aware Upgrade Proposal Template","dc:creator":"system","category":"Policies  and Templates üìå","description":"<h1><a name=\"season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template-1\"></a>Season 6: [Draft] Charter-Aware Upgrade Proposal Template</h1>\n<hr>\n<p><em>// This is a draft Upgrade Proposal Template for community feedback.

This post will serve as an introduction to Blockspace Charters, explaining what they are and what their purpose is. We will also present, and eventually seek ratification for, the first charter‚Äîthe <em><strong>Standard Rollup Charter</strong></em>‚Äîin a parallel post. An initial draft of the Standard Rollup Charter for community feedback can be found <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The Reflection Period will be used to build understanding of the underlying concepts presented below. Ratification for the Standard Rollup Charter will occur during Season 6, and updates to the corresponding Protocol Upgrade framework will follow. In the meantime, the Foundation will conduct an AMA as part of the Token House Community Call on Tuesday, May 14 to answer any questions and collect community feedback. Followup calls may be scheduled as necessary.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The Superchain is quickly blossoming into a robust ecosystem of OP Stack-based chains. However, these chains are not all technically equivalent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Different chains may use different <em>versions</em> of the OP Stack‚Äîsome projects have made modifications to the stack, and others are on outdated versions of it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Even within chains that are on the same version, some may be <em>configured</em> differently ‚Äî that is, deployed with different values for various parameters, admin roles, and so on.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Open source, permissionless innovation is key to the Collective‚Äôs success. At the same time, ecosystem fragmentation also poses challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Users and developers need an easy way to understand what blockspace has which properties and guarantees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optimism Governance needs to understand how to make decisions about these different forms of blockspace, which may make different commitments and have different control structures.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">The Law of Chains</a> is a neutrality framework designed to provide a guiding light for the Superchain and its stakeholders to make decisions and uphold protections. However, the Law of Chains is intentionally agnostic to any specific details of the protocol. This allows for it to be <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=It%20is%20further%20understood%20that%20the%20Law%20of%20Chains%20will%20require%20adaptation%20to%20changing%20circumstances%20as%20the%20Collective%20defines%20itself%2C%20evolves%2C%20and%20grows%20iteratively%20over%20time.%20Accordingly%2C%20the%20Law%20of%20Chains%20adopts%20additional%20interpretive%20principles%3A\">applicable over many iterations of the protocol</a>, but also means that it can fail to provide clear guidance at the granularity described in the above bullets.</p>\n<p>This makes the Law of Chains analogous to the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55\">Working Constitution of the Optimism Collective</a>. It defines the guiding principles for the Collective‚Äôs governance, but it does not define the specific mechanisms of voting cycles, quorums, and so forth.  Blockspace Charters are the equivalent to the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md\">Operating Manual</a>, providing the specific implementation details for different types of Superchain blockspace.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-is-a-blockspace-charter-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#what-is-a-blockspace-charter-3\"></a>What is a Blockspace Charter?</h1>\n<p>At a high level, a Blockspace Charter consists of three primary components: <strong>Criteria</strong>, <strong>Governing Policies</strong>, and <strong>Precommitments</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criteria</strong> are the specific technical parameters which define which chains are under the scope of a given charter.  The charter‚Äôs criteria should provide an <em>objective definition</em> for which chains are under its scope.  Generally, there are two components to blockspace criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Version:</strong> The version of the OP Stack which the chain is using, as determined by commit-hash/release. This refers to the specific protocol code powering the blockspace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Configuration:</strong> the accepted range of parameterizations of the software in the OP Chain‚Äôs deployment. Configuration can include static variables defined at genesis, like the Chain ID, and dynamic variables, like the chain‚Äôs sequencer or upgrade keys. Configuration bounds state what values those options must fall within to satisfy the charter‚Äôs criteria.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Solvency:</strong> This involves ensuring that a chain‚Äôs history does not include any invalid withdrawals, or invalid outputs, which could cause the bride to be undercollateralized.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Governing Policies</strong> are the specific rules, procedures, and principles which stakeholders participating in the charter‚Äôs blockspace follow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Generally, Governing Policies will be related to how the different <strong>configured roles</strong> should behave or interact, and how that is <strong>enforced</strong>.  For example, if a charter‚Äôs blockspace criteria requires that upgrade keys configured be held by the Security Council, and allows the chain‚Äôs sequencer to be configured to be anybody, then the governing policies could define:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The required behavior of the sequencer, which, if violated, would be grounds for removal, and the methods by which the community can check for violations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The governance process (i.e. proposal type) by which governance could vote to remove a sequencer found in violation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The signing procedure which would be subsequently taken by the Security Council to remove the offending sequencer.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As you will see in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135\">Standard Blockspace Charter draft</a>, governing policies should be mapped back to the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">Law of Chains</a> guiding principles.  For each protection in the Law of Chains, the governing policies make explicit how those protections can be upheld for the charter‚Äôs blockspace.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Precommitments</strong> serve as a commitment mechanism, outlining anticipated changes (or anticipated consistency) for future upgrades to the charter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>They are designed to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the long-term vision and stability of the governance framework. By committing to specific parameters or outlining planned evolutions of the charter, Precommitments help mitigate uncertainty and foster a stable environment for growth and innovation within the Superchain ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Precommitments can address various critical aspects of OP chains, such as <strong>fee split models</strong>, <strong>role separations</strong>, and <strong>technical parameters</strong> like gas limits and fee margins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The specificity of Precommitments can vary from extremely specific anticipated changes to protocol code, to anticipated changes to Governing Policies‚Äô enforcement procedures, to implementation-independent economic guidance or principles.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"how-will-blockspace-charters-be-rolled-out-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-will-blockspace-charters-be-rolled-out-4\"></a>How will Blockspace Charters be rolled out?</h1>\n<p>Blockspace Charters will be rolled out alongside two supporting components: the <strong>Superchain Registry</strong>, a Github repository which manages addition of new chains according to Charters‚Äô Criteria, and an <strong>improved upgrade proposal process</strong> which maps upgrade proposals to a particular Charter (see <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template/8134\">here</a>.)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"superchain-registry-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#superchain-registry-5\"></a>Superchain Registry</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Superchain Registry</strong> will play a crucial role in the Blockspace Charter framework by serving as an accessible index of what chains are a part of the Superchain. It acts as the source of truth for which chains have been accepted under a specific charter and documents the specific configuration values which have been chosen for each chain. This registry is essential for maintaining transparency and accountability within the Superchain ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The Superchain Registry implements the <strong>validation logic</strong> referenced in Charters‚Äô Criteria via an automated test suite. This ensures that all chains meet the criteria outlined in their respective Blockspace Charter before being added, ensuring consistency and security across the Superchain.</p>\n<p>As a public index, the Superchain Registry also serves as <strong>unified, accessible documentation</strong> for what OP Chains exist, and what kind of blockspace they implement (i.e.‚Äîwhat charter, if any, they fall under). Note that the Superchain Registry may include different chains in the superchain which meet different charters‚Äô criteria (or which meet no charters‚Äô criteria). This means that <em>inclusion in the Superchain Registry only implies inclusion in the Superchain.</em> The Superchain Registry implements an extensible categorization system to clearly delineate which chains fall under which criteria (and therefore which Blockspace Charter), which further implies what ‚Äúpart‚Äù of the Superchain it is in.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"incremental-rollout-beta-registry-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#incremental-rollout-beta-registry-6\"></a>Incremental Rollout (Beta Registry)</h3>\n<p>While the process outlined in this document brings a great deal of clarity to Superchain governance, the Collective already votes on protocol versions independent of the chains in question. As the Security Council currently enacts all Protocol Upgrades, we do not view it as strictly necessary for the Standard Rollup Charter to be ratified before the Phase 1 Security Council becomes responsible for upgrades on additional OP Chains.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in close coordination with the Security Council and relevant Chain Governors and Servicers, we plan to roll out a ‚Äúbeta registry‚Äù and begin onboarding some initial chains to the Phase 1 Security Council and Superchain Registry, if we know they are on the governance-approved version of the OP Stack.  We plan to use this as an opportunity to iron out any frictions and get the Security Council comfortable with the end-to-end process, before before the charter is ratified and the process is scaled.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"improved-upgrade-proposal-process-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#improved-upgrade-proposal-process-7\"></a>Improved Upgrade Proposal Process</h2>\n<p>Corresponding to Blockspace Charters being able to rigorously define specific types of blockspace, upgrade proposals will now be changed to correspond to specific charters. Together with the Superchain Registry, this will allow the Collective to clearly understand exactly which chains are in the scope of an upgrade, and rigorously consider the impact on stakeholders.</p>\n<p>The updated Upgrade Proposal template can be found <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template/8134\">here</a>.  The template is relatively similar to that in previous seasons, with the difference that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Upgrade proposals now specify a Blockspace Charter to be upgraded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgrade proposals must link to a pull request for an updated charter. This will be the version of the charter that, if successful, applies post-upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Impact Summary</code> section of the upgrade proposal now must provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Justifications for all changes to the Blockspace Charter not covered in other sections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A comprehensive justification that all Precommitments in the previous Charter are preserved by the upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This enhanced upgrade proposal process, by aligning closely with Blockspace Charters and the Superchain Registry, ensures a transparent, accountable, and stakeholder-focused approach to evolving the Superchain. It supports to goal that every upgrade is carefully considered, justified, and aligned with the long-term vision and commitments of the Optimism Collective, fostering a stable and innovative ecosystem.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 10:28:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8133"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133.rss","#text":"Season 6: Introducing Blockspace Charters: Superchain-first Governance"}},{"title":"Season 6: Anticapture Commission Amended","dc:creator":"system","category":"Metagovernance","description":"<h1><a name=\"season-6-anticapture-commission-amended-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-anticapture-commission-amended-1\"></a>Season 6: Anticapture Commission Amended</h1>\n<p><em>This is an amended version of the original <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889\">Anticapture Commission Charter</a> approved in Season 5.
