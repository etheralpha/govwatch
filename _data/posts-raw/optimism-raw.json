The Optimism Foundation, aware of the challenges facing the governance structure—ambiguous processes, delegate workload overload, and underlying conflicts of interest—decided to introduce an innovative reform: <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945\">The Grants Council.</a></p>\n<p>During <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x37fc8a6ae60cff2e4e72fe9c0567f739bb9a78262c2ada236892fcbc7af2c32d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Special Voting Cycle #9a</a>, the Token House approved the incorporation of the Grants Council and elected its first 8 members. They were organized into two subcommittees: <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xdcff47b93fb17a11411bda1809e22cba72e5131d31624e4c0f2b9dbee6811f5c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Builders</a> and <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0xa9457a5344747a6c272de786419fc7a4e83fcf0f927ef9b1ce767452faa9b453\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Growth Experiments</a>. While the members were part of the community, the Council leader was selected directly by the Foundation, an external figure with a primarily administrative role and no voting rights on grant approvals.</p>\n<p>Since its beginning, the Grants Council has focused on operational efficiency and transparency. Its main objective was to streamline the proposal selection process, creating a more predictable environment for proposers and setting a regular rhythm in fund distribution. Clear scopes were set, distinguishing Partner Fund operations and improving accountability through milestone-based distributions and smaller-sized grants. This approach not only improved Governance Fund management but also eased the workload of delegates, allowing them to focus on other governance areas.</p>\n<p>Today, the Grants Council continues its initial approach but has evolved to play an even more multifaceted role within Optimism’s governance. With the expansion to three subcommittees—<a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-13972604474186334\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Builders</a>, <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-6101609328023982\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Growth Experiments</a>, and <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/milestones-and-metrics-sub-committee-missing-48524816566608164\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Milestones and Metrics</a>—and a total of 13 members. This reflects the Optimism Collective’s ongoing commitment to efficient and responsible fund allocation, essential for the sustainable development of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This strategic effort to integrate the grants process within the broader Token House governance framework not only underscores the Council’s commitment to continuous improvement but also ensures a lasting impact on strengthening and growing the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the Council Structure, Goals and Responsibilities <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-proposal-moving-to-a-grants-council/3945\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"grants-council-the-journey-of-growth-in-optimism-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#grants-council-the-journey-of-growth-in-optimism-3\"></a>Grants Council: The Journey of Growth in Optimism</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-season-3-launch/4833\">Season #3</a>: Habemus Grants Council</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/4Hw152Ibn5GDXHVVwTyMJZJlp0u.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_438x375.jpeg\" alt=\"2\" data-base62-sha1=\"4Hw152Ibn5GDXHVVwTyMJZJlp0u\" width=\"438\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_438x375.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_657x562.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/2/20f3fc82bdb238bba0204d041e9cb687f3bfcc4a_2_876x750.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DEBFC2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In this season, the Grants Council came to life, its foundations were laid and its first members were elected.

Since its beginning, we have observed significant changes in fund distribution. In the first two seasons, before the Council was established, fund distribution was disorganized with large amounts of OP tokens allocated to a limited number of applicants. However, with the implementation of the Council in Season 3, the situation improved dramatically: the number of applicants increased by 261.9%, and the number of beneficiaries rose by 54.8%.</p>\n<p>In Season 4, we continued to see progress, with a 101.9% increase in the number of applicants and a 60.41% increase in beneficiaries. The allocated funds increased moderately, by 7.5% compared to Season 3. The positive trend continued in Season 5, where the number of applicants grew by 78.5% and beneficiaries by 68.9%. Additionally, the allocated funds also increased by 47.48% compared to the previous season. It is worth mentioning that in latest season the Grants Council evaluated both the Grants Program and Mission Requests Program.</p>\n<p>Regarding the budget, we can see that each season a portion of the initially approved budget has not been allocated and it was returned to the Government Fund Treasury. This suggests that funds are allocated meticulously and responsibly, avoiding exceeding the initially assigned budget. Similarly, when it was necessary to allocate more budget, such as in Season 4, it was increased by 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>During Cycle 19, out of the 314 applications the Grants Council received, 252 were evaluated by 2 randomly selected reviewers based on the respective subcommittee involved, following the specified rubric. After passing the intake filter, approximately 40 proposals were ultimately approved, including 31 for the builders subcommittee and 12 for the Growth subcommittee. Meanwhile, in Cycle 22, the Grants Council received 234 applications. Out of these, 37 applications were declined during intake, leaving 197 to be evaluated by two randomly selected reviewers, depending on the subcommittee handling the mission request. Among these, 64 proposals were assigned to the builders subcommittee and 26 to the Growth subcommittee. This data was gathered from the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ul8iMTsOFUKUmqz6MK0zpgt8Ki8tFtoWKGlwXj-Op34/edit#gid=970075255\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism GovFund Grants: Public Delivery Tracking</a>.

We also suggest that this subcommittee have its own framework, schedule and timeline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As we saw, the number of applicants increases each season, and to maintain this momentum while assisting diverse groups of developers, communities, and protocols in applying to the Grants Program and Mission Requests Program, we suggest establishing a broader marketing and communications task force.

We define Token Bridges, Messaging Bridges and the rest of the components in the interoperability stack as we will be discussing which parts of the stack Optimism should focus on and why.</p>\n<p>We then dive into various stakeholders like Users, dApp Builders and Chain Builders, and what are their preferences are when it comes to interoperability. For example,</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Users</strong> care about user experience, costs of interoperability and the security of the tokens they are holding</li>\n<li>Whereas <strong>dApp Builders</strong> care about interop standards, composability and abstraction of permissions, etc.</li>\n<li>And <strong>Chain Builders</strong> care about the sovereignty, MEV extraction (or prevention) and reorg dependencies, etc.<br>\nOptimism needs to satisfy each of these stakeholders before making major changes to the Superchain stack.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then we look at how other ecosystems similar to Superchain have approached the interop problem and how they are planning to. We also compare how these solutions affect each of their stakeholders (users, dapp builders, and chain builders).</p>\n<p>We believe shared sequencing is a powerful solution that can solve many of our problems. The next evolution of shared sequencing, which is based sequencing, is the best solution to the Ethereum interop problem. We believe this decision is an important one that should be made with a lot of discussions.</p>\n<p><strong>The Main Part</strong><br>\nWe later make suggestions on the directions Superchain should take. There are many directions Superchain can choose to go into. Every option we list <strong>trades off</strong> one factor for another.<br>\n1. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">No Changes to the Base Layer</a>: We explore what it would look like to let the market figure it out for themselves. Interop will be solved one way or the other. Superchain may choose to solve it or let new teams pop up to solve it. Chain builders benefit here the most as they get to retain their sovereignty. We do not recommend this, for the sake of our industry.<br>\n2. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Asynchronous Composability</a>: In this approach, Superchain chooses to offer <strong>trustless</strong> interop between chains thus solving interop to a very good extent, but does not offer the complete solution. This may limit what dApp Developers can build on Superchain.<br>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Shared Validity Sequencing</a>: This seems to be the approach Optimism is taking <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/interop/overview.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">right now</a>. Although a great approach, we believe it trades off permissionless interop with all the old and new OP Stack chains. Chains will have to be super vary about who they interop with as there can be frequent rollbacks via fraud proofs.<br>\n4. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">zk-Aggregation Layer</a>: If OP Stack chooses to turn into a zk-rollup, this solutions seems to be the best option available. The main tradeoff is giving up the benefits of Optimistic rollups. On the other side, it is possible to achieve secure atomic execution natively across all of the aggregated chains.<br>\n5. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Shared Sequencer Networks</a>: A shared sequencing network solution built to offer interoperability as a feature. The chain builders lose part of their sovereignty if they opt in. But gain interop and decentralization.<br>\n6. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Superchain-and-the-Monolithic-Experience-cc499f712c8648cd852b0b5393db2b51?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Based Sequencing</a>: Based Sequencing is about interop with the L1. We believe this should be the ultimate goal for rollups. With this approach, Ethereum can work as a monolithic chain while retaining the benefits of the fragmented rollups.</p>\n<p>Finally, we roughly gauge the amount of effort required by various stakeholders to offer the monolithic experience to their stakeholders.</p>\n<p>This TLDR version just scratches the surface.

Despite the hurdles, the Grants Council demonstrated adaptability and resilience, reviewing a remarkable surge in applications with efficiency. Season 5 saw a 73.2% growth in applications compared to the previous season, receiving a total of 530 Mission Request applications. The Council adapted well to changes, including handling a transition in the Builders Subcommittee. Subcommittees refined Rubrics tailored to each intent, with 8 Rubrics applied to 27 Mission Requests. The review process for Season 5 has concluded, and a detailed list of 74 Finalists for Cycle 22 has been provided. The Finalists represent grants totaling approximately 4.56M OP, with the total recommended grants for Season 5 amounting to around 7.12M OP.

This move aims to streamline the calculation process and enhance predictability for contributors. Instead of individual assessments, a collective definition of profit will be determined through a deliberative process and subsequently ratified by the Citizens’ House. This definition will be applied universally to all projects, simplifying the voting process and reducing voting complexity for badgeholders. The aim is to foster a more productive and sustainable ecosystem by rewarding positive impact on the collective. Through a deliberative process set up for Retro Funding 4, a randomly sampled subset of 50 citizens will deliberate on the definition of profit, guided by facilitated sessions and balanced information. The outcomes of this deliberation will influence the Retro Funding rewards allocated to projects, creating a more streamlined and predictable process for contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"foundation-s6-ama-token-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-14th-1100-pt-1400-et-1800-gmt-1900-cethttpsgovoptimismiotfoundation-s6-ama-token-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-14th-11-00-pt-14-00-et-18-00-gmt-19-00-cet8087-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#foundation-s6-ama-token-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-14th-1100-pt-1400-et-1800-gmt-1900-cethttpsgovoptimismiotfoundation-s6-ama-token-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-14th-11-00-pt-14-00-et-18-00-gmt-19-00-cet8087-9\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/foundation-s6-ama-token-house-call-will-be-tuesday-may-14th-11-00-pt-14-00-et-18-00-gmt-19-00-cet/8087\">Foundation S6 AMA / Token House Call will be [Tuesday, May 14th @ 11:00 PT / 14:00 ET / 18:00 GMT / 19:00 CET]</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-05-08<br>\n<strong>Author</strong>: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/michael\">@Michael</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nThe Token House Community Call is scheduled for next Tuesday and will feature a Season 6 AMA with @ lavande and the Foundation, as well as a surprise talk from @ ben-chain.

The open-source voting dapp streamlines community signaling by allowing users to choose between two options and aggregates their choices into quantifiable results. The intention is to amplify community voices, increase project discovery, and network effects. Pairwise aims to engage token holders, delegates, RetroPGF recipients, and badgeholders in community signaling. The platform offers a user-friendly experience, minimizes the cost and cognitive burden of voting, and converts subjective inputs into measurable outputs.</p>\n<p>To encourage engagement, the new version includes features like mobile optimization, voter feedback, Tinder-style filtering, sound effects, and pseudonymous account abstraction. Instead of allocating tokens, users will rank projects to streamline the voting process. Challenges to overcome include tight timelines and engagement levels, with a marketing campaign planned to maximize participation. Four metrics are proposed for different stakeholder groups, and voting power distribution details are provided.</p>\n<p>The Pairwise ranking will aggregate input from Badgeholders, Recipients, Delegates, and Holders, with engagement requirements for each group to qualify as a metric for voting. The app’s timing will align with the project’s finalization, and reward distribution is structured to promote stakeholder engagement. An anti-gaming strategy will ensure the integrity of the voting process, and transparency will be maintained throughout the reward calculation and distribution steps. The community is encouraged to share feedback to shape this experiment collectively, with a prototype set to launch internally on May 15.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"season-6-intents-ratificationhttpsgovoptimismiotseason-6-intents-ratification8104-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-intents-ratificationhttpsgovoptimismiotseason-6-intents-ratification8104-18\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104\">Season 6: Intents Ratification</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-05-09<br>\n<strong>Author</strong>: system</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nThe discussion revolved around the upcoming Season 6 of the Optimism Collective, where significant changes are being made to the setting of Intents and budgets.

For more context on the Blockspace Charter Framework, see <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133\">here.</a></em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>The Standard Rollup is the Optimism Collective’s flagship, high-security blockspace product. The Standard Rollup targets the Collective’s highest bar for security, uptime, and decentralization, with Optimism Governance responsible for upholding the protections outlined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">Law of Chains</a>. Further, the Standard Rollup should have all potential changes treated with careful consideration by the governance community, to enable long-term, sustainable projects to be built around Standard Rollup blockspace with confidence.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"criteria-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#criteria-3\"></a>Criteria</h1>\n<p>The criteria for being a Standard Rollup consist of a set of deterministic onchain criteria to ensure that chains are well-configured, up-to-date, and secured by the Optimism Security Council, as well as a set of lightweight offchain criteria initially checked by the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"deterministic-onchain-criteria-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#deterministic-onchain-criteria-4\"></a>Deterministic (Onchain) Criteria</h2>\n<p>The deterministic criteria for Standard Rollups consist of 3 primary components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Version Check</strong>: ensuring that all L1 smart contracts are the most up-to-date, governance-approved version of the OP Stack codebase, and, if the chain has been upgraded in the past, that the previous versions were a standard release of the codebase.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Configuration Check</strong>: ensuring that all configuration values for the chain are within high-security, well-tested bounds, and that all administrative roles are set correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Solvency Check</strong>: ensuring all of the chain’s L1 outputs are correct, preventing historic malicious withdrawals from causing the bridge to become undercollateralized.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The precise code which can be used to perform these checks can be found <code>[here]</code>, and should be considered the canonical, deterministic criteria for what blockspace is governed via this charter. However, some of the key points are included here for readability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The chain’s genesis state and predeploy (<code>0x420000...</code>) contracts are standard, uniform implementations with no malicious code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The protocol parameters are constrained to high-security, high-stability, well-tested values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Security Council (currently in Phase 0) for the chain’s L1 bridge contracts, and any other roles .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A standard fee split to the Collective is enforced by smart contracts, as specified <code>[here]</code> and implemented by <code>[this contract]</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"offchain-criteria-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#offchain-criteria-5\"></a>Offchain Criteria</h2>\n<p>In addition to the above deterministic criteria, the Optimism Foundation will perform a limited set of manual, offchain checks at its discretion before inclusion as a Standard Rollup. These checks are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>ChainID check</strong>: ensuring that the Chain ID is unique and does not collide with a pre-existing EVM chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gas Limit check</strong>: ensuring that the Chain’s initial GasLimit is configured to a reasonable value based on the then-current status of OP Stack performance testing. (see below for additional context on Gas Limit policy)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security Monitoring</strong>: ensuring certain standard monitoring tools have been deployed for every chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Governor/Servicer verification</strong>: verifying at the social layer that the chain is indeed deployed and operated by the parties in question, and are not being impersonated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Other checks:</strong> running necessary checks related to compliance with applicable laws.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Optimism Foundation’s final inclusion of a chain in the <code>superchain-registry</code> repo will be the canonical indicator of passing the offchain criteria. Thus, in summation, the community can determine whether a given chain falls under the scope of this charter by checking that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Chain passes all Deterministic Criteria checks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Chain has been included by the Optimism Foundation in the <code>superchain-registry</code> repo.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over time, it should be expected that the Foundation’s subjective checks are either eliminated, or transitioned to a process run directly by the community, so that inclusion may be determined purely by onchain data.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"governing-policies-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#governing-policies-6\"></a>Governing Policies</h1>\n<p>The Standard Rollup’s governing policies implement additional “reactive” procedures in the event that one or more stakeholder protections in the Law of Chains are violated in such a way that the protocol cannot naturally handle them. Each of these governing policies include reference to a specific protection in the Law of Chains.</p>\n<p>In its current form, all governing policies’ relevant enforcement actions would be taken by the <code>L1ProxyAdmin</code> role, which is held by the Phase 0 Security Council. As such, all enforcement actions will follow the standard Protocol Upgrade vote procedure, which is the existing path used for governance to exercise the <code>L1ProxyAdmin</code> role. In the future, policies may include different enforcement mechanisms (e.g. via unilateral action by other councils, or via direct onchain governor outcomes given explicit authority in the protocol.)</p>\n<h3><a name=\"governor-key-recovery-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#governor-key-recovery-7\"></a>Governor Key Recovery</h3>\n<p>In the current version of the OP Stack, the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> is permitted to change certain chain configuration values. According to the Law of Chains, control of some of these values are afforded to the Chain Governor (e.g. transaction fee margin), and others are afforded to the Chain Servicer (e.g. the batcher hotkey).</p>\n<p>For convenience, the Configuration Check in the above criteria permits either the Chain Servicer or the Chain Governor to be the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code>, so that Chain Governors can delegate all configuration updates to Servicers. However, because the Chain Governor is also protected by the Law of Chains to <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=This%20should%20include%20the%20ability%20for%20the%20Chain%20Governor%20to%20change%20the%20Sequencer%20on%20its%20OP%20Chain\">be able to switch between Chain Servicers</a>, ultimate control of the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role should belong to the Chain Governor.</p>\n<p>In the event that a Chain Servicer stops fulfilling the wishes of the Chain Governor for those values which the Law of Chains states they should be able to control, or refuses to transfer control of the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role in the event that the Chain Governor desires to switch to a different servicer, then the Chain Governor may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to have the Phase 1 Security Council recover the role to an account they control.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"sequencer-censorship-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#sequencer-censorship-8\"></a>Sequencer Censorship</h3>\n<p>In the event that a sequencer is determined to be intentionally censoring valid user transactions, or experiencing unreasonable downtime impacting applications on the chain, they are violating the User Protection of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=a%20timely%20manner.-,Security%2C%20Uptime%2C%20and%20Liveness,-%3A%20Block%20production\">Security, Uptime, and Liveness</a> in the Law of Chains.</p>\n<p>In the event that a Chain Governor refuses to change its sequencer in reaction, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and appoint a new sequencer.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"responsible-gaslimits-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#responsible-gaslimits-9\"></a>Responsible GasLimits</h3>\n<p>The OP Stack is rapidly evolving and the boundaries of its performance continue to be pushed. As such, the protocol currently does not implement a hardcoded upper bound on the Gas Limit for a chain. However, this ability must be responsibly exercised to ensure <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md.\">fulfillment of User Protections.</a> Thus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Before any GasLimit increase, Chain Governors should submit to the community a public load test which demonstrates stability at that limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After any GasLimit increase, if the chain experiences a significant degradation in performance or stability, the GasLimit should promptly be lowered back to its previous value.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a Chain Governor fails to take these steps, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and lower the GasLimit.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"responsible-batch-submission-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#responsible-batch-submission-10\"></a>Responsible Batch Submission</h3>\n<p>The current version of the OP Stack allows for batches to be submitted with up to a 12 hour delay after initial reception by the sequencer (the “sequencing window”). However, Sequencers are expected to submit at least twice as frequently (i.e. every 6 hours). This affords sufficient time to batch submit in the case of failures or downtime, fulfilling the User Protection to <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=a%20timely%20manner.-,Security%2C%20Uptime%2C%20and%20Liveness,-%3A%20Block%20production\">Security, Uptime, and Liveness</a>.</p>\n<p>In the event that a Chain Governor refuses to change its sequencer which repeatedly and intentionally violates this practice, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and appoint a new compliant sequencer.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"fee-margins-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#fee-margins-11\"></a>Fee Margins</h3>\n<p>The Law of Chains affords Chain Governors the ability to set fee margins for the chain. However, setting the fee margin significantly high can be a form of economic censorship — by making transactions prohibitively expensive to submit, the Governor could <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">effectively violate the User Protection to censorship resistance.</a> A Chain Governor that configures the OP Chain in such a way that Users indirectly cannot transact (e.g.%2C by setting a prohibitively high gas markup.)</p>\n<p>The Standard Rollup should allow a maximum fee margin of 50% (i.e., the average cost of transactions should not exceed twice the cost of batch submission). If a Chain Governor sets the fee margin in excess of this, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> and lower the Fee Margin.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"resourcemetering-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#resourcemetering-12\"></a>ResourceMetering</h3>\n<p>The <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role is currently able to modify the <code>ResourceMetering</code> struct, a low-level set of values which set certain properties of L1→L2 message rules. This is a low-level variable with no reason to be changed outside of a protocol upgrade.</p>\n<p>If a <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> (either Servicer or Governor) changes this value, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the relevant party and revert the change.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"precommitments-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#precommitments-13\"></a>Precommitments</h1>\n<p>This section commits to anticipated changes (or lack thereof) for future upgrades to this charter.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"collective-fee-take-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#collective-fee-take-14\"></a>Collective Fee Take</h3>\n<p>The current Blockspace Charter specifies a fee split to the collective of the greater of 1) 2.5% of transaction fee revenue and 2) 15% of chain profit (fee revenue - L1 submission cost). It is extremely important to provide Stakeholders in the Collective with a reliable economic model on which they can build reliable, sustainable long-term projects. By ratifying this Blockspace Charter, the Collective is signaling its precommitment to <strong>all standard rollups</strong> that it will not modify the fee split parameters outlined above for 5 years, until [June] 2029.</p>\n<p>This does not preclude changes or improvements to the implementation of the fee split contracts, so long as they preserve the original spirit. In the event that new sources of fees (or operating costs) are introduced to the protocol, the economics should be updated with minimized impact to the existing expectations and projects on the Superchain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"governorservicer-role-separation-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#governorservicer-role-separation-15\"></a>Governor/Servicer Role Separation</h3>\n<p>Some policies above (e.g. Governor Key Recovery) arise from an overloading of the <code>SystemConfigOwner</code> role to control configurability options which the Law of Chains affords separately to Governors and Servicers. In a future upgrade, the Collective expects to transition to a model which establishes independent roles for the Governor and Servicer, allowing them to modify the configuration values afforded to them independently. This change would also remove controllability of the Resource Metering Config without a protocol upgrade.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ossified-gaslimits-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#ossified-gaslimits-16\"></a>Ossified GasLimits</h3>\n<p>Because the OP Stack’s performance is rapidly improving, the GasLimit configurability is unbounded (subject to the relevant Governing Policy above). However, as the rate of change slows, the Collective expects to set a hard upper bound, which can only be changed via upgrade.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"direct-fee-margin-controls-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#direct-fee-margin-controls-17\"></a>Direct Fee Margin Controls</h3>\n<p>Today, the “fee margin” discussed in the relevant Governing Policy above is only indirectly influenceable via the control of multiple other configuration variables. In the future, the Collective anticipates a protocol improvement which allows the margin to be set more directly, and which imposes a strict upper bound of 50%, to remove the ability to perform economic censorship even temporarily.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 10:44:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8135"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135.rss","#text":"Season 6: [DRAFT] Standard Rollup Charter"}},{"title":"Season 6: [Draft] Charter-Aware Upgrade Proposal Template","dc:creator":"system","category":"Policies  and Templates 📌","description":"<h1><a name=\"season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template-1\"></a>Season 6: [Draft] Charter-Aware Upgrade Proposal Template</h1>\n<hr>\n<p><em>// This is a draft Upgrade Proposal Template for community feedback.

This post will serve as an introduction to Blockspace Charters, explaining what they are and what their purpose is. We will also present, and eventually seek ratification for, the first charter—the <em><strong>Standard Rollup Charter</strong></em>—in a parallel post. An initial draft of the Standard Rollup Charter for community feedback can be found <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The Reflection Period will be used to build understanding of the underlying concepts presented below. Ratification for the Standard Rollup Charter will occur during Season 6, and updates to the corresponding Protocol Upgrade framework will follow. In the meantime, the Foundation will conduct an AMA as part of the Token House Community Call on Tuesday, May 14 to answer any questions and collect community feedback. Followup calls may be scheduled as necessary.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The Superchain is quickly blossoming into a robust ecosystem of OP Stack-based chains. However, these chains are not all technically equivalent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Different chains may use different <em>versions</em> of the OP Stack—some projects have made modifications to the stack, and others are on outdated versions of it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Even within chains that are on the same version, some may be <em>configured</em> differently — that is, deployed with different values for various parameters, admin roles, and so on.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Open source, permissionless innovation is key to the Collective’s success. At the same time, ecosystem fragmentation also poses challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Users and developers need an easy way to understand what blockspace has which properties and guarantees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optimism Governance needs to understand how to make decisions about these different forms of blockspace, which may make different commitments and have different control structures.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">The Law of Chains</a> is a neutrality framework designed to provide a guiding light for the Superchain and its stakeholders to make decisions and uphold protections. However, the Law of Chains is intentionally agnostic to any specific details of the protocol. This allows for it to be <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md#:~:text=It%20is%20further%20understood%20that%20the%20Law%20of%20Chains%20will%20require%20adaptation%20to%20changing%20circumstances%20as%20the%20Collective%20defines%20itself%2C%20evolves%2C%20and%20grows%20iteratively%20over%20time.%20Accordingly%2C%20the%20Law%20of%20Chains%20adopts%20additional%20interpretive%20principles%3A\">applicable over many iterations of the protocol</a>, but also means that it can fail to provide clear guidance at the granularity described in the above bullets.</p>\n<p>This makes the Law of Chains analogous to the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55\">Working Constitution of the Optimism Collective</a>. It defines the guiding principles for the Collective’s governance, but it does not define the specific mechanisms of voting cycles, quorums, and so forth.  Blockspace Charters are the equivalent to the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md\">Operating Manual</a>, providing the specific implementation details for different types of Superchain blockspace.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-is-a-blockspace-charter-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#what-is-a-blockspace-charter-3\"></a>What is a Blockspace Charter?</h1>\n<p>At a high level, a Blockspace Charter consists of three primary components: <strong>Criteria</strong>, <strong>Governing Policies</strong>, and <strong>Precommitments</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criteria</strong> are the specific technical parameters which define which chains are under the scope of a given charter.  The charter’s criteria should provide an <em>objective definition</em> for which chains are under its scope.  Generally, there are two components to blockspace criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Version:</strong> The version of the OP Stack which the chain is using, as determined by commit-hash/release. This refers to the specific protocol code powering the blockspace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Configuration:</strong> the accepted range of parameterizations of the software in the OP Chain’s deployment. Configuration can include static variables defined at genesis, like the Chain ID, and dynamic variables, like the chain’s sequencer or upgrade keys. Configuration bounds state what values those options must fall within to satisfy the charter’s criteria.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Solvency:</strong> This involves ensuring that a chain’s history does not include any invalid withdrawals, or invalid outputs, which could cause the bride to be undercollateralized.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Governing Policies</strong> are the specific rules, procedures, and principles which stakeholders participating in the charter’s blockspace follow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Generally, Governing Policies will be related to how the different <strong>configured roles</strong> should behave or interact, and how that is <strong>enforced</strong>.  For example, if a charter’s blockspace criteria requires that upgrade keys configured be held by the Security Council, and allows the chain’s sequencer to be configured to be anybody, then the governing policies could define:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The required behavior of the sequencer, which, if violated, would be grounds for removal, and the methods by which the community can check for violations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The governance process (i.e. proposal type) by which governance could vote to remove a sequencer found in violation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The signing procedure which would be subsequently taken by the Security Council to remove the offending sequencer.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As you will see in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135\">Standard Blockspace Charter draft</a>, governing policies should be mapped back to the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">Law of Chains</a> guiding principles.  For each protection in the Law of Chains, the governing policies make explicit how those protections can be upheld for the charter’s blockspace.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Precommitments</strong> serve as a commitment mechanism, outlining anticipated changes (or anticipated consistency) for future upgrades to the charter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>They are designed to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the long-term vision and stability of the governance framework. By committing to specific parameters or outlining planned evolutions of the charter, Precommitments help mitigate uncertainty and foster a stable environment for growth and innovation within the Superchain ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Precommitments can address various critical aspects of OP chains, such as <strong>fee split models</strong>, <strong>role separations</strong>, and <strong>technical parameters</strong> like gas limits and fee margins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The specificity of Precommitments can vary from extremely specific anticipated changes to protocol code, to anticipated changes to Governing Policies’ enforcement procedures, to implementation-independent economic guidance or principles.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"how-will-blockspace-charters-be-rolled-out-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-will-blockspace-charters-be-rolled-out-4\"></a>How will Blockspace Charters be rolled out?</h1>\n<p>Blockspace Charters will be rolled out alongside two supporting components: the <strong>Superchain Registry</strong>, a Github repository which manages addition of new chains according to Charters’ Criteria, and an <strong>improved upgrade proposal process</strong> which maps upgrade proposals to a particular Charter (see <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template/8134\">here</a>.)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"superchain-registry-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#superchain-registry-5\"></a>Superchain Registry</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Superchain Registry</strong> will play a crucial role in the Blockspace Charter framework by serving as an accessible index of what chains are a part of the Superchain. It acts as the source of truth for which chains have been accepted under a specific charter and documents the specific configuration values which have been chosen for each chain. This registry is essential for maintaining transparency and accountability within the Superchain ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The Superchain Registry implements the <strong>validation logic</strong> referenced in Charters’ Criteria via an automated test suite. This ensures that all chains meet the criteria outlined in their respective Blockspace Charter before being added, ensuring consistency and security across the Superchain.</p>\n<p>As a public index, the Superchain Registry also serves as <strong>unified, accessible documentation</strong> for what OP Chains exist, and what kind of blockspace they implement (i.e.—what charter, if any, they fall under). Note that the Superchain Registry may include different chains in the superchain which meet different charters’ criteria (or which meet no charters’ criteria). This means that <em>inclusion in the Superchain Registry only implies inclusion in the Superchain.</em> The Superchain Registry implements an extensible categorization system to clearly delineate which chains fall under which criteria (and therefore which Blockspace Charter), which further implies what “part” of the Superchain it is in.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"incremental-rollout-beta-registry-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#incremental-rollout-beta-registry-6\"></a>Incremental Rollout (Beta Registry)</h3>\n<p>While the process outlined in this document brings a great deal of clarity to Superchain governance, the Collective already votes on protocol versions independent of the chains in question. As the Security Council currently enacts all Protocol Upgrades, we do not view it as strictly necessary for the Standard Rollup Charter to be ratified before the Phase 1 Security Council becomes responsible for upgrades on additional OP Chains.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in close coordination with the Security Council and relevant Chain Governors and Servicers, we plan to roll out a “beta registry” and begin onboarding some initial chains to the Phase 1 Security Council and Superchain Registry, if we know they are on the governance-approved version of the OP Stack.  We plan to use this as an opportunity to iron out any frictions and get the Security Council comfortable with the end-to-end process, before before the charter is ratified and the process is scaled.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"improved-upgrade-proposal-process-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#improved-upgrade-proposal-process-7\"></a>Improved Upgrade Proposal Process</h2>\n<p>Corresponding to Blockspace Charters being able to rigorously define specific types of blockspace, upgrade proposals will now be changed to correspond to specific charters. Together with the Superchain Registry, this will allow the Collective to clearly understand exactly which chains are in the scope of an upgrade, and rigorously consider the impact on stakeholders.</p>\n<p>The updated Upgrade Proposal template can be found <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-charter-aware-upgrade-proposal-template/8134\">here</a>.  The template is relatively similar to that in previous seasons, with the difference that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Upgrade proposals now specify a Blockspace Charter to be upgraded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgrade proposals must link to a pull request for an updated charter. This will be the version of the charter that, if successful, applies post-upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Impact Summary</code> section of the upgrade proposal now must provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Justifications for all changes to the Blockspace Charter not covered in other sections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A comprehensive justification that all Precommitments in the previous Charter are preserved by the upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This enhanced upgrade proposal process, by aligning closely with Blockspace Charters and the Superchain Registry, ensures a transparent, accountable, and stakeholder-focused approach to evolving the Superchain. It supports to goal that every upgrade is carefully considered, justified, and aligned with the long-term vision and commitments of the Optimism Collective, fostering a stable and innovative ecosystem.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 10:28:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8133"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133.rss","#text":"Season 6: Introducing Blockspace Charters: Superchain-first Governance"}},{"title":"Season 6: Anticapture Commission Amended","dc:creator":"system","category":"Metagovernance","description":"<h1><a name=\"season-6-anticapture-commission-amended-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-anticapture-commission-amended-1\"></a>Season 6: Anticapture Commission Amended</h1>\n<p><em>This is an amended version of the original <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889\">Anticapture Commission Charter</a> approved in Season 5.

It’s a very important role and we know it’s not easy. Optimism delegates are asked to continuously experiment and constantly iterate; it’s never easy to be the first to do something and delegates do it everyday.</p>\n<p>While the Collective depends on a community of high context, highly engaged delegates, we also understand the realities of part-time contribution and the demands of outside commitments.

It is suggested this post include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resignation period (whether short term or long term)</li>\n<li>Reason for resignation</li>\n<li>Any plans to remain active in the Collective in a different capacity</li>\n<li>Please tag <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/lavande\">@lavande</a>, from the Optimism Foundation, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/zcf\">@zcf</a>, from Agora, so we’re aware of your resignation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re a large delegate, whose inactive voting power might block quorum, please encourage your delegators to redelegate their tokens while you’re away. You may suggest a specific delegate(s) towards which your delegators should consider redelegating.</p>\n<p>Advanced delegation allows a delegate to pass-through their delegation to another delegate and would be an ideal feature to utilize in the case of short-term absences. However, while Agora has begun rolling out advanced delegation to select delegates, this feature only works on a go-forward basis and, therefore, isn’t applicable for delegations made before the feature was enabled. Broader roll-out and retroactive applicability of advanced delegation would be subject to a one-time upgrade to the token contract, which comes with serious considerations.</p>\n<p>We recommend sharing long-term resignation plans on additional platforms such as Farcaster or in the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#gov-general</span> or <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#delegate-discussion</span> channel in Discord to broaden the audience aware of your long-term resignation.

These include:<br>\nHere’s a refined version of the suggested Internal Operating Procedures (IOP) changes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Streamline Intake and Preliminary Review:</strong> Consolidate intake and preliminary review into a single process to enhance efficiency and rigor. This unified process should be more stringent to pass, ensuring that only high-quality proposals proceed to the next stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shorten Review Process:</strong> Reduce the duration of the review process from 6 weeks to 3 weeks to expedite decision-making and minimize delays in applicant feedback and final selections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Perpetual Finalist Status:</strong> Grant perpetual finalist status to non-elected applicants of the final review to allow sufficient time (2 weeks) for integration of feedback and revisions, reducing the need for repetitive resubmissions and administrative overhead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mid-Week Review Assignment:</strong> Implement a mid-week deadline for initial review assignments. Applications not yet reviewed by this deadline will be open for any reviewer to pick up, ensuring a balanced workload distribution and fair rewards based on individual review contributions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mandatory Feedback Focus:</strong> Make feedback regarding mission request alignment and formal application process mandatory, emphasizing alignment with established criteria rather than the viability of the project idea itself. This ensures consistency and clarity in the review process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Buffer:</strong> Incorporate a 12 to 24-hour buffer between review steps to allow the Grants Council Lead and Operations team to perform necessary operational actions, such as second assignment, application declination, and report formulation. This buffer enhances operational efficiency and responsiveness to review outcomes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Proponent Communication:</strong> Promote improved feedback mechanisms, communication channels, and contact with proponents to foster greater transparency and collaboration throughout the grants process.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Suggested Adjustments to the Charter:</strong></p>\n<p>The suggested adjustments to the Charter aim to optimize the structure and functionality of the Grants Council. These include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Audits Subcommittee Inclusion:</strong> Introduce an audits subcommittee along with its designated reviewers to enhance oversight and accountability in the audit process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Streamline Subcommittee Structure:</strong> Remove the builders and growth subcommittees as separate entities, and maintain a unified pool of reviewers to ensure equitable distribution of workload and resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible Reward Model:</strong> Implement a system to adjust rewards based on workload, providing opportunities for reviewers with lighter responsibilities to receive proportionate rewards during the season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Internal Reviewer Grouping:</strong> Internally categorize reviewers based on interests, performance, and availability to facilitate efficient assignment allocation and optimize team dynamics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mission Request Authorization:</strong> Enforce the acceptance of only those mission requests authorized by the Grants Council to mitigate potential principal-agent problems and uphold governance integrity.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What improvements to the team’s mandate would you suggest for next Season?</strong></p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the next season, it is recommended to continue the team’s operations with a focus on refining processes and enhancing transparency. Additionally, the review of budget allotment mid-season for Token House voting is proposed to further align the grants process with broader governance responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Grants Council has demonstrated commendable performance and remains committed to serving the needs of the Optimism Collective. Through continuous improvement and adaptation, we strive to uphold transparency, efficiency, and accountability in our operations.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-retrospective-season-5/8126\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-retrospective-season-5/8126","pubDate":"Fri, 10 May 2024 15:42:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8126"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-retrospective-season-5/8126.rss","#text":"Grant Council - Retrospective Season 5"}},{"title":"Season 6: Chain Delegation Program Amendment","dc:creator":"system","category":"Metagovernance","description":"<p><em>Special thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/brichis\">@brichis</a>,<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/kaereste\">@kaereste</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/porter_smith\">@Porter_Smith</a> for review and feedback on these amendments as part of the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863\">Feedback Commission</a></em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"season-6-chain-delegation-program-amendment-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-chain-delegation-program-amendment-1\"></a>Season 6: Chain Delegation Program Amendment</h1>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"chain-delegation-program-amendment-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#chain-delegation-program-amendment-2\"></a>Chain Delegation Program Amendment</h2>\n<p>The Chain Delegation Program was not utilized in Season 5 due to longer than expected timelines on the partnership side and due to the ongoing evolution of what it means to be part of the Superchain. However, the Chain Delegation Program is expected to play a meaningful role in our plans to onboard the next ~15 OP Chains. Below we propose an amendment to the original proposal, based on changes that have occurred over the course of Season 5. This program pertains only to L2’s as governance controls protocol parameters at the L2 level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains that meet the below criteria will be eligible for 250k OP in delegation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133#superchain-registry-5\">Superchain Registry</a> (or similar)</li>\n<li>Committed to contribute revenue back to the Collective and generating &gt; 1 ETH / month in sequencer revenue, for at least 2 consecutive months</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally, chains the meet the below requirement will be eligible for an additional 750k OP in delegation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1M in transaction volume per month, for at least 2 consecutive months (qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on this metric at the beginning of each Season.) This metric more closely ties to private grant milestones, replacing the previous revenue generation metric (in part due to the impact of 4844).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Chains operating on the Standard Configuration would be eligible for an additional 500k OP in delegation (a total of 1.5M OP for these chains.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on these metrics at the start of each Season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The size of the program would be increased to 20M, to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation. All delegation formulas and caps remain the same.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The duration of the program would be extended, to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation, on a rolling basis until, all qualifying chains have gone through the program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All delegations made through this program will continue to be capped at the point at which an OP Chain reaches a total possible delegation equal to 9% of the votable supply. OP Chains that would be able to self-delegate up to 9% of the votable supply to themselves but have not done so yet are not eligible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No delegations have been made through this program to date. Any delegations that are made will be noted as a comment to this forum post.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains will not be added to this program until they opt-in and verify they are able to uphold the below participant expectations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>OP Chains must maintain a &gt;70% voting participation rate during the Season, calculated at the start of each Season, or their delegation will be removed at the start of the next Season</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delegates should set an ENS Primary Name to their delegation address and create a delegate statement on <a href=\"http://vote.optimism.io\">vote.optimism.io</a>.

The Foundation has consulted the Anticapture Commission on several related matters, as has Agora.

Teams can apply for a grant to fulfill a Mission Request and the Grants Council evaluates which applicants will receive grants.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>In Season 6, Delegates will be asked to approve Mission Requests proposed by the Grants Council and the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863\">Collective Feedback Commission</a>.</p>\n<p>Mission Requests will be proposed under each Intent in a suggested rank order. Delegates may either follow this suggested order, by voting down the line, or they may chose to override these suggestions and vote in their own preferred order. Below is an example of how ranking works.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-does-approval-ranking-work-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-does-approval-ranking-work-3\"></a>How Does Approval Ranking Work?</h3>\n<p>Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of “Yes” votes they receive. Approval ranking is a voting mechanism that allows each delegate to cast a vote with their full voting power, on as many options as desired.</p>\n<p>Each Mission proposal must receive a minimum number of “yes” votes, equal to 51% of the 30% quorum. Any Mission Request that does not receive &gt; required number of “yes” votes will not be approved.</p>\n<p>The top ranked Mission Requests, above the minimum number of “yes” votes, will be accepted in rank order until the Intent Budget is fully allocated. If a Mission Request would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included and neither will any of the budget requests ranked beneath it.</p>\n<p>The main point of approval ranking is to prioritize work, not to optimize for complete allocation of the budget. Prioritization is a larger challenge for DAOs than fully allocating budgets as DAOs typically struggle to allocate budgets <em>sustainably</em>, allocating insufficient resources to core work and allocating too many resources to non-core work.</p>\n<p>Intent Budgets will be calculated based on the total amount of OP that could be allocated via the Request. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine the following scenario:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Votable supply = 20M OP</li>\n<li>Quorum = 6M OP (30% votable supply)</li>\n<li>Minimum yes vote requirement = 3.1M OP (51% of quorum)</li>\n<li>Total budget for Intent <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#10</span> = 200k OP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>–-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission Request 1: Ask for 50k OP, 5M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 2: Ask for 50k OP, 2M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 3: Ask for 50k OP, 3.4M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 4: Ask for 75k OP, 3.3M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 5: Ask for 35k OP, 3.2M OP votes (all are Yes votes)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 6: Ask for 25k OP, 3.1M OP votes (all are Yes votes.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Mission Request 1, 3, and 4 would move forward, as they were all above quorum and within the 200k OP budget. Mission Request 2 did not meet the quorum requirement. Mission Request 5 met quorum but was over the budget allocated to this Intent (including Mission Request 5 would have pushed the total to 210k OP rather than the approved 200k OP). Mission Request 6 wasn’t ranked high enough to qualify.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If an Intent Budget is over/underallocated, it should be viewed as an opportunity to assess several potential factors to improve future decision making, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether or not reasonable/appropriate budgets were proposed for each Intent</li>\n<li>Whether or not the Governance Fund is the optimal mechanism through which to support the initiatives proposed under each Intent</li>\n<li>Whether or not there were quality Mission Requests proposed under each Intent</li>\n<li>Whether or not any high impact initiatives did not move forward as a result of under/over allocation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"how-should-delegates-think-about-casting-votes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-should-delegates-think-about-casting-votes-4\"></a><strong>How Should Delegates Think About Casting Votes?</strong></h3>\n<p>This vote utilizes approval ranking. You may place a vote to approve any number of Missions Requests you would like to approve with your full voting power. That means, in the above example, if I am a delegate with 1M OP voting power, I could cast votes as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission Request 1: 1M OP (approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 2: Abstain (don’t approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 3: 1M OP (approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 4: Abstain (don’t approve)</li>\n<li>Mission Request 5: 1M OP (approve)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a voter, you should vote “Yes” on the Mission Requests you think most deserve to move forward, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think deserve to move forward. Delegates should not vote on their own proposals, including Mission Requests they have authored and/or sponsored.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"when-evaluating-mission-requests-please-keep-in-mind-they-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#when-evaluating-mission-requests-please-keep-in-mind-they-5\"></a>When evaluating Mission Requests, please keep in mind they:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>should describe a start-to-finish initiative, not ongoing services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>shouldn’t specify the team that should complete the Request</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>shouldn’t rely on any Foundation action or support   - should not propose metagovernance changes and/or structures (such as the creation of committees and/or Councils).
