The profit calculation will deduct past transfers, such as grants and funding, to determine the final award in OP for each voter’s impact assessment. A deliberative process involving badgeholders determined the profit definition, with a proposed deduction weight applied only to Optimism Grants. Badgeholders are called to vote on ratifying this definition which will automatically be applied to the voting result calculation in Round 4, with a fallback definition proposed by the Foundation if not ratified. The voting will take place on Snapshot from June 20-26.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"s6-grants-council-communication-threadhttpsgovoptimismiots6-grants-council-communication-thread8324-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#s6-grants-council-communication-threadhttpsgovoptimismiots6-grants-council-communication-thread8324-2\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/s6-grants-council-communication-thread/8324\">S6 Grants Council Communication Thread</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-06-19</p>\n<p><strong>Author</strong>: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth\">@Gonna.eth</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>In the Grants Council Communication Thread, an outline of the Season 6 Grants Council’s structure and roles is provided.

The goal is to design a “curriculum” for the best way for new governance participants to engage in meaningful governance activities, which can hopefully be expanded in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>What are GovNFTs?</strong><br>\nGovNFTs are a general-purpose governance primitive built by the Velodrome team. As many of you know, tokens for builders’ grants have a 1-year lock. Delegations have been made on these locked tokens in the past but require manual work from the foundation to do so. GovNFTs are an audited smart contract that can keep the tokens “locked” while at the same time allowing the builder to fluidly participate in Optimism Governance.</p>\n<p><strong>What is this program?</strong><br>\nTo test this primitive before expanding to the broader set of Optimism builder’s grantees, we are creating a pilot program as outlined in <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/velodrome-finance-governance-participation-23531902138656102\">this grant</a>. This pilot program makes available 25K OP to incentivize and reward existing GovNFT holders for valuable participation in Optimism governance. The initial set of users is 200+ users and protocols who have previously earned GovNFTs through previous grants on Velodrome. A series of activities will be assigned a point value. The 25k OP will be distributed among participants in the pilot based on a weighted average of points. The activities and their potential point values are as follows.</p>\n<p><em>This is a draft; the goal is to improve the following based on feedback from the community.

Anonymous in this case refers to instead of revealing attester we hide them instead while valid identity roles are still shown.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ZKP Overview:\n<ul>\n<li>To achieve this, we utilize a cryptographic primitive called zero knowledge proof, this allows us to hide some information while guaranteeing an enforced correct statement for such information. In this case, identity roles.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Chosen ZKP Protocols:\n<ul>\n<li>We choose UltraPlonk (zkSNARK) to be our ZK scheme and will be implemented using Noir (<a href=\"https://noir-lang.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://noir-lang.org/</a>) due to ease of development, community support, and tooling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Implementation Details And Workflow:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We came up with 2 possible variants of the anonymous attestation mechanism, each having different pros and cons.

The signature and address verification is obtained off-chain from passport-frontend. Address verification process is done through either ECDSA signature verification (native signature), or EDDSA signature verification (derived signature from registered keypair, intended for AA account)\n<ul>\n<li>User request to do anonymous attestation to target address on some message</li>\n<li>User send signature verifying their ownership of address to Curia through passport-frontend (signature can be ECDSA or registered EDDSA)</li>\n<li>Curia gives back a signature that guarantees ownership of the address with the identity role. This signature is signed on address and identity role.</li>\n<li>Calculate revoker using hash of address and signature</li>\n<li>User generate ZK Proof that proof that\n<ul>\n<li>User know a valid Curia signature that sign on the specific address</li>\n<li>Signature signed by that specific address on “CURIA_ANONYMOUS_ATTESTATION_V1” message is valid</li>\n<li>Attestation message is attached in public input</li>\n<li>Random nonce is attached in public input</li>\n<li>Revoker hash (hash of revoker) is correctly calculated and is attached in public input</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Pros:\n<ul>\n<li>Support real time role update</li>\n<li>Infinite identity group (We can support arbitrary identity groups ex. Top 10 Delegate, etc.)</li>\n<li>Very fast and not heavy computation dependent.</li>\n<li>Curia also has zero knowledge to link which attestation has been done if the requested signature pool is large enough.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cons\n<ul>\n<li>Rely on Curia infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Building blocks are not designed to be composable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Semaphore Group\n<ul>\n<li>Identity role proof is generated by verifying Semaphore group’s merkle tree inclusion of the address and the address ownership verification similar to Curia Signature method (ECDSA and EDDSA). The Semaphore group of each identity role is updated on-chain by Curia every 2-months interval (corresponding to Passport’s season).\n<ul>\n<li>User request to do anonymous attestation to target address on some message</li>\n<li>User fetch all semaphore merkle tree leafs</li>\n<li>User generates a signature verifying their ownership of the account.</li>\n<li>Calculate revoker using hash of address and signature</li>\n<li>User generate ZK Proof that proof that\n<ul>\n<li>User knows the merkle path from their address leaf to the root.</li>\n<li>Signature signed by that specific address on “CURIA_ANONYMOUS_ATTESTATION_V1” message is valid</li>\n<li>Attestation message is attached in public input</li>\n<li>Random nonce is attached in public input</li>\n<li>Revoker hash (hash of revoker) is correctly calculated and is attached in public input</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Pros:\n<ul>\n<li>Very decentralized.</li>\n<li>Proof and attestation transactions can be generated without interacting with Curia.</li>\n<li>All addresses in each group are verifiable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cons:\n<ul>\n<li>Computationally and communicationally expensive.</li>\n<li>Not real-time at all.</li>\n<li>Group membership update is very costly due to the large membership size nature.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then the proof is submitted to the relayer which the relayer then will call the “Curia Anonymous Attestation” contract. This contract will then verify the zk proof and call attestation function at EAS on behalf of the user.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Result of attestation would be “Curia Anonymous Attestation” contract attest to target address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anonymous attestation can be revoked by calling “Curia Anonymous Attestation” contract and providing uid of the attestation and preimage of “Revoker hash” submitted in the attestation. If the contract can correctly verify Revoker hash preimage, then the contract will call revoke at EAS on behalf of the user.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"h-9-smart-account-wallet-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-9-smart-account-wallet-11\"></a>9. Smart Account Wallet:</h4>\n<p>The smart account wallet serves as a comprehensive digital repository, designed to securely store and manage each participant’s on-chain identity passport along with their related attestations, providing an accessible record of their governance roles, contributions, and achievements within the Optimism collective.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart Account Wallet Overview:\n<ul>\n<li>A smart contract wallet is a type of Ethereum account that is managed by a smart contract instead of an externally owned account (EOA) private key.

If successfully renewed this Season, the CoCC will become a persistent structure in the Collective, assumed to continue unless/until a Council Dissolution proposal is put forward.

The needs of the council members are of high context and highly specialized skills.</li>\n<li><em>Accountability to the collective</em>: The Council works with elected members who will be held accountable for their decisions and are seasonally elected to allow open participation. Members of the Council are removable via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating Manual.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728\"><em>It takes a community to create a culture</em>:</a> Managing conflict is not only related to big cases and situations that require the enforcement of sanctions. The approach towards detection of conflict early by opening the space for small feedback loops will support the effectiveness of the work of the council in identification and capacity to solve cases (A stitch in time saves nine)</li>\n<li><em>Governance accessibility:</em> The council provides easy-to-access spaces to deal with conflict for every collective member, respecting the organization’s autonomy and trying to be neutral in decision-making. The Council does not charge more if there are more cases, we are proposing a one-time payment at the end of the season.</li>\n<li><em>Progressive decentralization</em>: The Council plays a key role in the autonomy of the collective, transferring authority to trusted members on taking a role that cover some needs that were being <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">managed by the foundation or with voting processes</a> before season 5. This council is an iteration of several efforts to reduce governance overhead from conflicts.</li>\n<li><em>Minimizing, but planning for the future</em>: Having this Council responds to a very particular need in communities which is having an internal management layer where conflict could be held privately. Managing conflict contributes to the perceived well-being of organizations, and investing on infrastructure for emergencies shapes the organizational ability to navigate the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VUCA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">VUCA</a> context we experience in Web3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"proposal-description-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#proposal-description-3\"></a><strong>Proposal description:</strong></h2>\n<p>Proposed Council Lead: Juan Carlos Bell</p>\n<p>Proposed Council Operating Budget: 26.000 OP (+8.000 OP increase from last Season)</p>\n<p>Contact Info: (<a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/juankbell\">@juankbell</a> Op forum) - (<a href=\"https://x.com/Bellcho\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@bellcho </a>X) - juankbell (Discord) -</p>\n<p><strong>- Please link to any previous work or qualifications to be Council Lead:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://regenscore.io/share/0x7d547666209755FB833f9B37EebEa38eBF513Abb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Regenscore</a>: My on-chain interaction has been mostly in Optimism, ETH mainnet, Polygon, and Gnosis chain, contributing actively to many projects in the web3 space Since 2019.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-do-you-feel-about-a-conflict-committee/3117/14\">First forum post in OP forum</a>: My first interaction with the OP forum was precisely supporting the idea of a conflict committee, back in Oct 2022.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RFP # 2:</a> (2023) I posted a proposal in the name of Gravity DAO, supporting the implementation of code of conduct enforcement solutions in the optimism collective, improving governance accessibility, and minimizing governance overhead from the foundation, which at that point was managing Code of conduct violations via token voting.

The Code of Conduct Council can facilitate communication with and between conflicting parties.</p>\n<p>The Code of Conduct Council is available to facilitate discussions and provide feedback, and changes to the Code of Conduct and Rules of Engagement for transparency and coherence.</p>\n<p>Violations can be reported using platform tools, processed by NERDs or govNERDs for users, or through specific forms for delegates or Citizens. Since the Rules of Engagement apply to anyone using Optimism-hosted platforms, there is no distinction between Token House and Citizens’ House - the CoCC would enforce the Rules of Engagement for everyone, regardless of House, with penalties ranging from warnings to potential permanent removal.</p>\n<p>The relationship between the Council with SupportNERDs will be as two separate and independent groups. The supportNERDs being a contributor path that facilitates moderating content via platform monitoring, and the Code of Conduct Council taking over cases that may involve enforcement of sanctions, affect multiple parties, or require further discussion, interpretation, or proper spaces to be debated within internal management layers.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Council Members = 5 (20.000 OP total) (+ 5.000 total increase from last Season)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(4.000 OP each)</strong></p>\n<p>Council members should be elected by the community via <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-nominations-code-of-conduct-council/8118\">public nomination</a>, and be present and available to process any case that arises in the community during the season.
