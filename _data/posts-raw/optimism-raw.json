I co-founded multiple projects that are now used by millions of people. In addition to my work at Oasis Labs, I also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Led and grew the engineering team at Plasmic, a low-code frontend builder</li>\n<li>Co-founded a networking project that was productionized by Google into Outline, and now used by people around the world to get access to the free and open Internet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:</strong><br>\nWhen I was the technical leader of Oasis, I was responsible for both building and deploying the L1 protocol. This included communicating with validators, designing for robustness in a diverse heterogeneous deployments, and securely managing keys for the team and protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:</strong><br>\nI have always taken operational security very seriously. This typically involves a defense-in-depth strategy, thinking through potential threat vectors from a holistic view, in which the human is typically the weakest link. I‚Äôve studied this theoretically as an academic, publishing papers at security conferences. I‚Äôve handled this in practice during my time running engineering teams. And I look forward to applying these diverse experiences to keep Optimism humming smoothly. In my opinion, good visibility and strong proactive communication are table stakes. No system is perfect, and we should expect occasional failures. A good defense-in-depth strategy allows us to mitigate the downsides of failures, giving us the room to diagnose systemic issues. When I led post-mortems in the past, we held them with a no-fault ethos, recognizing that the system must design for human fallibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:</strong><br>\nN/A</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Operating Manual</a>:</strong><br>\nI understand</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand that election is subject to successful completion of a Foundation screen which</strong> <strong>may include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract:</strong> [No/Yes]<br>\nYes</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities.

Once implemented, this ZKP can reduce the challenge period for Optimism from 7 days to 12 hours and avoid complicated interactive challenge procedures. Optimism accepted and funded three proposals from Risc Zero, O(1) Labs, and the ETH Storage team. Each team proposes a similar approach, where the fault proof program, written in Go or Rust, is compiled into a generic instruction set such as RISCV, WASM, or MIPS. These compiled instructions are then verified for correctness using zkVMs like zkRISCV, zkWASM, or zkMIPS, which we refer to as the generic VM approach. An alternative approach involves developing a custom circuit for the fault proof program, which we believe offers better performance compared to the generalized VM method. Recently, Polygon Zero announced the development of a highly performant type1 zkEVM, which aligns with our expectations for creating a custom circuit for opBNB‚Äôs fault proof program. Therefore, we have decided to develop a proof of concept (PoC) based on Polygon Zero‚Äôs type1 zkEVM codebase to demonstrate the performance advantages compared to the generalized VM approach. The PoC involves the protocol specific to Optimism, and can be used to generate ZKP for Optimism blocks. The figure below illustrates the simple workflow of the two approaches. It is worth noting that our proposal aims not only to improve performance but also to enhance the robustness of the Optimism multi-proofs system.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vi6DVyZIjKqoMYUlBCrHhYFUrA7.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b_2_669x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"vi6DVyZIjKqoMYUlBCrHhYFUrA7\" width=\"669\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b_2_669x500.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F5F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"current-fault-proof-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#current-fault-proof-overview-2\"></a>Current Fault Proof Overview</h3>\n<p>Before delving into the ZK fault proof design, Let‚Äôs quickly review the current optimism fault proof design.</p>\n<p>The offchain fault proof program consists of two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Derive the disputed block from the anchor L1 block hash;</li>\n<li>Execute the disputed block based on the agreed L2 state root and compare the execution result with the claimed output root</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The onchain fault dispute game works as following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The attacker and defender take turns initiating on-chain actions based on the claims submitted on-chain by their opponents until they agree on the disputed L2 block;</li>\n<li>They then repeat the above challenge process until they agree on the disputed instruction of the off-chain fault proof program, which uses the disputed L2 block as the input;</li>\n<li>Then invoke the on-chain MIPS contract to execute the disputed instruction which will determine the winner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above fault proof design has following disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The attacker or defender needs to send many on-chain transactions, resulting in significant gas cost;</li>\n<li>The attacker or defender is susceptible to <a href=\"https://kelvinfichter.com/pages/thoughts/challenge-periods/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">censorship attacks</a>, where transactions become harder to include in the L1 chain due to congestion created by either party.

This forum post is looking for support from the Optimism community for this idea. Even if funded, without active support from the Optimism community any quality standard would simply be an easily ignored set of documents.

Instead, this one question drives 100 unanswered questions. How do you define safe? What version of OP Stack are they running? Is it the latest? Did they make changes on it? Did they test those changes? Should they? Why does the website and docs not address any of these questions?

Despite the grant‚Äôs approval, though, we haven‚Äôt received any project assignments from the Grants Council so far.</p>\n<p>We understand that the Grants Council is currently managing a high workload, which may have contributed to the delay in project assignments.

In December, the Optimism Foundation moved away from Fractal as an identity verification provider and stopped using them for most users and geographies.

Because the data belongs to individuals and not Optimism, they informed us that users need to request data deletion personally. You can email privacy@fractal.id to request data deletion.

A high degree of knowledge is required to understand the OP Stack‚Äôs different components, the impact of protocol development initiatives and the usefulness of tools that support OP chain operators. The hypothesis that round 5 is aiming to test is if experts make better OP allocation decisions on OP Stack contributions compared to non-experts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"research-questions-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#research-questions-1\"></a>Research Questions</h3>\n<p>The Retro Funding 5 governance experiment is designed around the following research questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are there significant differences in how experts versus non-experts vote to allocate resources to technical contributions?</li>\n<li>Are there significant differences between existing badgeholders and new guest voters, both in how they vote to allocate resources and in other characteristics?</li>\n<li>Will sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications improve the voter experience?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"expertise-measurement-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#expertise-measurement-2\"></a><strong>Expertise Measurement</strong></h3>\n<p>Expertise is measured via a score assigned to each individual based on their past Github activity relating to the OP Stack. The GitHub accounts of guest voters are collected in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393\">application flow to become a guest voter</a>. Badgeholders are invited to add their GitHub account to their <a href=\"https://retrofunding.optimism.io\">Optimist Profile</a> in the process of completing Season 6 onboarding. The scores are assigned using an algorithm developed through a collaboration between <a href=\"https://karma3labs.com/\">Karma3Labs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.opensource.observer/\">Open Source Observer</a>, and is based on <a href=\"https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/Lecture4/lecture4.html\">Hubs and Authorities</a>. The algorithm is more complex than <a href=\"https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/eigentrust.pdf\">EigenTrust</a>, because it incorporates two entities: GitHub Repos and GitHub Users, both of which can have ‚Äòtrust‚Äô and give ‚Äòtrust‚Äô to each other. The algorithm used to rank expertise will be open sourced after the conclusion of Round 5 to avoid influencing the experiment.

Random sampling does not guarantee that a particular sample is a perfect representation of the population, but rather allows for valid conclusions to be drawn about the entire population based on the sample. Another way of saying this is that the random sample approximates the full population. This is due to the equal probability of selection. Read more here <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Experimenting with Random Sampling in the Citizens' House</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"treatment-and-control-groups-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#treatment-and-control-groups-5\"></a>Treatment and control groups</h3>\n<p>Retroactive Public Goods Funding is an ongoing experiment, in which the Collective tests and validates different voting designs based on how well they perform at rewarding impact. Previous experiments were largely product iterations based on learnings from previous rounds and hypothesised improvements. For future rounds, experimentation will become more scientific to better understand cause and effect of different design choices. We believe this approach will allow the Collective to develop an industry-leading approach to metagovernance that will strengthen the design of the system over time.  Retro Funding 5 introduces the concept of treatment and control groups. In experimental design, the ‚Äútreatment group‚Äù participates in the experiment, while the ‚Äúcontrol group‚Äù does not (representing the status quo.) This allows hypotheses to be validated or invalidated by comparing the results of the treatment group to the control group. Specifically, taking this approach in Round 5 will allow the Collective to generate actionable insights about the performance of expert voters compared to non-expert voters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"voting-process-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#voting-process-6\"></a>Voting Process</h3>\n<p>An iteration on Retro Funding voting design is the allocation of voters into subgroups. Each subgroup only votes on a specific category of projects (e.g. Ethereum Core Contributions, OP Stack Research &amp; Development, OP Stack Tooling). This has been a popular experimentation request and is one proposed methodology by which the Retro Funding voting process can be scaled to reward more projects. This change can be understood as a product iteration, as its validation largely relies on the change in performance data compared to previous rounds and badgeholder feedback, while there is no control group which would allow for more scientific comparison.</p>\n<p>Process Overview:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Subgroups are established</strong>: voters are (randomly) assigned into subgroups, the subgroups are equal in size and remain representative of the different voter groups.</li>\n<li><strong>Category allocation</strong>: All voters vote on the allocation of OP among the three categories of the round scope.

The Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 &amp; 5, and will propose round sizes for Retro Funding 6 &amp; 7, to be ratified by the Citizens‚Äô House. In the future, this process will gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons. Below you find some considerations that informed the round sizing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Retro Funding 3 benchmark</strong>: In retro round 3, approx 6.5m+ OP were allocated to projects contributing to the OP Stack.</li>\n<li><strong>Rapid development of the OP Stack</strong>: Since round 3, 5+ Protocol upgrades took place that introduced major performance improvements to the OP Stack. Research has accelerated with the deployment of the OP Stack fault proof system on mainnet. Thus, the impact generated by contributions to the OP Stack has increased significantly since October 2023.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"voting-design-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#voting-design-8\"></a><strong>Voting design</strong></h3>\n<p>Retro Funding 5 will sort Badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications, with the hypothesis that voter experience and allocation of rewards are improved, compared to past rounds. For the round, a number of guest voters with expertise relating to the OP Stack will be selected, to test if there are significant differences in how experts versus non-experts vote to allocate rewards to OP Stack contributions.
