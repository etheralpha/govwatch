By improving sensemaking capabilities, we aim to increase meaningful participation in governance and citizen confidence.</p>\n<p>Sensemaking is the process by which individuals and groups create shared meaning and understanding from complex, ambiguous, or uncertain environment in order to facilitate effective decision-making and action.</p>\n<p>Sensemaking is crucial for DAOs due to their decentralized nature, which often involves participants with different cultural backgrounds, motivations, and levels of engagement. Some key aspects of sensemaking that are relevant to DAO governance include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Surfacing and synthesizing diverse perspectives: DAOs need mechanisms to gather input from a wide range of participants and to identify patterns and insights that may not be immediately apparent.</li>\n<li>Facilitating dialogue and deliberation: Sensemaking in DAOs requires creating spaces for participants to exchange ideas, clarify assumptions, and build shared understanding, even if they don‚Äôt always reach full consensus.</li>\n<li>Balancing scale and context: As DAOs grow, they need sensemaking processes that can operate at scale without losing the richness and nuance of individual experiences and local knowledge.</li>\n<li>Navigating power dynamics and reputation: Sensemaking in DAOs must account for the influence of informal power structures, reputation systems, and the potential for exclusion or marginalization of certain voices.</li>\n<li>Enabling distributed action: Effective sensemaking should not only lead to shared understanding but also enable participants to take coordinated action in a decentralized fashion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Implementing advanced sensemaking in Optimism can significantly enhance the quality of deliberation, ultimately contributing to more robust and effective governance processes.</p>\n<p><strong>What is required to execute this Mission Request?</strong><br>\nThe selected teams or individuals will be expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct research on existing sensemaking frameworks and their applicability to DAO governance.</li>\n<li>Develop a sensemaking framework tailored to Optimism‚Äôs governance structure.</li>\n<li>Create a solution to implement this framework, emphasizing:\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing citizen engagement and participation</li>\n<li>Enhancing understanding of complex governance proposals, especially upgrade vetos</li>\n<li>Facilitating informed deliberation (between delegates as well)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Integrate the solution with existing governance processes and tooling.</li>\n<li>Provide comprehensive documentation and educational resources for the community.</li>\n<li>Collaborate with core developer teams to ensure that sensemaking tooling can adapt to evolving governance structures, including potential onchain execution of governance outcomes.</li>\n<li>Maintain and iterate on the solution based on community feedback and observed impact for a minimum of 12 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Milestones:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Research phase completion and framework proposal (2 months)</li>\n<li>Initial tool development and community testing (4 months)</li>\n<li>Full implementation and integration with existing governance processes (3 months)</li>\n<li>Comprehensive documentation and educational resources creation (2 months)</li>\n<li>Ongoing maintenance and iteration based on feedback (12 months from full implementation)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase in votable supply of OP tokens towards the 100M OP target</li>\n<li>Percentage of Citizens who report feeling confident when voting on upgrade vetos</li>\n<li>Increase in the number of active delegates and delegation rate</li>\n<li>Improvement in the quality of governance proposals as measured by community feedback and successful implementation rates</li>\n<li>Reduction in the time to reach consensus on complex governance decisions</li>\n<li>Growth in the number of unique addresses participating in governance discussions and voting</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Impact</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced clarity and understanding of governance issues, particularly complex topics like upgrade vetos</li>\n<li>Improved ability to synthesize diverse perspectives and reach well-informed decisions</li>\n<li>Increased engagement and satisfaction of DAO members with the governance process</li>\n<li>Contribution to the development of a comprehensive framework for mapping decentralization beyond technical properties</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Has anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?</strong> No</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts -

The document sets forth the processes the DAB will follow in fulfilling our <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/zach-obront-developer-advisory-board-operating-budget/8141\">charter</a>, including supporting the grants council, token house, and citizens with evaluating mission requests, mission applications, and protocol upgrades.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Mission Applications</strong></p>\n<p>The DAB will review all technical mission applications per Grant Council request. Our process to perform this duty is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Grants council will provide a list of applications they would like feedback on at least 7 days before the end of each voting cycle.</li>\n<li>DAB Ops Lead will organize the requests in a spreadsheet, which will be shared with the DAB, with three phases of assignment: (1) any applications that interact with the core roadmap will be assigned to one of the reps from OP Labs or Base, (2) DAB Members will have 24 hours to proactively claim applications to review, (3) after 24 hours, Ops Lead will randomly assign the remaining applications such that each application has 2-3 reviewers (depending on the quantity to review).</li>\n<li>Feedback will be provided in the spreadsheet with at least 72 hours left in the cycle, with each application given one of the following indications: yes, no, or veto.</li>\n<li>In the event of a veto, other DAB members will be invited to review. In the case of a unanimous veto, the DAB will veto the mission application. Otherwise, no veto action will be taken.</li>\n<li>After feedback has been provided, the Grants Council will have the option to set up a call to review feedback and discuss details, if they have any questions. All feedback (besides vetos) will be non-binding, and the Grants Council can take it into account as they see fit.</li>\n<li>Feedback will also be shared publicly by the DAB directly on the Mission Request Application in Charmverse, to provide insight to applicants (as well as the opportunity to clarify or improve their application).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2) Protocol Upgrades</strong></p>\n<p>The DAB is responsible for providing plain English summaries of upgrades and blocking upgrades they believe are unsafe (by withholding the approval comment on the forum draft post). Our process to perform this duty is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a new upgrade is posted to the forums, the Upgrade Czar (together with the DAB Lead) will review and write a plain english summary within 72 hours.</li>\n<li>The Upgrade Czar will also share the summary with the DAB, along with their opinion on whether the upgrade is safe.</li>\n<li>If any DAB member believes that approval should be withheld, the DAB will set up a call to discuss, which will end with a vote.</li>\n<li>If a simple majority of DAB members vote ‚Äúno‚Äù, the DAB will withhold the approval comment. The Upgrade Czar (or, in the case that the Upgrade Czar disagrees with the vote, another member) will be responsible for writing up an explanation to share with the community documenting the reasoning and what would be required for the DAB to be comfortable accepting the upgrade.</li>\n<li>In the event that any DAB member abstains and the result is a tie, the DAB Lead will make the final decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3) Reactive Feedback &amp; Support</strong></p>\n<p>The DAB will be available to provide a la carte technical feedback to other councils and board who request it. Our process to perform this duty is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any council or board can reach out to the DAB either by (a) tagging the board on Discord (<span class=\"mention\">@Developer</span> Advisory Board), (b) tagging any member of the board in a forum post or (c) reaching out to any DAB member directly.</li>\n<li>Any requests will be shared with the DAB to allow members to proactively offer to help.</li>\n<li>If no proactive offers are made, the DAB Lead will assign the project to a DAB Member.</li>\n<li>When relevant, the DAB Member who provided the feedback will share a summary of the request and feedback provided on the forum in case the community can benefit from it.</li>\n<li>Examples of this type of work include: feedback on Mission Requests, reviewing milestones on existing grants, requests for brainstorming or code review from OP Labs, helping OP Labs find talent in their hiring process, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4) Discovering New Ways to Support the Collective</strong></p>\n<p>While the processes above are the core responsibilities of the DAB, a part of our Season 6 mission is to discover and expand our ability to support the collective. Our process to perform this duty is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A ‚ÄúDeveloper Advisory Board Feedback‚Äù thread will be created on the Optimism forum where community stakeholders can make requests, give feedback, and share ideas.</li>\n<li>Community calls will be scheduled bimonthly (in July, September and November) to discuss ideas and feedback with the community. Summaries of these calls will be posted on the above thread.</li>\n<li>The DAB will proactively explore best ideas (based on subjective judgment), using the forum thread as the source of truth for all ideas. Each DAB member will be expected to experiment with at least one idea over the course of the season.</li>\n<li>At end of season, the DAB will share a summary on the forum of exactly what experiments were run, the results, which ideas will persist as core responsibilities next season, and the best ideas remaining to be tried in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-s6-internal-operating-procedures/8558\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-s6-internal-operating-procedures/8558","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 02:34:59 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8558"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-s6-internal-operating-procedures/8558.rss","#text":"Developer Advisory Board - S6 Internal Operating Procedures"}},{"title":"[Request for feedback] Building a Farcaster frame as a governance tool to facilitate matchmaking between OP holders and delegates","dc:creator":"Cotabe","category":"Delegates  üèõ","description":"<h2><a name=\"gm-optimists-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#gm-optimists-1\"></a>GM Optimists!</h2>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We are building a Farcaster frame to help OP token holders seamlessly find an ideal match to delegate their OP.</p>\n<p>We are a small team supported by Raid Guild to build this MVP for Optimism to help increase the delegated supply of OP to active delegates and foster deeper alignment between delegates and delegators. We also want to bring Raid Guild closer to the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We are taking inspiration from Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) to create a Delegate Match Application (DMA) for Optimism. Voting Advice Applications are online tools designed to help voters identify which political parties or candidates most closely align with their personal views and preferences.

The outcome is usually a percentage score or a list showing which parties or candidates the user aligns with most closely, thus aiding in making informed voting decisions.</p>\n<p>VAAs have been widely used across Europe. By providing voters with tools to easily compare their own policy preferences to those of various parties, VAAs have significantly improved electoral participation and the quality of democratic governance.</p>\n<p>We aim to adapt this model and build this application for the Optimism community in the open to make a more user-centric MVP.

To date most capital has remained on L1 for security reasons; L2s are, to many, way too unproven to test the many risks bridging onto an L2 entails.</p>\n<p>I believe that when this body of capital is ready to migrate, much of it is going to move to the L2 that presents significant promise and safety. And I think most of that capital moves only once. So we need to be that L2.</p>\n<p>Optimism is now getting to a place where we can credibly attract much of this Mainnet capital. Fault proofs are here, crosschain specs are taking shape, we have major players on our side. I think it‚Äôs now time to start making moves to attract this capital.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the idea here is <em>not</em> simply to provide incentives to pull capital over.

We can offer this kind of model.</p>\n<p>Take a highly promising project led by a handful of independent builders. They have some funds but not much‚Äîand, more importantly, they lack time and other resources to build out their project beyond what they are individually capable of managing.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs a lot they have to take care of or fund: audits, RPC costs, deployment costs, yes, but also business formation; legal preparation; payroll; fundraising. If they are deploying a token, there‚Äôs liquidity, treasury management, regulatory concerns, etc. The list goes on, but what unites these areas is that they are essential to new projects and often prohibitively resource-consuming. Audits, for example, are essential and expensive enough that many projects turn to fundraising specifically to afford them.</p>\n<p>There are also business concerns that could, under the right circumstances, be addressed as part of this Mission: new venture strategy; business development; hiring; marketing, etc. Our bar is especially high for service providers in this sphere; there are many who claim to offer these services, but few can at the level we‚Äôd hope to be able to offer, which is at the top of our industry. It is of course also very difficult for a DAO to oversee this kind of service.</p>\n<p>All of this is to say that proposals should consider, in concrete terms: who is the builder we‚Äôre targeting with our offer? How would our in-kind support help this kind of builder? What about this service we are offering is important or helpful enough for this builder to come deploy on Optimism or consider Optimism the best place to build? Do we have evidence that many new projects need help with this service? And, finally: are we the demonstrably the best at what we do?</p>\n<p><strong>What is required to execute this Mission Request?</strong></p>\n<p>Applicants should provide a commitment to providing some high-quality service in exchange for granted OP.

But while this document contained just a short list of fairly specific things to look for (‚ÄúWhat to review projects on‚Äù), reviewers are also expected to ensure that applications comply with the general application rules, and it is my impression that this left quite a bit of room for subjective interpretation - and uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Some specific points around which there seemed to be ambiguity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Github repo age.</strong> The guidelines say: ‚ÄúDoes the repo hold no code or is it newly created, raising a red flag?‚Äù What is a red flag? A warning signal? A disqualification?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unverified contracts.</strong> Reviewers are being asked to verify that the applicant has ‚Äúmade their contract code available in a public Github repo‚Äù. What happens when a contract shows as unverified on e.g. optimistic etherscan? How would a reviewer know if the deployed contract corresponds to the code in the Github repo?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>OSO slug.</strong> This was arguably the most <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1163942190104461444/1251355792846880949\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">mysterious</a> topic in the review process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Downstream contracts.</strong> During the review process, it surfaced that the automatic verification performed by OSO considered <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1163942190104461444/1255124780906971228\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">anything downstream</a> of a project‚Äôs stated deployer as in scope.

And they need to know exactly <em>what they need to look for</em>.</p>\n<p>This requires the reviewers to <em>understand the automatic verification process clearly</em>, such that they know what they can safely ignore.</p>\n<p>Especially in a round like this with so much emphasis on objectivity and quantitative metrics, it seems important that eg. overlapping impact, transaction counts and transaction timing should be automatically checked ‚Ä¶and possibly subjected to random sample tests by appointed badgeholders with the necessary skillset.</p>\n<p>Other badgeholders could be asked to notify these specialists in case of doubt, but abstain from rejecting applications based on their own tests.</p>\n<p>I think more clarity will lead to more consistency and delegation of responsibility. Feedback and questions from the human reviewers can be used to inform the automatic process - and the automatic process can apply the learnings consistently.</p>\n<p><strong>Reviewer tooling</strong></p>\n<p>Suggestions for improvement of the Charmverse UI that was used in the review process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Filtering.</strong> Reviewers absolutely need to be able to easily see which projects are assigned to them and the current status of these projects. The same is true for appeals reviewers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Notifications.</strong> It would be awesome if there was some kind of automatic notification in case a reviewer has missed a review, and also whenever new projects are assigned to a person.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rejection reasons.</strong> We need the option to reject an application due to missing or incomplete information. It does not feel good to choose ‚Äòspam‚Äô or ‚Äòdeceiving badgeholders‚Äô in cases where an application is simply incomplete for reasons that the reviewer can‚Äôt know.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reviewer notes.</strong> The current interface offers 3 kinds of free text comments: a) The almost invisible ‚Äòreviewer notes‚Äô in the top right corner; b) the public comments on the bottom of the screen; and c) the explanation attatched to rejections. I think the reviewer notes are of little use at this point, and it might be better to remove them completely to avoid confusion. It would be nice to have the option of also offering an explanation when you accept an application. <em>The public notes on the bottom of the page actually proved quite useful in one or two cases where an applicant pitched in and explained something.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Application links.</strong> Links to project website, Github, contracts etc. really should be shown as links and not just as text. Having to copy-paste these things into new browser tabs every time very, very quickly grows tiresome!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Changing votes.</strong> The flow around a reviewer changing his opinion could be better.
