Selecting the right ecosystem projects to fund, which tokens to list in a lending market, and the outcome of a protocol fee switch are valuable propositions that affect all community stakeholders. Once the combined value at stake reaches a critical mass, the founding team is unable to make decisions by themselves without running the risk of centralization. As a result, many aspects of the decentralized protocol model make governance unavoidable.</p>\n<p>But token voting as a mechanism for decentralized governance has introduced its own <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">set of problems</a>. An inherent conflict of interest arises when voting power is disproportionately concentrated among a small group of wealthy token holders. As an example, venture funds or whales involved in external projects might be incentivized to pursue agendas that benefit their broader portfolio at the expense of the protocol‚Äôs long-term success. In addition, the over-reliance on token voting not only entrenches the power of a wealthy few but also undermines the collective action taken by smaller stakeholders. Smaller delegates within the Optimism ecosystem often <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2830772/4724839/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">refrain from voting</a> due to their individual decisions ‚Äúnot mattering much‚Äù. The situation creates a paradox where the promise of decentralization leads to a quasi-centralization of power and an absence of true preferences.</p>\n<p>Doxamarket aims to address these gaps by offering a novel approach to incentivize voter participation and mitigate the inefficiencies associated with governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"information-markets-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#information-markets-2\"></a>Information Markets</h2>\n<p>Onchain information markets have gained immense popularity recently with the rise of <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Polymarket</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1775542217307791366\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">liquidity-backed Kalshi</a>. Their success confirms the financial value that assigning probabilities to future outcomes and sub outcomes can generate. Most importantly, we believe information markets carry an <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/04/01/dc.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">element of chaos</a> that could be directly applied to form consensus in decentralized governance. The crypto space will always prefer chaotic and decisive action over stasis debates between two protocol researchers. Integrating information markets into the onchain decision-making process introduces a novel way to financially incentivize token-voting, increase voter participation, and force true preferences from broader ecosystem participants.</p>\n<p>For the implementation of this idea, Doxamarket (formerly BetCaster) has <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-4085199193924518\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">received a grant of 50,000 OP</a> from Optimism‚Äôs Mission Request Round 1.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"didomi-as-doxamarkets-first-experiment-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#didomi-as-doxamarkets-first-experiment-3\"></a>Didomi as Doxamarket‚Äôs First Experiment</h2>\n<p>As the first experimental information market on Doxa, Didomi will grant users the ability to speculate $DEGEN on the winners of Optimism‚Äôs <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/proposals\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mission Request Round 2</a>. <strong>Didomi will open today as a multi-option contract market within Farcaster frames and will close on April 24th 7pm UTC.</strong> The market close is scheduled one day before the OP grant council releases final scores.

The theory gained some popularity in the 90‚Äôs but lost momentum due to the difficulty of agreeing on what actually constitutes a meme and how to measure cultural information.</p>\n<p>Internet memes define a structure and are easily tracked. <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/about\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Know Your Memes</a> has been doing so since 2008 in a format similar to wikipedia. Internet memes don‚Äôt represent complete cultures of course, but it‚Äôs a significant step for the theory.</p>\n<p>It seems like the next logical step in this progression is to create an app that allows memes to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be created, mutated, and replicated by groups</li>\n<li>Form links to incubate and grow into complex cultures</li>\n<li>Undergo selection processes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We could probably stop here and see some interesting results, but I think we can go a step further to clean the cultural slate and initiate a Cambrian Explosion of memetic activity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One human = one account at the gates to keep out bots and sybils</li>\n<li>Anonymizing users at the gates removes the influence of previous cultural links (friends, family, etc) on that user‚Äôs input. They still hold that cultural information in their minds, but the social pressure of identity and conformity is removed while in the app, so they are free to try on new hats and express themselves authentically.\n<ul>\n<li>As memes are co-created and cultures are formed, anonymous users can offer to share (or revoke) pieces of information with those they have interacted with, creating high value social data. Example: two parties offer to share info with a group they just made a dope meme with; the exchange is made and a new social connection is formed, anchored within a culture.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Memes can be minted to allow individuals to build their own cultural narratives.

Agora is the governance software company contributing to the Optimism token house governor and its frontend at <a href=\"http://vote.optimism.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vote.optimism.io</a>. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<p>This is a 1 line update to the governance smart contract of the token house that will allow the small subset of voters who have received their voting power from advanced delegation (a feature introduced in the last governor update) to vote by signing one transaction instead of two.</p>\n<p>If this vote passes, the Optimism foundation will upgrade governor contract to the new implementation Agora deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n<p>As part of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/64\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the v2 upgrade of the token house</a> we shipped in December, we enabled a new feature called ‚Äúadvanced delegation‚Äù, which allows token holders to delegate their voting power to multiple delegates without splitting their balance. This facilitates governance participation for large funds, partners and the foundation, who have complex token storage requirements. One side effect of feature is that voters who received advanced delegation would need to sign two transactions to vote.</p>\n<p>When we shipped this feature, we thought having two transactions would be a good thing, to easily show users when they voted from each of their voting powers: standard delegation power and advanced delegation power.</p>\n<p>After getting feedback from a small group of ~50 voters who‚Äôve received votes via this feature, it was clear that this was a bad idea. As a consequence, we have paused the further rollout of this feature and refactored the contract to allow for a vote with both standard and advanced delegation in one transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact to voters:</strong></p>\n<p>Delegates with advanced voting power will have a better user experience and will sign only 1 transaction.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#specifications-3\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"contract-changed-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#contract-changed-4\"></a>Contract Changed</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/voteagora/governor/pull/22/files\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism Governor</a> would be changed as part of this upgrade.

We‚Äôve piloted the proof with Round 3. This post intends to explain the mechanics of the audit and also ask for feedback from the Optimism community.</p>\n<p><strong>The TLDR;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Retroactive Funding process and algorithm ideally improves with each round via governance feedback.</li>\n<li>We‚Äôve essentially audited RetroPGF Round 3. We did so through a cryptographic proof, and anyone can verify it using this <a href=\"https://retrofunding.ezkl.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">webapp</a>.</li>\n<li>This paves the way for an end-to-end automated process with private voting, checks and balances on the allocation algorithm, and smart contract enabled allocation delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For stakeholders, this audit means many things:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For badgeholders, that your vote was fairly counted</li>\n<li>For recipients, that your allocation was fairly calculated</li>\n<li>For everyone else, the results actually correspond with the Optimism governance forums</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"an-iterative-approach-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#an-iterative-approach-1\"></a>An iterative approach</h3>\n<p>As this forum is aware, a core tenet of the Optimism community is agile iteration. That means the design of Round 3 looks much different from that of Round 1. We see that Round 3 heavily indexes on the impact evaluation framework, and as a both qualitative and quantitative measure, heavily relies on the judgement of voters (badgeholders).</p>\n<p>Votes are currently fed through an allocation algorithm, published publicly by the Optimism team. The team announces the algorithm‚Äôs results at the conclusion of a round, as well as learnings to iterate upon for the next rounds.</p>\n<p>The trickiest bit has always been effectively measuring impact. Reliance on quantitative metrics risks exclusion. Reliance of qualitative feedback risks human biases among other coordination challenges. And there are many more tradeoffs beyond these. Consequently, the algorithm and overarching design continues to evolve and evoke discussion. <strong>Ideally, we can check the process and algorithm with each new iteration.</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-integrity-challenge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#the-integrity-challenge-2\"></a>The integrity challenge</h3>\n<p>One of the main tradeoffs for Retroactive Funding is related to privacy.</p>\n<p>For such a large pool of OP rewards, transparency is important. We want to ensure results are aligned with previous governance decisions. More importantly, this recognizes that many projects depend on the allocation for sustainability.</p>\n<p>However, badgeholder votes are private in Retroactive Funding. A longstanding feature of voting systems, this allows voters to express their true preferences without fear of retaliation, coercion, or pressure from others. It makes it difficult to execute vote buying, and encourages honest participation.</p>\n<p><strong>This presents a key challenge</strong>: verifying that allocation outcomes are truly based on badgeholder votes. Even though the allocation algorithm is public (and we can check that it accurately codifies forum promises), we can‚Äôt run a check without the input data. In the worst case, we can‚Äôt guarantee that the provided allocation algorithm was even used or that all votes were counted.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-zero-knowledge-solution-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#the-zero-knowledge-solution-3\"></a>The zero knowledge solution</h3>\n<p>Making this process transparent requires both a proof that legitimate votes were counted and that the allocation algorithm was run as intended, whilst keeping <em>the votes themselves private.</em> This is exactly the sort of proof zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography was designed to enable ‚Äî and why we‚Äôre so excited to showcase this project as a hallmark use of the technology.</p>\n<p>There are two places we apply ZKP:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-1-verifying-the-voting-process-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-1-verifying-the-voting-process-4\"></a>1. Verifying the voting process</h4>\n<p>The first circuit verifies that the cast ballots are legitimate, and that all legitimate ballots are counted. Ballots are legitimate if signed by a badgeholder from the public whitelist.</p>\n<p><strong>The details:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check the ballot signatures against the whitelist.</li>\n<li>For each project, create a hash of all its legitimate ballots. This is denoted as Hash A.</li>\n<li>Aggregate the hashes to generate an overall proof. This proof means that across all projects, all legitimate votes were counted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>This results in Proof A.</strong></p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-checking-the-allocation-algorithm-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-2-checking-the-allocation-algorithm-5\"></a>2. Checking the allocation algorithm</h4>\n<p>The second circuit verifies the usage of the allocation algorithm.</p>\n<p>The details:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For each project, we repeat steps 1 and 2 of the first circuit. This, however, is denoted by Hash B. We will check that Hash A = Hash B out of circuit.</li>\n<li>Generate a proof over the allocation algorithm. The algorithm takes in a ballot table as input, and outputs an allocation table. We only need one proof of the whole algorithm.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The results in Proof B.</strong></p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-3-combining-the-proofs-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-3-combining-the-proofs-6\"></a>3. Combining the proofs</h4>\n<p>Since we generate the proofs separately, we want to link them together cryptographically. This ensures there is not tampering of votes in between proofs. We link them by checking that the hashes of legitimate votes, Hash A and Hash B, are the same. This is the same hash you see on the platform, just in QR form.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-4-verifying-a-projects-allocation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-4-verifying-a-projects-allocation-7\"></a>4. Verifying a project‚Äôs allocation</h4>\n<p>This is where you come in! When you press <strong>verify</strong>, you check the allocation was correct for a given project.</p>\n<p>Even though the proofs are for <em>all projects,</em> each proof has a set of public variables particular to a given project. In Proof A this is the hash of the votes (Hash A), in Proof B this is the hash of the votes (Hash B) <em>and</em> the allocation amount for a given project.</p>\n<p>If we change any of those variables, we break verification <em>for a particular project</em>. Try it yourself!</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-5-verifying-the-entire-retropgf-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-5-verifying-the-entire-retropgf-8\"></a>5. Verifying the entire RetroPGF</h4>\n<p>It‚Äôs also possible to verify the entire RetroPGF round at once. You can do so by pressing ‚Äúverify‚Äù on the landing page.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"everyones-verification-matters-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#everyones-verification-matters-9\"></a>Everyone‚Äôs verification matters</h3>\n<p>If you‚Äôre neither a badgeholder nor a recipient, why hit the verify button? Simply put, verifying the results of the round contributes to the security and legitimacy of the process.</p>\n<p><strong>Here‚Äôs the idea</strong>: Blockchains have both social consensus (which fork is the main one, which client should be run, etc.) and computational consensus. A smart contract can enforce a set of rules, but humans decide which copy of the smart contract is the canonical one. Election workers count ballots, but citizens recognize the result. Similarly, by verifying the RetroPGF results for one or more projects, you help solidify the social consensus around the legitimacy of the vote. You are an election observer, contributing to a successful audit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByUUpr4yR.jpg\" alt=\"photo_2024-03-27_19-22-21\" width=\"690\" height=\"360\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"implementation-details-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#implementation-details-10\"></a>Implementation details</h3>\n<p>You can find the code for this on our <a href=\"https://blog.ezkl.xyz/post/zkrpgf/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">blog</a>. We briefly discuss the details for verification of the allocation algorithm.</p>\n<p>Optimism‚Äôs allocation algorithm was written in Python, which made the EZKL python library a natural fit for in-program conversion of the data science into zero-knowledge proofs. You‚Äôll also notice that OP allocation votes are cast with floating point amounts ‚Äî this meant a very low tolerance for imprecision.</p>\n<p>EZKL already optimizes heavily for precision given the frequency of nonlinear operations (reciprocals, softmax, etc.) in data science and machine learning models. However, we also made substantial improvements to the core engine, and specifically how we perform lookups, in order to retain proof size while increasing numerical accuracy. Incidentally, proving performance for other models like random forests and transformers improved significantly (sometimes over 90%). A win-win!</p>\n<p>There are a few more important details, specifically around signature verification and the proving system. This may require some background in cryptography, so we omit a full discussion here. However, this also is available on our blog.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#next-steps-11\"></a>Next steps</h3>\n<p>This is just the first step in auditing and automating the Retroactive Funding process. In the future, it is possible to create more comprehensive systems and even automate the process end-to-end. This may look something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Algorithm implemented and formally verified against specifications in governance forums</li>\n<li>Votes checked against whitelist of badgeholders via a proof of legitimacy</li>\n<li>Upon verification, votes run through the allocation algorithm</li>\n<li>Final allocation checked via a proof of calculation</li>\n<li>Upon final verification, distribution of funds automatically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This also makes it easier to reflect and analyze voter behavior without revealing information about any one badgeholder ‚Äî facilitating incremental improvement for the next round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"open-questions-call-for-feedback-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#open-questions-call-for-feedback-12\"></a>Open questions &amp; call for feedback</h3>\n<p>We would be grateful for any feedback on the platform, and will aim to implement improvements for future rounds. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Were you more interested in the verification of the whole RetroPGF or focus on particular projects?</li>\n<li>Did you find features like the ability to manipulate the hash or allocation amount interesting? Did they make the meaning of the proof more clear?</li>\n<li>Do you feel comfortable with the implementation, or should we provide further details?</li>\n<li>Are there additional aspects of the voting and allocation process where you would like to see this applied? For example:\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying data analysis on votes/results</li>\n<li>Verifying algorithms to select badgeholders or legitimate voters</li>\n<li>Verifying the weight / inclusion of certain impact metrics</li>\n<li>And any other ideas you may have!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We look forward to feedback and further discussion!</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/proving-the-retropgf-results/7916\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/proving-the-retropgf-results/7916","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Apr 2024 16:46:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-7916"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/proving-the-retropgf-results/7916.rss","#text":"Proving the RetroPGF Results"}},{"title":"MrCrypto Arabic Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"mrcrypto","category":"Delegate Updates","description":"<p>Hello all!</p>\n<p>We‚Äôre thrilled to initiate this dialogue as Delegates within Optimism‚Äôs Governance framework.

One area that could be further improved is liquidity management, particularly for assets with interest-bearing features, such as sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>\n<p>sDAI is a synthetic stablecoin that aims to track the price of DAI. However, its price can experience periods of volatility due to factors such as market conditions, changes in the underlying collateral, demand for the asset, and its <strong>interest-bearing</strong> nature. This volatility can make it challenging for liquidity providers to maintain a healthy balance of USDC (or other stablecoins) and sDAI in their pools.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n<p>I propose an automated liquidity management (ALM) system for Velodrome that would use a dynamic range to adjust the ratio of USDC to sDAI in liquidity pools based on the interest rate of sDAI. The range would increase gradually as the price/interest rate of sDAI increases, helping to protect liquidity providers from impermanent loss and capturing the additional yield generated by sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed ALM system would offer several benefits, including:</p>\n<p>Reduced impermanent loss: The dynamic range would help to reduce impermanent loss for liquidity providers, as it would adjust the pool‚Äôs composition to account for changes in the volatility, price, or interest rate of sDAI.</p>\n<p>Increased capital efficiency: The system would allow liquidity providers to make better use of their capital by automatically adjusting the pool‚Äôs composition.</p>\n<p>Improved liquidity: The system would help to improve liquidity for sDAI, making it easier for traders to buy and sell the asset.</p>\n<p>Captured yield: The system would allow liquidity providers to capture the additional yield generated by sDAI, increasing their overall returns.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>The ALM system could be implemented using a smart contract that would monitor the price, volatility, and interest rate of sDAI and adjust the pool‚Äôs composition accordingly. The smart contract would need to be carefully designed and audited to ensure its security and reliability.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>An automated liquidity management system with an increasing range would be a valuable addition to Velodrome. It would help to reduce impermanent loss for liquidity providers, increase capital efficiency, improve liquidity for sDAI, and allow liquidity providers to capture the additional yield generated by sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Details</strong></p>\n<p>The following are some additional details about the proposed ALM system:</p>\n<p>The range would be calculated using a formula that takes into account the price, volatility, interest rate, and other relevant factors of sDAI.</p>\n<p>The range would be updated periodically, such as every hour or every day.</p>\n<p>Liquidity providers would be able to choose whether or not to participate in the ALM system.</p>\n<p>The ALM system would be open source and auditable.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>This proposal is still under development, and I am open to feedback and suggestions.

None.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team? This seems to be the ideal team.

Low technical risk here, lots of prior art for this kind of work and the solution proposed seems to follow it well. The marketplace seems as though it could be complex but could also be very cool. The milestones given are excellent and well paced. I am excited to see this come to fruition and approve and recommend this applicant.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the proposed solution address the DMR? Yes, the proposed solution addresses the DMR.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible? I believe the proposal is <em>partially</em> feasible. I feel that the most valuable part of this proposal is high-quality open source tooling for creating, operating, and upgrading an OP Stack chain without the need for a RaaS provider. Creating this tooling and making it amazing will set the foundation for a decentralized RaaS in the future. Additionally, there are technical limitations on the protocol that make a truly decentralized RaaS less feasible at the moment. By removing the marketplace aspect of this proposal and doubling down on the high-quality tooling, I believe this work would be much more successful long term.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? Not strictly, see comment above.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team? Unsure. I cannot find any evidence that this team has the understanding of the OP Stack or the experience with cloud infrastructure required to deliver this project. I also cannot find any clear evidence to the contrary.</li>\n<li>Milestone feedback?

However, I am concerned that this project would conflict with existing planned work for the fault proof. Other changes like updates to the fault proof required to support Superchain interoperability and support for multiple proof types likely take precedence over this work. Given the security-critical nature of this code path, the proposed changes would likely have to involve engineers from OP Labs whose time would probably consumed by other projects. It is possible that the fault proof protocol changes before this proposal can be accepted into the protocol.<br>\nIt is additionally worth noting that the underlying concern that the proposal is addressing has not been sufficiently analyzed. Although the proposal does increase the cost of censorship, the community currently lacks the research to demonstrate that the censorship risk posed by the current 40-transaction model is unacceptable for Stage 2.<br>\nGiven the above, I would recommend against carrying out this proposal not on technical merits but on strategic ones. I‚Äôm mostly worried that the team will spend time on this project and the end result will not be included in the final protocol. Instead, I would encourage the team to submit an alternative proposal that focuses on carrying out the underlying research to demonstrate the censorship risk relative to the number of transactions required as part of the game. Specifically, it would be valuable to understand the exact cost and feasibility of an attacker to execute a censorship attack as the number of transactions required as part of the proof increases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 2:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I am excited to see the proposal. I think that it would be high leverage to work on and it‚Äôs completion would really improve the efforts to decentralized the OP stack. The team is strong with a good track record and the proposal is well thought out. I think the collection of individuals who have a strong understanding of the dispute game and fault proofs is small and given me personal expertise i believe this applicant has a strong understanding. I think the requested amount is modest and more than reasonable. I believe that stage two decentralization for for the OP stack and that improvements to the dispute game (currently bisection) should be a priority and I endorse this proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 3:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I am a fan of any kind of meaningful performance improvement, especially if it‚Äôs an introduction of new algorithm for the dispute game.

Yes. This moves the OP Stack towards one of its main goals of decentralized fault proving. One could argue that this is less of a research project as it has concrete produce outputs, but it probably fits best of any of the DMRs.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible? Yes, although more research is needed to understand if their prover is fast enough to accomplish the goals.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? No obvious ones other than the open question of whether their prover is fast enough to support this use case. While they do include some speedups regarding witness generation, it would be nice to see an estimated trace length for proving a block and some estimate of how long it would take to prove said trace based on smaller benchmarks.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team? Yes. This team includes Delphius, who is working on SNARK provers which is the main relevant are of technical expertise required.</li>\n<li>Milestone feedback? Looks good.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 2</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the proposed solution address the DMR?</li>\n<li>Yes, it contributes to technical decentralization by adding another path by which to add redundancy to a critical part of the OP Stack: the fault proof.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible?</li>\n<li>Yes.

Yes. While I think it‚Äôs unlikely to be used by too many users on established chains, it seems like a very useful piece of developer tooling for the ecosystem to have.

No.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team? Yes. This project requires a mix of EVM knowledge and front end skills.

All look good to me.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I believe that this proposal could certainly be constructive to the ecosystem at large, as chain visibility is high leverage. However i do not believe that this is a particular novel proposal but non the less diversity and competition in explorers is good and worth supporting in my opinion. I think that the requested amount here is less modest proportional to the impact (if i had to balance the amounts i would switch the allocation amounts with this and the multi-section dispute). All in all i also endorse this Proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work review: Solid prior work on StarkNet explorer (but not public yet it seems). Team has delivered projects in the past.</li>\n<li>Proposed Solution: Yes it addresses the DMR. I think as superchain vision is realized there will be way more OP Stack L2s that won‚Äôt receive support from Etherscan and can‚Äôt pay for an integration. And blockscout is generally too much of a departure from normal user flows and that degrades the UX. So going with a Etherscan style UI is great. The team should checkout Otterscan. Tying together the superchain on top of a familiar UX is great.</li>\n<li>Milestones could be better by adding expected time frames (work weeks/dates).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-to-vote-open-source-op-stack-developer-tooling/7417\">PermaDA: Utilizing Arweave as a low-cost permanent data availability solution</a></p>\n<p>Application: <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/permada-utilizing-arweave-as-a-low-cost-permanent-data-availability-solution-6707330937293612\" class=\"inline-onebox\">CharmVerse - the all-in-one web3 space</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the proposed solution address the DMR? Yes, the application suggests open sourcing an application to easily integrate Arweave as a DA for OP Stack chains, which could certainly help OP Stack devs.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible? As far as I can tell, the approach is feasible.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? The explanation of the discrete steps seems a little vague. The broad strokes make sense, but seems like they have not yet thought too much about the exact details or precise work that will go into it.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team? They certainly seem to have knowledge of Arweave, and they have released 4EVER-Raas based on OP stack, but something in the write up makes me feel a bit iffy about whether they will succeed at this.</li>\n<li>Milestone feedback? The milestones are ok but dates are off (some are in the past) and descriptions are not that detailed. It‚Äôs all fine, just feels a little sloppy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the proposed solution address the DMR? Mostly. One could argue that this isn‚Äôt tooling and is instead infrastructure, but I think it aligns closely enough and is worthwhile enough project to include.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible? Yes.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? Not really. The only additional feature that may be worth adding is some tooling for verifying the correctness of a blob against an Ethereum node. This should be feasible as one can take the stored data, compute the KZG commitment, and check that it is equal to the commitment stored permanently by Ethereum.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team? Yes. They have relevant experience.</li>\n<li>Milestone feedback? Looks ok.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the proposed solution address the DMR?</li>\n<li>Yes.

The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, and facilitated by the Foundation, based on community feedback.

In scoping retro rounds in 2024, the Foundation aimed to identify the types of contributions which are most impactful to the Collective and where Retro Funding is best suited to support. The detailed scope of each retro round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"sizing-retro-rounds-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#sizing-retro-rounds-3\"></a><strong>Sizing retro rounds</strong></h3>\n<p>The aim for sizing round rewards is to provide OP rewards which accurately reflect the impact within the scope of a retro round and provide a strong incentive for contributing to the Collective. The amount of rewards for each round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.<br>\nThe Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 &amp; 5, and will proposes round sizes for Retro Funding 6 &amp; 7 to be ratified by the Citizens‚Äô House. In the future, the goal for this process will be to gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"citizen-workload-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#citizen-workload-4\"></a><strong>Citizen workload</strong></h3>\n<p>While the number of retro rounds is increasing, the goal is for individual citizen workload to not increase and possibly be reduced. In previous retro rounds, citizens‚Äô provided feedback on the time intensive labor of participating and shared concerns that increasing the number of rounds will increase the required time commitment of individual citizens. Retro Funding is actively exploring designs &amp; experiments which enable an increase in the number of rounds while not impacting individual citizens workload.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"more-rounds-more-experiments-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#more-rounds-more-experiments-5\"></a>More rounds, more experiments</h2>\n<p>Running multiple types of rounds allows us to run different experiments on the best ways to scale and improve Retro Funding.

Not all impact is the same, and different types of impact are best measured via different approaches. Below you find a summary of the framework which the Foundation applies to explore appropriate approaches to measuring different types of impact.</p>\n<p>Contributions to Optimism can be categorized as either upstream or downstream of Optimism blockspace.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upstream contributions improve Optimism itself, this includes improvements to the OP Stack and Optimism Governance</li>\n<li>Downstream contributions improve the experience of Optimism users, such as builders and consumers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fFEmdxO2Ej1MuutFh7MR4SXftu5.png?dl=1\" title=\"Untitled\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_690x105.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" data-base62-sha1=\"fFEmdxO2Ej1MuutFh7MR4SXftu5\" width=\"690\" height=\"105\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_690x105.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_1035x157.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_1380x210.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F2F2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"upstream-impact-is-measured-via-the-aggregate-utility-of-optimism-users-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#upstream-impact-is-measured-via-the-aggregate-utility-of-optimism-users-7\"></a>Upstream impact is measured via the aggregate utility of Optimism users</h4>\n<p>To evaluate impact which is upstream, we need to understand how the contribution has increased the aggregate utility of all users of the Optimism Platform.

E.g., how has the contribution benefited builders and consumers?<br>\nGathering and analysing these signals presents significant challenges, such as sybil resistance and vanity metrics.<br>\nExample: see <a href=\"https://ccerv1.github.io/downstream_impact/?mode=fees\">downstream impact</a>, a metric in which dev libraries are evaluated based on the output of the builders on Optimism which use them</p>\n<p>Upcoming Retro Funding experiments are designed to best address the different nature of upstream and downstream impact:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"experiment-1-impact-juries-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#experiment-1-impact-juries-9\"></a>Experiment 1: Impact Juries <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_judge.png?v=12\" title=\":man_judge:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":man_judge:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thesis <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1:</span></strong> By sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications, impact measurement is improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Thesis <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span></strong>: Sortition, the selection of public jurors by using a random representative sample, allows us to effectively scale citizenship</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Retro Funding 3, citizens <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA\">requested a more focused evaluation experience</a>.

The first step towards this vision was <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-base-to-optimism-governance/6689\">welcoming Base to the Collective</a>. In addition to being an important contributor to the Collective, Base has set the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/manifesto-how-base-will-participate-in-optimism-governance/7361\">standard</a> for active governance participation among OP Chains.</p>\n<p>In 2024, we plan to bring 5-10 more OP Chains into the Collective increasing the number of high impact contributors building the Superchain. For example, <a href=\"https://x.com/fraxfinance/status/1755386510474347002?s=20\">Frax</a> is an early committer to the Superchain vision and we expect to welcome many more such OP Chains over the coming months.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"onboarding-op-chains-to-governance-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#onboarding-op-chains-to-governance-2\"></a>Onboarding OP Chains to Governance</h3>\n<p>Increasing the number of OP Chains not only benefits the ecosystem but further decentralizes the core protocol and governance system by adding additional, high impact contributors. Importantly, OP Chains provide particularly relevant insight into Protocol Upgrades, a core responsibility of the Token House. Given the <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY\">design</a> of Optimism governance, which supports capture resistance and effective resource allocation, the addition of OP Chains should strengthen the overall governance system.</p>\n<p>To support this goal, it is likely that new OP Chains receive grants from the <a href=\"https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/\">Ecosystem Fund</a> to incentivize long term alignment with the ecosystem and active participation in Optimism Governance. It‚Äôs important that OP Chains have skin in the game and participate in the governance system to which they‚Äôve entrusted the future of their chains. That said, an important property of our governance system is that no one stakeholder gain unilateral decision-making power. As with Base, the Foundation is taking a thoughtful approach to aligning incentives as we facilitate the onboarding of OP Chains as active participants in Optimism Governance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"encouraging-aligned-participation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#encouraging-aligned-participation-3\"></a>Encouraging Aligned Participation</h3>\n<p>Some proactive measures include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directing initial governance participation to occur through the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889\">Chain Delegation Program</a>, which includes important accountability mechanisms and will help new Chains build a track record of participation before unlocking voting power through their grants. A proposal to adjust and/or extend this program to better support this goal may be put forward to the Token House in the upcoming Reflection Period.</li>\n<li>Voting caps, based on % of votable supply, may be applied when appropriate. These caps may consider planned voting participation and delegation.</li>\n<li>The Foundation will recommend OP Chains delegate all or a portion of their voting power.</li>\n<li>In instances in which an OP Chain plans to vote directly, the Foundation will provide onboarding support to promote active participation.</li>\n<li>Base serves as an example of what <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-base-will-participate-in-optimism-governance/6690\">active participation</a> can look like. All OP Chains will be strongly encouraged to take community feedback, attend community calls, and publish voting rationale and/or delegation frameworks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, it‚Äôs important to ensure all governance participants remain accountable to the Collective.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All OP Chain delegates should uphold <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241\">Optimist Expectations</a> and will be subject to the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751\">Code of Conduct</a> and <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728\">Rules of Engagement</a>, along with all other voters</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889\">Anticapture Commission</a> was established in Season 5 to monitor the Token House for signs of capture and alert the Citizens‚Äô House, the ultimate check on imbalances in the Token House, to any concerns</li>\n<li>Token grants do not confer any rights to participate in the Citizens‚Äô House</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>2024 will be an exciting year for the Superchain and Optimism governance!

However, what has also been <em>at least</em> equally as frequent an occurrence. Of course I could understand some people‚Äôs feelings to be in line with ‚Äúit‚Äôs a blessing and a curse‚Äù mindset, but I personally feel like we can and should be holding ourselves, and this community, to a <strong>much</strong> higher standard.</p>\n<p>It has become all too often that tokens launching on Ethereum/Optimism-based chains (ETH/OP going forward), and other chains, are done so with the secret intent of being nothing more than a rugpull or similar scam. If we look into <em>why</em> this is, I think we end up coming to the revelation that it is foundationally based on the fact that creating a token on this chain is both extremely cheap and extremely easy‚Äìperhaps even more so than most other chains, resulting in a higher than average concentration of scam tokens.<br>\nIn fact, I personally just spent the past 48 hours experiencing this firsthand. I have spent this entire time‚Äìsince the virality of DOGE‚Äìpurposely refusing to invest in utility-less ‚Äúmemecoins‚Äù. However, I chose to change course a few days ago, just as an experiment, and invested the most amount of money I have ever invested in that short of a period. The result was <strong>not</strong> attractive‚Äìfor me, or for ETH/OP as a community. After having put money into a total of 9 different ‚Äúmemecoins‚Äù on ETH/OP (and more on others), 6 of those ended up being rugpulls, and one ended up going severely in the red for whatever other reasons. The one <em>successful</em> token has, to this moment, only given me like a 28% gain in total. <strong>THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE</strong>! The other 2 chains I invested in coins on for the last 2 days have only totaled in <strong>one</strong> (of three) of the whole number of tokens. If we put a grain of trust in this experience, that means on ETH/OP there were 66% of tokens that were rugs, whereas only 33% on other chains were. IDK about the rest of you, but I‚Äìas a member of this community‚Äìam not even somewhat satisfied with this. It <strong>HAS</strong> to change. <strong>NOW</strong>.</p>\n<p>I propose that we start focusing on ways to prevent this from continuing or reoccurring, and I suspect that we would do well to begin looking at the simplicity with which anyone can create and launch a token. IDK if there should be any technical barriers created for creating and launching a token, or what, but <strong>something</strong> has to be fixed. I have two primary concepts that I am personally working on, which I think would serve this purpose in a clean, practical, understandable way. However, these are nowhere beyond the ideological stage, so it will take time to spin them up. I also encourage others look into doing the same.</p>\n<p>I guess since I did decide to post this here, I will mention that I would like to propose‚Äìand get input on‚Äìthe thought that I receive a small chunk of compensation to continue working on the two concepts that I have.

$1M into a favela in Brazil as an experiment to see community managed funds used on public infrastructure</p>\n<p>Project:</p>\n<p>Another friend created Sikana, an educational video platform with tens of millions of views based in Rio.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the project could be something like producing an instructional video in Portuguese on how to cheaply and sustainably construct bathrooms.<br>\nI would love to walk through the location with a friend from Brazil and ask residents their thoughts no the whole initiative and crowdsource ideas from the locals on the best projects, and perhaps for QF and prizes they add their ideas for people to vonate towards.</p>\n<p>Community and timing:</p>\n<p>A group called Blockful was also considering running a Zuzalu style pop up village in Q1 of 2025 in Florianopolis in Brazil, and I know IpeCity network state group was also considering doing a pop up village, and Dweb Brazil has great experience running community gatherings. Perhaps I can connect all three groups and see if they wish to join forces.</p>\n<p>Research:<br>\nA friend of mine co-founder of Gitcoin and advisor to Metagov researchers group mentioned how there really should be a research paper for the effectiveness of quadratic funding so we have already discussed putting out a prize for this.<br>\nAnd of course Dr. Hanson and the economics professors of George Mason University have an amazing network of researchers.</p>\n<p>Media:<br>\nKai of Adrianople helped organize one of the largest beach clean ups in history in Brazil and so has an amazing media/marketing network</p>\n<p>Location:</p>\n<p>Then Hugo of Tools for the Commons discussed how he knows people who work in Rosinha, the largest favela in Brazil which is located just outside of Rio.</p>\n<p>Rocinha has 100,000-300,000 people packed within 1 km^2. For reference, the most densely populated city on earth Manila has only 46,000 people per km^2 (and downtown NYC has 27,000).<br>\nThe police do not enter there, the infrastructure is all built through the decentralized efforts of residents, and it is generally disconnected from the public services in the rest of the country.</p>\n<p>This is despite being a 30 minute walk from a fashion mall, a country club golf course, and a Sheraton hotel.</p>\n<p><strong>In Memoriam</strong></p>\n<p>When I was in Rio as an 18 year old backpacker, my savings from juggling shows became a fortune in the country. I ate Acai in Copacabana beach to my heart‚Äôs content, went hanggliding with a German friend, and raved in a discoteca out in a favela. People warned us we might get stabbed or robbed or drugged there, but that we had to visit because people in that area were the best dancers who knew how to have a good time.</p>\n<p>Then the next day, I walked through downtown and found the most extreme financial inequality I had ever witnessed. I had seen waves of tent encampments and shared meals under crowded bridges in the USA which is where I had seen the most inequality before this. The homeless in the USA are mostly immigrants saving up to send more funds to their kids back home, elderly who pushed away or were abandoned by their families, and drug addicts and the mentally ill. In Rio as I walked amongst the shining skyscrapers of the financial district, I saw families.</p>\n<p>I remember standing at one intersection and watching as waves of men in suits holding a phone to their ear with one hand and a laptop bag in the other rushed the marble floors lined with cardboard. On one patch of cardboard, a young mother and father were playing with their toddlers.</p>\n<p>I knew right then that I would relentlessly pursue every opportunity that I had the good fortune to come across. Now I run a tech company that provides an economic mechanism that I believe can empower people to support their families and one another and that this can scale up to neighborhoods, nations, and civilizations. Not only that, I have a network of friends who also are working for the same goals with their platforms.<br>\nLet‚Äôs test it and see if we can really make a difference.</p>\n<p>I would like to dedicate this idea in memory of my friend Antonio, who‚Äôs gentle smile and raucous laughter made my first time in Brazil a wonderful experience.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think I have some messages to send to see if there are people who wish to work together and help lead this initiative. I cannot put this together myself but if others are excited for it then it could happen.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-find-the-best-way-to-fund-public-goods-a-potential-study-on-funding-strategies-in-a-favela-in-brazil/7853\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-find-the-best-way-to-fund-public-goods-a-potential-study-on-funding-strategies-in-a-favela-in-brazil/7853","pubDate":"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 23:30:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-7853"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-find-the-best-way-to-fund-public-goods-a-potential-study-on-funding-strategies-in-a-favela-in-brazil/7853.rss","#text":"How to Find The Best Way To Fund Public Goods - A Potential Study On Funding Strategies in a Favela in Brazil"}},{"title":"Token House participation and incentives: Season 5 (Cycle 16-19)","dc:creator":"Joxes","category":"üèõ Token House Governance","description":"<p>During the previous season, we conducted a report that served as a reference for measuring participation in Governance (you can see it <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-participation-and-incentives-an-extended-analysis/6479\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>First of all, we want to acknowledge the contributions of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/dmars300\">@dmars300</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/brichis\">@brichis</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/lavande\">@lavande</a>, whose insightful feedback has enriched this report.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Season 5</strong>, our team lead by Joxes and members <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/pumbi\">@Pumbi</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/axlvaz\">@AxlVaz</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/delphine\">@delphine</a> have been working on this report, which, like the previous one, aims to provide information to evaluate the progress of our Optimism Collective processes and to detect any increase in governance participation during this season.</p>\n<p>Special recognition goes to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/pumbi\">@Pumbi</a>, who has worked diligently on tracking MissionsV2, collecting and analyzing a large volume of data (manually).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"disclaimer-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#disclaimer-1\"></a>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p><em>All the relevant data was collected manually.

From here, we can highlight that during S5 there were more requests to carry out missions than actual missions in S4.</li>\n<li>Active delegate participation increased by 59.26% this season (27 delegates in S4 vs. 43 delegates in S5).</li>\n<li>This season, out of the 43 delegates who gave approvals 62.8% (27) provided feedback by commenting on the proposals in the governance forum. On the other hand, (16) 37.2% participated only by approving mission requests.</li>\n<li>From the total of 74 Mission Requests submitted:\n<ul>\n<li>16.22% of the missions were created for Intent 1</li>\n<li>27.03% of the missions were created for Intent 2</li>\n<li>28.38% of the missions were created for Intent 3</li>\n<li>28.38% of the missions were created for Intent 4</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Of the 74 missions proposed, if we take into account sponsorship (48) 64.9% were driven by delegates outside the top 25 with the most VP.</li>\n<li>During seasons 4 and 5, a nearly equal number of mission requests were approved by the DAO, with 27 approved in S4 and 26 during S5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusions-stay-optimistic-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#conclusions-stay-optimistic-18\"></a>Conclusions: <em>stay Optimistic!</em></h1>\n<p>After analyzing all the compared data regarding the previous season, we can notice at a glance a slight increase in delegate participation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Migrating from the 0.25% VP system to a list of Top 100 Delegates had a positive impact and contributed to the inclusion of delegates who were eager to collaborate more extensively.</li>\n<li>If the requirement to participate were extended to the Top 150 Delegates, would the % of total participation also increase?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It‚Äôs also important to note that in Season 5, the number of councils/committees increased due to the iterative and experimental nature of Optimism‚Äôs governance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the Grants Council we went from having 2 subcommittees to having 3 subcommittees, and 4 additional new councils/committees were introduced.</li>\n<li>The number of members increased from 9 in Season 4 to 47 in Season 5. It‚Äôs important to clarify that among the 47 members during this S5, there are 8 individuals who hold positions in multiple sectors such as ACC, Grants Council, govNERDs, Code of Conduct Council, among others. Therefore, to clarify, 47 positions are filled by 38 individuals, excluding individuals who hold more than one position or role.</li>\n<li>We believe this shows that the % of active involvement within the Optimism Collective is increasing and this is very important for the decentralization of governance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regarding Missions, while the number of approved missions at the end of the process remained similar between seasons, it is interesting to note that the final % passed decreased (55.1% in S4 vs 35.1% in S5).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hypothesis: as the Collective learns which type of Mission has a real positive impact on the ecosystem, the final approval rate will decrease over time as a result of specialization.</li>\n<li>It‚Äôs worth highlighting that there was a significant increase in the number of proposals created this season (49 Missions in S4 vs 74 Mission Requests in S5). A possible interpretation after analyzing this recent data is that crafting a Mission Request in S5 might be a bit easier, as the creator of the proposal isn‚Äôt necessarily the one executing it. This setup potentially fosters a freer flow of ideas and facilitates proposing with more liberty. Moreover, the applicant‚Äîwho later creates a mission based on the mission request and applies through Charmverse‚Äîcan also focus their ideas based on the mission requests and undergo the regular grants review process without the complexity that may come with participating in a forum. This is why we believe both processes maximize creativity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One not insignificant detail is that the process in Season 5 was somewhat confusing initially regarding the sponsorship by delegates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many community members were unsure about the flow from creation to approval of the proposal.</li>\n<li>Having a forum thread with + 170 messages is not a pleasant experience for someone unfamiliar with governance operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It was also observed that it was complex and an additional workload for the Top 100 delegates to review all the missions, analyze them, provide feedback, and subsequently approve them due to their quantity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assigning the review of specific missions to interested delegates was a process that greatly helped expedite the work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It‚Äôs truly amazing to participate in these processes and see more people engaging with Optimism governance. <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728\">Exciting challenges</a> lie ahead for governance, and we believe we are on the right path.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Additional resources</strong><br>\nAs we mentioned at the beginning of this report, these data and numbers were collected entirely manually.

The overwhelming interest in contributing to the Optimism ecosystem has been truly remarkable, with a total of 314 applications received for 28 mission requests.</p>\n<p>The reviewers evaluated each mission application, paying particular attention to the scope of the mission requests. Using the adapted rubric for each intent and subcommittee, assessments were made to ensure thoroughness and fairness. Looking ahead, we encourage authors to suggest additions to the standard rubric to further streamline the evaluation process. Your valuable feedback on rubrics for the upcoming round can be shared <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-rubrics-feedback-thread/7649\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This cycle showcased the unwavering dedication of every member of the grants council, as evidenced by the record number of applications reviewed. Each Growth reviewer assessed an average of 100 applications, while each builder reviewer did an average of 150 submissions. Despite the increased workload and having one less reviewer from the original design (I had to take Grant Council Lead), the commitment of the builder‚Äôs subcommittee was impeccable, and the growth subcommittee provided vital support in evaluating hybrid mission requests (Locked and liquid OP within the same application).</p>\n<p>Special acknowledgment is due to the Charmverse team for their instrumental role in providing the necessary tools to facilitate the review process. Leveraging the rubric, workflow, and form tools for the first time, we achieved an impressive success rate of 97.2% out of 314 applications without errors and solved any issues on a 12-hour gap. Seamless communication between reviewers and applicants further enhanced the efficiency of the process, paving the way for the upcoming milestone hub implementation.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the second round, <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/application-guide-4494195094676161\">applications are now open</a>. The council is committed to refining the rubrics, narrowing the scope of some of the mission requests, and fostering increased participation from builders within the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission requests that open again will consider non-granted finalists from round 1 as finalists of round 2 with the same score unless they include feedback on their application and comments.

For now basic functions like trading, listing, making offers, making offers based on price, filters etc. is there, but we have much more to build such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysis dashboard</li>\n<li>Easier listings</li>\n<li>Buyer‚Äôs market (e.g. \"Buy until 100k veVELO, from $0.06/veVELO)</li>\n<li>Emergency sales</li>\n<li>Divide and sell option</li>\n<li>DCA option</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?</strong> :</p>\n<p>Optimism and Base‚Äôs hub of liquidities are Velodrome and Aerodrome, therefore dominated by financial NFTs. Current marketplaces have shortcomings because they are optimized for traditional NFTs.</p>\n<p>There is a total 878,661,086 veVELO staked in total, but only 2M of it is liquid. It‚Äôs even worse for Aerodrome, as there are total of 552,442,060 veAERO, but only 700k of it is liquid.</p>\n<p>Decode is built to tackle the liqudity issue of FNFTs, aiming to be hub of FNFTs, and create a mutualist relationship with projects like Velodrome and Aerodrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how</strong> :</p>\n<p>Yes. The trend of staking mechanism is locking it and turn it into an NFT, and the biggest problem for a lot of protocols is making that NFT liquid. By simply removing that hurdle, it becomes easier for users to stake and lock, as they will know that the NFT they have can be sold any time.</p>\n<p>It also enables protocols like DYAD to deploy their protocols on Optimism, as those projects need an adapted frontend to facilitate their trading.</p>\n<p><strong>Provide us with links to any of the following for the project</strong> :</p>\n<p>Website : <a href=\"https://decode.market\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://decode.market</a><br>\nDiscord : <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RJu2y7M7sw\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Decode</a><br>\nTwitter : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Decode_NFT\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/Decode_NFT</a></p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any metrics on the project currently?</strong> (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>Who are your competitors?</strong> :<br>\nOpenxSwap, OpenSea</p>\n<p><strong>What differentiates you from your competitors?</strong> :</p>\n<p>Our singular focus is on Financial NFTs unlike our competitiors.
