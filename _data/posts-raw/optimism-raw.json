An impactful event for our project, that changed it all! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>\n<p>Trying to be short and not steal a lot of everyone‚Äôs time, what brought me here is reading<br>\nthis topic : <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861/5\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Upcoming Retro rounds and their design - #5 by joanbp</a></p>\n<p>Having experienced RPGF3 as a participant project, i find a lot of smart decitions and improvements &lt;3. For instance making narrower rounds, or the experiments on new ways of measuring true impact.</p>\n<p>Having said that, and this is the other reason that brings me here, i must say I‚Äôm a bit sad<br>\nfor the fact that with the recent changes at the ‚ÄúBuilder‚Äôs round‚Äù , (where education and onboarding is now a bit left aside, and redirected to the Token House Mission) now our project, Newtro, can‚Äôt apply to RPGF.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact we truly understand that sometimes measuring this kind of projects can be tricky<br>\n(there are a lot of fakes, and scams and whatnot) at the same time, there are good number of<br>\nimportant projects, legit and deeply recognized by the users who are impacted by them.<br>\nI think Newtro is one of them (but don‚Äôt worry, this is not us claiming to be included in the round, we just want to raise the alarm on some topics for future improvement!)</p>\n<p>Our work at educating, onboarding, and producing alongside artists with whom we can create<br>\ntrue palpable local impact, has been lovingly recognized at RPGF3 (with a big margin in the votes,<br>\nand 20k OP as a grant); highlighting our impact at the Zora blockchain, where we drove a significant<br>\nnumber of artists (more than a 100 since mid 2023, and growing each trimester), generating a lot of true and organic activity at the chain. This was the direct result of our ‚ÄúArts &amp; W3b‚Äù free workshop for artists‚Äô onboarding to the blockchain. We can say the same for the Farcaster ecosystem, and Base in a tangent way.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks to RPGF3, some of the things we could make were:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A trip with 15 artists to La Pampa (Argentina) to the VuelaPelucas3000 festival<br>\nhosted by Pamilo Ceirone (Argentinian artist who tokenizes his work) in December 2023, in order to participate at the event with projections, vjing and djing.

Its also our intention to<br>\nstart to spread the word about what‚Äôs going on in our tokenized art niche, so thanks again for reading!</p>\n<p>We can say we are a testament of how to build a true, impactful cultural Arts &amp; Web3 project in the blockchain, full of art, knowledge exchange, local impact and organic growth, producing true measurable impact not only for our project, but also artists and blockchains, in a thriving territory as Latin America is in the web3 world. With some shyness, i can proudly say that sometimes we heard the words ‚ÄúThe Newtro model‚Äù, something that humbled but also excited us a lot.</p>\n<p>Talks of being able to talk with other more recent artists‚Äô Collectives to give a hand or advice,<br>\nor even share our knowledge with Mexican projects (!), ignited our flame and made us realize that soon, this is something we had to do. We take Culture and the promotion of arts and artists as serious as it is. And we are happy to share what we know. <strong>With the Artists Collectives, but also with whomever would find productive to hear us from the OP Collective.</strong></p>\n<p>But in order for this kind of projects (artists collectives trying to create onchain and offchain impact)<br>\nto thrive, as anyone else, we need financial support. We and our partners and sponsors know how hard we work, how much impact we conduct to the blockchain, off the chain, and how many artists lives we touch.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs why i wanted to raise a bit my voice, and hopefully bring to light some concerns that im sure<br>\nwe are not the only ones experiencing, since the changes made at the Builder‚Äôs category of RPGF4.<br>\nWe are more than willing to <strong>keep sharing abt our experience, its importance, and its needs</strong>.I must say that we are thankful for the ‚ÄúToken House Missions‚Äù but its hard to create something lasting, cohesive and truly impactful just by hosting events from time to time. Working for culture and art is an everyday job for us, which we as artists ourselves, do passionately and with the highest compromise.</p>\n<p>So once again, thanks for reading, thanks for all the work the OP Collective is doing at so many levels<br>\nand finally. <strong>We open this space to talk about how we can make a better job in culture and arts and the blockchain and the role of RPGF and OP</strong>.

In DAO governance‚Äôs reality though, only a handful of primitives achieved significant adoption. 1token1vote links voting power directly to the number of tokens held. Vote delegation allows token holders to assign their voting rights to another party, enabling concentrated decision-making power based on trust.</p>\n<p>There is a third class of voting mechanisms to complement these concepts: make a voter‚Äôs track record count in DAO decisions, and use proofs of expertise and achievements as a signal to define voting weight and decision-making power. In this experiment, TE Academy explores the potential of Reputation-based Weighted Voting in an educational project. Students will have the chance to go over the entire token engineering process and work on a case study with a real voting outcome - deciding on the winner of the first TE Academy fellowship with a $10K prize for the fellowship winner.</p>\n<p>Over the past 3 years, TE Academy has established a system of NFT proofs to track individual community members‚Äô achievements and the development of the sector overall. We‚Äôve issued more than 1000 NFTs to students who‚Äôve passed knowledge requirements and to researchers with significant contributions to the token engineering discipline. In our experiment, any community member will be eligible to vote - however, holding Token Engineering NFTs will increase a voter‚Äôs weight in this decision. No popularity contest!</p>\n<p>We‚Äôll account for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>passed exams in the TE Fundamentals course (more than <a href=\"https://tokenengineering.net/explore/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">4000 students enrolled</a>)</li>\n<li>sharing knowledge as a speaker at TE Academy events (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TE-Academy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">more than 120</a> over the last 3 years)</li>\n<li>contributions to our shared body of knowledge in the form of online learning materials (first <a href=\"https://tokenengineering.net/explore/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bachelor-level course in token engineering</a>)</li>\n<li>supporting students as study group host (in one of 45 study groups)</li>\n<li>and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Reputation-based Weighted Voting can be applied to any DAO decision-making cases where expertise is required to make good decisions. In RWV systems, voters are encouraged to sharpen their profile and become highly sought-after experts in their domain of decisions (e.g. Retro-Public Goods Funding, Risk Management). For a DAO‚Äôs collective, it‚Äôs an opportunity to establish incentives for decision-makers and grant voting power to those who were actively involved in good decisions.<br>\nCombined with 1token1vote and vote delegation, it‚Äôs a new building block to make decisions transparent, and robust against collusion, bribery, and economic attacks.</p>\n<p>We offer this program as part of our public goods education, enabled by Optimism RetroPGF! <strong>The results of this experiment, as well as the voting algorithm and a simulation engine, will be available open-source.</strong></p>\n<p>Learn more about our program in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gQKKt755n6Y?si=XsTY2Iw_CaK2j4yU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this presentation at the Optimism Demo Day</a>!</p>\n<p>Today, more than 4000 students are enrolled in TE Academy‚Äôs studying programs, and research initiatives.

Impact will be rewarded within the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demand generated for Optimism Blockspace</li>\n<li>Interactions from repeat Optimism users</li>\n<li>Interactions from Optimism users with high trust scores</li>\n<li>Interactions of new Optimism users</li>\n<li>Open Source license of contract code</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"eligibility-criteria-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#eligibility-criteria-4\"></a>Eligibility Criteria</h2>\n<p>In Retro Funding 3, the Retro Funding sign up process saw a large influx of spam and low-quality applications. By setting stronger eligibility criteria in Retro Funding 4, the Foundation aims to provide clarity to builders and reduce the amount of human review required for spam and low-quality application. In addition, qualifying criteria reduce the number of applicants who have not generated sufficient impact to receive rewards (such as the below requirement of a minimum number of unique address interactions). The below eligibility criteria aim to strike a balance between broad inclusivity and sufficient requirements to allow for an operationally viable Retro Funding round.</p>\n<p><strong>Builders are eligible who have</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deployed their onchain contracts on one or multiple OP chains (OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Frax and Metal) and meet the following criteria:\n<ul>\n<li>Onchain contracts have interactions from 420 unique addresses during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contracts had their first transaction before April 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contract had more than 10 days of activity during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Verified their onchain contracts in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Made their contract code available in a public Github repo, for which ownership has been verified in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Confirmed that they will comply with Optimism Foundation KYC requirements and are not residing in a sanctioned country</li>\n<li>Submitted a Retro Funding application before June 6th, 2024 and comply with application rules</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"round-sizing-10m-op-to-reward-onchain-builders-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#round-sizing-10m-op-to-reward-onchain-builders-5\"></a>Round Sizing: 10m OP to reward Onchain Builders</h2>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 will allocated 10m OP to reward the impact of Onchain Builders. The OP token allocation for Retro Funding 4 should reflect the impact generated by onchain builders, as well as set a strong incentive for the continuous generation of demand for Optimism blockspace.<br>\nBelow you find some considerations which informed the Foundation‚Äôs round sizing decision:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Underallocation to Onchain Builders in Retro Funding 3:</strong> Previously, Retro Funding 3 allocated a total of <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">1.5M out of 30M OP</a> to the top 20% of applicants who generated network usage. There has been <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">strong feedback from badgeholders and community</a> members that this allocation was too low and should be increased in future rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Growth in developer activity since last round:</strong> The Collective is focused on growing the number of active onchain developers. Developer activity, across the Superchain, <a href=\"https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-chains-revenue-generating-deployer-addresses\">has seen a large increase over the past six months</a>. Thus, Retro Funding rewards to these types of contributions should increase to reflect this increase in impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Collective sustainability:</strong> In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders have <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">raised concerns around Retro Funding sustainability</a>. Retro Funding currently relies on the Retroactive Public Goods Funding token allocation of 850M OP for rewards. <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY\">In the future</a>, Retro Funding will rely on surplus protocol revenue as the source of rewards. Currently, <a href=\"https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-collective-contribution\">Total Collective Contributions</a> (of surplus protocol revenue) fall short of what is needed to sustain Retroactive Public Goods Funding. Additionally, in Retro Funding 3, badgeholders raised points <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">around the relationship of rewards to the sequencer revenue</a>, to ensure rewards don‚Äôt exceed the sequencer revenue itself. By allocating a significant amount of OP to rewarding onchain builders, the Citizens‚Äô House is incentivizing developer growth and increased network activity.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"future-round-sizing-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#future-round-sizing-6\"></a>Future round sizing</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 &amp; 5, and will proposes round sizes for Retro Funding 6 &amp; 7, to be ratified by the Citizens‚Äô House. In the future, this process will gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons. Round sizing decisions are currently informed by the amount of impact observed within the Collective, considerations for incentivising contributors to take action, and sustainability of Retro Funding rewards. In the future, these decisions should be made based on a framework which takes a number of established measurements and criteria into. We invite Data NERDs to explore measurements and criteria which will inform governance participants to make informed budgeting decisions in the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"voting-design-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#voting-design-7\"></a>Voting design</h2>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 experiments with <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861\">Metrics-based Evaluation</a>, with the hypothesis that by leveraging quantitive metrics, citizens are able to more accurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more accurate judgements of the impact delivered by individual contributors.<br>\nIn stark contrast to other Retro Funding experiments, badgeholders will not vote on individual projects but will rather vote via selecting and weighting a number of metrics which measure different types of impact. You can find out more about prototypes and explorations that informed this design <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimentation-impact-metric-based-voting/7727\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact metrics</strong><br>\nAll Citizens will be asked to vote in Retro Funding 4 and will be invited to actively shape and input on the design of impact metrics via discussions on the forum as well as a workshop. More details on the process of selecting impact metrics and their design will follow soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Voting interface</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.opensource.observer/\">Opensource Observer</a> is leading the development of impact metrics and relating infrastructure.<br>\n<a href=\"https://voteagora.com/\">The Agora team</a> is building the voting API for Retro Funding 4, with the team building the voting interface being selected via a <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/173\">Foundation Mission Request</a>. The Foundation will provide designs and specs for the voting interface and will invite badgeholders to participate in user testing and user experience research.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"kyc-grant-delivery-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#kyc-grant-delivery-8\"></a><strong>KYC &amp; Grant delivery</strong></h2>\n<p>The Optimism Foundation is making active improvements on the KYC &amp; grant delivery process.

Selecting the right ecosystem projects to fund, which tokens to list in a lending market, and the outcome of a protocol fee switch are valuable propositions that affect all community stakeholders. Once the combined value at stake reaches a critical mass, the founding team is unable to make decisions by themselves without running the risk of centralization. As a result, many aspects of the decentralized protocol model make governance unavoidable.</p>\n<p>But token voting as a mechanism for decentralized governance has introduced its own <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">set of problems</a>. An inherent conflict of interest arises when voting power is disproportionately concentrated among a small group of wealthy token holders. As an example, venture funds or whales involved in external projects might be incentivized to pursue agendas that benefit their broader portfolio at the expense of the protocol‚Äôs long-term success. In addition, the over-reliance on token voting not only entrenches the power of a wealthy few but also undermines the collective action taken by smaller stakeholders. Smaller delegates within the Optimism ecosystem often <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2830772/4724839/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">refrain from voting</a> due to their individual decisions ‚Äúnot mattering much‚Äù. The situation creates a paradox where the promise of decentralization leads to a quasi-centralization of power and an absence of true preferences.</p>\n<p>Doxamarket aims to address these gaps by offering a novel approach to incentivize voter participation and mitigate the inefficiencies associated with governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"information-markets-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#information-markets-2\"></a>Information Markets</h2>\n<p>Onchain information markets have gained immense popularity recently with the rise of <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Polymarket</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1775542217307791366\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">liquidity-backed Kalshi</a>. Their success confirms the financial value that assigning probabilities to future outcomes and sub outcomes can generate. Most importantly, we believe information markets carry an <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/04/01/dc.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">element of chaos</a> that could be directly applied to form consensus in decentralized governance. The crypto space will always prefer chaotic and decisive action over stasis debates between two protocol researchers.

For either case I‚Äôm particularly interested in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you understand what the project is?</li>\n<li>Does it make sense as to why it‚Äôs worth building (or at least why I think it‚Äôs worth building)?</li>\n<li>What would you add?</li>\n<li>What would you remove?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Now then‚Ä¶</strong></p>\n<p>A meme was originally defined as the cultural equivalent of a gene - a unit of information within a social group that can replicate, evolve, and undergo natural selection. The theory gained some popularity in the 90‚Äôs but lost momentum due to the difficulty of agreeing on what actually constitutes a meme and how to measure cultural information.</p>\n<p>Internet memes define a structure and are easily tracked. <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/about\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Know Your Memes</a> has been doing so since 2008 in a format similar to wikipedia. Internet memes don‚Äôt represent complete cultures of course, but it‚Äôs a significant step for the theory.</p>\n<p>It seems like the next logical step in this progression is to create an app that allows memes to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be created, mutated, and replicated by groups</li>\n<li>Form links to incubate and grow into complex cultures</li>\n<li>Undergo selection processes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We could probably stop here and see some interesting results, but I think we can go a step further to clean the cultural slate and initiate a Cambrian Explosion of memetic activity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One human = one account at the gates to keep out bots and sybils</li>\n<li>Anonymizing users at the gates removes the influence of previous cultural links (friends, family, etc) on that user‚Äôs input. They still hold that cultural information in their minds, but the social pressure of identity and conformity is removed while in the app, so they are free to try on new hats and express themselves authentically.\n<ul>\n<li>As memes are co-created and cultures are formed, anonymous users can offer to share (or revoke) pieces of information with those they have interacted with, creating high value social data. Example: two parties offer to share info with a group they just made a dope meme with; the exchange is made and a new social connection is formed, anchored within a culture.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Memes can be minted to allow individuals to build their own cultural narratives. This creates another opportunity for social connections to happen. Example: when ten people mint the same meme give them an option to form a new culture as a group with that meme as a genesis block.</li>\n<li>Limiting how much time and data any individual can put into the system to about what the bottom 20% of active users would naturally contribute spreads the content more evenly, which means more diversely since every human has unique experiences and perspectives to throw in the blender.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If it works right, this could allow us to rapidly discover and develop new foundational layers of society that accurately represent the wants, needs, and desires of the population. And because everyone is working together to create these memes and cultures, they automatically start with a committed, decentralized, and aligned community.</p>\n<p>So, that‚Äôs the basic premise. <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/hedgey-rpgf-grants-final-project-updates/7841/6\">Here are some more details about what I‚Äôve built the last month and plans for the future.</a> Considering the idea is all about co-creation and shared perspectives, I‚Äôll stop here and curiously await some novel perspective from the OP cultural mind to move the narrative forward.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/culture-blocks-co-created-memes-that-can-be-linked-together-to-form-complex-cultures-and-social-graphs/7935\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/culture-blocks-co-created-memes-that-can-be-linked-together-to-form-complex-cultures-and-social-graphs/7935","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 16:37:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-7935"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/culture-blocks-co-created-memes-that-can-be-linked-together-to-form-complex-cultures-and-social-graphs/7935.rss","#text":"Culture Blocks - Co-created memes that can be linked together to form complex cultures and social graphs"}},{"title":"Proposal: Improve advanced delegation voting","dc:creator":"Agora","category":"Protocol Upgrade","description":"<h1><a name=\"executive-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#executive-summary-1\"></a>Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>Hi I‚Äôm Kent, CTO of Agora.

This facilitates governance participation for large funds, partners and the foundation, who have complex token storage requirements. One side effect of feature is that voters who received advanced delegation would need to sign two transactions to vote.</p>\n<p>When we shipped this feature, we thought having two transactions would be a good thing, to easily show users when they voted from each of their voting powers: standard delegation power and advanced delegation power.</p>\n<p>After getting feedback from a small group of ~50 voters who‚Äôve received votes via this feature, it was clear that this was a bad idea. As a consequence, we have paused the further rollout of this feature and refactored the contract to allow for a vote with both standard and advanced delegation in one transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact to voters:</strong></p>\n<p>Delegates with advanced voting power will have a better user experience and will sign only 1 transaction.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#specifications-3\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"contract-changed-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#contract-changed-4\"></a>Contract Changed</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/voteagora/governor/pull/22/files\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism Governor</a> would be changed as part of this upgrade.

We‚Äôve piloted the proof with Round 3. This post intends to explain the mechanics of the audit and also ask for feedback from the Optimism community.</p>\n<p><strong>The TLDR;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Retroactive Funding process and algorithm ideally improves with each round via governance feedback.</li>\n<li>We‚Äôve essentially audited RetroPGF Round 3. We did so through a cryptographic proof, and anyone can verify it using this <a href=\"https://retrofunding.ezkl.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">webapp</a>.</li>\n<li>This paves the way for an end-to-end automated process with private voting, checks and balances on the allocation algorithm, and smart contract enabled allocation delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For stakeholders, this audit means many things:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For badgeholders, that your vote was fairly counted</li>\n<li>For recipients, that your allocation was fairly calculated</li>\n<li>For everyone else, the results actually correspond with the Optimism governance forums</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"an-iterative-approach-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#an-iterative-approach-1\"></a>An iterative approach</h3>\n<p>As this forum is aware, a core tenet of the Optimism community is agile iteration. That means the design of Round 3 looks much different from that of Round 1. We see that Round 3 heavily indexes on the impact evaluation framework, and as a both qualitative and quantitative measure, heavily relies on the judgement of voters (badgeholders).</p>\n<p>Votes are currently fed through an allocation algorithm, published publicly by the Optimism team. The team announces the algorithm‚Äôs results at the conclusion of a round, as well as learnings to iterate upon for the next rounds.</p>\n<p>The trickiest bit has always been effectively measuring impact. Reliance on quantitative metrics risks exclusion. Reliance of qualitative feedback risks human biases among other coordination challenges. And there are many more tradeoffs beyond these. Consequently, the algorithm and overarching design continues to evolve and evoke discussion. <strong>Ideally, we can check the process and algorithm with each new iteration.</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-integrity-challenge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#the-integrity-challenge-2\"></a>The integrity challenge</h3>\n<p>One of the main tradeoffs for Retroactive Funding is related to privacy.</p>\n<p>For such a large pool of OP rewards, transparency is important. We want to ensure results are aligned with previous governance decisions. More importantly, this recognizes that many projects depend on the allocation for sustainability.</p>\n<p>However, badgeholder votes are private in Retroactive Funding. A longstanding feature of voting systems, this allows voters to express their true preferences without fear of retaliation, coercion, or pressure from others. It makes it difficult to execute vote buying, and encourages honest participation.</p>\n<p><strong>This presents a key challenge</strong>: verifying that allocation outcomes are truly based on badgeholder votes. Even though the allocation algorithm is public (and we can check that it accurately codifies forum promises), we can‚Äôt run a check without the input data. In the worst case, we can‚Äôt guarantee that the provided allocation algorithm was even used or that all votes were counted.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-zero-knowledge-solution-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#the-zero-knowledge-solution-3\"></a>The zero knowledge solution</h3>\n<p>Making this process transparent requires both a proof that legitimate votes were counted and that the allocation algorithm was run as intended, whilst keeping <em>the votes themselves private.</em> This is exactly the sort of proof zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography was designed to enable ‚Äî and why we‚Äôre so excited to showcase this project as a hallmark use of the technology.</p>\n<p>There are two places we apply ZKP:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-1-verifying-the-voting-process-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-1-verifying-the-voting-process-4\"></a>1. Verifying the voting process</h4>\n<p>The first circuit verifies that the cast ballots are legitimate, and that all legitimate ballots are counted. Ballots are legitimate if signed by a badgeholder from the public whitelist.</p>\n<p><strong>The details:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check the ballot signatures against the whitelist.</li>\n<li>For each project, create a hash of all its legitimate ballots. This is denoted as Hash A.</li>\n<li>Aggregate the hashes to generate an overall proof. This proof means that across all projects, all legitimate votes were counted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>This results in Proof A.</strong></p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-checking-the-allocation-algorithm-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-2-checking-the-allocation-algorithm-5\"></a>2. Checking the allocation algorithm</h4>\n<p>The second circuit verifies the usage of the allocation algorithm.</p>\n<p>The details:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For each project, we repeat steps 1 and 2 of the first circuit. This, however, is denoted by Hash B. We will check that Hash A = Hash B out of circuit.</li>\n<li>Generate a proof over the allocation algorithm. The algorithm takes in a ballot table as input, and outputs an allocation table. We only need one proof of the whole algorithm.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The results in Proof B.</strong></p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-3-combining-the-proofs-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-3-combining-the-proofs-6\"></a>3. Combining the proofs</h4>\n<p>Since we generate the proofs separately, we want to link them together cryptographically. This ensures there is not tampering of votes in between proofs. We link them by checking that the hashes of legitimate votes, Hash A and Hash B, are the same. This is the same hash you see on the platform, just in QR form.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-4-verifying-a-projects-allocation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-4-verifying-a-projects-allocation-7\"></a>4. Verifying a project‚Äôs allocation</h4>\n<p>This is where you come in! When you press <strong>verify</strong>, you check the allocation was correct for a given project.</p>\n<p>Even though the proofs are for <em>all projects,</em> each proof has a set of public variables particular to a given project. In Proof A this is the hash of the votes (Hash A), in Proof B this is the hash of the votes (Hash B) <em>and</em> the allocation amount for a given project.</p>\n<p>If we change any of those variables, we break verification <em>for a particular project</em>. Try it yourself!</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-5-verifying-the-entire-retropgf-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-5-verifying-the-entire-retropgf-8\"></a>5. Verifying the entire RetroPGF</h4>\n<p>It‚Äôs also possible to verify the entire RetroPGF round at once. You can do so by pressing ‚Äúverify‚Äù on the landing page.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"everyones-verification-matters-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#everyones-verification-matters-9\"></a>Everyone‚Äôs verification matters</h3>\n<p>If you‚Äôre neither a badgeholder nor a recipient, why hit the verify button? Simply put, verifying the results of the round contributes to the security and legitimacy of the process.</p>\n<p><strong>Here‚Äôs the idea</strong>: Blockchains have both social consensus (which fork is the main one, which client should be run, etc.) and computational consensus. A smart contract can enforce a set of rules, but humans decide which copy of the smart contract is the canonical one. Election workers count ballots, but citizens recognize the result. Similarly, by verifying the RetroPGF results for one or more projects, you help solidify the social consensus around the legitimacy of the vote. You are an election observer, contributing to a successful audit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByUUpr4yR.jpg\" alt=\"photo_2024-03-27_19-22-21\" width=\"690\" height=\"360\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"implementation-details-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#implementation-details-10\"></a>Implementation details</h3>\n<p>You can find the code for this on our <a href=\"https://blog.ezkl.xyz/post/zkrpgf/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">blog</a>. We briefly discuss the details for verification of the allocation algorithm.</p>\n<p>Optimism‚Äôs allocation algorithm was written in Python, which made the EZKL python library a natural fit for in-program conversion of the data science into zero-knowledge proofs. You‚Äôll also notice that OP allocation votes are cast with floating point amounts ‚Äî this meant a very low tolerance for imprecision.</p>\n<p>EZKL already optimizes heavily for precision given the frequency of nonlinear operations (reciprocals, softmax, etc.) in data science and machine learning models. However, we also made substantial improvements to the core engine, and specifically how we perform lookups, in order to retain proof size while increasing numerical accuracy. Incidentally, proving performance for other models like random forests and transformers improved significantly (sometimes over 90%). A win-win!</p>\n<p>There are a few more important details, specifically around signature verification and the proving system. This may require some background in cryptography, so we omit a full discussion here. However, this also is available on our blog.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#next-steps-11\"></a>Next steps</h3>\n<p>This is just the first step in auditing and automating the Retroactive Funding process. In the future, it is possible to create more comprehensive systems and even automate the process end-to-end. This may look something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Algorithm implemented and formally verified against specifications in governance forums</li>\n<li>Votes checked against whitelist of badgeholders via a proof of legitimacy</li>\n<li>Upon verification, votes run through the allocation algorithm</li>\n<li>Final allocation checked via a proof of calculation</li>\n<li>Upon final verification, distribution of funds automatically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This also makes it easier to reflect and analyze voter behavior without revealing information about any one badgeholder ‚Äî facilitating incremental improvement for the next round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"open-questions-call-for-feedback-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#open-questions-call-for-feedback-12\"></a>Open questions &amp; call for feedback</h3>\n<p>We would be grateful for any feedback on the platform, and will aim to implement improvements for future rounds. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Were you more interested in the verification of the whole RetroPGF or focus on particular projects?</li>\n<li>Did you find features like the ability to manipulate the hash or allocation amount interesting?

One area that could be further improved is liquidity management, particularly for assets with interest-bearing features, such as sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>\n<p>sDAI is a synthetic stablecoin that aims to track the price of DAI. However, its price can experience periods of volatility due to factors such as market conditions, changes in the underlying collateral, demand for the asset, and its <strong>interest-bearing</strong> nature. This volatility can make it challenging for liquidity providers to maintain a healthy balance of USDC (or other stablecoins) and sDAI in their pools.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n<p>I propose an automated liquidity management (ALM) system for Velodrome that would use a dynamic range to adjust the ratio of USDC to sDAI in liquidity pools based on the interest rate of sDAI. The range would increase gradually as the price/interest rate of sDAI increases, helping to protect liquidity providers from impermanent loss and capturing the additional yield generated by sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed ALM system would offer several benefits, including:</p>\n<p>Reduced impermanent loss: The dynamic range would help to reduce impermanent loss for liquidity providers, as it would adjust the pool‚Äôs composition to account for changes in the volatility, price, or interest rate of sDAI.</p>\n<p>Increased capital efficiency: The system would allow liquidity providers to make better use of their capital by automatically adjusting the pool‚Äôs composition.</p>\n<p>Improved liquidity: The system would help to improve liquidity for sDAI, making it easier for traders to buy and sell the asset.</p>\n<p>Captured yield: The system would allow liquidity providers to capture the additional yield generated by sDAI, increasing their overall returns.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>The ALM system could be implemented using a smart contract that would monitor the price, volatility, and interest rate of sDAI and adjust the pool‚Äôs composition accordingly. The smart contract would need to be carefully designed and audited to ensure its security and reliability.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>An automated liquidity management system with an increasing range would be a valuable addition to Velodrome. It would help to reduce impermanent loss for liquidity providers, increase capital efficiency, improve liquidity for sDAI, and allow liquidity providers to capture the additional yield generated by sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Details</strong></p>\n<p>The following are some additional details about the proposed ALM system:</p>\n<p>The range would be calculated using a formula that takes into account the price, volatility, interest rate, and other relevant factors of sDAI.</p>\n<p>The range would be updated periodically, such as every hour or every day.</p>\n<p>Liquidity providers would be able to choose whether or not to participate in the ALM system.</p>\n<p>The ALM system would be open source and auditable.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>This proposal is still under development, and I am open to feedback and suggestions.

However, I am concerned that this project would conflict with existing planned work for the fault proof. Other changes like updates to the fault proof required to support Superchain interoperability and support for multiple proof types likely take precedence over this work. Given the security-critical nature of this code path, the proposed changes would likely have to involve engineers from OP Labs whose time would probably consumed by other projects. It is possible that the fault proof protocol changes before this proposal can be accepted into the protocol.<br>\nIt is additionally worth noting that the underlying concern that the proposal is addressing has not been sufficiently analyzed. Although the proposal does increase the cost of censorship, the community currently lacks the research to demonstrate that the censorship risk posed by the current 40-transaction model is unacceptable for Stage 2.<br>\nGiven the above, I would recommend against carrying out this proposal not on technical merits but on strategic ones. I‚Äôm mostly worried that the team will spend time on this project and the end result will not be included in the final protocol. Instead, I would encourage the team to submit an alternative proposal that focuses on carrying out the underlying research to demonstrate the censorship risk relative to the number of transactions required as part of the game. Specifically, it would be valuable to understand the exact cost and feasibility of an attacker to execute a censorship attack as the number of transactions required as part of the proof increases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 2:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I am excited to see the proposal. I think that it would be high leverage to work on and it‚Äôs completion would really improve the efforts to decentralized the OP stack. The team is strong with a good track record and the proposal is well thought out. I think the collection of individuals who have a strong understanding of the dispute game and fault proofs is small and given me personal expertise i believe this applicant has a strong understanding. I think the requested amount is modest and more than reasonable. I believe that stage two decentralization for for the OP stack and that improvements to the dispute game (currently bisection) should be a priority and I endorse this proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 3:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I am a fan of any kind of meaningful performance improvement, especially if it‚Äôs an introduction of new algorithm for the dispute game. Very supportive.

Yes. This moves the OP Stack towards one of its main goals of decentralized fault proving. One could argue that this is less of a research project as it has concrete produce outputs, but it probably fits best of any of the DMRs.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible? Yes, although more research is needed to understand if their prover is fast enough to accomplish the goals.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? No obvious ones other than the open question of whether their prover is fast enough to support this use case. While they do include some speedups regarding witness generation, it would be nice to see an estimated trace length for proving a block and some estimate of how long it would take to prove said trace based on smaller benchmarks.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team?

Yes. While I think it‚Äôs unlikely to be used by too many users on established chains, it seems like a very useful piece of developer tooling for the ecosystem to have.

However i do not believe that this is a particular novel proposal but non the less diversity and competition in explorers is good and worth supporting in my opinion. I think that the requested amount here is less modest proportional to the impact (if i had to balance the amounts i would switch the allocation amounts with this and the multi-section dispute). All in all i also endorse this Proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work review: Solid prior work on StarkNet explorer (but not public yet it seems). Team has delivered projects in the past.</li>\n<li>Proposed Solution: Yes it addresses the DMR. I think as superchain vision is realized there will be way more OP Stack L2s that won‚Äôt receive support from Etherscan and can‚Äôt pay for an integration. And blockscout is generally too much of a departure from normal user flows and that degrades the UX. So going with a Etherscan style UI is great. The team should checkout Otterscan.

As far as I can tell, the approach is feasible.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? The explanation of the discrete steps seems a little vague. The broad strokes make sense, but seems like they have not yet thought too much about the exact details or precise work that will go into it.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team? They certainly seem to have knowledge of Arweave, and they have released 4EVER-Raas based on OP stack, but something in the write up makes me feel a bit iffy about whether they will succeed at this.</li>\n<li>Milestone feedback?

One could argue that this isn‚Äôt tooling and is instead infrastructure, but I think it aligns closely enough and is worthwhile enough project to include.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible? Yes.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? Not really. The only additional feature that may be worth adding is some tooling for verifying the correctness of a blob against an Ethereum node. This should be feasible as one can take the stored data, compute the KZG commitment, and check that it is equal to the commitment stored permanently by Ethereum.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team?

Politics aside using a separate chain whether Arweave or othwerwise may worsen Optimism‚Äôs technical decentralization and security by potentially making it reliant on a cheaper but less secure &amp; decentralized DA layer. Furthermore the proposal doesn‚Äôt mention a light-client or bridge of any sort that would be required to make proofs that data was made available on Arweave in Ethereum for the sake of fault proofs and disputing sequencers.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team?</li>\n<li>Yes.

The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, and facilitated by the Foundation, based on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by the Collective. It is at this point that the Foundation becomes just one of many ‚ÄúCore Delegates‚Äù proposing design changes to the system (metagovernance).</p>\n<p>As outlined in <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728/2\">The Path to Open Metagovernance,</a> the path to open metagovernance will occur gradually over multiple phases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To date, we‚Äôve been primarily in <strong>Phase 0: community informed design.</strong> The Optimism Foundation open-sources our internal research and proposes designs based on active feedback from governance participants. We receive feedback on late-stage drafts from high-context stakeholders informally, usually after designs are complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now we are ready to start entering <strong>Phase 1: Community consulted design process.</strong> That means will we continue open-sourcing more of our design principles, process, and goals to the community to build shared context while also consulting community members earlier in the design process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will do this via two primary mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Frequent polls on low-context design parameters, open to any community member‚Äôs input.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Higher context feedback requested of an experimental Collective Feedback Commission.

rounds to more narrowly scoped rounds; you can find out more about this transition <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-moving-from-broad-to-narrow-scoped-rounds/7759/1\">here</a>.<br>\nTo provide more transparency into the Retro Funding design process, in line with <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728\">Optimism‚Äôs path towards Open Metagovernance</a>, we‚Äôre sharing plans and considerations for Retro rounds for all of 2024. You can find the announcement of upcoming rounds <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/nz5II2tucf3k8tJ76O6HWwvidLB6TLQXszmMnlnhxWU\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"scoping-sizing-retro-rounds-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#scoping-sizing-retro-rounds-1\"></a>Scoping &amp; Sizing retro rounds</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"scoping-retro-rounds-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#scoping-retro-rounds-2\"></a><strong>Scoping retro rounds</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/citizens-house/#experimentation-framework\">The scope of a retro round</a> outlines the type of impact that is being rewarded. <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA\">Feedback from Retro Funding 3</a> suggests that narrowly scoped rounds can lead to significant improvements of the builder and voter experience. In scoping retro rounds in 2024, the Foundation aimed to identify the types of contributions which are most impactful to the Collective and where Retro Funding is best suited to support. The detailed scope of each retro round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"sizing-retro-rounds-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#sizing-retro-rounds-3\"></a><strong>Sizing retro rounds</strong></h3>\n<p>The aim for sizing round rewards is to provide OP rewards which accurately reflect the impact within the scope of a retro round and provide a strong incentive for contributing to the Collective. The amount of rewards for each round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.<br>\nThe Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 &amp; 5, and will proposes round sizes for Retro Funding 6 &amp; 7 to be ratified by the Citizens‚Äô House. In the future, the goal for this process will be to gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"citizen-workload-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#citizen-workload-4\"></a><strong>Citizen workload</strong></h3>\n<p>While the number of retro rounds is increasing, the goal is for individual citizen workload to not increase and possibly be reduced. In previous retro rounds, citizens‚Äô provided feedback on the time intensive labor of participating and shared concerns that increasing the number of rounds will increase the required time commitment of individual citizens. Retro Funding is actively exploring designs &amp; experiments which enable an increase in the number of rounds while not impacting individual citizens workload.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"more-rounds-more-experiments-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#more-rounds-more-experiments-5\"></a>More rounds, more experiments</h2>\n<p>Running multiple types of rounds allows us to run different experiments on the best ways to scale and improve Retro Funding. Below you find an overview of the experiments planned for 2024.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"measuring-impact-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#measuring-impact-6\"></a>Measuring impact</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA\">One of the obstacles citizens faced in Retro Funding 3</a> was the challenge of evaluating different types of impact using the same approach. Not all impact is the same, and different types of impact are best measured via different approaches. Below you find a summary of the framework which the Foundation applies to explore appropriate approaches to measuring different types of impact.</p>\n<p>Contributions to Optimism can be categorized as either upstream or downstream of Optimism blockspace.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upstream contributions improve Optimism itself, this includes improvements to the OP Stack and Optimism Governance</li>\n<li>Downstream contributions improve the experience of Optimism users, such as builders and consumers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fFEmdxO2Ej1MuutFh7MR4SXftu5.png?dl=1\" title=\"Untitled\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_690x105.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" data-base62-sha1=\"fFEmdxO2Ej1MuutFh7MR4SXftu5\" width=\"690\" height=\"105\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_690x105.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_1035x157.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6dd5eaa2ae0d3a509d3d850ecfb870f226bae8b5_2_1380x210.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F2F2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"upstream-impact-is-measured-via-the-aggregate-utility-of-optimism-users-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#upstream-impact-is-measured-via-the-aggregate-utility-of-optimism-users-7\"></a>Upstream impact is measured via the aggregate utility of Optimism users</h4>\n<p>To evaluate impact which is upstream, we need to understand how the contribution has increased the aggregate utility of all users of the Optimism Platform.

E.g., how has the contribution benefited builders and consumers?<br>\nGathering and analysing these signals presents significant challenges, such as sybil resistance and vanity metrics.<br>\nExample: see <a href=\"https://ccerv1.github.io/downstream_impact/?mode=fees\">downstream impact</a>, a metric in which dev libraries are evaluated based on the output of the builders on Optimism which use them</p>\n<p>Upcoming Retro Funding experiments are designed to best address the different nature of upstream and downstream impact:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"experiment-1-impact-juries-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#experiment-1-impact-juries-9\"></a>Experiment 1: Impact Juries <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_judge.png?v=12\" title=\":man_judge:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":man_judge:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thesis <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1:</span></strong> By sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications, impact measurement is improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Thesis <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span></strong>: Sortition, the selection of public jurors by using a random representative sample, allows us to effectively scale citizenship</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Retro Funding 3, citizens <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA\">requested a more focused evaluation experience</a>.
