In December, the Optimism Foundation moved away from Fractal as an identity verification provider and stopped using them for most users and geographies. This move was spurred by community provided feedback that the process felt unnecessarily thorough. We are currently using Persona to satisfy our identity verification requirements as a component of KYC. You can read about their successful completion of key privacy and security audits here: <a href=\"https://withpersona.com/security\">https://withpersona.com/security</a>.</p>\n<p>While we are still waiting to learn more from Fractal about the nature of the breach, their team has confirmed that <strong>five Optimism users were impacted</strong>. Breached data did <strong>not</strong> include any direct association between a user’s personal identifying information and a team’s Optimism grant awards, nor their L1 or L2 addresses in use for grant awards. Email or other contact information provided to Fractal may have been subject to the data breach. The Fractal team can provide users with the most context about their specific cases and impact.</p>\n<p>The privacy of our community’s data is critically important to us. We reached out to Fractal to request deletion of any user data from Optimism community members. Because the data belongs to individuals and not Optimism, they informed us that users need to request data deletion personally. You can email privacy@fractal.id to request data deletion. Please feel free to use the following template:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>​\"Dear Fractal team,</p>\n<p>I hereby request the deletion of my account with Fractal ID and erasure of the underlying personal data.\"</p>\n<p>Please confirm via email when this deletion has been completed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fractal has assured us that they have reached out to all impacted users. If you have not received an email from noreply@fractal.id, then your data is not believed to have been among the records compromised.</p>\n<p>We’re following developments closely and our team is communicating with Fractal to advocate for Optimism users and their data protection.

A high degree of knowledge is required to understand the OP Stack’s different components, the impact of protocol development initiatives and the usefulness of tools that support OP chain operators. The hypothesis that round 5 is aiming to test is if experts make better OP allocation decisions on OP Stack contributions compared to non-experts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"research-questions-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#research-questions-1\"></a>Research Questions</h3>\n<p>The Retro Funding 5 governance experiment is designed around the following research questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are there significant differences in how experts versus non-experts vote to allocate resources to technical contributions?</li>\n<li>Are there significant differences between existing badgeholders and new guest voters, both in how they vote to allocate resources and in other characteristics?</li>\n<li>Will sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications improve the voter experience?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"expertise-measurement-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#expertise-measurement-2\"></a><strong>Expertise Measurement</strong></h3>\n<p>Expertise is measured via a score assigned to each individual based on their past Github activity relating to the OP Stack. The GitHub accounts of guest voters are collected in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393\">application flow to become a guest voter</a>. Badgeholders are invited to add their GitHub account to their <a href=\"https://retrofunding.optimism.io\">Optimist Profile</a> in the process of completing Season 6 onboarding. The scores are assigned using an algorithm developed through a collaboration between <a href=\"https://karma3labs.com/\">Karma3Labs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.opensource.observer/\">Open Source Observer</a>, and is based on <a href=\"https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/Lecture4/lecture4.html\">Hubs and Authorities</a>. The algorithm is more complex than <a href=\"https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/eigentrust.pdf\">EigenTrust</a>, because it incorporates two entities: GitHub Repos and GitHub Users, both of which can have ‘trust’ and give ‘trust’ to each other. The algorithm used to rank expertise will be open sourced after the conclusion of Round 5 to avoid influencing the experiment.

Random sampling does not guarantee that a particular sample is a perfect representation of the population, but rather allows for valid conclusions to be drawn about the entire population based on the sample. Another way of saying this is that the random sample approximates the full population. This is due to the equal probability of selection. Read more here <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Experimenting with Random Sampling in the Citizens' House</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"treatment-and-control-groups-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#treatment-and-control-groups-5\"></a>Treatment and control groups</h3>\n<p>Retroactive Public Goods Funding is an ongoing experiment, in which the Collective tests and validates different voting designs based on how well they perform at rewarding impact. Previous experiments were largely product iterations based on learnings from previous rounds and hypothesised improvements. For future rounds, experimentation will become more scientific to better understand cause and effect of different design choices. We believe this approach will allow the Collective to develop an industry-leading approach to metagovernance that will strengthen the design of the system over time.  Retro Funding 5 introduces the concept of treatment and control groups. In experimental design, the “treatment group” participates in the experiment, while the “control group” does not (representing the status quo.) This allows hypotheses to be validated or invalidated by comparing the results of the treatment group to the control group. Specifically, taking this approach in Round 5 will allow the Collective to generate actionable insights about the performance of expert voters compared to non-expert voters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"voting-process-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#voting-process-6\"></a>Voting Process</h3>\n<p>An iteration on Retro Funding voting design is the allocation of voters into subgroups. Each subgroup only votes on a specific category of projects (e.g. Ethereum Core Contributions, OP Stack Research &amp; Development, OP Stack Tooling). This has been a popular experimentation request and is one proposed methodology by which the Retro Funding voting process can be scaled to reward more projects. This change can be understood as a product iteration, as its validation largely relies on the change in performance data compared to previous rounds and badgeholder feedback, while there is no control group which would allow for more scientific comparison.</p>\n<p>Process Overview:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Subgroups are established</strong>: voters are (randomly) assigned into subgroups, the subgroups are equal in size and remain representative of the different voter groups.</li>\n<li><strong>Category allocation</strong>: All voters vote on the allocation of OP among the three categories of the round scope. These votes will be public.</li>\n<li><strong>Impact Evaluation</strong>: Each voter votes on the amount of retro rewards all projects within their assigned category should receive. Votes will be private to prevent intimidation and coercion, promote unbiased decision-making and protect against bribery.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"voting-design-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#voting-design-7\"></a>Voting design</h3>\n<p>The Foundation Mission “<a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/188\">Evaluating Voting Design Tradeoffs for Retro Funding</a>” is expected to deliver relevant insights into voting design tradeoffs, which will inform the selection of a voting mechanism for round 5. Further details on the implementation of impact = profit within the round, and the policy for conflicts of interests among badgeholders, will follow.</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2024 10:51:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8613"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613.rss","#text":"Retro Funding 5: Expert voting experiment"}},{"title":"Retro Funding 5: OP Stack - round details","dc:creator":"system","category":"Retro  Funding 🔴","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/601921ef4339aad2e29c73a73cd3ca40e0b5929c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dI7Gn3JxX4n0PqWvv3E128B4X6c.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/601921ef4339aad2e29c73a73cd3ca40e0b5929c_2_690x387.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"dI7Gn3JxX4n0PqWvv3E128B4X6c\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/601921ef4339aad2e29c73a73cd3ca40e0b5929c_2_690x387.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/601921ef4339aad2e29c73a73cd3ca40e0b5929c_2_1035x580.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/601921ef4339aad2e29c73a73cd3ca40e0b5929c_2_1380x774.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FEAABB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) 5 will reward contributors to the OP Stack, including core Ethereum infrastructure that supports or underpins the OP Stack, advancements in OP Stack research and development, and tooling which supports its accessibility and usability.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"timeline-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#timeline-1\"></a>Timeline</h3>\n<p>Please note that all dates are preliminary and might change.

Here are the key updates:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unified Rubric</strong>: This season, we will be using a single, general rubric that can be adapted to all Mission requests. The Grants Council has designed this rubric to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for all applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Discretionary Slots</strong>: Reviewers will now have three discretionary slots instead of one. These slots allow reviewers to assign a score between -2 and 4 to specific aspects of the application. When applying discretionary scores, reviewers must provide a clear explanation for their decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Final Scoring System</strong>: The final score for each Mission application will be calculated as the sum of all reviewer scores, divided by the number of reviewers who evaluated the application. This ensures that the scores are fair and representative of the overall consensus.</li>\n<li><strong>Preliminary Review</strong>: The preliminary review will be conducted by a single reviewer. This step aims to provide an initial assessment and identify any major issues before the full review takes place.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedback and Cycle 25</strong>: Any feedback received during the review process will be incorporated into the evaluation for Cycle 25. We encourage applicants to provide their feedback to the Grants Council by the designated deadline.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We believe these changes will lead to a more efficient and equitable review

Over the course of the season, the Milestone and Metrics Committee shall assess whether the Milestone Hub is well-suited to its purpose and may, with the assistance and guidance of the Operations Manager, adapt the Milestone Hub as it deems appropriate.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"prospective-applications-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#prospective-applications-3\"></a>Prospective Applications</h4>\n<p>In order to be considered as a finalist, an application must include multiple milestones. Milestones are intended to show good faith effort and a baseline of success toward the goals articulated in the grant application. Additional milestones (used to be called benchmark milestones) are intended to show impact to the Optimism Collective that can be used to assess the project in the future, and can be added to strengthen an application. The Milestones should be aimed at creating discrete, trackable milestones for each successful application.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of each Final Review, the Milestones and Metrics Committee will review each application selected by each of the grant reviewers to determine whether the application’s milestones meet the standard of sufficiency set forth in the Milestones Guidelines.</p>\n<p>In order to be eligible to become a finalist, an application must receive a favorable vote of a majority of the Milestones and Metrics Committee members verifying that the application’s milestones meet the standards of sufficiency.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"past-applications-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#past-applications-4\"></a>Past Applications</h4>\n<p>The Milestones and Metrics Committee shall make recommendations to the Foundation or Optimism Collective as to whether or not to proceed with the remainder of past seasons’ Experiments and Builders grants. In general, the Milestones and Metrics Committee shall not recommend proceeding with a project unless all critical milestones have been achieved (per the vote of the Committee).</p>\n<p>The Milestone and Metrics Committee is generally responsible for voting on whether or not milestones have been achieved. In circumstances where the Committee determines that it would require expertise beyond the capacity of the Committee, the Milestone and Metrics Committee Lead may submit a milestone for consideration of the Committee that originally voted to designate the application as a prior finalist. In such cases, the majority vote of the relevant committee shall be considered determinative.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Standard procedure</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applications for the continuation of a grant should be submitted to the Milestones Hub. (Season 6 will also be CharmVerse)</li>\n<li>In general, applications will be reviewed only after a project confirms that all relevant required milestones have been completed. However, the Milestone and Metrics Committee may consider requests to review individual milestones in certain cases.</li>\n<li>Absent an approval for a greater amount of time, critical milestones will be considered past due twelve months from the locking of the grant for Builders applications.</li>\n<li>Milestones and Metrics votes shall be recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Other procedures</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In cases where a project has failed to complete its critical milestones in the allotted time, the Committee will default to recommending against proceeding with any further steps of the grant. Projects are free to voluntarily recuse themselves from a grant if they are unable to finish before the deadline.</li>\n<li>In the case where a proposer makes a proposal to change the substance (or extend the time) of a critical milestone, the Committee may consider the change only if (a) the Committee determines that there is substantial good reason to support the request and (b) a super-majority of all of the Council reviewers vote in favor of the proposal.</li>\n<li>When relevant, the Committee shall wait for the Developer Advisory Board to confirm the completion of the critical milestones prior to confirming completion to the Foundation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The guidance in this section yields to any contrary rule, guidance, or vote from Token House or the Foundation.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"reviewer-metrics-accountability-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#reviewer-metrics-accountability-5\"></a>Reviewer Metrics Accountability</h4>\n<p>Similar to Season 5, the committee will ensure grant council reviewers communicate effectively with the grant applicants and are accountable for their work. For Season 6, specific metrics and processes as mandated by the charter will again include: reviewer comment frequency on substantive rubric components, reviewer comments on failed intake applications, reviewer attendance of committee meetings, reviewer voting on committee and full council polls.</p>\n<p>The metrics as a whole will possibly be adapted over the course of the season as best practices reveal themselves in this trial run period. The goal will not be to micromanage each reviewer but more so to identify and allocate additional support for those reviewers that need such, while also offering comparison between reviewers for delegates and token house members.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"official-record-and-rule-changes-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#official-record-and-rule-changes-6\"></a>Official Record and Rule Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Council will maintain a tracker of applications considered, finalists named, milestones for finalists, and the progress / completion of milestones.</li>\n<li>On a bi-weekly basis, the Council may review the effectiveness of its internal procedures and make proposals for improvement. The Committee can amend the internal procedures by a simple majority vote of the members of both Committees (provided that any vote to amend the rubric comports with the procedures described above). Amendments will be recorded as a comment to this post.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"rules-of-decision-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#rules-of-decision-7\"></a>Rules of Decision</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If one or more Committee members abstains from a vote, a vote will pass by the simple majority vote of the remaining members, provided there are more than one voting members remaining. If only one member of a Committee votes, the result will be to take no action on the proposed matter. For instance, if the matter being voted on relates to whether or not to include an application in the final review, the result will be not to include the application in the final review.</li>\n<li>Any Council-wide votes must include members of each Committee to achieve a quorum.</li>\n<li>The Grants Council Lead may correct any clear errors in the Internal Procedures or resolve any conflicting provisions. For resolving conflicts, the Lead may submit a question of the best resolution to a vote of the Committee members, the results of which may be recorded on the Landing Page.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/milestone-assessments-for-s6/8598\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/milestone-assessments-for-s6/8598","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 13:39:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8598"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/milestone-assessments-for-s6/8598.rss","#text":"Milestone Assessments for S6"}},{"title":"Season 6: Security Council Nomination Template - Cohort A","dc:creator":"system","category":"Elections","description":"<h1><a name=\"season-6-security-council-nomination-template-cohort-a-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#season-6-security-council-nomination-template-cohort-a-1\"></a>Season 6 Security Council Nomination Template - Cohort A</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"please-paste-your-completed-nomination-herehttpsgovoptimismiotseason-6-security-council-cohort-a-nomination-thread8588-following-the-instructions-at-the-top-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#please-paste-your-completed-nomination-herehttpsgovoptimismiotseason-6-security-council-cohort-a-nomination-thread8588-following-the-instructions-at-the-top-2\"></a>Please paste your completed nomination <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-security-council-cohort-a-nomination-thread/8588\">here</a>, following the instructions at the top.</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"security-council-member-self-nomination-template-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#security-council-member-self-nomination-template-3\"></a>Security Council Member <strong>Self-Nomination Template</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Please keep your answers as concise as possible while conveying all relevant information.</em><br>\n<em>All nominations will require 8 Top 100 delegate approvals.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Please indicate if you are running to be the Council Lead or a Council Member:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Does this nomination represent an individual or organization:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Candidate country of residence (or, if an entity, incorporation and principle place of business):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Have you previously served on Optimism’s Security Council:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Have you previously served on any other Council or Board in the Collective:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Are you a representative of OP Labs:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Are you a representative of another OP Chain:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you are a delegate, please provide the link to your delegate profile:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you are a member of the Citizens’ House, please link to your most recent attestation here:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please outline your contributions, and their impact, to the Optimism ecosystem to date:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please demonstrate any non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this role:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your technical background, including your expertise score (more info on this shortly):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md\">Operating Manual</a>:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand that election is subject to successful completion of a Foundation screen which</strong> <strong>may include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract:</strong> [No/Yes]</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities.

There is no limit to the number of terms a Security Council participant may serve.</p>\n<p>Top 100 delegates may provide approval by pasting the below language as a comment under a candidate’s nomination:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>”I am an Optimism delegate [link to your <a href=\"https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/your_address\">delegate commitment</a>] with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a name=\"eligibility-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#eligibility-considerations-5\"></a><strong>Eligibility Considerations</strong></h3>\n<p>Participants on the Security Council may be either individuals or entities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Entity requirements:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Active and offers a service that benefits the blockchain community</li>\n<li>Operating for at least one year with sufficient runway to continue for at least one year</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All participants on the Security Council, whether individuals or entities, should be selected in accordance with the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reputation.</strong> Known, trusted individuals or entities that have demonstrated consistent alignment with the Optimistic Vision.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical competency.</strong> Baseline proficiency with the OP Stack and secure key management and signing standards. <em>Additionally, candidates may be asked to sign into the OP Atlas app, connect GitHub, verify their wallet and calculate an expertise score. There is no minimum requirement for an expertise score, but it can serve as an indicator to help delegates evaluate a candidate’s technical expertise.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Alignment.</strong> Participants should not possess conflicts of interest that will regularly impact their ability to make impartial decisions in the performance of their role. Potential conflicts of interest could be, but are not limited to, affiliations with direct Optimism competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects or self-dealing, etc. There should be no more than 3 members serving on other Security Councils. There are 3 members serving on other Security Councils in Cohort B, which means <strong>candidates serving on other Security Councils are not eligible for this election (Cohort A)</strong> and delegates should not provide approvals on ineligible nominations.</li>\n<li><strong>Ability to participate.</strong>  A candidate’s willingness and ability to actively participate and fulfil the member responsibilities, dedicating an average of approximately 5 active hours per month hours per month, should be considered. Please note that there is an “on-call” aspect to this role that is not fully encompassed in the active hours estimate.</li>\n<li><strong>Geographic diversity.</strong> The number of participants that reside in any country should be less than the quorum required for multisig action.  The Foundation is responsible for ensuring this criteria is met. If a new member would surpass the threshold of signers from any one country, the next qualifying runner up will fill their place.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversity of interests.</strong> No more than 1 elected member is associated with a particular entity, or that entity’s employees or affiliates.

Elections use approval voting. Approval voting is set up such that delegates can place a vote for any number of nominees with their full voting power. In the case of approval/ranked choice votes, delegates may vote for themselves, so long as they also cast votes for the remaining elected positions.</p>\n<p>Once elected, all participants will be required to pass an eligibility screening process before being added to the Council. This process may include KYC/AML and sanctions screening, and a requirement that the member sign a standard contract, which will be implemented at the discretion of the Optimism Foundation.

By improving sensemaking capabilities, we aim to increase meaningful participation in governance and citizen confidence.</p>\n<p>Sensemaking is the process by which individuals and groups create shared meaning and understanding from complex, ambiguous, or uncertain environment in order to facilitate effective decision-making and action.</p>\n<p>Sensemaking is crucial for DAOs due to their decentralized nature, which often involves participants with different cultural backgrounds, motivations, and levels of engagement. Some key aspects of sensemaking that are relevant to DAO governance include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Surfacing and synthesizing diverse perspectives: DAOs need mechanisms to gather input from a wide range of participants and to identify patterns and insights that may not be immediately apparent.</li>\n<li>Facilitating dialogue and deliberation: Sensemaking in DAOs requires creating spaces for participants to exchange ideas, clarify assumptions, and build shared understanding, even if they don’t always reach full consensus.</li>\n<li>Balancing scale and context: As DAOs grow, they need sensemaking processes that can operate at scale without losing the richness and nuance of individual experiences and local knowledge.</li>\n<li>Navigating power dynamics and reputation: Sensemaking in DAOs must account for the influence of informal power structures, reputation systems, and the potential for exclusion or marginalization of certain voices.</li>\n<li>Enabling distributed action: Effective sensemaking should not only lead to shared understanding but also enable participants to take coordinated action in a decentralized fashion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Implementing advanced sensemaking in Optimism can significantly enhance the quality of deliberation, ultimately contributing to more robust and effective governance processes.</p>\n<p><strong>What is required to execute this Mission Request?</strong><br>\nThe selected teams or individuals will be expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct research on existing sensemaking frameworks and their applicability to DAO governance.</li>\n<li>Develop a sensemaking framework tailored to Optimism’s governance structure.</li>\n<li>Create a solution to implement this framework, emphasizing:\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing citizen engagement and participation</li>\n<li>Enhancing understanding of complex governance proposals, especially upgrade vetos</li>\n<li>Facilitating informed deliberation (between delegates as well)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Integrate the solution with existing governance processes and tooling.</li>\n<li>Provide comprehensive documentation and educational resources for the community.</li>\n<li>Collaborate with core developer teams to ensure that sensemaking tooling can adapt to evolving governance structures, including potential onchain execution of governance outcomes.</li>\n<li>Maintain and iterate on the solution based on community feedback and observed impact for a minimum of 12 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Milestones:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Research phase completion and framework proposal (2 months)</li>\n<li>Initial tool development and community testing (4 months)</li>\n<li>Full implementation and integration with existing governance processes (3 months)</li>\n<li>Comprehensive documentation and educational resources creation (2 months)</li>\n<li>Ongoing maintenance and iteration based on feedback (12 months from full implementation)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase in votable supply of OP tokens towards the 100M OP target</li>\n<li>Percentage of Citizens who report feeling confident when voting on upgrade vetos</li>\n<li>Increase in the number of active delegates and delegation rate</li>\n<li>Improvement in the quality of governance proposals as measured by community feedback and successful implementation rates</li>\n<li>Reduction in the time to reach consensus on complex governance decisions</li>\n<li>Growth in the number of unique addresses participating in governance discussions and voting</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Impact</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced clarity and understanding of governance issues, particularly complex topics like upgrade vetos</li>\n<li>Improved ability to synthesize diverse perspectives and reach well-informed decisions</li>\n<li>Increased engagement and satisfaction of DAO members with the governance process</li>\n<li>Contribution to the development of a comprehensive framework for mapping decentralization beyond technical properties</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Has anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?</strong> No</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts -

When activated, the Kardashev artifact creates a blue circle within which all planets can instantly transfer their energy to the central planet, making it a powerful tool for resource management.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DarkSea NFT Trading Market Update</strong>: We updated the DarkSea trading market for in-game artifacts (NFT721), allowing players to trade artifacts freely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bounty Hunter System</strong>: We implemented the Bounty Hunter system, enabling players to post assassination bounties on specific planets. Players can attack these planets to earn bounties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>In-Game Resource Trading System</strong>: Players can now purchase planets, spaceships, and planet skins, allowing them to acquire the resources they need to better compete in the game rankings.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"relevant-information-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#relevant-information-3\"></a><strong>Relevant Information</strong></h2>\n<p>Game website: <a href=\"https://dfares-round3.netlify.app/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dfares-round3.netlify.app/</a></p>\n<p>DFAres v0.1 Round 3 is deployed on Redstone mainnet.<br>\ncontract address: 0xA0e198CBD1B5f8749F57Aa8d60a8660d23B96957</p>\n<p>For more detailed updates, please refer to the player guide:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/DFAres-Round-3-Guide-3980998d8f65440085c116ba0df0d99a?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dfares.notion.site/DFAres-Round-3-Guide-3980998d8f65440085c116ba0df0d99a?pvs=25</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"open-source-code-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#open-source-code-4\"></a><strong>Open Source Code</strong></h2>\n<p>Core Game : <a href=\"https://github.com/dfarchon/DFARES-v0.1\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - dfarchon/DFARES-v0.1: Dark Forest Community Rounds</a></p>\n<p>Tag: v0.1.3-backup</p>\n<p>Alternatively, view the main branch with commit ID ce15b5b3d21a96568d16a79e44adc16c9942b493</p>\n<p>Bounty Hunter: <a href=\"https://github.com/dfarchon/DF-ARTEMIS\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - dfarchon/DF-ARTEMIS: Planet-targeted bounty mercenary system for Dark Forest.</a></p>\n<p>In-Game Artifact (NFT) Trading Market: <a href=\"https://github.com/dfarchon/darksea-market\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - dfarchon/darksea-market: The DarkSae Market for Dark Forest</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"whats-next-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#whats-next-5\"></a><strong>What’s next</strong></h2>\n<p>You can review all of the upcoming milestones and deliverables on <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/dark-forest-ares-2473027417469651\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CharmVerse</a>.</p>\n<p>We’ve already started the development on next Milestone: DFAres v0.1 Round 4 and prepare to hold <strong>DF Ares v0.1 Round 4 public test</strong> in Augest.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"feedback-and-feature-requests-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#feedback-and-feature-requests-6\"></a>Feedback and feature requests</h2>\n<p>We hope to hear your feedback on our development content and design ideas, as well as any features you would like to see introduced in future development.</p>\n<p>You can find the game website and open source code in <strong>Relevant Information</strong> or <strong>Oen Source Code</strong> section.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"contact-info-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#contact-info-7\"></a>Contact info</h2>\n<p>Please reach out to us by commenting here or using any of the contact information below.

The document sets forth the processes the DAB will follow in fulfilling our <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/zach-obront-developer-advisory-board-operating-budget/8141\">charter</a>, including supporting the grants council, token house, and citizens with evaluating mission requests, mission applications, and protocol upgrades.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Mission Applications</strong></p>\n<p>The DAB will review all technical mission applications per Grant Council request. Our process to perform this duty is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Grants council will provide a list of applications they would like feedback on at least 7 days before the end of each voting cycle.</li>\n<li>DAB Ops Lead will organize the requests in a spreadsheet, which will be shared with the DAB, with three phases of assignment: (1) any applications that interact with the core roadmap will be assigned to one of the reps from OP Labs or Base, (2) DAB Members will have 24 hours to proactively claim applications to review, (3) after 24 hours, Ops Lead will randomly assign the remaining applications such that each application has 2-3 reviewers (depending on the quantity to review).</li>\n<li>Feedback will be provided in the spreadsheet with at least 72 hours left in the cycle, with each application given one of the following indications: yes, no, or veto.</li>\n<li>In the event of a veto, other DAB members will be invited to review. In the case of a unanimous veto, the DAB will veto the mission application. Otherwise, no veto action will be taken.</li>\n<li>After feedback has been provided, the Grants Council will have the option to set up a call to review feedback and discuss details, if they have any questions. All feedback (besides vetos) will be non-binding, and the Grants Council can take it into account as they see fit.</li>\n<li>Feedback will also be shared publicly by the DAB directly on the Mission Request Application in Charmverse, to provide insight to applicants (as well as the opportunity to clarify or improve their application).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2) Protocol Upgrades</strong></p>\n<p>The DAB is responsible for providing plain English summaries of upgrades and blocking upgrades they believe are unsafe (by withholding the approval comment on the forum draft post). Our process to perform this duty is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a new upgrade is posted to the forums, the Upgrade Czar (together with the DAB Lead) will review and write a plain english summary within 72 hours.</li>\n<li>The Upgrade Czar will also share the summary with the DAB, along with their opinion on whether the upgrade is safe.</li>\n<li>If any DAB member believes that approval should be withheld, the DAB will set up a call to discuss, which will end with a vote.</li>\n<li>If a simple majority of DAB members vote “no”, the DAB will withhold the approval comment. The Upgrade Czar (or, in the case that the Upgrade Czar disagrees with the vote, another member) will be responsible for writing up an explanation to share with the community documenting the reasoning and what would be required for the DAB to be comfortable accepting the upgrade.</li>\n<li>In the event that any DAB member abstains and the result is a tie, the DAB Lead will make the final decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3) Reactive Feedback &amp; Support</strong></p>\n<p>The DAB will be available to provide a la carte technical feedback to other councils and board who request it. Our process to perform this duty is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any council or board can reach out to the DAB either by (a) tagging the board on Discord (<span class=\"mention\">@Developer</span> Advisory Board), (b) tagging any member of the board in a forum post or (c) reaching out to any DAB member directly.</li>\n<li>Any requests will be shared with the DAB to allow members to proactively offer to help.</li>\n<li>If no proactive offers are made, the DAB Lead will assign the project to a DAB Member.</li>\n<li>When relevant, the DAB Member who provided the feedback will share a summary of the request and feedback provided on the forum in case the community can benefit from it.</li>\n<li>Examples of this type of work include: feedback on Mission Requests, reviewing milestones on existing grants, requests for brainstorming or code review from OP Labs, helping OP Labs find talent in their hiring process, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4) Discovering New Ways to Support the Collective</strong></p>\n<p>While the processes above are the core responsibilities of the DAB, a part of our Season 6 mission is to discover and expand our ability to support the collective. Our process to perform this duty is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A “Developer Advisory Board Feedback” thread will be created on the Optimism forum where community stakeholders can make requests, give feedback, and share ideas.</li>\n<li>Community calls will be scheduled bimonthly (in July, September and November) to discuss ideas and feedback with the community. Summaries of these calls will be posted on the above thread.</li>\n<li>The DAB will proactively explore best ideas (based on subjective judgment), using the forum thread as the source of truth for all ideas. Each DAB member will be expected to experiment with at least one idea over the course of the season.</li>\n<li>At end of season, the DAB will share a summary on the forum of exactly what experiments were run, the results, which ideas will persist as core responsibilities next season, and the best ideas remaining to be tried in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-s6-internal-operating-procedures/8558\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-s6-internal-operating-procedures/8558","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 02:34:59 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8558"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-s6-internal-operating-procedures/8558.rss","#text":"Developer Advisory Board - S6 Internal Operating Procedures"}},{"title":"[Request for feedback] Building a Farcaster frame as a governance tool to facilitate matchmaking between OP holders and delegates","dc:creator":"Cotabe","category":"Delegates  🏛","description":"<h2><a name=\"gm-optimists-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#gm-optimists-1\"></a>GM Optimists!</h2>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We are building a Farcaster frame to help OP token holders seamlessly find an ideal match to delegate their OP.</p>\n<p>We are a small team supported by Raid Guild to build this MVP for Optimism to help increase the delegated supply of OP to active delegates and foster deeper alignment between delegates and delegators. We also want to bring Raid Guild closer to the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We are taking inspiration from Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) to create a Delegate Match Application (DMA) for Optimism. Voting Advice Applications are online tools designed to help voters identify which political parties or candidates most closely align with their personal views and preferences. Users answer a series of questions about key issues, and the VAA matches their responses with the positions of various political parties or candidates. The outcome is usually a percentage score or a list showing which parties or candidates the user aligns with most closely, thus aiding in making informed voting decisions.</p>\n<p>VAAs have been widely used across Europe. By providing voters with tools to easily compare their own policy preferences to those of various parties, VAAs have significantly improved electoral participation and the quality of democratic governance.</p>\n<p>We aim to adapt this model and build this application for the Optimism community in the open to make a more user-centric MVP.
