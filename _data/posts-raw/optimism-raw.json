My work at the Worldcoin Foundation includes integrating advanced cryptographic protocols, improving identity verification without compromising user privacy, for World ID.</p>\n<p>One of the key contributions was collaborating with Optimism and Ethereum’s technical teams to implement the KZG ceremony that was needed for EIP-4844. I also contributed ruint, the arithmetic library that Reth (and hence op-reth and sp1-reth) uses for the 256-bit EVM virtual machine.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-Optimism Experience:</strong></p>\n<p>I bring significant experience in cryptography, blockchain, and decentralized systems to this role. My career includes significant contributions to several key projects in the blockchain space, where I have focused on privacy and scalability. At Worldcoin Foundation, I lead efforts to develop scalable, privacy-preserving technologies that address some of the most pressing challenges in decentralized identity. My contributions include the first open source compatible Stark prover, the Hubble L2 node implementation, EIP-712, and the gas optimized EVM assembly implementations of muldiv, exp and log used by many prominent projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Background:</strong></p>\n<p>My GitHub handle is <span class=\"mention\">@recmo</span> and I write technical notes on <a href=\"http://xn--2-umb.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2π.com</a>. I love to learn and dive into complex new subjects, which has given me experience in compilers, cryptography, databases, numerical algorithms, and many programming languages, including C++, Rust, Go, Python, Solidity, and EVM/x86/Aarch64 assembly. My current interests lie in cryptographic protocols, privacy-preserving technologies, and scalable decentralized systems. I have a strong focus on designing and implementing solutions that maintain the balance between security, scalability, and user privacy.</p>\n<p>I graduated from Sir Stephen Hawking’s theoretical physics department at Cambridge University, Business Administration at the University of Twente and the GSP of Singularity University at NASA Ames. Since then I’ve co-founded a cybersecurity company, a blockchain company, and joined 0x project early.</p>\n<p><strong>Experience with Relevant Member (or Lead) Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>At Worldcoin Foundation, I regularly collaborate with various stakeholders in the Web3 ecosystem, including security experts, protocol developers, and governance bodies. This experience has taught me the importance of transparency, collaboration, and open communication when making complex governance decisions.</p>\n<p>I am particularly focused on integrating feedback from a diverse range of stakeholders, ensuring that our solutions meet the needs of the broader community while adhering to the highest standards of security and privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Philosophy on What Makes a Good Security Council Member:</strong></p>\n<p>A good Security Council member should have a deep understanding of all technical matters involved and the project’s commitments. They should be able to independently judge the effects of operations on complex technical systems. An independent curious mind experienced in adversarial thinking is critical here.</p>\n<p>During normal operation they should strike the right balance between strict adherence to process and expediency. During emergencies they should be responsive, communicative and make decisions with exceptional judgment of technical matters and a strong moral understanding of the project’s goals and expectations. They should remain effective when faced with partial information and dilemma’s.</p>\n<p><strong>Anticipated Conflicts of Interest:</strong></p>\n<p>I will act in the best interest of the Collective, but I want to acknowledge that Worldcoin Foundation is deeply involved in privacy-preserving identity solutions, which may be deployed in other ecosystems that could have competing interests with Optimism.</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding of Removal and Election Processes:</strong></p>\n<p>I understand that I may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in the Operating Manual, and that election is subject to a successful Foundation screen, which may include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract.</p>\n<p><strong>Commitment to Responsibilities:</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I am able to commit ~5 active hours per month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities, with an understanding of the “on-call” aspect of this role.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-nomination-remco-bloemen/8714\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-nomination-remco-bloemen/8714","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 22:01:40 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8714"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-nomination-remco-bloemen/8714.rss","#text":"Security Council Nomination: Remco Bloemen"}},{"title":"Security Council Nomination: Everett Hildenbrandt (Runtime Verification)","dc:creator":"ehildenb","category":"Elected  Representatives 💼","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-39327-season-6-security-council-nomination-template-cohort-a-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39327-season-6-security-council-nomination-template-cohort-a-1\"></a>Season 6 Security Council Nomination Template - Cohort A</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39327-please-paste-your-completed-nomination-here-following-the-instructions-at-the-top-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39327-please-paste-your-completed-nomination-here-following-the-instructions-at-the-top-2\"></a>Please paste your completed nomination here, following the instructions at the top.</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39327-security-council-member-self-nomination-template-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39327-security-council-member-self-nomination-template-3\"></a>Security Council Member <strong>Self-Nomination Template</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Please keep your answers as concise as possible while conveying all relevant information.</em><br>\n<em>All nominations will require 8 Top 100 delegate approvals.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Please indicate if you are running to be the Council Lead or a Council Member:</strong></p>\n<p>Council Member</p>\n<p><strong>Does this nomination represent an individual or organization:</strong></p>\n<p>Organization</p>\n<p><strong>Candidate country of residence (or, if an entity, incorporation and principle place of business):</strong></p>\n<p>USA</p>\n<p><strong>Have you previously served on Optimism’s Security Council:</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>Have you previously served on any other Council or Board in the Collective:</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>Are you a representative of OP Labs:</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>Are you a representative of another OP Chain:</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>If you are a delegate, please provide the link to your delegate profile:</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>If you are a member of the Citizens’ House, please link to your most recent attestation here:</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>Please outline your contributions, and their impact, to the Optimism ecosystem to date:</strong></p>\n<p>We have worked with the OP Labs team on integrating <a href=\"https://kontrol.runtimeverification.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kontrol</a> —our formal verification tool for Solidity and EVM smart contracts—into their CI.

This opens up the possibility of deriving new metrics that look more holistically at a project’s contributions <em>relative to some baseline</em>.</p>\n<p>In baseball, there is a famous advanced metric called “WAR” which allows for player comparisons across teams, leagues, years, and eras. There isn’t a single, standard formula for WAR. Different sources use various calculations, but they all rely on the same public datasets, publish their methodologies, and follow similar principles. Some key points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WAR includes a mix of offensive and defensive metrics, making it a more holistic measure than ones that focus on a single aspect.</li>\n<li>It adjusts for different player positions, recognizing that not all positions are equally important defensively.</li>\n<li>The averages and constants are derived empirically by looking at performance over a specific period, such as a single season or multiple seasons (an “era”).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the context of a grant program like Retro Funding, we want to understand how effective each round is relative to all the other incentive programs happening (or not happening) in the space AND have some way of aggregating the quality of all the proects being supported.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WAR could help identify not only successful projects but also weak points within an ecosystem — whether in developer tooling, user engagement, or protocol innovation — that need more investment. It could be used to determine eligibility for grant rounds or power oracles that allocate ongoing funding streams to high-performing projects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The post includes a few strawman proposals for what a WAR for OSS projects or WAR for protocols might look like. The challenge lies in identifying metrics that not only capture current activity but also predict future growth and network effects. Realistically, it’s going to take some time to have decent WAR models running in production.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39312-some-next-steps-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39312-some-next-steps-3\"></a>Some next steps</h2>\n<p>The post also include some ideas for how to get started…</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start Simple</strong>: The first version of WAR was fairly basic. Over time, more sophisticated versions emerged. Similarly, the initial metrics for decentralized ecosystems don’t need to be perfect. Starting with something simple allows for gradual refinement and improvement (see: <a href=\"http://principles-wiki.net/principles:gall_s_law\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gall’s Law</a>).</li>\n<li><strong>Embrace Competing Implementations</strong>: As mentioned earlier, there is no single standard calculation for WAR. Even though the data and methodologies are public, there’s vibrant debate about which method is best. In an industry as dynamic as crypto, this diversity of approaches is a strength, encouraging innovation and continuous improvement.</li>\n<li><strong>Engage the Research Community</strong>: WAR models are like catnip for data enthusiasts. They offer endless opportunities for simulation, experimentation, and visualization. By providing well-documented, easy-to-use datasets and stoking interest in the results from protocol leaders and governance teams, we can create a garden of catnip for researchers and data nerds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/war-for-public-goods\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">full post</a> and let us know if you have ideas for a WAR model or anything else metrics-related!</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/advanced-metrics-for-retro-funding/8711\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/advanced-metrics-for-retro-funding/8711","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 17:32:16 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8711"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/advanced-metrics-for-retro-funding/8711.rss","#text":"Advanced metrics for Retro Funding"}},{"title":"Optimism Fractal Season 4","dc:creator":"DanSingjoy","category":"Community Calls","description":"<p>Dear Optimists,</p>\n<p>Optimism Fractal is returning from summer break and we’re excited to embark on Season 4!

Although limiting grant amounts based on a team’s reputation is still a valuable concept, the implementation of Trust Tiers has revealed some limitations. As such, the Trust Tiers program will see some significant changes starting in Season 6 and beyond. These changes are informed by the experiences of builders and the Grants Council, and adhere to <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/\">the principle of iterative governance design and experimentation</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39262-trust-tiers-what-we-learned-in-seasons-4-and-5-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39262-trust-tiers-what-we-learned-in-seasons-4-and-5-1\"></a>Trust Tiers - what we learned in Seasons 4 and 5</h3>\n<p>These learnings derive from a survey with five members of the Season 5 Grants Council and four builders, as well as several informal conversations with Grants Council members.</p>\n<p>The Grants Council rated the concept of Trust Tiers as neutral, but rated Trust Tiers in their current form as not very useful. Here are the reasons given:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trust Tiers do not accurately reflect teams’ reputations. Some teams seem ‘overvalued’ and others ‘undervalued’ based on their Trust Tier. Specific limitations called out:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Reputation gained in other ecosystems isn’t transferable to Optimism.</li>\n<li>There have been many edge cases where teams pivoted and lost their Tier, or trusted contributors left a project that retained its Tier.</li>\n<li>Trust Tier status gained through Retro Round 3 was called out as seemingly inaccurate or adding noise to the data.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Trust Tiers are very hard to verify, making them difficult to use effectively.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The Grants Council must rely on a project’s self-reported Trust Tier until the final stages of a grant application, when they verify the self-reported Trust Tier.</li>\n<li>This is because the operational overhead of checking each applicant’s Trust Tier up-front is too high.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The builders surveyed were neutral on Trust Tiers, mostly understanding the concept and aware of the Trust Tier their project is in. The following limitations were highlighted:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Teams aren’t always clear how to calculate their Trust Tier when they’ve had multiple grant types or they fall into a gray area.</li>\n<li>Trust Tiers may benefit from including other reputation markers beyond the team having previously received a grant.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39262-diagnosing-the-problems-with-trust-tiers-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39262-diagnosing-the-problems-with-trust-tiers-2\"></a>Diagnosing the problems with Trust Tiers</h3>\n<p>The primary issue with the Trust Tiers is not that the reputation of teams doesn’t matter in grant decisions, but that the Tiers have not been an effective method of predicting whether a team would be successful at completing a Mission Request. In addition, manual verification of the Tiers is inefficient and may lead to confusion.</p>\n<p>Therefore, our objective should be to build an alternative reputation model that can more effectively predict whether a team will successfully complete a grant, with the ultimate goal of reducing the number of incomplete mission requests and grants clawed back and increasing the successful outcomes of completed grants.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of Trust Tiers was based on subjective contributions to the Optimism Collective for each Tier’s qualification. These criteria are composed of trust signals like ‘has previously worked for the Optimism Collective’ or ‘has earned over a certain amount of OP in Retro Funding’. Each Tier’s set of criteria was a best guess at which signals might be relevant.</p>\n<p>The next generation of Trust Tiers should be built bottom-up, using the underlying trust signals as training data to build a machine learning model that effectively predicts a team’s likelihood of success. This approach is more likely to yield Tiers that effectively segment teams by reputation. It may also reveal that a continuous trust score (e.g. a scale of 0-100) is more useful than dividing teams into levels.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39262-trust-tiers-in-season-6-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39262-trust-tiers-in-season-6-3\"></a>Trust Tiers in Season 6</h3>\n<p>To re-build the Trust Tiers bottom-up, the first priority is to grow the number of trust signals available about projects. Only then can the Collective attempt to build a model or models that effectively categorize or score teams.</p>\n<p><strong>Since the Trust Tiers do not appear to be working in their current form, they will no longer be used in Season 6.</strong> The Grants Council will make grant decisions based on the information that is available to them about the teams applying.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Collective will focus on developing the trust signals that underlie the Tiers, and record these as attestations. As part of this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All teams doing work in the Collective as part of Retro Funding or Mission Grants will be asked to create a persistent project profile, to which they collect attestations.</li>\n<li>Teams working on Foundation and Token House Mission Requests will receive attestations upon grant completion.\n<ul>\n<li>Attestations will include the OP amount and season in which the grant was issued.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Retro Funding awards will also be represented as attestations issued to the projects that applied. OP amount and Round are included in the <a href=\"https://docs.optimism.io/chain/identity/schemas#retro-funding-rewards\">attestation schema</a>.</li>\n<li>The owners of user interfaces that include project profiles are encouraged to display relevant project attestations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is one of several initiatives the Foundation is bootstrapping in Season 6 to equip the Collective to be able to make data driven decisions. In future seasons as the project model gains more usage, the Collective can continue to develop the number and variety of trust signals available.</p>\n<p>Please see <a href=\"https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/project-and-individual-identity-in-the-collective/#\">the governance docs</a> for more detailed information on how projects and people are represented in the Collective.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/trust-tiers-2-0/8698\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/trust-tiers-2-0/8698","pubDate":"Mon, 12 Aug 2024 07:58:46 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8698"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/trust-tiers-2-0/8698.rss","#text":"Trust Tiers 2.0"}},{"title":"Security Council Nomination: ml_sudo","dc:creator":"ml_sudo","category":"✨ General","description":"<p><em>My name is Michelle Lai but I go by ml_sudo in community.</em> Twitter: <span class=\"mention\">@michlai007</span> (<a href=\"https://x.com/michlai007\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Please indicate if you are running to be the Council Lead or a Council Member:</strong> Council Member</p>\n<p><strong>Does this nomination represent an individual or organization:</strong> Individual</p>\n<p><strong>Candidate country of residence (or, if an entity, incorporation and principle place of business):</strong> Nomadic (Asia, Mexico)</p>\n<p><strong>Have you previously served on Optimism’s Security Council:</strong> No<br>\n<strong>Have you previously served on any other Council or Board in the Collective:</strong> No<br>\n<strong>Are you a representative of OP Labs:</strong> No<br>\n<strong>Are you a representative of another OP Chain:</strong> No<br>\n<strong>If you are a delegate, please provide the link to your delegate profile:</strong> N.A.<br>\n<strong>If you are a member of the Citizens’ House, please link to your most recent attestation here:</strong> N.A.</p>\n<p><strong>Please outline your contributions, and their impact, to the Optimism ecosystem to date:</strong></p>\n<p>I am on the governance council (the Spartan Council) at Synthetix.

Overall, since beginning my career in 2007, I’ve picked up broad experience in collapsing uncertainty in complex situations.</p>\n<p>Here is more color on what I am about, since many might not yet know me.</p>\n<p>From a motivation angle, I got into crypto in 2016 after one talk by Vitalik in Hong Kong where he shared a use case that immediately resonated: smart contracts for escrow payments. I had just arranged a 3-day (!) escrow for $100mn for my day job, and my eyes popped out at the ~$300,000 price tag - and there Vitalik was with a superior solution.

Agora is a Core Dev of the OP Collective and builds cutting edge governance solutions for the health and security of the OP Collective. In short, we were pivotal in moving OP Governance Onchain, let me explain how we did that.</p>\n<p>Our primary contribution in the past few years has been: <a href=\"https://vote.optimism.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vote.optimism.io</a> and the work we did on the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/64\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Foundation Mission #64 in 2023</a>. This lead us to the rebuilding and design of the <a href=\"https://vote.optimism.io/changelog\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">advanced delegation</a> schema for OP delegates and the launch of a new governor. Each day, each week, we ensure that the team at Agora is doing all we can to make the voting and delegation experience better for OP Delegates, and that the vote is strong, and secure. Whether we are building new voting modules like our Approval Voting module in 2023 (Pick a choice voting) or our new Optimistic Voting Module in 2024, we are pushing the boundaries and delivering quality service that gets better each week.</p>\n<p>We were also the team behind: <a href=\"https://retrofunding.optimism.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://retrofunding.optimism.io/</a>, the website and app that powers the new OP Project creation schema on EAS. We also built and maintain the <a href=\"https://github.com/voteagora/op-atlas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OP Atlas Github</a> repo that powers the code for the RetroFunding website.  and the API that powers the RetroPGF Voting process over here: <a href=\"https://vote.optimism.io/api_v1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://vote.optimism.io/api_v1</a>.</p>\n<p>We are deeply proud of the work we do for the Collective and we are humbled to have the opportunity to work so deeply with so many great Collective members.</p>\n<p>Finally, at Agora we work with other incredible DAOs (Uniswap, ENS, Nouns) and are able to bring their ideas to the OP Collective and export what works for OP to other communities, making the entire Web3 ecosystem better and expanding the Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>Please demonstrate any non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this role:</strong></p>\n<p>Over the past two decades in the tech industry, I’ve established myself as a leader in building and scaling complex, real-time financial systems and large-scale platforms. My experience spans from innovative startups to established tech giants, always focusing on creating solutions that empower users and foster collaboration.</p>\n<p>At Clearco, as VP of Product and Growth, I spearheaded the development of groundbreaking financial products like Invoice Funding and Buy Now, Pay Later. These initiatives supported over 5,000 founders and facilitated the movement of nearly $500 million in capital. The core of my work involved constructing scalable systems capable of handling intricate financial transactions in real time, ensuring both seamless operations and sustainable growth.</p>\n<p>Prior to Clearco, I played a pivotal role at Tilt, where I managed and scaled a robust system enabling peer-to-peer payments. This work contributed significantly to the platform’s success, ultimately leading to its acquisition by Airbnb. Throughout my career, I’ve consistently leveraged my deep technical expertise and strategic understanding of product growth to build and lead teams that deliver cutting-edge solutions in the fintech space.</p>\n<p>My professional journey extends beyond these roles. I’ve founded over 10 startups, successfully exiting from two. This entrepreneurial experience has honed my ability to manage and optimize large, complex systems requiring real-time processing and high reliability.</p>\n<p>What truly drives me is a passion for grassroots growth, community building, and collective decision-making. This enthusiasm fuels my commitment to creating products that genuinely empower users, particularly in the Web3 space. Here, decentralized governance and community-driven initiatives are not just buzzwords, but the foundation of innovation.</p>\n<p>As I continue to lead and innovate in the tech space, my focus remains on creating value through technology while fostering strong, collaborative communities. It’s about building systems and products that make a tangible difference, all while remembering that our most valuable resource is time - and how we choose to spend it.</p>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your technical background, including your github handle (this will be used to calculate your github expertise score and will be added to your nomination before it goes to a vote by the Foundation):</strong></p>\n<p>My github handle is <a href=\"https://github.com/kent\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@kent</a> on Github.</p>\n<p>Throughout my 20+ year career in the tech industry, I’ve cultivated a deep and diverse technical background, specializing in building and scaling complex, real-time financial systems and large-scale platforms.</p>\n<p>My expertise spans across multiple programming languages and frameworks, with a particular focus on those commonly used in fintech and blockchain development. I’m proficient in languages such as Python, Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript (including Node.js), and Solidity for smart contract development. I’ve also worked extensively with frameworks like React for front-end development and Next.js for building robust back-end services.</p>\n<p>In terms of database technologies, I have hands-on experience with both SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra) databases, crucial for managing the vast amounts of data in financial systems. My work often involves designing and implementing scalable architectures, utilizing microservices and containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>At Agora, I was foundational is designing and building our onchain and offchain platform architecture to ensure that we were able to work with different DAOs, on different chains in a fast, and effective way to deliver the test technical governance solutions we can.</p>\n<p>I’m a strong advocate for clean, maintainable code and have implemented rigorous testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in my projects. I believe in the power of open-source collaboration and regularly contribute to community-driven initiatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>At Agora, we regularly work with and listen to various stakeholders at OP including members of the security council and protocol work. We will read their thoughts and listen when they weight in on designs or future protocol directions.</p>\n<p>In fact, a big learning we had when we rolled out our new governor was <em>not getting enough feedback</em> from the security council and we are continuing to redouble our efforts there. as we try and bring as much transparency and collaboration to our complex governance decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:</strong></p>\n<p>Council members need to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Informed</li>\n<li>Opinionated</li>\n<li>Have strong opinions loosely held</li>\n<li>Listen more than speak</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and ultimately integrate a bunch of information along with the goals and mission of the Collective and make the right recommendation or decision for the better of the Collective regardless of what that means for you personally.</p>\n<p>The proposals and decisions that we will put forth / vet will shape the future of the OP Collective and not something I take lightly.</p>\n<p><strong>Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:</strong></p>\n<p>I will act with the Collectives best interest at heart, but also want to acknowledge that Agora is a governance software provider and may at in the future be deployed on other applications and ecosystems that could have competing interests with Optimism.</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Operating Manual</a>:</strong></p>\n<p>I do understand.</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand that election is subject to successful completion of a Foundation screen which</strong> <strong>may include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract:</strong> [No/Yes]</p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities.

I co-founded multiple projects that are now used by millions of people. In addition to my work at Oasis Labs, I also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Led and grew the engineering team at Plasmic, a low-code frontend builder</li>\n<li>Co-founded a networking project that was productionized by Google into Outline, and now used by people around the world to get access to the free and open Internet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:</strong><br>\nWhen I was the technical leader of Oasis, I was responsible for both building and deploying the L1 protocol. This included communicating with validators, designing for robustness in a diverse heterogeneous deployments, and securely managing keys for the team and protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:</strong><br>\nI have always taken operational security very seriously. This typically involves a defense-in-depth strategy, thinking through potential threat vectors from a holistic view, in which the human is typically the weakest link. I’ve studied this theoretically as an academic, publishing papers at security conferences. I’ve handled this in practice during my time running engineering teams. And I look forward to applying these diverse experiences to keep Optimism humming smoothly. In my opinion, good visibility and strong proactive communication are table stakes. No system is perfect, and we should expect occasional failures. A good defense-in-depth strategy allows us to mitigate the downsides of failures, giving us the room to diagnose systemic issues. When I led post-mortems in the past, we held them with a no-fault ethos, recognizing that the system must design for human fallibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:</strong><br>\nN/A</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Operating Manual</a>:</strong><br>\nI understand</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand that election is subject to successful completion of a Foundation screen which</strong> <strong>may include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract:</strong> [No/Yes]<br>\nYes</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities.

By incorporating an OP delegate signal into our funding mechanism, we observed a noticeable increase in support for projects focused on the Optimism ecosystem. This success validates our approach and reinforces our confidence in using TQF to align funding with community priorities and expertise in the Superchain.</p>\n<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to the Optimism ecosystem, it’s worth noting that our $TEC token is a native OP token. This aligns with our broader mission to promote token engineering within the Optimism and Superchain ecosystems, extending beyond these specific funding experiments.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"round-2-tec-retro-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#round-2-tec-retro-6\"></a>Round 2: TEC Retro</h3>\n<p>The retroactive funding round is currently slated for November and will use Gitcoin’s EasyRetro on Allo Protocol.

We are constantly updating our knowledge of the latest zero-knowledge proof techniques for layer 2s and other use cases.</p>\n<p>Recently, we proposed a zero-knowledge-based solution (partially utilizing the circuit proposed by the Polygon Zero team) for opBNB fraud-proof, and we think it could also be used for OP Stack.</p>\n<p>We respectfully submit our proposals here for your consideration and feedback.</p>\n<p><em>As a new user, I can only upload one embeddable picture.

Once implemented, this ZKP can reduce the challenge period for Optimism from 7 days to 12 hours and avoid complicated interactive challenge procedures. Optimism accepted and funded three proposals from Risc Zero, O(1) Labs, and the ETH Storage team. Each team proposes a similar approach, where the fault proof program, written in Go or Rust, is compiled into a generic instruction set such as RISCV, WASM, or MIPS. These compiled instructions are then verified for correctness using zkVMs like zkRISCV, zkWASM, or zkMIPS, which we refer to as the generic VM approach. An alternative approach involves developing a custom circuit for the fault proof program, which we believe offers better performance compared to the generalized VM method. Recently, Polygon Zero announced the development of a highly performant type1 zkEVM, which aligns with our expectations for creating a custom circuit for opBNB’s fault proof program. Therefore, we have decided to develop a proof of concept (PoC) based on Polygon Zero’s type1 zkEVM codebase to demonstrate the performance advantages compared to the generalized VM approach. The PoC involves the protocol specific to Optimism, and can be used to generate ZKP for Optimism blocks. The figure below illustrates the simple workflow of the two approaches. It is worth noting that our proposal aims not only to improve performance but also to enhance the robustness of the Optimism multi-proofs system.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vi6DVyZIjKqoMYUlBCrHhYFUrA7.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b_2_669x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"vi6DVyZIjKqoMYUlBCrHhYFUrA7\" width=\"669\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b_2_669x500.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F5F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"current-fault-proof-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#current-fault-proof-overview-2\"></a>Current Fault Proof Overview</h3>\n<p>Before delving into the ZK fault proof design, Let’s quickly review the current optimism fault proof design.</p>\n<p>The offchain fault proof program consists of two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Derive the disputed block from the anchor L1 block hash;</li>\n<li>Execute the disputed block based on the agreed L2 state root and compare the execution result with the claimed output root</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The onchain fault dispute game works as following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The attacker and defender take turns initiating on-chain actions based on the claims submitted on-chain by their opponents until they agree on the disputed L2 block;</li>\n<li>They then repeat the above challenge process until they agree on the disputed instruction of the off-chain fault proof program, which uses the disputed L2 block as the input;</li>\n<li>Then invoke the on-chain MIPS contract to execute the disputed instruction which will determine the winner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above fault proof design has following disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The attacker or defender needs to send many on-chain transactions, resulting in significant gas cost;</li>\n<li>The attacker or defender is susceptible to <a href=\"https://kelvinfichter.com/pages/thoughts/challenge-periods/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">censorship attacks</a>, where transactions become harder to include in the L1 chain due to congestion created by either party.

This POC only includes the Optimism block execution circuit, which is the most time-consuming of all the circuits mentioned above. The adoption work we have done is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the gas fee calculation mechanism according to Optimism/opBNB protocol;</li>\n<li>Optimism/opBNB transaction fees consist of two components: the Execution Gas Fee and the L1 Data Fee. The Execution Gas Fee covers the cost of executing transactions on L2, similar to Ethereum’s gas fee. The L1 Data Fee covers the cost of publishing L2 transaction data on Ethereum. More information can be found<a href=\"https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> here</a></li>\n<li>Added the handling logic for Deposited Transaction and Deposit Receipt;\n<ul>\n<li>Deposited Transactions are derived from L1, and included in a L2 block. There are two kinds of deposited transactions: L1 attributes deposited transaction (submits the L1 block’s attributes to the L1 Attributes Pre-deployed Contract) and User deposited transactions (transactions derived from an L1 call to the deposit contract).

Additionally, efforts are underway to enhance the performance of the backend proving system. The opBNB team can contribute to these planned improvements. We believe that the performance of the opBNB custom circuit approach will significantly improve as the performance of the type 1 zkEVM continues to advance.</p>\n<p>To achieve a complete ZK fault proof for Optimism or opBNB, we need to implement all the components such as the block derivation circuit, fault proof circuit, and the on-chain zkFaultProofVerifier contract. These will be important tasks for the next phase of our PoC.</p>\n<p>Once the development of the opBNB custom circuit design is complete, the opBNB team will contribute this work to the Optimism ecosystem to enhance the security and performance of the multi-proof system.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/zk-fault-proof-for-op-stack/8648\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/zk-fault-proof-for-op-stack/8648","pubDate":"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 13:10:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8648"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/zk-fault-proof-for-op-stack/8648.rss","#text":"Zk fault proof for OP Stack"}}]}}}
