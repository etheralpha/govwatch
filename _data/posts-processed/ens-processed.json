During this process, we’ve identified some interesting applications where verifiable compute could potentially be used by ENS. We’re curious about the community’s perspective on these ideas and hope to spark some dialogue:</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Renewal Terms Based on Ownership Duration</strong></p>\n<p>We could implement a system where the grace period for domain renewals is dynamically adjusted based on the length of continuous ownership. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard ownership (0-2 years): 90-day grace period (current system)</li>\n<li>Long-term ownership (2+ years): Extended grace period (e.g., 180 days)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This could be achieved by using HDP to verify the continuous ownership duration of an ENS name. The system would calculate the average ownership time over a long period (e.g., checking ownership every month for the past two years) to prevent manipulation through short-term transfers.</p>\n<p><strong>Resolver Stability Checks for Smart Contracts</strong></p>\n<p>HDP could be used to verify if the account that a name resolves to has remained unchanged within a specified range of blocks. This feature would be particularly useful for smart contracts interacting with ENS names.</p>\n<p>Why this matters for smart contracts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contracts could verify that an ENS name hasn’t suddenly changed its resolved address, reducing the risk of interacting with an unexpected address.</li>\n<li>Contracts could implement different behavior based on the stability of an ENS resolution. For example, allowing higher-value transactions only if the resolution has been stable for a certain period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Verifiable On-Chain Loyalty Programs for Long-Term Holders</strong></p>\n<p>We could implement loyalty programs for long-term ENS holders that are verifiable on-chain. This would reward dedicated users and encourage long-term engagement with the ENS ecosystem. Here’s how it could potentially work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discounts on renewals or new registrations based on proven continuous ownership of other ENS names</li>\n<li>Preferential terms (e.g., exclusive access to certain names or sub-domains) for accounts with a history of long-term ENS engagement</li>\n<li>Other criteria, such as factoring in both ownership duration and historical ENS token balance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, a user who has owned multiple ENS domains for over three years and maintained a significant ENS token balance could receive a 20% discount on future renewals or registrations. This could all be verified on-chain, ensuring transparency and fairness in the loyalty program.</p>\n<p>These are by no means all the possible ways that HDP could be used by ENS. HDP is currently in Beta and is not production ready, but building a limited MVP of any of these three ideas is possible today. If there’s interest, our team could develop such a demo.</p>\n<p>What do you think? We’d love to hear the community’s thoughts on these concepts, particularly the loyalty program idea, and any potential challenges or improvements you see.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Resources</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/developers/data-processor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/developers/data-processor</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/HerodotusDev/hdp\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/HerodotusDev/hdp</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/discussion-dynamic-renewal-terms-resolver-stability-checks-and-loyalty-programs/19375\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/discussion-dynamic-renewal-terms-resolver-stability-checks-and-loyalty-programs/19375","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 16:56:18 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.ens.domains-topic-19375"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/discussion-dynamic-renewal-terms-resolver-stability-checks-and-loyalty-programs/19375.rss","#text":"[Discussion] Dynamic Renewal Terms, Resolver Stability Checks, and Loyalty Programs"},"filter":false},{"title":"Use ENS names as Abstracted Account","dc:creator":"xinbenlv","category":"🧑‍💻 ENS Development","description":"<p>Hi all,<br>\nLike to propose an idea bout ENS names as Account Abstraction.</p>\n<p>Imagine an ERC-721 token or ERC-20 can be sent to an account but not by address but natively with the name of ENS names, effectively making ENS name as an abstracted account rather than wallet address.</p>\n<p>Has any similar idea been proposed before?

The integration will provide a substantially more intuitive and efficient search experience for users. Alongside with the integration into the ENS app frontend, we will also provide an open, public API - allowing anyone in the community to query custom data requests about ENS registry state in milliseconds, or build applications on top of our high performance database.</p>\n<p>Before going into technical details, we strongly encourage giving our demo a try! We’ve created a demo for our proposed integration of our backend with the current ENS registry frontend, the implementation of which serves to illustrate how the search UX could be substantially improved by our indexer, without hindering the feel and identity of the app.</p>\n<p><strong>Try out the demo here:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ens.kodex.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ens.kodex.io</a></p>\n<p>The initial features we will implement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Filtering by availability type</li>\n<li>Multiple suggested results per search</li>\n<li>Relevant data tags for all results (status, past registry price, date)</li>\n<li>Filtering by domain content (letters, numbers)</li>\n<li>Natural language powered suggestions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We propose to implement these features into the ENS app without requiring any (or very minimal) work from ENS engineering talent, as well as maintaining and running the indexer going forward to support the open API. We’ve already laid the groundwork for this implementation as can be seen from the demo, and our infrastructure is ready to handle traffic at scale.</p>\n<p>To achieve this implementation, we are asking for $50,000/month on a monthly streaming basis. We are confident in the utility of what we’ve built, which is why we propose the stream being cancellable at any moment by the DAO should its value not be realized. A full cost breakdown is provided below, the majority of which is hosting services, but also includes development, maintenance, bug fixing, and ongoing efficiency improvements.</p>\n<p>Based on statistics gathered in December 2023, ENS earns $1.36 million in monthly protocol revenue. Thus, the proposed integration would only need to yield a 3.6% increase in registration volume to pay for itself. Any additional increase would make this integration a net-positive for the protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>\n<p>Why does ENS need an indexer? Because it is run by a distributed computer instead of a centralized server, thus it is much harder to know what the current state of it is, as well as its history. Our indexer collects data from every new Ethereum block and feeds it into our special purpose database. We have backfilled data to go as far back as the initial ENS (legacy) contracts went live.</p>\n<p>In general, we and many others believe that having an indexer for ENS as a public good and an open API would be of great benefit to the protocol. There is a lot that can’t be queried by logs and this is where indexing comes in handy. For example turning namehashes into a name, or querying and aggregating lots of data about activity at once. The extensibility of what we built is quite large, and we have realized that by gatekeeping it as a paid service on a third party front-end, we have been significantly limiting its potential and reach.</p>\n<p>Since then, we’ve extended the search capabilities on top of our indexer (the DB that queries the state) to become as intelligent as possible. Most recently, this included building a custom Natural Language model which could recommend “similar” domains to what a user was searching, as well as build a semantic preference profile. We also trained it on all the past ENS data to be able to build a hierarchy of relevance with suggested results. Domains that were previously registered or registered off premium are deemed more “notable”, since they have past transaction history.</p>\n<p>All of this we built in the hopes of making the ENS registry discoverable. Our goal: help newcomers find a single domain they love, a handle that excites them to dive into web3 as a user, or a domain that allows them to direct their website via Ethereum.</p>\n<p>The grant would allow us to continue maintaining and improving our Indexer as a public good, but ultimately, we would just love to see what we’ve built be integrated with the frontend in some shape or form to be made available to more users! We are wholeheartedly confident in the UX improvement our indexer can bring, and would be happy to let that speak for itself.</p>\n<p>Thus, we are willing to structure our grant as a stream and be cancellable by the DAO at any moment if there is no noticeable improvement in app usage, or if the economics of the services and their cost no longer make sense for the protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Costs:</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, just keeping the indexer running smoothly alone is quite a cost-intensive operation, due to the sheer amount of data and the desire to serve it rapidly to users all over the globe.</p>\n<p>The following is a breakdown of our costs for this proposal. To run our backend, we use a variety of services to aggregate, format, sort and serve data back to users. Our largest cost comes from AWS, where we host most of the data. In the image below you can see a detailed breakdown of a single AWS region deployment and its associated costs:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/d/dcfa931e9a06e37f6a27bf29a954b4201132ec2b.png\" data-download-href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/dcfa931e9a06e37f6a27bf29a954b4201132ec2b\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/d/dcfa931e9a06e37f6a27bf29a954b4201132ec2b.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"vwRTDaBru9izcRwGMCCXw30h85Z\" width=\"456\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"E1E1E1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>With this proposal we plan to spin up instances in multiple regions: US East, EU Zurich, and AUS Melbourne. Doing this will greatly reduce latency and response times for requests, improving the user experience for those outside of the US. Some services will need to grow as usage and chain size increases, while others will remain static. Across all three regions, our annual server costs will run up to approximately $220,000.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are other costs associated with this proposal that we have to cover. As a part of this proposal, we will assign multiple developers from the Kodex team to work on implementation of the features from the demo, maintenance, and bug fixing. These members from our team will need to provide consistent oversight and checking to ensure that the technology is functioning flawlessly around the clock. They will also be available to help community members interact with or build on top of the API. Since these developers come from the Kodex team and are not being hired solely for the purpose of this proposal, the following figures are not the full annual salaries of our developers, but rather reflect their time and work commitment solely towards the proposal.</p>\n<p>Our engineers are already deeply familiar and well seasoned with the ENS stack, from the front-end of the app to the intricate architecture of all the contracts and the protocol.</p>\n<p>The annual development costs associated with this proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Back end and Database developers(x2): $140,000/yr\n<ul>\n<li>Responsible for: designing, implementing, and improving our database structure, creating APIs, aggregating data from a variety of sources, improving the speed of queries, creating sorting and filtering logic</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Front end and UI developer: $60,000/yr\n<ul>\n<li>Responsible for: creating UI elements that are required for the upgrade, serving results generated from our search engine, ensuring the app feels responsive, implementing the various sorting functionalities created by the back end team</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Systems administrator: $50,000/yr\n<ul>\n<li>Responsible for: managing security of our database, ensuring our tech stack is up to date and running smoothly, improving cost efficiency of servers and services we use</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Project manager: $40,000/yr\n<ul>\n<li>Responsible for: managing day to day tasks of developers, keeping the project on track, ensuring the vision of the proposal is brought to life, handling payments to developers and 3rd party service providers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Built into the proposal cost is a service charge of $90,000 for designing, implementing, and maintaining this upgrade.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost summary:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Server deployment across 3 regions: $220,000</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Development costs: $290,000</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design and maintenance of service: $90,000</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total cost of this proposal: $600,000/year ($50,000/month)</p>\n<p><em>If approved, Kodex Labs agrees to a 3rd party code audit at the discretion of the ENS DAO.

This delegation gets mobilized by Voter Pass holders functionally giving underrepresented DAO citizens multiplied voting power and therefore non-monetary incentive to express their voices.</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum DAO</strong> <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x66fd48c246080260275e60e327b4d14d3ca202c6d13aba17e970c55536b44664\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">voted</a> via snapshot temp check to delegate 7m ARB (and grant 50k ARB) to Event Horizon making Event Horizon the 15th largest delegate in the Arbitrum ecosystem.

This delegation can be revoked by the DAO with an on-chain vote at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>The Gitcoin DAO</strong> has <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">recently passed</a> a proposal supporting Event Horizon, thereby making our Citizen Enfranchisement pool the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#6</span> delegate on Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>We also request an annual grant of 4k ENS to help the team maintain and expand this public good in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product thus far built out of pocket over the past several months.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"problem-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#problem-2\"></a>Problem</h1>\n<p>Today, typical ENS wallet participation rate floats at significantly less than 1%, often with less than 200 voters for on-chain votes. However, there are thousands of individual voters who participate in each vote despite having effectively no meaningful say. They should be rewarded with a voice. Moreover, there are thousands of incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all. Not voting when you only have, say, $500 worth of ENS doesn’t make sense, it’s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. The strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community. The governance platform and vote multiple that Event Horizon gives to these citizens incentivizes greater participation: our average participation rate is 30%.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"mechanism-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#mechanism-3\"></a>Mechanism</h1>\n<p>ENS Citizens interested in governance may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass NFT which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter enfranchisement pool subject to an additional Gitcoin Pass requirement to prevent sybil attacks to be implemented soon after delegation. As detailed further below, this model:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Grants a clear and meaningful voice to statistically low capital DAO citizen voters regardless of their financial means</li>\n<li>Incentives participation with additional governance authority, not inflationary rewards</li>\n<li>Incentives participants interested in governance itself, not financial gain</li>\n</ol>\n<p>DAOs today rely exclusively on individuals and company entities to serve as network delegates. However, this isn’t the only option. While individual delegates certainly add incredible value to the ENS Ecosystem, so would a governance allotment dedicated to the greater body of smaller citizen participants.</p>\n<p>In this regard, Event Horizon slots into the ENS ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders.</p>\n<p>This serves two functions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters.</li>\n<li>It drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the greatest barriers to participation is a lack of voice due to lack of capital. Implicit delegation and public access governance changes this. Implicit Delegation is a model by which the full public governance block mobilizes in favor of the consensus of those who do vote, thereby implicitly delegating the authority of those who don’t vote to those who do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When participation is low…</em> each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.</p>\n<p><em>When participation is high…</em> there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, citizen participation is high, which is a win for the ecosystem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/hvax/implicit-delegation-event-horizons-governance-solution-3815d61ded12\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Implicit Delegation</a></strong> represents an effort to offer a new paradigm around means of influence. A shift from today’s entirely capital-centric to a more citizen-friendly, participation-centric model.</p>\n<p>Where Direct Governance allocates influence along the lines of capital, and Explicit Delegation allocates influence along the lines of popularity (which often reflects capital), Implicit Delegation allocates influence to those who care most: people showing up to vote. Because the carrot is governance voice itself, implicit delegation attracts governance-interested citizens, not capital-interested citizens; more on that below.</p>\n<p>Because the entirety of the block is always mobilized, those who are most vested are rewarded for their participation by having a larger share of the voting pie. In this regard, Event Horizon’s model leans into a systemic lack of participation to create a solution.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p><strong>Delegation rationale:</strong></p>\n<p>120K ENS would place the Event Horizon community as the 10th largest delegate. Based upon significant dialogue with existing delegates and stakeholders across the DAO ecosystem, we think this places a fair amount of power into the 3rd pillar of governance, namely citizens (the other two being organizational and individual delegations) without being large enough to flip any typical proposal.</p>\n<p>This proposal reflects two of ENS’ presumed core values:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Democratization: By constructing a dedicated block of governance authority with lower capital barriers, our community greatly expands who gets a seat at the table.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Public Good: Like ENS, Event Horizon is a public good. By making the thoughts and ideas of this broader swath of individuals heard, we further broaden the spectrum of possibilities for the evolution of our ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Grant rationale:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>While we initially didn’t want to ask for compensation, several delegates pointed out that doing this magnitude of work for the DAO for free sets a bad precedent for future builders. It sends a message that “do not build here, your work is not valued by the ENS community”. It’s also simply not sustainable for us to maintain this public good forever without some help from the DAO. So despite our initial hesitation, and multiple refusals to do so, we now think it important to ask for some compensation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The request grant sum is in line with the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x66fd48c246080260275e60e327b4d14d3ca202c6d13aba17e970c55536b44664\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">recently passed Arbitrum proposal</a>. This grant will be used to cover various operating expenses including front end changes, server costs, a $6k/year Snapshot subscription, in addition to engineering costs related to expanding this public good in various ways including a direct pipeline from voting to forum + Discord posting all on Event Horizon’s front end. The primary aim of this grant is to not only maintain a seamless UX for voter and contributor onboarding in a sustainable fashion, but to expand this pipeline beyond voting alone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maintain functionality through any changes in ENS governance process – 1.5K ENS</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maintain and further expand voter onboarding UX (forum/Discord integrations, misc. UX polishes) – 1K ENS</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bi-annual reporting including KPIs such as voters, participation rate, voters above key threshold amounts (say $1K worth of ENS), etc. – 1K ENS</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Forking the Franchiser contract (more on that below) – 500 ENS</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"benefits-compared-to-token-incentivized-governance-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#benefits-compared-to-token-incentivized-governance-5\"></a>Benefits compared to Token Incentivized Governance:</h1>\n<p>While token rewards for participation hold legitimate merit and are an intuitive remedy for low turnout, it has limitations.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Misaligned Incentives:</strong> Token-based incentives attract returns-interested parties. However, when it comes to governance, participation is most valuable when it comes from those interested in participating not payout. Implicit delegation directly appeals to these individuals as it rewards those who participate, not with capital, but with greater voting power.</p>\n<p>Added Thought Capital: in line with the notion above, there are likely thousands of community members each holding both strong ideas and valuable contributions for the ecosystem, but simply lack enough voice to justify participation. Through Implicit Delegation, any community member of the ENS ecosystem has an opportunity to have their voice heard, bringing thousands more minds and ideas to the surface.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Inflationary:</strong> While token rewards drive participation at the expense of inflation, Implicit delegation simply leverages its game theory model to increase incentive to vote in the form of a greater voting share. This does not cost the token any inflation, nor the treasury any ENS.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Non-scalable:</strong> Token-based rewards are finite and require a constant drain of ENS funds to continue driving participation. As the ecosystem scales, and more participants join, greater and greater sums of ENS will be needed to continue fueling growth. Implicit delegation has no cost, and its balanced game theory functions with no burn. As more citizen voters join, more ENS could be delegated to the community block, however, again, this is not a cost as the ENS tokens are still retained by the treasury.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p><strong>Past Performance</strong></p>\n<p>The above is not just theory. The Event Horizon community is already active on Ethereum providing metagoverning public goods to Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, ShapeShift, and Arbitrum. In fact, in several recent Uniswap votes, the Event Horizon community was the 10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem. Event Horizon has also recently voted as the 8th largest delegate in recent Aave votes. Gitcoin DAO <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">just voted</a> to make Event Horizon the 6th largest delegate in the DAO via delegation.</p>\n<p>While there is still quite a gap between Event Horizon and the larger delegates in the larger DAOs, interestingly enough this position serves as a line of demarcation between individual delegates above, and citizens below. This dynamic does, however, highlight a call to action. Raise the long tail a bit, and bring in more voices. Sure, voting isn’t the full picture of DAO decision making, but it’s a great place to start. Individual, organization AND citizen delegations are all valuable and mutually inclusive, three symbiotic pillars for a strong ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Since its inception just a few months ago, the Event Horizon protocol has processed &gt;300 metagovernance proposals and placed over $40,000,000 of governance authority and enfranchisement directly into the hands of the citizen voter, a feat not seen anywhere else in the DAO space. This is $40,000,000 of voice amplification for the low-capital, high-conviction citizen which would never have been possible prior to the Event Horizon’s product. Across all proposals for which the Event Horizon Community has participated, the community’s cumulative voter footprint is on pace to exceed $100,000,000 this year.</p>\n<p>Some more metrics worth highlighting:</p>\n<p>Number of Metagovernance Proposals Passed ~300<br>\nOur community members have participated in and passed over 300 metagovernance proposals, each corresponding to various DAO proposals.</p>\n<p>Voter Participation: &gt;30%<br>\nOver thirty percent of our community members have participated in our metagovernance proposals. Some participants have voted as many as 63 times in under 5 months. Check out the latest info on our leaderboard: EventHorizon.vote/leaderboard</p>\n<p>Average Authority Mobilized per Participating Passholder: &gt;$130,000 (and counting)<br>\nFor the cost of $3 in gas, each participating passholder has mobilized an average of just over $100,000 in Uniswap and AAVE authority governance authority across all metagovernance proposals passed.</p>\n<p>Average Authority Mobilized Multiple: &gt;44,000x (and growing)<br>\nThe average pass holder minted their voter pass for ~$3 in gas. When compared to the $130,000 in average authority mobilized, each member has mobilized over 40,000x their gas cost of admission in blue-chip governance authority.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"mechanisms-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#mechanisms-7\"></a>Mechanisms</h1>\n<p>| Step 1 – Duplication: Once a delegation is established, Event Horizon begins automatically duplicating all base DAO (in this case ENS) proposals within its own voting portal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/7/7ee09389a44abff0231f047eb21dcbb910a1f0e7.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"i6pjskkevqt1UF0zPMe3lXO4kKj\" width=\"562\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p>| Step 2 – Metagovernance: Retail voters may mint a free voter pass and begin voting to decide how the retail enfranchisement pool is mobilized in the base DAO proposal.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/e/e7dd4212d101b51248925fee5a17d699c35692b3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/e7dd4212d101b51248925fee5a17d699c35692b3\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/e/e7dd4212d101b51248925fee5a17d699c35692b3_2_624x377.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"x5al0Z3WD7cZYhMjmWtSLwG7wkP\" width=\"624\" height=\"377\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/e/e7dd4212d101b51248925fee5a17d699c35692b3_2_624x377.jpeg, https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/e/e7dd4212d101b51248925fee5a17d699c35692b3_2_936x565.jpeg 1.5x, https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/e/e7dd4212d101b51248925fee5a17d699c35692b3_2_1248x754.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"070808\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>| Step 3 – Base DAO Voting: 24 hours prior to the closure of the base DAO proposal, the Event Horizon metagovernance proposal closes.

The delegation will use the Franchiser contract explained below.</p>\n<p>After the initial delegation and grant from the DAO, Event Horizon handles everything from there. Event Horizon will facilitate and maintain all elements of the pool from pass minting to metagovernance.</p>\n<p>Again, this delegation would not be a grant and funds would remain in the DAO-controlled wallet. Consider us a delegate + service provider like any of the other talented delegates and service providers currently supporting the ENS ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"technical-implementation-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#technical-implementation-9\"></a>Technical Implementation</h1>\n<p>In order to implement this proposal, it is required that we create a DAO-controlled Franchiser contract. The contract owner would be the DAO timelock and it would allow the DAO the power to delegate and undelegate tokens that it sends from the treasury to the Franchiser. In order to create an official and safe implementation of an already proven Franchiser contract, Event Horizon will, with the help of the ENS grant, fork the Trail of Bits audited Uniswap Labs <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xf754A7E347F81cFdc70AF9FbCCe9Df3D826360FA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">implementation</a> [<a href=\"https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github</a>] of the same concept. If this proposal passes Snapshot, we will post a follow up Snapshot to cover the to be determined costs of audits.</p>\n<p>The contract has simple functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fund: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate to a single address</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FundMany: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate any amount to multiple addresses</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recall: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from a single delegate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RecallMany: allows DAO to pull back funds from franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from multiple delegates.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is worth noting that all tokens sent to the Franchiser will remain a part of the DAO’s balance sheet as it has full control over the contract. The delegated tokens never leave the DAO’s ownership.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"additional-considerations-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#additional-considerations-10\"></a>Additional Considerations</h1>\n<p>In order to operate safely and responsibly, on Arbitrum we asked to create a ⅗ oversight committee with veto power. However, given the <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/introducing-veto-ensdao-eth/19088\">recent and popular veto.ensdao.eth delegate</a>, this would be redundant. As such, the Event Horizon voter enfranchisement pool could be easily vetoed in the unlikely event that the need should arise for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>Sybil Considerations: it is important to note that the delegated ENS is by a large margin a minority voter amount. Any potential risk of Sybil influence over the public-access block would under almost all conditions not amount to a sum of authority that would be capable of passing a vote absent incredibly significant broader support from other delegates and the broader ENS ecosystem participants. E.g. A rogue vote is virtually impossible.That being said, we will be implementing Gitcoin Passport requirements for ENS metagovernance shortly after initial delegation to mitigate this risk.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"poll-options-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#poll-options-11\"></a>Poll options</h1>\n<p>Yes</p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p>Abstain</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-good-delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon-penrose/19261\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-good-delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon-penrose/19261","pubDate":"Thu, 30 May 2024 20:50:01 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.ens.domains-topic-19261"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-good-delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon-penrose/19261.rss","#text":"[Public Good] Delegate to a Public Access, Public Good Citizen Enfranchisement pool through Event Horizon (Penrose)"},"filter":false},{"title":"Request for Bounty: GitCoin Round 20","dc:creator":"ENSPunks.eth","category":"🌱 ENS Ecosystem","description":"<p>Due to time constraints in todays EcoSystem WG meeting I am posting the following &amp; request for bounty.</p>\n<p><strong>GitCoin</strong></p>\n<p>GitCoin has built in tools (e.g. GitCoin Passport), but there are two short comings with the existing toolsets: 1) the operate behind the scenes in sort of a blackbox; and 2) the tools are for after the close of the round before matching funds are released and calculated (however, by then the damage is done)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>This is easy to solve by making the results of the process more transparent.

Lending staked tokens seems unlikely to be attractive, since borrowers can’t use the voting power the tokens represent - if they could, the staked token wouldn’t be serving its purpose.</p>\n<p>If the yield comes from rewards paid out by the protocol, then we could just as easily do this to all token holders, and thus incentivize the same behaviour (holding instead of earning, given that the defi protocols won’t be able to claim yield).</p>\n<aside class=\"quote group-agoraphiles\" data-username=\"dennison\" data-post=\"17\" data-topic=\"19090\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/user_avatar/discuss.ens.domains/dennison/48/10541_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"><a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/17\">[Temp Check] Enable CANCEL role on the DAO</a></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Correct, would it be productive to instead think of this of paying active token holders for the act of governance? Something interesting here is that you can split the revenue generated by staking: part goes to the token holder while part goes to the delegate. If you want 100% you have to both hold the token (the liquid staked token) AND delegate, (and then ideally actively participate- I’ll punt the convo for what counts as active participation for now). Now you’re receiving rewards for doing work, and no token holders receive revenue for not doing work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I think it’s consistent with ENS’s values to consider offering rewards in $ENS for staking $ENS tokens to active delegates, because it recognizes those contributing positively to governance with more governance power. Those rewards could be split between delegator and delegate in whatever way is game-theoretically sound.</p>\n<p>I don’t think paying registration &amp; renewal revenue to tokenholders is consistent with ENS’s values or constitution.</p>\n            <p><small>34 posts - 9 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/liquid-staking-for-ens/19242\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/liquid-staking-for-ens/19242","pubDate":"Wed, 29 May 2024 08:23:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.ens.domains-topic-19242"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/liquid-staking-for-ens/19242.rss","#text":"Liquid staking for $ENS"},"filter":false},{"title":"Example of initiative to induce more active delegation on Uniswap","dc:creator":"SpikeWatanabe.eth","category":"🗳️ Meta-Governance","description":"<p>Following up on recent ENS Metagovernance call, I would like to bring here example of what Uniswap is doing to increase voting participation.</p>\n<p>You can find full thread <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936?u=spikewatanabe.eth\">here.</a></p>\n<p>Gauntlet ran a simulation for them, which gave positive results.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>\n<p>They are going to channel portion of fees from LPs to those agents who delegated their tokens to decision makers of their choice.

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has been a crucial component of the Ethereum ecosystem, providing a decentralized, secure, and user-friendly naming system. However, as Ethereum continues to grow and evolve, the current ENS architecture faces limitations in terms of scalability and user costs. To address these challenges, enhance functionality, and align more closely with the Ethereum ecosystem, we’re proposing the extension of the ENS protocol to a Layer 2 network: either a public network or our own custom Layer 2. This proposal details that process and includes a formal request for additional funding from the ENS DAO to support the development of the new architecture and the migration process.</p>\n<p>This proposal follows several months of research, internal deliberation, and external conversations with L2s, members of the ENS community, and many members of the Ethereum ecosystem. You can review the proposal’s technical design document <a href=\"http://go.ens.xyz/ensv2\">here</a> for a deeper look into what we’re proposing for the protocol at the architecture level.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"background-problem-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#background-problem-2\"></a>Background &amp; Problem</h1>\n<p>Since its launch in 2017, ENS has evolved from solely naming onchain addresses into a multi-faceted (DNS, NFTs, Email, RWA) naming protocol. With millions of .eth names registered across numerous dapps, wallets, and browsers - it has seamlessly connected users as a vital bridge to web3. ENS currently operates on the Ethereum mainnet, and while Ethereum and our current architecture has served ENS well, it has limitations in terms of scalability and cost-efficiency. As demand for Ethereum’s blockspace increases, so have the costs associated with registering and updating an ENS name. These issues aren’t local to ENS, with Vitalik sharing his “rollup centric” (read: L2-centric) roadmap as part of Ethereum’s plan to mitigate these issues. The emergence of L2 solutions presents an opportunity for ENS to overcome these limitations by offering improved scalability, reduced gas costs, and the potential for enhanced functionality while maintaining backward-compatibility and continuing to derive security from Ethereum. It’s of the utmost importance that the ENS protocol remains decentralized as we continue to serve our users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-solution-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#proposed-solution-3\"></a>Proposed Solution</h1>\n<p>We’re formally proposing the extension of the ENS protocol to an L2, and a new hierarchical registry design for ENS, where each name has its own personal registry responsible for managing subdomains and resolvers. This design will be coupled with the introduction of an updated Universal Resolver, which will help streamline the resolution process and provide a better experience for users and developers.</p>\n<p>The authoritative registry for .eth names will be deployed on a selected L2 network. Users will have the flexibility to move their names between the L2 and Ethereum mainnet (L1), allowing them to choose the optimal balance between cost, security, and functionality. It’s important to note that users DO NOT need to move their names from Ethereum to the L2: it is 100% optional.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"l2-selection-framework-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#l2-selection-framework-4\"></a>L2 Selection Framework</h1>\n<p>To ensure a thorough and objective evaluation process in choosing between a public L2 and building a custom L2 for the ENS migration, we have developed a comprehensive Selection Framework. This framework will guide our decision-making process and help us identify the most suitable option that aligns with ENS’s requirements and goals. The Selection Framework consists of 3 requirements and 9 ranking criteria.</p>\n<p>The requirements are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>EVM Compatibility: The L2 network must be at least Type-4 EVM-compatible by <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html\">Vitalik’s Taxonomy</a>.</li>\n<li>Censorship Resistance &amp; Decentralization: The L2 must have a credible path to censorship resistance and decentralization of the sequencer.</li>\n<li>Open-Source: All critical L2 infrastructure must be available under an OSS license.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The ranking criteria are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Finality and State Updates: We will consider the time required for transactions to be committed to L1, and to be finalized. Fast time to first L1 commitment, and fast time to finality, are essential for decreasing latency between user updates to ENS names and those changes being observable by clients.</li>\n<li>Security and Resilience: The availability of fraud proofs and the frequency and thoroughness of security audits will be assessed to ensure the security and integrity of ENS on the L2 network.</li>\n<li>Performance and Scalability: We will evaluate the L2 network’s transaction throughput, confirmation times, gas costs, and scalability roadmap.</li>\n<li>Decentralization and Governance: The governance model and the ability for ENS to maintain governance independence will be evaluated to ensure alignment with ENS’s values and objectives.</li>\n<li>Interoperability and Composability: We will assess the L2 network’s cross-chain compatibility and adoption of standardized interfaces to facilitate interoperability with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Developer Experience and Tooling: The availability and maturity of developer tools, documentation, support resources, and the strength of the developer community.</li>\n<li>Adoption and Network Effects: We will evaluate the L2 network’s existing projects, partnerships and the potential benefits of joining a specific tech stack to gauge its impact on ENS adoption and usability.</li>\n<li>Customization and ENS-Specific Features: The L2 network’s ability to accommodate ENS-specific requirements will be assessed.</li>\n<li>Operational and Economic Considerations: We will consider the quality of technical support, operational overhead, fees, and conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of running ENS on the L2 network.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"migration-plan-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#migration-plan-5\"></a>Migration Plan</h1>\n<p>The migration to L2 will proceed in phases, designed to minimize disruption for DApps, wallets, and users. Initial phases include changes to the resolution process, which will facilitate a smooth rollout of more fundamental changes later in the process. For more details see the migration section of <a href=\"http://go.ens.xyz/ensv2\">the design doc</a>.</p>\n<p>Crucially, existing names will continue to function indefinitely, allowing existing applications that rely on the immutability of ENS names to continue to operate without changes - though these names will not be able to take advantage of some of the new functionality enabled by ENSv2.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"anticipated-impact-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#anticipated-impact-6\"></a>Anticipated Impact</h1>\n<p>We anticipate the deployment of ENSv2 will represent a step change in functionality and usability for both developers and end-users. Developers will benefit from the increased flexibility provided by the new registry design, as well as being able to benefit from other infrastructure deployed as part of the migration. Users will benefit from the reduced transaction fees and increased throughput that comes from hosting their names on an L2, while still being able to choose to retain the security and availability guarantees of hosting their name on L1 if desired.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"funding-request-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#funding-request-7\"></a>Funding Request</h1>\n<p>To execute the proposed migration to Layer 2, ENS Labs will need additional funding from the ENS DAO. In the coming weeks we will put forward an executable proposal to request an annual budget increase of 4 million USDC, which will be primarily allocated to hiring additional developers and covering infrastructure costs related to L2 development and deployment.</p>\n<p>This funding is crucial for ENS Labs to successfully develop and deploy ENSv2, and to extend .eth to a Layer 2 network, enabling us to carry out the necessary development work to build and implement the chosen L2 solution. We kindly request the ENS DAO consider this funding proposal as an integral part of the overall ENSv2 plan.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#next-steps-8\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>The ENS Labs team is already evaluating L2 networks for suitability. A detailed migration plan and timeline will be established, taking into account the technical requirements and community feedback. We’re also making good process on a first iteration of proof-of-concept contracts that implement the new architecture.</p>\n<p>In the coming weeks, we’ll be putting forward an executable proposal for additional funding for ENS labs to allow us to take on this major evolution in the life of ENS. This will allow us to hire more engineering, operations, and go-to-market talent to build and deploy ENSv2 in a timely manner, as well as covering infrastructure costs relating to the deployment and operation of L2 infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We encourage active participation and input from the ENS community throughout this process. Your insights and support are crucial in ensuring a successful migration that benefits all stakeholders.

We hope that this information will help the DAO have a healthy discussion about this topic and reach a consensus on the next steps.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#rationale-2\"></a>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>Based on various resources and proposals that have been made on this topic, we compiled a summary of the main arguments for and against this topic.</p>\n<p>Compensation is a powerful incentive to attract skilled and competent individuals who commit full-time to participating in governance. This helps ensure that decision-making processes become efficient and effective, leveraging the expertise and dedication of experienced professionals and leading to better outcomes for the DAO.</p>\n<p>Unpaid delegate work risks relying on volunteers, potentially leading to inconsistent commitment. Enthusiasts, true fans, and wealthy idealists are the only ones who’ll stick to an unpaid role or malicious actors who fake it until they can execute a governance attack.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, compensation may incentivise rent-seeking behaviour among delegates, prioritising personal gain over DAO interests. Introducing performance metrics and compensation structures may also encourage delegates to game the system by focusing on meeting compensation criteria rather than acting in the best interests of the DAO. This undermines the integrity of governance processes and diminishes trust in delegated actions.</p>\n<p>Further Reading: <a href=\"https://medium.com/flipside-governance/should-daos-pay-delegates-97f04f4bcca2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/stablenode-blog/how-to-attract-retain-delegates-delegate-compensation-51419903ce24\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://tally.mirror.xyz/UiRvo1eqmZdAL-_4cUqBgQs9jrVnmJrqRpoFPfmzwLk\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">3</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#overview-3\"></a>Overview:</h1>\n<p>Research link: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y_gA5e7MfObWQNzhhzImeqP4bt4n7t5M063lj7_eFXo/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We looked at programs at <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/april-2024-aligned-delegate-compensation/24272\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MakerDAO</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-retro-governance-participation-rewards/8105\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-incentive-program-results-april-2024/23632\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/15534-1ip54-recognized-delegates-program-renewal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1inch</a>, <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xfe8cb4e08138df2f0d136480e85edadf22679cca73b68f3f376d12f322dd2565\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap</a>, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-orbit-program-renewal-may-2024/17683\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AAVE</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-renewal-of-the-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial-3rd-period/1097\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hop</a>.</li>\n<li>On average, $1.4M is or will be spent on incentives in the latest incentive round</li>\n<li>131 delegates participated in earning incentives in the latest round of delegate incentives in the DAOspace and some delegates participated in several DAOs</li>\n<li>DAOs with larger budgets attract more delegates, but that does not mean each delegate is compensated more on average</li>\n<li>The median budget is $66000/month, involving 11 delegates and per delegate compensation of $5000.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"mechanics-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#mechanics-4\"></a>Mechanics:</h2>\n<p>All incentive programs focus on the voting activity of delegates and their ability to justify their stance on any given issue and have a cap on delegate compensation. However, there were a few nuances with other criteria and some interesting new ones. We will dive into each of these below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Voting Weight Threshold</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All DAOs employ some minimum voting weight threshold to participate in these programs. The most common threshold is equal to or higher than the amount of tokens needed to post a proposal on Snapshot.</p>\n<p>While this approach restricts newer delegates or those with a smaller network from gaining sufficient voting weight from qualifying, approaches by Optimism, 1inch and Uniswap have attempted to address this issue. Optimism compensates the top 100 delegates, allowing them to plan and set a budget while leaving the minimum threshold for the larger community to compete. In contrast, 1inch DAO has set three voting weight tiers, allowing delegates to receive compensation even with lower voting weight. Uniswap makes it optional to have this threshold provided the delegate has passed a proposal on the snapshot, which they have authored or co-authored.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Voting Participation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While participating in voting is easily the most critical criterion, some DAOs have made compensation proportional to voting activity. Most have a threshold that delegates have to meet in order to qualify for fixed compensation.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Communicating Rationale</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The ability of a delegate to justify their stance on their vote is also widespread amongst the majority of the DAOs. This not only helps maintain a certain standard for compensation but also allows potential delegators to decide whom they want to delegate to based on the delegates’ ‘political opinions’.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Forum Activity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While some DAOs include some sort of feedback from the delegates on the proposal as grounds for compensation, this is not a widely adopted practice. In fact, programs with this criterion have<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changes/23784\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> realised the gameability of this metric</a> and will be phasing it out.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Reward calculation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While all programs agree on a compensation cap, some have chosen to allocate compensation proportionally based on a formula. At the same time, most approaches used a fixed sum compensation. Rewards can take various forms, including stables or native tokens as well as points on a dashboard.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Other Contribution Bonus</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Many programs account for other types of contribution, such as being a role holder in the DAO, attending meetings, or exceptional contribution, as grounds for additional compensation. AAVE’s <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-orbit-program-renewal/16550\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Orbit Program</a> disqualifies delegates from participating if they are service providers for the DAO.</p>\n<p>New Additions:</p>\n<p>Some of the newer programs account for additional metrics such as ‘Authored/ Co-authored passed proposals’ and a ‘Minimum Delegation Time’ of 3 months as criteria for participation in the incentive programs. In almost all cases, the incentive programs were proposed and managed by delegates, except in the case of Optimism, where the foundation stewards the program.</p>\n<p>Besides these specific factors, some DAOs employ additional specific criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1inchDAO wants Recognized Delegates to be voted in by the DAO to be eligible for compensation</li>\n<li>Uniswap DAO has a points system to choose the top 11 delegates who will be eligible for compensation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disclaimer:</p>\n<p>All information gathered here is pulled from publicly available data or sources.

This was unpaid work, but significant enough to push back the scheduled launch.

I replied that I preferred a refund, but if they had record of making/shipping the hat then I would just accept the loss.  Thereafter, they confirmed they “dug” up the order and that I would get a refund, which I received on May 17.</p>\n<p>The ENS Merch Store reflects on ENS just as much, if not more, than the team funded by the DAO running the store.  After learning about a 2nd community member having a similar experience, which they said was only resolved after contacting a Steward “a dozen times” to intervene and reading Nick’s comments I felt I should give this review.</p>\n<p>I don’t think it’s my place to make specific suggestions, but perhaps this may start a productive conversation leading to actionable improvements with an emphasis on responsibilities owed by 3rd parties receiving payments from the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-merch-store-feedback-review/19209\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-merch-store-feedback-review/19209","pubDate":"Tue, 21 May 2024 13:31:26 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.ens.domains-topic-19209"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-merch-store-feedback-review/19209.rss","#text":"ENS Merch Store Feedback & Review"},"filter":false}]}}}
