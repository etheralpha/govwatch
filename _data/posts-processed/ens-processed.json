ENS has become very familiar to most people in the industry. For many of these people, using ENS has become a long-term option. We believe that ENS should incentivize users who make this long-term choice by providing certain discounts for long-term renewals.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/u/2048.eth\">@2048.eth</a> posted [a related thread](<a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/a-method-to-increase-the-effective-number-of-ens\">https://discuss.ens.domains/t/a-method-to-increase-the-effective-number-of-ens</a> -users/18440), this proposal was supported by most of the responders (including me). I think it deserves a Temp Check as a proposal.</p>\n<p>Providing discounts for long-term renewals should have at least the following benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Reduce the cost burden of real ENS users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reduce the gas consumption of repeated renewals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reduce the probability of domain name expiration due to forgetting to renew.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#specification-2\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/u/2048.eth\">@2048.eth</a> and I discussed the specific options for discounts.

As discussed on the forum and on Meta-Gov calls, we firmly believe that these tokens should be vested in order to ensure long-term alignment of these stewards with the DAO, whilst ensuring that they are able to use the tokens to vote in governance.</p>\n<p>It is also important to note that allocating value denominated in <strong>purely</strong> ENS tokens should be avoided in general. This proposal will only advocate for adding vesting to steward allocations and won‚Äôt propose changes to the current steward incentives given this should be discussed before the terms begin.</p>\n<p>Over the longer term, we would support a change in the steward compensation structure where stewards could still receive a high amount of value, but in the form of increased USDC and a fixed USD ‚Äòvalue‚Äô of ENS tokens. As well as supporting stewards being delegated tokens from ENS DAO or multisigs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#specification-2\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>We propose that all ENS disbursements to stewards be vested on a linear 24 month schedule from the time of distribution. In line with the 12 month term that each steward serves plus an additional 12 months of vesting to encourage longterm DAO alignment.</p>\n<p>This vesting could be a longer (for example using 3/4 years similar to ENS Labs) but we feel 2 years allows for there to still be significant value distributed during a stewards term, as well as baking in longer term alignment.</p>\n<p>This vesting can be implemented by using Hedgey (or similar tooling) which would allow stewards to access full voting power of their allocated tokens up front, whilst ensuring that the monetary value of these tokens can only be accessed based on the vesting schedule.</p>\n<p>One final note is that stewards joined each working group on the 1st of Jan 2024, meaning it‚Äôs been ~3 months since joining. Our proposal would be this acts as a ‚Äòcliff‚Äô within the 24 month vest and ENS tokens would have been ‚Äòunvested‚Äô for the passed 3 months.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"vote-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#vote-3\"></a>Vote</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes.

And although I got some great replies by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/u/184.eth\">@184.eth</a> and others, my question still hasn‚Äôt really been answered, so I thought I‚Äôd write a temp check. To hear the opinions of delegates and other interested people.</p>\n<p>Currently when a .eth expires, after it goes through a 90 day grace period, it becomes available for general registration again. To prevent this from becoming a race, a ‚Äòtemporary premium‚Äô is attached that starts at $100 million and exponentially decreases to zero over 21 days; ‚Äòthe dutch auction‚Äô. This premium fee goes to the ENS treasury just like the yearly registration fee.</p>\n<p>I am curious, what is the reason that ENS receives the proceeds of the dutch auction instead of past owners? Wouldn‚Äôt that be more fair? If ENS gets to sell my .eth if I forget to renew it, doesn‚Äôt that mean that ENS owns it a little bit too? And shouldn‚Äôt I be the owner?</p>\n<p>For context, ENS revenue from premium registration fees in 2023 was $3.84m (in eth) over 36k names, in 2022 $9.08m over 255k names and in 2021 $2.01m over 6774 names. The total revenue of registration + renewal fees in 2023 was $18.9 million, in 2022 $50.2m, in 2021 $26.1m. I‚Äôm unsure how correct this info is tho, the source is ENS on <a href=\"https://dune.com/ethereumnameservice/dot-eth-revenue\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dune</a>, but revenue data on <a href=\"https://dune.com/steakhouse/ens-steakhouse\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">steakhouse</a> differs. Anyway, its not nothing.</p>\n<p>In order to prevent me from registering all the possible .eth names, registration fees exist. A consequence of those registration fees is that names expire. But not that when a name expires it goes to auction, of which the proceeds go to ENS. That‚Äôs just another rule. And for what?</p>\n<p>According to the ENS Constitution the only way for ENS to justify fees, presumably because fees infringe upon name ownership, is if they ‚Äúprevent the namespace from becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered names. A secondary purpose is to provide the DAO with enough revenue to fund ongoing development and the improvement of ENS‚Äù.  So, does ENS receive premium fees because if the owners would receive them instead there would be overwhelming speculation? And why would that be the case?</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/9/94594c69433218402d4f5c3da188920f0711e47f.png\" data-download-href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/94594c69433218402d4f5c3da188920f0711e47f\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 12.17.06\"><img src=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/9/94594c69433218402d4f5c3da188920f0711e47f_2_690x358.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 12.17.06\" data-base62-sha1=\"lalZb1M5bHhTaMqxGk4cH0fDcbJ\" width=\"690\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/9/94594c69433218402d4f5c3da188920f0711e47f_2_690x358.png, https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/9/94594c69433218402d4f5c3da188920f0711e47f_2_1035x537.png 1.5x, https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/9/94594c69433218402d4f5c3da188920f0711e47f_2_1380x716.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F2F2F3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Or is that wrong framing? Is ENS receiving the premium fee simply not infringing upon name ownership? I feel like ENS has at least the responsibility to justify this, what stops ENS from arbitrarily introducing new fees otherwise, if there are no requirements for raising them? I have only been able to find one mention, by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/u/slobo.eth\">@slobo.eth</a>, of this choice in the many topics about the dutch auction(<a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/handling-name-expiries-more-gracefully/52\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/increasing-the-temporary-premium-start-price/9250\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep9-executable-change-to-exponential-premium-price-oracle/11320\">3</a>) on the forum: ‚ÄúGiven a choice between <strong>intermediaries</strong> profiting of expiring domains and ENS profiting of them, it is preferable that ENS does.‚Äù But even if that is preferable, is ENS profiting from premium fees in the spirit of the <a href=\"https://docs.ens.domains/dao/constitution#ii-fees-are-primarily-an-incentive-mechanism\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ENS Constitution</a>?</p>\n<p>To prevent gaming of the grace period through short registrations and reregistrations I would propose for only the amount above the value of the grace period to go to previous owners. So everything below ~$160 for 3L, ~$40 for 4L and ~$1.25 for 5L still would go to ENS.

This initiative provides the stewards with a direct allowance for these expenses, eliminating the need for these costs to be continually factored into their requests for DAO budget allocations.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this proposal seeks to reimburse the <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x91c32893216dE3eA0a55ABb9851f581d4503d39b\">Metagov Safe</a> for the payments made to karpatkey and Steakhouse Financial during 2024, covering the service fees for <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4ef4b34d397e6ce1fbe1fbe3e94340dcf02d590fc9d93c7107a76282beb201c6\">January</a> and <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdd631a42ccc3762e285276043926c52b86dedbc70fa34dddd611585a38534a89\">February</a>, which total 43.54 ETH.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Since the initiation of the Endowment through the execution of the <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-4-executable-fund-the-endowment-first-tranche/16277#specification-3\">first tranche</a>, payments to karpatkey and Steakhouse Financial for their services have been categorised as operational expenditures.

Should the allowance cap be reached, further withdrawals will be paused until the commencement of the next 30-day cycle. This adjustment eradicates the need for frequent funding operations, paving the way for the Endowment‚Äôs sustained self-sufficiency.</p>\n<p>The monthly cap of 30 ETH has been carefully chosen to align with the Endowment‚Äôs scale and historical fee structure, ensuring it suffices to cover monthly expenses. Should there be a need to revise this limit to better suit future requirements, adjustments can be facilitated through the submission of a new proposal.</p>\n<p>Finally, to ensure the strategic shift is applied retroactively from the outset of 2024, this proposal requests that the Endowment reimburse the Metagov Safe for expenses incurred through payments to karpatkey and Steakhouse Financial. This reimbursement, aimed at covering the service fees for January and February 2024, amounts to a total of 43.54 ETH.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\"

This motion would see a 24-month linear vesting schedule, which extends beyond the Stewards‚Äô 12-month terms. The rationale is to prevent any misalignment between the DAO and Stewards and to discourage the premature sale of allocated ENS tokens. The proposal suggests the possibility of using tools like Hedgey for implementation, allowing Stewards to retain full voting power while ensuring the value of the tokens is accessed according to the vesting schedule. James.eth also suggests an additional vesting ‚Äòcliff‚Äô that would come into effect around 2.5 months after a Steward joins, further entrenching the alignment over the full 24-month period. The proposal is open to a vote where the community can approve the addition of vesting, not approve it, or abstain. <sup> ‚Äî 03.18.24 </sup></p>\n<p>‚Äî</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ens-governance-distribution-program-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#ens-governance-distribution-program-8\"></a>ENS Governance Distribution Program</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-governance-distribution-program-v2-0/18970\">ENS Governance Distribution Program</a> temperature check, proposed by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/u/avsa\">@Avsa</a>, outlines a new strategy to combat voter apathy, enhance decentralization, align third parties with the ENS ecosystem, and combat voting power stagnation. This revised proposal, following feedback from an <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-governance-distribution-program/18940/17\">earlier version</a>, suggests breaking down votes into ‚Äúskin in the game ENS matching‚Äù and ‚Äúinertial delegated voting power‚Äù. The ‚ÄúENS Matching‚Äù part aims for better alignment with entities contributing to the DAO by granting them vested ENS tokens proportional to their monetary support. The ‚ÄúInertial Delegated votes‚Äù section proposes giving past and current stewards continued influence through delegated voting power, which would be effective immediately but would not include access to the underlying tokens. The proposal also includes measures to prevent stewards from voting for their own re-elections, ensuring fair use of this inertial voting power. <sup> ‚Äî 03.19.24 </sup></p>\n<p>‚Äî</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ens-labs-updates-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#ens-labs-updates-9\"></a><img src=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/images/emoji/twitter/cyclone.png?v=12\" title=\":cyclone:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":cyclone:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> ENS Labs Updates</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"ens-stats-february-2024-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#ens-stats-february-2024-10\"></a><img src=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/images/emoji/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12\" title=\":chart_with_upwards_trend:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":chart_with_upwards_trend:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> ENS Stats: February 2024</h3>\n<p>In February 2024, the ENS Protocol registered 38.6k new .eth domains, bringing the total to 2.1 million.

It is an open-source initiative aimed at enabling Flutter developers to more easily engage with web3 technologies. A significant feature of Variance is its integration with ENS, providing tools for name registration and resolution for smart accounts. This integration is further enhanced by the development of an ENS normalize implementation in Dart, allowing for direct name resolution and reverse lookup within the SDK. This approach simplifies the process for developers building web3 apps that leverage ENS. All Dart/Flutter SDKs from Variance are licensed under the BSD 3-clause license. The project, led by founders <a href=\"https://x.com/peteranyaogu\">Peter Anyaogu</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/godwinaekainu\">Godwin Alexander</a>, represents a significant step in making web3 technologies more accessible to mobile developers.

To give an overview of their achievements and current projects, they referred to a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NES6tLhXn6TQZV_BHK_gs3fWfvzrF0JenHnNaD4hj5I/edit?usp=sharing\">set of slides detailing the company‚Äôs progress</a> on the platform, <a href=\"https://docs.namespace.tech/\">technical documentation</a>, and various integrations and partnerships.</p>\n<p>‚Äî</p>\n<p><strong>Unicorn</strong></p>\n<p>Unicorn aims to empower non-profits to raise cryptocurrency and foster crypto economies, while also ensuring safety from scams, frauds, and phishing attacks. Acknowledging the ease with which people can make errors in crypto transactions, Unicorn is developing a non-custodial wallet on the market. This wallet, using ENS, will restrict certain actions to prevent errors, such as sending to an incorrect 0x address. Additionally, they are creating a system that allows anyone with an ENS domain to generate their own onboarding portal and are considering a way for subdomains to share in transaction fees.

To accomplish this, they are considering the development of a dedicated ENS Chain. The rationale behind the ENS Chain includes avoiding competition for block space, having fine-grained control over gas price economics, maintaining governance independence, and controlling their own decentralization trade-offs. The team has thoroughly reviewed various rollup stacks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Polygonzk, evaluating their positives and negatives. Currently, the project is in the design phase, and the team is actively seeking community feedback, anticipating extensive discussions.</p>\n<p>‚Äî</p>\n<h3><a name=\"project-presentation-tokenization-llc-36\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#project-presentation-tokenization-llc-36\"></a>Project Presentation: Tokenization LLC</h3>\n<p>Tokenization LLC, represented by <span class=\"mention\">@ENSPunks</span>, established the company to assist small businesses engaged in the Web3 environment with managing self-custody wallets.

The goals of the proposal remain the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Combat voter apathy.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Increase decentralization of power responsibly.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Create more aligned third parties with the ENS ecosystem.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Combat stagnation of voting power.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the last proposal, main issues were the fact that metagov stewards making decisions on any ENS allocation would always be subject to further scrutiny and criticism, and that there‚Äôs a big difference in governance voting power and ens market value. This updated version attempts to address this.</p>\n<p>But here, instead of approaching a global grant of ENS votes to multiple parties, I propose to break down the vote in two parts, ‚Äúskin in the game ENS matching‚Äù and ‚Äúinertial delegated voting power‚Äù</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ens-matching-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#ens-matching-1\"></a>ENS Matching</h2>\n<p>The goal would be to get more alignment with third parties that have contributed to the DAO in any way, to grant them a long term investment with ENS.</p>\n<p>Every year, in a given date (I would suggest doing at the end of Q2 every year) Metagov stewards would analyze <a href=\"https://dune.com/karpatkey/ens-dao-fundflow?start_date_ta748c=2023-01-01&amp;end_date_te10fd=2023-12-31\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">all monetary transfers out of the DAO</a> of ETH and USDC. That would include all transfers made from the main DAO wallet, but also Working Groups multisigs, ENS small grants program, etc. Then for every $1 the account received (accounting for the value at time of transaction) Metagov would grant them a matching $1 in ENS (valued at the time it would be granted). That value would be put in a vesting contract of a stream of a total 3 year duration plus 1 year cliff, with immediate delegated voting power.</p>\n<p>Current term 5 steward would not be included in this comp, but this would also replace the ENS comp starting term 6. Funds coming in and out of the endowment also do not count towards the matching grants.</p>\n<p>The goal here is that the recipients would not be selected by Metagov stewards, instead we would be assuming that any funds distributed by the DAO had already passed a high criteria, either by a grant committee, a DAO vote or an RFP, so were deserving. This would mean that all entities who have already been selected by the DAO would get a matching ENS donation that would give them skin in the game. We would also expect that if this is normalized, it would alter the candidate pool of any person or entity providing service to ENS, as they could charge less expecting that they would also be compensated with a ‚Äúbonus‚Äù.</p>\n<p><em>Once granted, only the DAO would have direct control over these vested tokens and any change would require an executable proposal.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"inertial-delegated-votes-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#inertial-delegated-votes-2\"></a>Inertial Delegated votes</h2>\n<p>All persons who are considered representative of the DAO (in principle stewards but this could be expanded to include others, like service providers) would be delegated an immediate 50k ENS in delegated voting power. They would NOT have access to the underlying tokens, but only have the votes.</p>\n<p>These would take effect immediately when their term started, but only end 3 years after their term ended. This ‚Äúinertia‚Äù would mean that past stewards (and other representatives) would still have a voice in DAO decisions if they wanted, creating a continuity of policy. These delegations would be cumulative (but naturally limited to 3 years) meaning that a Steward that is reelected is given another 50k in delegated votes and could accumulate up to 150k ENS in voting power. This policy would also be combined with a stronger bylaw preventing stewards on voting for themselves in Steward elections, to make sure that this would not give them an unfair advantage to reelect themselves.</p>\n<p><em>Only the DAO would have control over these delegated powers and any change would require an executable proposal.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#summary-3\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>The inertial part is important to create a sense of continuity that will help the DAO acknowledge and honor past decisions. It‚Äôs set in terms of ENS value but since the tokens are not controlled, then it would not be take in consideration token value but rather actual vote power. On the other hand, the ENS matching would indeed consider token value at the time of the grant, but vested over a long time, meaning that anyone who participates with ENS is given a long term alignment with the DAO and can accumulate a voice.</p>\n            <p><small>26 posts - 11 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-governance-distribution-program-v2-0/18970\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-governance-distribution-program-v2-0/18970","pubDate":"Tue, 19 Mar 2024 17:44:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.ens.domains-topic-18970"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-governance-distribution-program-v2-0/18970.rss","#text":"[temp check] ENS Governance Distribution Program (v2.0)"},"filter":false},{"title":"[TEMP CHECK] ENS Steward Vesting Proposal","dc:creator":"James","category":"DAO-Wide","description":"<h1><a name=\"abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>Following discussion in the <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/5-4-1-social-funding-request-ens-meta-governance-working-group-term-5-q1-q2/18883\">Metagov funding request thread</a> on discourse, we have put together this amendment proposal which looks to add the requirement of vesting to all ENS distributions to Stewards moving forward.</p>\n<p>Under the current proposal, the MetaGov Working Group will be distributed liquid ENS tokens which will then be distributed individually to stewards. As discussed on the forum thread, we firmly believe that these tokens should be vested in order to ensure long-term alignment of these stewards with the DAO, whilst ensuring that they are able to use the tokens to vote in governance.</p>\n<p>We do not believe current stewards are likely to sell their allocated ENS and walk away from the DAO with the monetary value before the term is over. However, it seems prudent to introduce mechanisms that prevent any chance of misalignment between the DAO and stewards.</p>\n<p>It is also important to note that in our opinion, we shouldn‚Äôt be allocating value to stewards denominated in ENS tokens at all. This proposal will only touch on adding vesting to steward allocations and won‚Äôt outline incentive changes to the stewards given this should be discussed before the terms begin.</p>\n<p>Over the longer term, we would support a change in the steward compensation structure where stewards could still  receive a high amount of value, but in the form of increased USDC and a fixed USD ‚Äòvalue‚Äô of ENS tokens. As well as supporting stewards being delegated token amounts from ENS DAO or multisigs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#specification-2\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>We propose that all ENS disbursements to stewards be vested on a linear 24 month schedule from the time of distribution. In line with the 12 month term that each steward serves plus an additional 12 months of vesting to encourage longterm DAO alignment.</p>\n<p>This could be a longer vesting schedule (for example using 3/4 years similar to ENS Labs) but we feel 2 years allows for there to still be significant value distributed during a stewards term, as well as baking in longer term alignment.</p>\n<p>This vesting can be implemented by using Hedgey (or similar tooling) which would allow stewards to access full voting power of their allocated tokens up front, whilst ensuring that the monetary value of these tokens can only be accessed based on the vesting schedule.</p>\n<p>One final note is that stewards joined each working group on the 1st of Jan 2024, meaning it‚Äôs been ~2.5 months since joining. Our proposal would be this acts as a ‚Äòcliff‚Äô within the 24 month vest.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"vote-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#vote-3\"></a>Vote</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Approve the addition of vesting on all steward ENS distributions</li>\n<li>Do not approve vesting</li>\n<li>Abstain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This vote adjusts the structure of ENS token distributions to stewards, and if passed, the Meta-gov working group will work to implement this vesting schedule (and associated tooling) for all ENS token distributions to stewards.</p>\n            <p><small>43 posts - 10 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-steward-vesting-proposal/18964\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-steward-vesting-proposal/18964","pubDate":"Mon, 18 Mar 2024 22:21:16 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"Yes","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.ens.domains-topic-18964"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-steward-vesting-proposal/18964.rss","#text":"[TEMP CHECK] ENS Steward Vesting Proposal"},"filter":false},{"title":"TOKENIZATION LLC - Mint/Own/Manage a Delaware LLC on ENS","dc:creator":"ENSPunks.eth","category":"Ecosystem Discussion","description":"<h1><a name=\"tokenization-llc-mintownmanage-a-delaware-llc-on-ens-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#tokenization-llc-mintownmanage-a-delaware-llc-on-ens-1\"></a>TOKENIZATION LLC - Mint/Own/Manage a Delaware LLC on ENS</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#h-2\"></a></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"name-and-website-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#name-and-website-3\"></a>NAME AND WEBSITE:</h3>\n<p>TOKENIZATION LLC<br>\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"https://app.webhash.com/Links/tokenization\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>tokenizationllc.eth</code></a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"background-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#background-4\"></a>BACKGROUND:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think everyone with a self-custody wallet has the same problem, unmitigated legal risk and potential personal liabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have been an attorney since 2010.

The plaintiffs sued the DAO and the members of the DAO.   This puts all members holders at risk of being personal liability for a $50M judgment.  An LLC used to wrap the wallet(s) hodling governance tokens and participating in governance activities, including voting, can protect the owner and the owner‚Äôs personal assets from those activities.</p>\n<p><b>RR-BAYC:</b></p>\n<p>An NFT project that did not use a legal entity ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù to protect the individuals involved.

Yuga ended up with a judgement that exceeded the alleged revenues of the project by $7M, because there was no legal entity protecting them, Yuga can pursue that $7M deficiency against the defendants personally, where an LLC might have limited their liability to the $2M in profits and investment in the NFT project.</p>\n<p><b>Bridge IRL Businesses Onchain:</b></p>\n<p>Businesses are more acutely aware of legal and regulatory considerations of accepting cryptocurrency and owning self-custody digital assets.

The LLC protects the owner and the owners personal assets from potential liabilities of the licensing agreement.</p>\n<p><b>RWA Tokenization Abstraction:</b></p>\n<p>There are legal and regulatory issues preventing tokenization of certain real world assets. For example, a property owner would not generally be able to tokenize and transfer their property onchain in the US.  The US is a patchwork of laws with 50 states and thousands of counties that nearly all have their own rules regarding memorializing transfers of property by recording a public deed. While the direct ownership of property generally cannot be tokenized directly, an LLC can be created to own the property, recorded on a deed, and then the LLC ownership can be tokenized and transferred onchain without triggering a change in legal title of the property.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"budgetmilestones-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#budgetmilestones-9\"></a>BUDGET/MILESTONES:</h3>\n<p>Using the <code>$500</code> 1st place prize from the Webhash Buildathon as an inital budget to date I have achieved the following milestones and exhausted the following budget:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TOKENIZATION LLC Certificate of Formation, State of Delaware Filing Fee +24 hour expedite service: <code>$210</code></li>\n<li>Delaware Registered Agent: <code>$50/year</code></li>\n<li>Delaware Trademark Fees: <code>$35</code></li>\n<li>US Provisional Patent Filing Fee: <code>$60</code></li>\n<li>Mystery Expense: <code>~$79</code></li>\n<li>ENS Cost: <code>~$60</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remaining Balance: <code>~$35</code></p>\n<h3><a name=\"status-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#status-10\"></a>STATUS:</h3>\n<p><code>prelaunch</code></p>\n<h3><a name=\"point-of-contact-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#point-of-contact-11\"></a>POINT OF CONTACT:</h3>\n<p><code>enspunks.eth</code></p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#h-12\"></a></h2>\n<p>Disclaimers/disclosures: Please note that Tokenization LLC is not a law firm, or an accounting firm.

We believe this happens because of governance fatigue, where large delegates often get tired of monthly voting. Thus rewarding responsible delegates as well as having new ones should help.</li>\n<li><strong>Increase decentralization of power responsibly.</strong> Right now the current distribution means that 6 top delegates could agree to execute any proposal.It also means that the largest delegates could stop bad proposals being voted, so they‚Äôre also a line of defense. It means distributing power should not be done for the sake of redistribution, but responsibly to parties we believe have a long term interest of ENS in mind, as well are philosophically aligned with the goals of web3</li>\n<li><strong>Create more aligned third parties with the ENS ecosystem.</strong> We believe the more we can have serious parties, who have a stake in the future of ENS, the bigger the reach and long term stay our technology will have.</li>\n<li><strong>Combat stagnation of voting power.</strong> We believe that while some continuity in the work of previous stewards and other parties is good, it‚Äôs also healthy to bring new voices in the ecosystem and all of that starts in the voting power distribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"amounts-and-vesting-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#amounts-and-vesting-1\"></a>Amounts and vesting</h3>\n<p>These are the current hardcode limits for ENS governance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To propose a social vote on Snapshot: 10K ENS</li>\n<li>To propose an executable vote: 100K ENS</li>\n<li>Quorum needed to execute a proposal: 1M ENS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The equivalent monetary value is volatile: ENS at its launch was briefly at $50, then for many years stayed in the $6-$12 range and recently has gone up again to $25. We believe that the best way to detach governance decisions from monetary value is with multi year vesting. So all our ENS distributed in this program will be streamed using Hedgey, which will permit the receiver from having immediate voting power, but they can only access the monetary value over the 3 years as a stream.</p>\n<p>The only exception will be Steward compensation for term 5.<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Due to the limits of rule 4.8 on Stewards ruling on their own compensation</a>, we can only recommend the stream to be applicable starting on term 6 and beyond. Term 5 ENS compensation will follow the manner in which was defined by metagov term 4, distributed in two tranches at the end of each semester, in June and December. It‚Äôs effectively similar to a 1 year vesting.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"stewards-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#stewards-2\"></a>Stewards</h3>\n<p>Maintaining previous compensation, all stewards are eligible for 10k ENS over the full term, paid at the end of each semester. This has been done in previous years and was always listed on the metagov budget. In order to increase this transparency, we also commit ourselves to start doing a more longer process of campaign and outreach to new steward candidates, both to get more quality candidates in the candidate pool, but also to make sure they are widely known by the community before the vote. This will be detailed later.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ens-stream-providers-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#ens-stream-providers-3\"></a>ENS Stream Providers</h3>\n<p>As people who have been working deeply into the ecosystem building tools for it, we believe developers who are participating in the Service Provider payment should have a vested long term interest in ENS and a larger voice on its future decisions. To ensure that the decisions are not centralized in companies but rather on the people working on them, ENS will be granted for Individual developers, NOT the companies themselves.</p>\n<p>Each participating company will have the option to elect one representative for each 100k USDC/year of their current budget. So a company receiving 300k per year will be eligible to indicate 3 different persons, who will receive 10k ENS vested over the next 3 years (with immediate voting power). These persons must be employed in the company and involved in the day to day decisions, development and outreach of ENS (but there‚Äôs no requirement they be doing direct development or technical work).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"delegates-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#delegates-4\"></a>Delegates</h3>\n<p>Being a delegate is a big responsibility that requires time commitment which is done voluntarily. Many of the top Delegates have voting power not because of individual ownership of ENS granted at airdrop, but rather the decision of small individual Airdrop receivers who have delegated to them. Because these votes are seldom redelegated (despite <a href=\"http://delegationweek.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">campaigns</a>), it means that a person who was a delegate candidate in 2021 might be stuck for the foreseeable future with the responsibility of decisions for many voters without any compensation.</p>\n<p>As such the Metagov Working group proposes picking 3 delegates who fall under the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have voted on most of the snapshot votes in the past 3 years</li>\n<li>Do not already qualify on the two criteria above, as either steward or stream provider</li>\n<li>Their voting power is a representative of a large amount of individual delegations rather than just holding lots of ENS themselves (we understood this could be gamed by an individuals distributing their own ENS in multiple accounts, but right now we have no reason to believe it applies)</li>\n<li>Have shown responsible and thoughtful voting. <em>How</em> they voted should not matter, just the fact that they are share their thinking and engage with debate, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The exact process for this selection will be detailed later. The selected delegates will be compensated with 10k ENS each, with a 3 year vesting and immediate voting power.</p>\n<p>Besides these 3 delegates we will also commit to distribute another 30k ENS through snapshot ‚Äúincentivized voting‚Äù feature, over the full year. The exact process for which will be detailed later.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"other-companies-and-groups-of-interest-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#other-companies-and-groups-of-interest-5\"></a>Other Companies and groups of interest</h3>\n<p>Metagov Working group is also interested in identifying other parties that would benefit from the program. We hope to find 3 to 5 parties that match the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are building a large product with ENS at the core of their business, or participate in other organizations who would make sense to be aligned with ENS</li>\n<li>Are aligned with the overall philosophy of Web3, distributed applications and permissionless networks</li>\n<li>Are not already large holders of ENS</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#conclusion-6\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>With the current distribution plan, Metagov would be distributing about 550 thousand ENS to over 50 different key parties, all who are considered responsible and important partners, who would then be aligned over the long term prospect of ENS.</p>\n<p>This is just a preliminary temp check to see if the community agrees with the direction. Numbers, dates, amounts, and even criteria are subject to change, and the total amount is not even completely funded by the current metagov budget.</p>\n            <p><small>19 posts - 9 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-governance-distribution-program/18940\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-governance-distribution-program/18940","pubDate":"Fri, 15 Mar 2024 18:14:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"Yes","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.ens.domains-topic-18940"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-governance-distribution-program/18940.rss","#text":"[temp check] ENS Governance Distribution Program"},"filter":false},{"title":"Forum User Statistics Table View","dc:creator":"accessor.eth","category":"üí¨ General Discussion","description":"<p><a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/groups/meta-gov_stewards\">@Meta-Gov_Stewards</a> <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/groups/publicgoods_stewards\">@PublicGoods_Stewards</a> <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/groups/ecosystem_stewards\">@Ecosystem_Stewards</a></p>\n<p>I request for the forum wide user statistics view be enabled again.

I‚Äôd like to leave a note regarding working group rules.</p>\n<p>Last summer I wrote a <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-marketing-research-pilot-episode-ens-econometrics/17742\">study regarding ENS</a>. I carried out this work under the delusion that Ecosystem WG would consider funding it. This misconception was caused by the fact that neither the <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/term-4-grants-summary/17624\">forum topics</a> nor the <a href=\"https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/1.8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">rules (relevant at that moment)</a> of the working groups say that the project should be of a technical nature.</p>\n<p>The existence of such a condition is indicated only by the <a href=\"https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/0.4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">old rules</a> of the working groups that have <strong>lost their legal force</strong>. If I had known that the rules have no direct influence, but are only a tool of the stewards and can be interpreted by them as they wish, I certainly would not have written this study.</p>\n<p>This misconception has cost me dearly. During the time I wrote the research, I earned less than I would have if I had free time. I got problems with family, health and housing. Today, six months later, it is the imbalance of expenses generated by this delusion that has led me to a situation in which the only way to not live the next month on the street is to return to Russia, into the clutches of a totalitarian regime, to which address I publicly said extremely unpleasant things. I don‚Äôt know whether there‚Äôs actually a prison waiting for me there or a forced conscription into the army, but I can say for sure that this place cannot be called safe for a person with my background and views.</p>\n<p>I personally pointed this out to the stewards of the ecosystem working group, because I did not want to make this discussion public, but they did not consider it important to answer me anything. It is worth noting that Slobo <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/term-5-grants-summary/18921\">pointed out</a> the imperative of the technical focus of the project in a recent topic regarding fifth term grants. I believe this was done to avoid future situations like this. However, what to do with my situation remains unclear.</p>\n<p>The fact is that ENS grants are a public offer. And the fact that the stewards of the working group preventively refused to consider my application citing a <strong>non-existent rule</strong> is a violation of the rules of a public offer in any country in which such a legal category exists at all. In an ordinary situation, I would go to court, but a number of factors, such as the legal location of ENS in an offshore zone, the imbalance of resources of the parties and the potential insignificance of the cost of the claim, are unlikely to bring anything other than trouble for ENS, most of whose representatives are not even related to the situation described above.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I do not have working protection tools, but nevertheless, I would like to share this story with you.

Users who find themselves in this situation are advised to contact the the Meta-Governance Working Group or to make a submission on the forum to request a refund.</p>\n<p>‚Äî</p>\n<h3><a name=\"february-2024-financial-report-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#february-2024-financial-report-24\"></a>February 2024 Financial Report</h3>\n<p>Highlights from the February 2024 financial report:</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Overview:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue &gt; Cash Burn, Runway: 191 months</li>\n<li>Proactive financial management resulted in a $20M profit in February, with endowment revenues covering 36% of cash burn</li>\n<li>Revenue $2.4M, showing a slight increase from the previous month, Cash Inflow: $1.5M, exceeding cash burn by 2.18 times</li>\n<li>Normalized Cash Burn: $0.7M, with Reserves reaching $131M (ETH: $103M, USDC: $28M)</li>\n<li>Total Endowment: $90.3M, P&amp;L: $20.5M driven significantly by ETH mark-to-market gains</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Review the full report prepared by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/u/steakhouse\">@Steakhouse</a> <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-financial-reporting-by-steakhouse/16601/20\">here</a></p>\n<p>‚Äî</p>\n<h3><a name=\"weekly-endowment-update-march-5th-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#weekly-endowment-update-march-5th-25\"></a>Weekly Endowment Update ‚Äî March 5th</h3>\n<p>Karpatkey presented their <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-weekly-meeting-9am-et-tuesday/18720/4\">Endowment Update</a>, highlighting that the endowment value has reached $106.2 million. This increase is largely due to a significant appreciation in value, primarily attributed to the rising prices of ETH, which now constitutes 83.3% of the portfolio.</p>\n<p>The capital utilization rate of the endowment is at 99.90%, and its Annual Percentage Rate (APR) stands at 4.17%. Karpatkey emphasized the current protocol distribution within the Endowment, noting Compound V2 as the largest allocation at 23.7%. This is followed by allocations in other protocols such as Aave, Maker, and Lido. The ETH distribution within the portfolio is more diversified, including various forms of ETH holdings like stETH, ankrETH, and cETH.</p>\n<p>A monthly report is expected soon, highlighting recent strategic moves, such as the swap of rETH for ETHx to gain bonus rewards from Stader. In anticipation of discussions with the DAO regarding rebalancing policy, regular swaps have been mentioned as a part of their strategy. Although there was an aim for a 25% allocation in stablecoins, the current lower proportion suggests a shift in strategy due to the appreciation in ETH‚Äôs price.</p>\n<p>‚Äî</p>\n<h3><a name=\"working-group-funding-requests-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains#working-group-funding-requests-26\"></a>Working Group Funding Requests</h3>\n<p>The ENS DAO Working Groups are preparing to advance their funding request process.
