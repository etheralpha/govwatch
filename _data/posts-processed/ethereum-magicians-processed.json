Although EIP-191 defines different versions serving different purposes, versions <code>0x00</code> and <code>0x45</code> (E) do not serve the same purpose.</p>\n<p>In this issue, we can see that EIP-191 was almost fully supported, but precedence led to only versions 0x45 and 0x01 being implemented, dropping version 0x00.</p>\n<p>Due to this, several apps have deviated from version 0x00, although it makes more sense to use it than 0x45. For example, in the issue mentioned above, the team deviated from 0x00 and chose 0x45, even though a smart contract account (Multisig) should handle verification and signing for one intended validator address.</p>\n<p>This was the issue where support for EIP-191 Full was being worked on: <a href=\"https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/1566\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub Issue</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"support-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#support-4\"></a>Support</h2>\n<p>We see many members of the ETH ecosystem tired of the hacks that happen due to blind signing. Even if this standard is not perfect, it at least provides an idea of which verifier will verify the message. If you trust the verifier, then it’s one extra step towards safety (not full safety as users can’t know what bytes they are signing, but still).</p>\n<p>In the Metamask forum, it received support and was praised by <a href=\"https://x.com/nicksdjohnson\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">nick.eth</a>, Lead developer of ENS &amp; Ethereum Foundation alum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://x.com/0xYamen/status/1790736305539661977\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Nick’s Tweet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://community.metamask.io/t/add-support-for-eipe-191-version-0-intended-validator-data/28940\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Metamask Forum - 15+ Votes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Currently, signing messages relies heavily on ERC-191 version 0x45 (<code>eth_sign</code>) and <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org\">EIP-712</a> (<code>eth_signTypedData</code>). While EIP-712 provides a more structured approach, it is often seen as complex. On the other hand, ERC-191 version 0x45 is widely used but poses significant phishing risks due to the lack of data parsing.</p>\n<p>ERC-191 defines three versions: 0x45, 0x01, and 0x00. This proposal aims to fully support ERC-191 by introducing the rpc call for 0x00 version, which enables signing data with an intended validator address. This new method will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable more dApps to use ERC-191 version 0x00 without using raw signing methods which might be dangerous and restricted in few wallets.</li>\n<li>Enhance security by parsing data and displaying the intended validator address, reducing phishing risks.</li>\n<li>Provide a simpler alternative to EIP-712, offering a balance between usability and security.</li>\n<li>Be particularly relevant for smart contract accounts, allowing signing with a specific intended validator address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the rise of smart contract accounts and the reliance on signatures to improve UX, the need for supporting ERC-191 version 0x00 increases, especially given the prevalence of verifier smart contracts, such as Entry Points, Smart Contract Accounts, Key Managers, etc.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"wallet_signintendedvalidatordata-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#wallet_signintendedvalidatordata-7\"></a><code>wallet_signIntendedValidatorData</code></h3>\n<p>MUST calculate an Ethereum signature using <code>sign(keccak256(\"\\x19\\x00&lt;signature validator address&gt;&lt;data to sign&gt;\"))</code>.</p>\n<p>This method adds a prefix to the message to prevent malicious dApps from signing arbitrary data (e.g., a transaction) and using the signature to impersonate the victim.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"parameters-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#parameters-8\"></a>Parameters</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><code>DATA</code> - 20-byte account address: The address signing the constructed message.</li>\n<li><code>DATA</code> - 20-byte account address: The intended validator address included in the message to sign.</li>\n<li><code>DATA</code> - Data string: The data to sign.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"returns-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#returns-9\"></a>Returns</h4>\n<p><code>DATA</code> - Signature.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"example-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#example-10\"></a>Example</h4>\n<p><strong>Request:</strong></p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"bash\"><code class=\"lang-bash\">curl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"wallet_signIntendedValidatorData\",\"params\":[\"0x6aFbBC5e6AFcB251371711a6551E60ead2779Dc0\", \"0x345B918b9E06fAa7B0e56bd71Ba418F31F47FED4\", \"0x59616d656e\"], \"id\":1}'\n</code></pre>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"json\"><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"wallet_signIntendedValidatorData\",\n  \"params\": [\n    \"0x6aFbBC5e6AFcB251371711a6551E60ead2779Dc0\",\n    \"0x345B918b9E06fAa7B0e56bd71Ba418F31F47FED4\",\n    \"0x59616d656e\"\n  ],\n  \"id\": 1\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"json\"><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": \"0x4355c47d63924e8a72e509b65029052eb6c299d53a04e167c5775fd466751c9d07299936d304c153f6443dfa05f40ff007d72911b6f72307f996231605b915621c\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#rationale-11\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>The <code>wallet_signIntendedValidatorData</code> method aims to bridge the gap between the simplicity of ERC-191 version 0x45 and the structured approach of EIP-712.

However, there are areas for improvement to further secure and democratize the governance of multisig wallets, especially within decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposed-improvements-to-the-multisig-standard-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#proposed-improvements-to-the-multisig-standard-1\"></a>Proposed Improvements to the Multisig Standard</h3>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-time-based-voting-shares-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#h-1-time-based-voting-shares-2\"></a>1. Time-Based Voting Shares</h3>\n<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Many DeFi protocols are managed using multisig wallets, which control the distribution of funds and participate in critical protocol decisions. Currently, there is no effective mechanism to remove bad actors from the core governance of a DAO if they form a majority within the multisig group or a majority within the community</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Implement an election-based multisig process to address the issue of entrenched bad actors. This proposal includes the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Regular Elections</strong>: Members of the multisig wallet are elected by the community every four years. This process ensures that the control of the wallet remains in the hands of trusted and accountable members.</li>\n<li><strong>Presidential Role</strong>: The multisig can have a president or owner, who may be chosen on a different schedule from other members or this role may not be voted on at all. This role provides an additional layer of oversight and leadership.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Involvement</strong>: This standard allows the community to have an equal opportunity to influence the future of their platform through regular elections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not every DAO will require this standard, but it offers a democratic method for those that prioritize community governance.</p>\n<p>This standard can also be incorporated with:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-time-locked-transactions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#h-2-time-locked-transactions-3\"></a>2. Time-Locked Transactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Feature:</strong> Allow owners to set time delays on certain transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a window to cancel potentially malicious transactions, enhancing the security and control over high-value or sensitive transactions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-nft-tokenized-shares-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#h-3-nft-tokenized-shares-4\"></a>3. NFT Tokenized Shares</h3>\n<p><strong>Feature:</strong> Represent ownership shares in the multisig wallet as NFTs.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Facilitates the distribution and transfer of ownership rights, making it easier to manage changes in ownership. Tokenized shares enable seamless transfer and management of ownership stakes, promoting flexibility and liquidity.</p>\n<p>Note: This is an open proposal inviting any developer to create what is described here <img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=12\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> credit would be nice thank you</p>\n            <p><small>1 post -

The EIP nomenclature acts as a very effective communication tool when discussing the importance of changes to other development teams outside of the EL client developers, in a way that an unnamable PR to a supporting repository cannot.</p>\n<p>When seeking feedback about these changes in private conversations, the means of effectively communicating the importance comes from demonstrating proof of concept injection attacks. I have chosen not to publicly broadcast these to this point, but I would love feedback about if there’s a stronger middle ground here for herding the branching downstream changes that would need to happen in response.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/new-eip-auditable-json-rpc-specification/20642\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/new-eip-auditable-json-rpc-specification/20642","pubDate":"Thu, 25 Jul 2024 17:13:49 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20642"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/new-eip-auditable-json-rpc-specification/20642.rss","#text":"New EIP: Auditable JSON-RPC Specification"},"filter":false},{"title":"Idea and Prototype for an Intent-based Oracle Extending ERC-4337","dc:creator":"tomw1808","category":"Primordial Soup","description":"<p>First time poster on Ethereum magicians, I hope I’m not overstepping here, if so, please let me know…</p>\n<p>I’m looking for some early technical feedback on a new oracle solution my team and I are working on, or interested people who potentially want to give it a try.</p>\n<p>We were working on a novel oracle solution that leverages ERC-4337 account abstraction to provide real-time on-chain price updates. Unlike traditional pull or push-based oracles, our approach uses an intent system leveraging and extending the already existing infrastructure for erc4337 account abstraction.</p>\n<p>Something like this:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/6/655c1798e1a56badfe68a10060e4e3659781d9f1.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/655c1798e1a56badfe68a10060e4e3659781d9f1\" title=\"SCR-20240724-kgpt\"><img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/655c1798e1a56badfe68a10060e4e3659781d9f1_2_690x316.jpeg\" alt=\"SCR-20240724-kgpt\" data-base62-sha1=\"esFwVwtGacmAqwfAH4dJcLOPNND\" width=\"690\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/655c1798e1a56badfe68a10060e4e3659781d9f1_2_690x316.jpeg, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/655c1798e1a56badfe68a10060e4e3659781d9f1_2_1035x474.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/655c1798e1a56badfe68a10060e4e3659781d9f1_2_1380x632.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"A4BEC6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The idea we had was to run a slightly modified erc4337 bundler that listens to a new kind of UserOp, or wraps the actual UserOp in a DataRequestOp and injects updated (price/…/?) information before submitting the actual transaction. From a data-consuming contract perspective, it would be usable very much like a push oracle, just like manually triggering an update before read and would basically ensure accurate and up-to-date data being on chain before a contract reads it. On the other end, the bundler (or whoever is providing data) gets compensated for its services through the same mechanism that erc4337 already uses. So, it would create an additional economic incentive to run a bundler.</p>\n<p>We got a prototype for a single bundler and the whole process running on sepolia. It’s of course not decentralized and the end vision is a decentralized network of bundlers or something like aggregated signatures of several bundlers and an open protocol to let anyone run a bundler+dataprovider and potentially a reputation dashboard of some sort.</p>\n<p>Anyways, that’s the idea in a nutshell. Thoughts, concerns? Any projects that work on a tangential system and want to collaborate? Anyone who needs access to real time US Equities, Commodities or Forex and want to give it a try? Anyone who is currently running Bundlers and would be interested in implementing it - or spearhead an ERC together?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nThomas</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/idea-and-prototype-for-an-intent-based-oracle-extending-erc-4337/20631\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/idea-and-prototype-for-an-intent-based-oracle-extending-erc-4337/20631","pubDate":"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 09:29:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20631"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/idea-and-prototype-for-an-intent-based-oracle-extending-erc-4337/20631.rss","#text":"Idea and Prototype for an Intent-based Oracle Extending ERC-4337"},"filter":false},{"title":"All Core Devs - Consensus (ACDC) #138, July 25 2024","dc:creator":"abcoathup","category":"Working Groups","description":"<h3><a name=\"agenda-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#agenda-1\"></a>Agenda</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1100\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Consensus-layer Call 138 · Issue #1100 · ethereum/pm · GitHub</a><br>\nModerator: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/ralexstokes\">@ralexstokes</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h3>\n<p>Recap by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/ralexstokes\">@ralexstokes</a> (<em>from Eth R&amp;D <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/745077610685661265/1266221913836097648\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Discord</a></em>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Started the call with an update on <code>pectra-devnet-1</code> , which launched this week\n<ul>\n<li>The network is live but participation is low and the chain has forked into 3-4 pieces</li>\n<li>The initial chain split appears to have been caused by an EIP-7702 transaction, and there’s ongoing work to debug</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Next, we turned to a proposal to restructure the requests types added in Pectra\n<ul>\n<li>These requests types are data coming from the EL which are required for the CL to process with each block</li>\n<li>Until now, CL clients prune EL data as otherwise the data would be duplicated within one Ethereum node given the dual CL-EL architecture</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/3856\">proposal here</a> suggests moving the requests data outside the block structure CL clients already prune so we can easily have the requests data handy with minimal code change</li>\n<li>We discussed the design space addressing this problem on the call as there are a few different ways to satisfy the problem, but there was broad support for <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/potuz\">@potuz</a>’s solution linked above.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Then we had a proposal from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/matt\">@matt</a> to change how these requests types are arranged in the Engine API to facilitate ease of implementation of the EL interfacing with the CL\n<ul>\n<li>There was some back and forth on the details, as a large part of answering this question comes down to finding the best way to share the technical complexity of this feature set between EL and CL implementations.</li>\n<li>This proposal appears to mirror the implementation of these features on the EL which can simply forward them into the Engine API; in turn, the CL then has some additional work to do to map the unified data into the requisite parts.</li>\n<li>Given the fact that CL implementations generally have stronger typing of per-fork types, we landed on this PR making sense and intend to move forward with it.</li>\n<li>CL teams please take a look <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/565\">here</a> to chime in further.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After discussing these request types, we turned to an update on the SSZ stable container EIPs.\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/etan-status\">@etan-status</a> gave a great summary of the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1100#issuecomment-2242842599\">progress here</a> and proposed we include EIP-7688 and EIP-7495 into Pectra devnet-2.</li>\n<li>I clarified that the purpose of the pectra devnets is to reflect the formally included set of EIPs in Pectra, and so rather than simply including these EIPs in devnet-2, we must first agree to inclusion in Pectra.</li>\n<li>We discussed formal inclusion on the call with a variety of viewpoints: while the benefits of these changes are sound in isolation, there was strong pushback that Pectra is already quite large and the testing and security processes around the hard fork development are already quite strained given the size of the fork.</li>\n<li>There was no strong push for inclusion of these SSZ EIPs on the call and especially in light of the instability of the existing Pectra devnet agreed to focus on hardening the existing fork as specified before moving to consider additional features.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>PeerDAS was up after the core Pectra discussions\n<ul>\n<li>There hasn’t been much movement on the peerdas-devnet front, as the last network was not stable and clients have been in the process of hardening implementations before attempting another devnet.</li>\n<li>Acknowledging this, I gave an overview of the option to simplify PeerDAS further by dropping the “sampling” phase of the data availability mechanism of PeerDAS so that we can still have something shipped in Pectra without significantly delaying timelines.\n<ul>\n<li>This solution would still have nodes down segments of the blob data and for a small change in some of the PeerDAS parameters still maintains the same security profile as PeerDAS <em>with</em> sampling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There was interest on further exploring the idea and I’ll write something soon to share more widely beyond the call. Attendees are open to the idea, especially given the broad support for data scaling in Pectra.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This discussion segued into a general discussion of how to arrange PeerDAS alongside the rest of the Pectra features\n<ul>\n<li>The current approach has PeerDAS activated at a separate epoch than the Pectra fork epoch; these two parameters could ultimately be the same but allows for a relatively easy way to “disable” PeerDAS from Pectra in the event development timelines didn’t align with the rest of the Pectra EIP set.</li>\n<li>There were a variety of opinions on the best way to do this so I recommend checking the call for the full color.</li>\n<li>Ultimately, we decided to focus on getting a more stable network around the other Pectra EIPs (cf. devnet-1 stability) and revisit the best way to merge in the PeerDAS work once that is done.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We concluded the call with <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3845\">a proposal</a> from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/dapplion\">@dapplion</a> to enhance the expressivity of the <code>BeaconBlocksByRange</code> networking method — take a look at that PR and please provide any feedback.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"recording-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#recording-3\"></a>Recording</h3>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/lmzAUqsIbIE?t=148s\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b496f98b7c1d0aa02089225d511fc47656f003f0.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"FF1010\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/lmzAUqsIbIE?t=148s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:480/360;\"><img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d96fc998480769431bc8968edfc27724d820cebb.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"A2A5BA\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/lmzAUqsIbIE?t=148s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Consensus Layer Meeting 138 [2024-7-25]</a></h3>\n\n  <p>https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1100</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<h3><a name=\"additional-info-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#additional-info-4\"></a>Additional info</h3>\n<p>Notes by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/christine_dkim\">@Christine_dkim</a>: <a href=\"https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ethereum-all-core-developers-consensus-call-138\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Ethereum All Core Developers Consensus Call #138 Writeup | Galaxy</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post -

This proposal aims to supplement the current Ethereum Magicians platform with an AI-driven mail server that leverages AI to enhance efficiency, inclusivity, and transparency, while keeping every contribution recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"vision-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#vision-1\"></a>Vision:</h3>\n<p>Imagine a platform where a Linux server checks <a href=\"http://ethereum-magicians.org\">ethereum-magicians.org</a> for new submissions and a list of mailboxes every 5 minutes, parsing all new content through a preset but configurable LLM (Language Learning Model). This AI would filter and summarize all submitted data to decide the agenda points for the next All Core Dev (ACD) meeting. Here’s how it would work:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"key-components-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#key-components-2\"></a>Key Components:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Data Submission:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Participants submit their thoughts, ideas, and concerns here on the forum or via email.</li>\n<li>Each submission could eventually be authenticated via ENS/ETH to prevent spam and ensure only relevant inputs are considered, perhaps even require a minimum gas fee to consider your contribution and prevent spam though I think current AI can sufficiently filter out spam anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AI Aggregation and Summarization:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The AI aggregates and summarizes all inputs, identifying key issues and creating a dynamic agenda based on prioritized topics.</li>\n<li>A local text/data blob file is maintained for every unique submitter and every unique discussion. AI can help people informally connect over similar topics of interest to discuss and guide them towards people also occupied with the same ideas or concerns. acdagenda@ethereum.ai (example) for all submissions around the next agenda eip3074@ethereum.ai (for all discussions around that eip) and of course you can generate new ones on the fly and have AI tell you about / announce to others who have similar enough needs for discussion. let email addresses be channels of communication that anyone can submit whatever to, and set an LLM to moderate away the spam and irrelevance (within that channel)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Continuous Updates:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The proposed agenda is automatically updated with every new email/datablob processed, valuing every voice equally.</li>\n<li>A default agenda item is included to discuss any frustrations or proposals for updating the aggregator AI.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Human Control and Selection:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>While the AI assists in creating the agenda and providing solutions, humans retain control over selecting and voting on the final agenda items as AI just like humans, makes mistakes. We must still verify ourselves instead of blindly trusting.</li>\n<li>This ensures that all decisions are made by the community, maintaining the decentralized ethos of Ethereum.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transparency and Traceability:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All raw text interactions and conversations during the ACD are recorded and stored on the Ethereum blockchain for full transparency.</li>\n<li>Users can query the AI to understand decision histories and how specific agenda points were decided.</li>\n<li>Privacy concerns are minimal as all discussions are technical in nature, focusing solely on improving Ethereum.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Technical Focus:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All conversations should be technical in nature and focused on improving Ethereum for everyone. This strict context window ensures relevant discussions and effective governance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>EIP Defense Mechanism:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each EIP can defend itself by being automatically included in the ACD agenda once per meeting.</li>\n<li>The AI summarizes the arguments for and against each EIP based on reactions received in advance, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"proof-of-concept-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#proof-of-concept-3\"></a>Proof of Concept:</h3>\n<p>To validate this approach, I will set up a web interface displaying the most recent ACD agenda proposal based on recent activity on the Ethereum Magicians forums. This interface will feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An email address for anyone to freely contribute their thoughts and ideas.</li>\n<li>The AI will assess the relevance of each contribution to the ACD call and adjust the agenda accordingly within minutes.</li>\n<li>Users can ask the AI questions about the current knowledge database and ongoing discussions not yet visible on the agenda.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This initial phase can run on a regular Linux server, storing submissions locally and connecting necessary APIs. Over time, as we build trust and familiarity, we can transition to a fully functional Layer 2 solution, providing the needed scalability and decentralized trust.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"embracing-change-for-true-decentralization-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#embracing-change-for-true-decentralization-4\"></a>Embracing Change for True Decentralization:</h3>\n<p>For the Ethereum community to truly embrace decentralization, we must be willing to automate our own roles, even those of community moderators. Current moderators should see this as an opportunity to enhance their contributions, not as a threat to their positions. By adopting superhuman moderators, we can ensure that every voice is heard, and every relevant concern is addressed, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve as a decentralized community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"call-to-action-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#call-to-action-5\"></a>Call to Action:</h3>\n<p>I propose we develop this platform as a proof of concept, initially focusing on ACDE agendas and EIP discussions. By open-sourcing the aggregator AI, we can foster truly decentralized communities moderated by AI. The technology is already here; we just need to update our approach to leverage it fully.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss this proposal, provide feedback, and explore how we can make this vision a reality. Together, we can set a new standard for collaborative decision-making and take the next step in decentralizing our processes.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to an enlightening discussion!</p>\n<p>Snek 𓆙𓂀</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposal-gradually-transforming-ethereum-magicians-with-ai-driven-governance-and-communication/20605\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposal-gradually-transforming-ethereum-magicians-with-ai-driven-governance-and-communication/20605","pubDate":"Sat, 20 Jul 2024 11:44:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20605"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposal-gradually-transforming-ethereum-magicians-with-ai-driven-governance-and-communication/20605.rss","#text":"Proposal: Gradually transforming Ethereum Magicians with AI-driven governance and communication"},"filter":false},{"title":"Minimal escrow contract?","dc:creator":"MidnightLightning","category":"Primordial Soup","description":"<p>I’m in the process of searching for possible solutions to a need I think many DAOs/teams/groups have: the ability to provably have a reward/bounty on some action, and have others be able to contribute to it.</p>\n<p>Many groups have “task lists” that they can set up with items they want accomplished. Tools like <a href=\"https://dework.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dework</a> or <a href=\"https://charmverse.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CharmVerse</a> already exist to have cryptocurrency bounties put on the tasks. However, in both those tools the bounty is not verified/guaranteed. Visitors need to trust the group organizers to properly pay out when the task is complete, and also have to do their independent verification of whether the organizers actually have those funds to pay out (if there’s five tasks posted and each has a reward of 5 ETH, is there really enough in the treasury to pay all them out? Sorting the list of <a href=\"https://app.dework.xyz/bounties\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">all Dework bounties</a> by largest reward, I’m really skeptical the top listings would actually pay out…). Because systems like that rely on trust of the organizers, it’s hard to have other community members contribute to the bounty.</p>\n<p>I think if there were a lightweight way for community members to pool financial incentives, it would take some of the weight off the community organizers to manage. <strong>The goal is to have a list of tasks that are given rewards by many people contributing a little (grassroots-style, Kickstarter-style), rather than a single sponsor giving a grant (organizers figuring out rewards from community funds).</strong> Being able to do that in a provable way (the funds are put in escrow on-chain in an easily-inspect-able way) would encourage people to apply to do the task, and I think getting community involvement in bounty-funding is helpful because the financial reward intrinsically scales with how popular an item is to be implemented.</p>\n<p>There’s still a level of trust placed in the organizing group to do the reviews of task submissions and fairly trigger the payouts, but I think that’s an acceptable level of trust needed, given the current systems require that too. A more advanced setup could include the ability for a global governance group like <a href=\"https://kleros.io/governance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kleros Court</a> to allow end-users to appeal if the organizing group turns unresponsive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bountysource\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bountysource</a> had a system like this, but seems to have gone stagnant. Any other platform already done this?</p>\n<p>My thoughts on how to make a platform to support this functionality:</p>\n<h1><a name=\"individual-lockboxes-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#individual-lockboxes-1\"></a>Individual Lockboxes</h1>\n<p>Create a smart contract that is a factory that group organizers can trigger to stamp out a new “lockbox/escrow” contract.</p>\n<p>The lockbox contract acts as a smart contract wallet that starts with an owner of the address that triggered its creation. It then exists as a separate space that anyone can send funds to (it’s now the “reward wallet” for a single task item). When someone does the task, the organizer transfers ownership to the awardee.</p>\n<p>Example implementation: <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/3733032\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Basic Escrow ($3733032) · Snippets · GitLab</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"downsides-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#downsides-2\"></a>Downsides</h2>\n<p>The group organizers probably don’t want to create a lockbox for every single task (as that costs gas to stamp out another smart contract), so either the address the lockbox gets created at needs to be deterministic (community members can send funds to an “empty” address to show interest, and if the wallet’s balance is non-empty, the organizers can trigger deploying the smart contract logic to it), or the first community member to donate to the bounty has an increased cost of creating the lockbox too.</p>\n<p>People are likely to donate lots of different types of tokens (a single bounty may end up with a mishmash of DAI, USDT, USDC, FRAX, WETH, and ETH), so “sweeping” the wallet may be pretty gas-intensive. It may be beneficial then for the recipient to just keep the funds where they are, and spend from that wallet directly. Though if a single contributor wins several bounties, they’d then have multiple of these lockboxes, with potentially multiple different “dust” values in each to then try to manage.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"merged-pool-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#merged-pool-3\"></a>Merged Pool</h1>\n<p>Alternatively, rewards could be pooled into one main “pot” and the individual bounties annotated as how much allocation they get of the main pot.</p>\n<p>This is pretty similar to a DAO’s treasury and how Proposals can typically claim portions of the treasury. But a DAO would likely want to keep “bounty” funds separate from their main treasury (as a way to show those funds are earmarked/promised to be spent already, and cannot be used for other proposals).</p>\n<p>This is now easier on the recipient, who if they receive multiple bounties, their “dust” combines into a single allowance to be able to withdraw. It also minimizes the gas use for repeated actions (there’s just an initial setup cost of creating the pool, and setting up allowances).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"downsides-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#downsides-4\"></a>Downsides</h2>\n<p>Having a central pool means it’s a little more complicated for end-users to contribute: they cannot just send funds to the address, they need to also somehow annotate which bounty the contribution is for. That likely means they’d need to use the “Approve” process for ERC20- and ERC721-style tokens and call specific functions on the pool contract to do it properly. But it’s possible for users to make mistakes, and some funds may get blindly transferred to the pool address, making the total holdings of the pool larger than the combined allocations for the individual bounties.</p>\n<p>The pool could be coded to deal with that surplus somehow (e.g. it acts as a form of “quadratic funding” extra balance that bounties that already have some value allocated then get an additional part of the “bonus” in the pool?), but would likely add a lot of complication to the process.</p>\n<p>Having the funds in a central pool is more of a honeypot to draw in attackers, and one weakness could result in losing the whole pot of funds. That can be mitigated somewhat by not having a single global bounty pool, but each organizing group having their own individual pool for their bounties.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#next-steps-5\"></a>Next steps</h1>\n<p>Is there any project that’s already doing this sort of escrow setup? If not, what do we think is the best way to structure the base layer (individual smart contract lockboxes, or centralized bounty pools)?</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/minimal-escrow-contract/20599\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/minimal-escrow-contract/20599","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:03:01 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20599"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/minimal-escrow-contract/20599.rss","#text":"Minimal escrow contract?"},"filter":false},{"title":"ePBS breakout #5, July 19 2024","dc:creator":"abcoathup","category":"Working Groups","description":"<h3><a name=\"agenda-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#agenda-1\"></a>Agenda</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1095\" class=\"inline-onebox\">EIP-7732 breakout room #5 · Issue #1095 · ethereum/pm · GitHub</a><br>\nModerator: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/potuz\">@potuz</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#notes-2\"></a>Notes</h3>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://hackmd.io/@ttsao/epbs-breakout5\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8f0a562a90992dd656ced3f9b9b37c942cfbde54.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"696969\" width=\"134\" height=\"134\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@ttsao/epbs-breakout5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HackMD</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"96\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a9ed980444b9ca3be37d2db47d62cd43df965bbf.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"7D8691\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@ttsao/epbs-breakout5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ePBS breakout #5 notes - HackMD</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Quintus raised an issue on proposer leaks IP when requesting header to the builder.

It also inherently adapts to changing block utilization and maintains a constantly low average false positive ratio.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7745-two-dimensional-log-filter-data-structure/20580\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7745-two-dimensional-log-filter-data-structure/20580","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 14:57:57 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20580"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7745-two-dimensional-log-filter-data-structure/20580.rss","#text":"EIP-7745: Two dimensional log filter data structure"},"filter":false},{"title":"Discussion on EIP-7743: Multi-Owner Non-Fungible Tokens (MO-NFT)","dc:creator":"jamesavechives","category":"ERCs","description":"<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>I’d like to start a discussion on my new EIP-7743: Multi-Owner Non-Fungible Tokens (MO-NFT).</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:<br>\nThis EIP proposes a new standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that supports multiple owners. The MO-NFT standard allows a single NFT to have multiple owners, reflecting the shared and distributable nature of digital assets. This model also incorporates a mechanism for value depreciation as the number of owners increases, maintaining the principle that less ownership translates to more value.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong>:<br>\nTraditional NFTs enforce a single-ownership model, which does not align with the inherent duplicability of digital assets. MO-NFTs allow for shared ownership, promoting wider distribution and collaboration while maintaining secure access control. This model supports the principle that some valued information is more valuable if fewer people know it, hence less ownership means higher value.</p>\n<p>You can view the full proposal and PR <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/539\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or discussions on this proposal.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/discussion-on-eip-7743-multi-owner-non-fungible-tokens-mo-nft/20577\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/discussion-on-eip-7743-multi-owner-non-fungible-tokens-mo-nft/20577","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:28:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20577"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/discussion-on-eip-7743-multi-owner-non-fungible-tokens-mo-nft/20577.rss","#text":"Discussion on EIP-7743: Multi-Owner Non-Fungible Tokens (MO-NFT)"},"filter":false},{"title":"ERC-7744: Code Index","dc:creator":"peersky","category":"ERCs","description":"<p>Currently contract discovery relies on addresses, which are non-deterministic and can be obfuscated through proxies.
