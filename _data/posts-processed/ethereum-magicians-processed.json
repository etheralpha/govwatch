Indeed, ETH on Arbitrum L2, or WETH on Binance Smart Chain are not fully fungible with their mainnet counterpart. However, these assets are fully backed by their mainnet counterpart and guaranteed to be redeemable to their mainnet underlying asset, albeit with certain time delay.</p>\n<p>Fractional reserve tokens can allow an ecosystem (chains, L2s, and other networks of economic activity) to increase its supply by allowing users to mint the asset not only by bridging it to the ecosystem, but also by borrowing it (typically against a collateral).</p>\n<p>As an example, consider a fractional reserve token, namely, frDAI, that represents a synthetic DAI.<br>\nSuch token will allow users to mint 1 frDAI upon deposit of 1 DAI, or by providing a collateral that worth more than 1 DAI.<br>\nQuick redemption of frDAI to DAI is available as long as there is still some DAI balance in the frDAI token, and otherwise, the price of frDAI may temporarily fluctuate until borrowers repay their debt.</p>\n<p>Fractional reserve tokens may delegate minting capabilities for multiple risk curators and lending markets. Hence, a uniform standard for fractional reserve minting is needed.<br>\nFractional reserve banking does not come without risks, such as insolvency or a bank run.<br>\nThis standard does not aim to dictate economic risk management practices, but rather to have a standard on how to reflect the risk to token holders.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-51147-specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-51147-specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>The proposed standard has the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MUST</strong> be <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20</a> compatible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-51147-interface-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-51147-interface-4\"></a>Interface</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">interface IERCXXX is IERC20 {\n    // events\n    event MintFractionalReserve(address indexed minter, address to, uint256 amount);\n    event BurnFractionalReserve(address indexed burner, address from, uint256 amount);\n    event SetSegregatedAccount(address account, bool segregated);\n\n    // functions\n    // setters\n    function fractionalReserveMint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external;\n    function fractionalReserveBurn(address _from, uint256 _amount) external;\n \n   // getters\n    function totalBorrowedSupply() external view returns (uint256);\n    function requiredReserveRatio() external view returns (uint256);\n    function segregatedAccount(address _account) external view returns (bool);\n    function totalSegregatedSupply() external view returns (uint256);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a name=\"p-51147-reserve-ratio-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-51147-reserve-ratio-5\"></a>Reserve ratio</h2>\n<p>The reserve ratio reflects the ratio between the token that is available as cash, i.e., available for an immediate redemption (or alternatively, a token that was not minted via a fractional reserve minting), and the total supply of the token.

The lending operation <strong>SHOULD</strong> come with an interest rate, and some of the interest rate proceedings <strong>SHOULD</strong> be distributed to token holders that are not in segregated accounts.<br>\nThis standard does not dictate how distribution should occur.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-51147-rationale-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-51147-rationale-9\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>The proposed standard aims to standardise how multiple lending markets and risk providers can interact with a fractional reserve token. The actual lending operation should be done carefully by trusted entities, and it is the token owner’s responsibility to make sure the parties who have fractional reserve minting credentials are reliable.</p>\n<p>At the core of the coordination relies the need to understand how much additional supply is available for borrow, and at what interest rate. The additional borrowable supply is deduced from the required reserve ratio, and the total, borrowable and segregated supply.<br>\nThe interest rate <strong>SHOULD</strong> be monotonically increasing with the current reserve ratio.</p>\n<p>The standard does not dictate how the accrued interest rate is distributed. One possible distribution is by making the token a rebased token. An alternative way is to introduce staking, or just airdropping of proceeds.</p>\n<p>While a fractional reserve is most useful when it is backed by a known asset, e.g., frDAI and DAI, it can also be used in isolation. In such a case, a token will have a fixed initial supply, however additional supply can be borrowed. In such cases the supply temporarily increases, but the net holdings (<code>totalSupply() - totalBorrowedSupply()</code>) remains unchanged.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-51147-backwards-compatibility-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-51147-backwards-compatibility-10\"></a>Backwards Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Fractional reserve tokens should be backwards compatible with <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/LICENSE\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-51147-reference-implementation-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-51147-reference-implementation-11\"></a>Reference Implementation</h1>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">// The code below is provided only for illustration, DO NOT use it in production\ncontract FractionalReserveToken is ERC20, Ownable {\n\n    event MintFractionalReserve(address indexed minter, address to, uint256 amount);\n    event BurnFractionalReserve(address indexed burner, address from, uint256 amount);\n    event SetSegregatedAccount(address account, bool segregated);\n\n    /// @notice token supply in these accounts is not counted towards the reserve, and\n    /// therefore, additional token supply cannot be minted against them.\n    mapping(address =&gt; bool) public segregatedAccount;\n\n    /// @notice ratio between the token that is available as cash (immediate redemption)\n    /// and the total supply of the token.\n    uint256 public requiredReserveRatio;\n\n    uint256 public totalBorrowedSupply;\n\n    constructor(\n        string memory _name,\n        string memory _symbol\n    ) ERC20(_name, _symbol) Ownable(msg.sender) {}\n\n    function fractionalReserveMint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {\n        _mint(to, amount);\n        totalBorrowedSupply += amount;\n        emit MintFractionalReserve(msg.sender, to, amount);\n\n        uint256 reserveRatio = (totalSupply() - totalBorrowedSupply - segregatedSupply) * 1e18 / totalSupply();\n        require(reserveRatio &gt;= requiredReserveRatio, \"reserveRatio\");\n    }\n    function fractionalReserveBurn(address from, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {\n        _burn(from, amount);\n        totalBorrowedSupply -= amount;\n        emit BurnFractionalReserve(msg.sender, from, amount);\n    }\n\n    // ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // Code below is not part of the proposed standard\n    // ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    uint256 internal segregatedSupply; // supply of segregated tokens\n\n    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 value) internal override {\n        // keep the reserve up to date on transfers\n        if (!segregatedAccount[from] &amp;&amp; segregatedAccount[to]) {\n            segregatedSupply += value;\n        }\n        if (segregatedAccount[from] &amp;&amp; !segregatedAccount[to]) {\n            segregatedSupply -= value;\n        }\n        ERC20._update(from, to, value);\n    }\n\n    function mint(address account, uint256 value) external onlyOwner {\n        _mint(account, value);\n    }\n\n    function burn(address account, uint256 value) external onlyOwner {\n        _burn(account, value);\n    }\n\n    function setSegregatedAccount(address account, bool segregated) external onlyOwner {\n        if (segregated) {\n            require(!segregatedAccount[account], \"segregated\");\n            segregatedSupply += balanceOf(account);\n        } else {\n            require(segregatedAccount[account], \"!segregated\");\n            segregatedSupply -= balanceOf(account);\n        }\n        segregatedAccount[account] = segregated;\n        emit SetSegregatedAccount(account, segregated);\n    }\n\n    function setRequiredReserveRatio(uint256 value) external onlyOwner {\n        requiredReserveRatio = value;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h1><a name=\"p-51147-security-considerations-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-51147-security-considerations-12\"></a>Security Considerations</h1>\n<p>Fractional reserve banking comes with many economic risks.

But that’s the same for SIWE, right? Does SIWE give any extended information about the user that Farcaster doesn’t that would justify the SIWE dialogues to be THAT MUCH worse than sign in with Farcaster?</p>\n<p>For comparison, here is the completely awful flow using Ethereum. This is a huge point of churn. It makes me furious that this hasn’t notably improved over the last year despite many dapp builders very vocally complaining about this:</p>\n            <video width=\"394\" height=\"854\" title=\"imgur.com\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\">\n              <source src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1ER4jPg.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n              <source src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1ER4jPg.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\n            </video>\n\n<p>And this is only slightly better when using a different wallet, I consider Rainbow to be one of the best ones, yet it is still really bad. Notice how, for example, I had to look for the SIWE request in the notifications tab as it didn’t open by default. Other wallets have this and other issues too. It is not isolated to Rainbow. But the real question is why Connect Wallet and SIWE are even split into two actions.</p>\n<p>A few things that I don’t understand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why can’t we combine “Connect Wallet” and “SIWE” in one dialogue?</li>\n<li>Why can’t we automate the SIWE flow?</li>\n<li>Why can’t we parse the SIWE flow and make it look pretty instead of signing an unformatted string that looks sketchy as hell to a consumer?</li>\n<li>Are there security concerns for auto-signing SIWE? And if so, why don’t these security concerns apply to Warpcast? If there are security concerns, can we maybe have a two pronged approach of “Sign in with Ethereum” and “Step: 2: Allow the dapp to spend money after the user has signed in?”</li>\n<li>Why is Connect Wallet always so much worse than whatever Warpcast is doing here? It feels way more laggy somehow, why?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m a dapp builder so I don’t really have any meaningful power to change these things through building on my platform, so this is mostly a call to action for wallet providers etc. What’s stopping us here to get to parity? If we don’t get to parity then Ethereum wallets will simply not be the developer’s choice when it comes to consumer dapps. I don’t think we want all consumer dapps to be logged in through Warpcast, a closed source app, do we?<br>\nSorry if this is rage bait for you but I’m in rage when I see this. I have complained about this for months and nothing ever changes. We really need to get our shit together here otherwise we won’t be able to compete.

As this transformation occurs, financial instruments will be built around it, such as ETFs, bonds, and much more.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Decentralized Data Bonds?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Democratization of Data Ownership</strong>: Data is perhaps the most inclusive asset class in the world. Anyone with internet access can generate valuable data. By building a permissionless and decentralized solution, we empower individuals to reclaim ownership of their data.</li>\n<li><strong>Collective Bargaining Power</strong>: Individual data points often hold limited value, but collectively, they become immensely valuable. Our standard allows users to pool their data, increasing their bargaining power and potential returns.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Data Pools / Bonds</strong>: Users can contribute their data to specific pools or bonds. Each bond represents a collection of similar or complementary data types.</li>\n<li><strong>Verifiable Data Generation</strong>: Privately generate proofs for data with protocols such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Multiparty Computation (MPC) TLS</li>\n<li>TLS Proxy</li>\n<li>Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Tokenization</strong>: Contributors to a bond receive transferable tokens representing their share of the data pool. These tokens serve as both proof of contribution and a means to receive rewards.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Utilization</strong>: Companies, DAOs, and decentralized protocols can purchase or subscribe to access the aggregated data. Every time the data is accessed or purchased, token holders receive a yield proportional to their contribution.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance</strong>: Token holders have voting rights on decisions related to their specific data bond, such as pricing, access controls, and data usage policies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Example: Social Media Data Pool for LLM Training</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine a Decentralized Data Bond called “Social Bond” where users can contribute their Reddit and Twitter data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users connect their Reddit and Twitter accounts to the platform.</li>\n<li>The platform uses MPC-TLS to securely gather social verifiable data</li>\n<li>Contributors receive “Social Bond” tokens proportional to the quality and quantity of their data.</li>\n<li>An AI company developing a new language model purchases access to this data pool for training purposes.</li>\n<li>The revenue from this purchase is distributed to token holders based on their contribution.</li>\n<li>Token holders can vote on data usage policies, such as restricting access to non-commercial research only.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The proposed architecture consists of several key components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Smart Contracts</strong>: Manage token issuance, data access rights, and reward distribution.</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralized Storage</strong>: Utilize solutions like IPFS or Filecoin to store encrypted data off-chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Prover Layer</strong>: MPC-TLS, TLS Proxy, TEE</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Challenges</strong><br>\nDesign a secure architecture where none of the parties involved, besides the data owner and the buyer, can access the stored data.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Architect the standard</li>\n<li>Validate with security researchers</li>\n<li>Build the first open-source proof of concept</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am very happy to share my first ever ERC proposal, and hopefully we can bring a new standard to Ethereum that allows users to leverage and take back ownership of their own data.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/decentralized-data-bond-proposal/20994\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/decentralized-data-bond-proposal/20994","pubDate":"Sun, 08 Sep 2024 11:46:49 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20994"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/decentralized-data-bond-proposal/20994.rss","#text":"Decentralized Data Bond Proposal"},"filter":false},{"title":"PeerDAS breakout #8, September 17 2024","dc:creator":"abcoathup","category":"Protocol Calls & happenings","description":"<h4><a name=\"p-50929-agenda-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50929-agenda-1\"></a>Agenda</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1145\" class=\"inline-onebox\">PeerDAS Breakout Room #8 · Issue #1145 · ethereum/pm · GitHub</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/peerdas-breakout-8-september-17-2024/20985\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/peerdas-breakout-8-september-17-2024/20985","pubDate":"Sat, 07 Sep 2024 01:51:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20985"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/peerdas-breakout-8-september-17-2024/20985.rss","#text":"PeerDAS breakout #8, September 17 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"Interest in a Chain-Specific Transaction Hashes EIP?","dc:creator":"bumblefudge","category":"Wallets","description":"<p>[Continuing the discussion from <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/chain-specific-addresses/6449/26\">Chain-specific addresses</a>]</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/vid\">@vid</a> mentioned in the post above that a addressing standard for transaction hashes which includes the chain it’s on would be helpful.

Introduction</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Background on Uniswap v3</strong></p>\n<p>Uniswap v3 revolutionized decentralized finance (DeFi) by introducing concentrated liquidity, enabling liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate capital within specific price ranges. This approach, represented by ERC-721 NFTs, created unique, non-fungible liquidity positions that maximized capital efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations of ERC-721 in Current Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>While ERC-721 effectively represents unique positions, it introduces certain inefficiencies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gas inefficiencies:</strong> Managing multiple positions requires multiple transactions, leading to high gas costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Complexity:</strong> The necessity to manage numerous unique NFTs can complicate operations for LPs, especially those employing more sophisticated strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited programmability:</strong> ERC-721’s structure limits the implementation of advanced, programmatic DeFi strategies that require dynamic and automated position management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Introduction to ERC-1155</strong></p>\n<p>ERC-1155, a multi-token standard, supports the creation and management of fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible tokens within a single smart contract. This capability allows for more efficient batch operations and versatile token management, making it an ideal candidate for representing liquidity positions in a more programmatic and dynamic manner. By adopting ERC-1155, Uniswap v3 could unlock new possibilities in programmable liquidity management and real-time market adjustments.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-50766-iii-technical-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50766-iii-technical-overview-3\"></a><strong>III. Technical Overview</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>ERC-721 vs. ERC-1155: A Comparative Analysis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ERC-721:</strong> Designed for unique, non-fungible tokens where each token is distinct. This standard is excellent for representing individual assets but lacks efficiency in batch operations and programmability.</li>\n<li><strong>ERC-1155:</strong> Supports multiple token types within a single contract, enabling efficient batch operations and the representation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. This flexibility is crucial for implementing complex, automated liquidity strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Alignment with Concentrated Liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>Uniswap v3’s core innovation is concentrated liquidity, allowing LPs to provide liquidity within specific price ranges, creating personalized, unique positions. ERC-721 was initially chosen because it effectively represents these unique, one-off positions. However, ERC-1155 can maintain the uniqueness of each liquidity position by leveraging its multi-token structure. Each liquidity position within a pool can be represented by a sub-token under a unique pool ID, where the metadata for each sub-token holds the specific parameters of the position, such as price range and liquidity amount. This allows for the distinctiveness of each position to be preserved while offering enhanced programmability and batch operations. This proposal will include detailed examples of how this structure can be implemented, ensuring that each position retains its unique characteristics within the ERC-1155 framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract Architecture</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed ERC-1155 structure for Uniswap v3 would involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pool-based tokenization:</strong> Each liquidity pool is represented by a unique token ID within the ERC-1155 contract.</li>\n<li><strong>Sub-tokenization of positions:</strong> Individual liquidity positions within a pool are represented as sub-tokens, each with its metadata, allowing for precise management of attributes like liquidity amount, price range, and accrued fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration with existing protocols:</strong> The ERC-1155 contracts would be fully compatible with Uniswap v3’s existing architecture, ensuring seamless integration and operation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tokenization of Liquidity Positions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Representation of liquidity positions:</strong> ERC-1155 can represent both the liquidity pool and individual positions within that pool, simplifying the management of aggregated liquidity and enabling more complex, programmatic strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Metadata management:</strong> Each position’s unique attributes are stored as metadata within the sub-token, allowing for real-time data integration and instant market response.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-50766-iv-advantages-of-using-erc-1155-for-liquidity-pools-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50766-iv-advantages-of-using-erc-1155-for-liquidity-pools-4\"></a><strong>IV.

For instance, a liquidity position can be set to automatically adjust its price range in response to market shifts by using condition-based logic embedded in the ERC-1155 contract. These triggers could be based on predefined thresholds or real-time market data, enabling dynamic rebalancing without user intervention. Additionally, fee management can be automated to collect and reinvest fees once they reach a certain threshold, further enhancing LPs’ returns. Customizable algorithms could be developed for users who want to tailor these automated strategies to their specific needs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pool-Based Tokenization and Modular Management</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simplified management:</strong> Representing entire pools and their positions within a single contract allows for easier tracking and management of aggregated liquidity, improving the efficiency of liquidity provisioning.</li>\n<li><strong>Modular approach:</strong> This setup supports a modular management strategy where different layers of liquidity can be managed independently or collectively, depending on the strategy employed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid Asset Management</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Versatile products:</strong> ERC-1155’s ability to handle both fungible and non-fungible assets enables the creation of versatile DeFi products, such as liquidity tokens that can also serve as governance tokens or yield-bearing assets.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-protocol integration:</strong> The standard allows for the creation of cross-protocol liquidity pipelines, where liquidity can be moved or reused across different DeFi protocols efficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Fractional Ownership and Shared Positions</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Collaborative strategies:</strong> ERC-1155 supports fractional ownership of liquidity positions, allowing multiple users to share and collaboratively manage a single position. This can lead to innovative financial products, such as liquidity pools structured as index funds.</li>\n<li><strong>Crowdsourced liquidity:</strong> The ability to fractionalize positions enables new forms of crowdsourced liquidity provisioning, where multiple LPs contribute to and benefit from a shared liquidity strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Improved User Experience</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unified dashboards:</strong> Users can view and manage all their positions and intents through aggregated dashboards, simplifying the interface and making it easier to track and optimize their liquidity strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptive management:</strong> The flexibility of ERC-1155 allows for adaptive liquidity management, where the system can automatically optimize yield based on market conditions and user preferences.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Scalability and Future-Proofing</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Preparation for growth:</strong> ERC-1155’s structure is scalable, making it well-suited for future expansions and integrations within the DeFi ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>AI-driven strategies:</strong> The standard’s flexibility also supports the development of AI-driven rebalancing and predictive yield allocation strategies, ensuring that the platform remains adaptable to future advancements in financial technology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-50766-v-potential-challenges-and-mitigation-strategies-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50766-v-potential-challenges-and-mitigation-strategies-5\"></a><strong>V. Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increased Complexity in Smart Contract Design</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Managing multiple token types and their interactions within a single ERC-1155 contract introduces additional complexity, potentially complicating the development and auditing process.</li>\n<li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Modular contract designs and comprehensive testing frameworks can help manage this complexity.

transfers","dc:creator":"0xRobinR","category":"Uncategorized","description":"<blockquote>\n<p>this discussion focuses on the very basic component of every hack stack, <em><strong>erc20 token</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>a</strong> rollback token gives an address or a contract a time period to roll back an erc20 transaction, if the transaction is not rolled back within the time period, the transaction is considered valid and cannot be rolled back.</p>\n<p>one of the main advantages of using the rollback token standard in cold wallets or long-term asset holding wallets is the added layer of security it provides without compromising accessibility. cold wallets are typically used to store large amounts of cryptocurrency securely over long periods, with minimal interaction with the blockchain.</p>\n<p>by incorporating the rollback feature, users gain the ability to reverse any unauthorized transactions within a set time frame, significantly reducing the risk of permanent loss due to hacks or mistakes. this is particularly valuable for long-term holders who may not frequently monitor their wallets.</p>\n<p>the rollback token ensures that even if a cold wallet is compromised, the owner has a window of opportunity to reclaim their assets, making it an ideal solution for safeguarding long-term investments. this mechanism can offer peace of mind to asset holders, knowing that their funds are protected against unforeseen security breaches without needing to actively manage their wallets on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p>the rollback token standard integrates zero-knowledge proofs, specifically zk-STARKs, to enhance security and privacy in reversing compromised transactions. by using zk-STARKs, the system allows users to assign and verify a helper address (<code>sahayak</code>) without exposing sensitive information. this ensures that rollback operations are conducted in a secure, decentralized, and trustless manner, protecting long-term holdings from unauthorized access. zk-STARKs were selected for their scalability, efficiency, and the absence of a need for a trusted setup, making them ideal for this implementation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-50632-why-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50632-why-1\"></a>why?</h1>\n<p>in recent times, there have been many cases of people losing their tokens <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404062349979-Accidentally-sending-funds-to-the-wrong-address\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">due to a mistake</a> in the

href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/hackers-steal-around-100-million-cryptocurrency-binance-linked-blockchain-2022-10-07/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">due to a hack</a>. for a blockchain to handle this type of scams, large amount of hacks, it needs to be rolled back to the previous state to accumulate/reverse all the funds, as it was with ethereum that created ETC after <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ethereum-classic/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">hackers stole around $50 million from DAO</a></p>\n<p>and more recently, <a

in crypto has been hacked and scammed from various blockchains. and many of them didn’t rolled back, causing users and organizations to suffer great losses.</p>\n<p>the rollback token standard proposes, <em><strong>instead of rolling back the entire blockchain, one can just undo the transfer transaction within a time period, safeguarding the assets that were compromised.</strong></em></p>\n<p>with rbts,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>anyone can reverse their compromised token transfers</li>\n<li>crypto hacks can be minimized to 0</li>\n<li>new layer of security will be added on-chain</li>\n<li>no losses to anyone</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-50632-how-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#p-50632-how-2\"></a>how?</h1>\n<p>rollback token standardizes an existing erc20 token with a rollback feature. behind the curtains, the process starts with assigning an helper address Y (<code>sahayak</code>) to the address X, when the latter is compromised or hacked, rbt tokens transferred to the exploiter can be reversed back using the helper address.</p>\n<p>using zero-knowledge proofs, one can assign its helper in a way without exposing its details. only the sahayak will have the proof to prove its ownership over reversing transfers.</p>\n<p>hold on, wouldn’t the exploiter transfer to another address again? no! that’s the catch (and a security level check), for the tokens to be reflected in the balance, the same time period will be considered.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">struct TransferStruct {\n    address to;\n
