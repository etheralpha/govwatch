Besides confusion, there are real security risks, especially for L2 bridges based on the processing status of an L2 transaction (finalized on the L2 but not on the L1 vs finalized on the L2 and the L1).</p>\n<p>This topic of discussion also arose in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/L2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OASIS Ethereum Open Projects L2 Standards WG</a> when discussing the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/L2/pull/53\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2 Transaction Fee API specification</a>. The WG decided to make L2 Transaction Statuses their next work item.</p>\n<p>To start the discussion, the WG decided to propose a simple set of statuses both as a string and as a hex value, their definitions and trust assumptions. The minimal set of transaction statuses proposed is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>L2 Pending</strong>: An L2 transaction submitted to an L2, and waiting to be processed by a sequencer. <strong>Trust Assumption</strong>: No inclusion guarantee on the L2</li>\n<li><strong>L2 Replaced</strong>: An L2 transaction that was “Pending” was replaced by another L2 transaction. T<strong>rust Assumption</strong>: Same as L2 Pending</li>\n<li><strong>L2 Dropped</strong>: An L2 transaction that was removed from the L2 processing queue. <strong>Trust Assumption</strong>: NA</li>\n<li><strong>L2 Confirmed</strong>: An L2 transaction processed by a sequencer and assigned an order in a proposed L2 block by the sequencer by applying an L2 client-specific L2 transaction ordering protocol. <strong>Trust Assumption</strong>: The L2 transaction order guarantee is based on the security guarantee of the ordering protocol. Inclusion in finalized L2 and L1 blocks is not guaranteed.</li>\n<li><strong>L2 Finalized</strong>: An L2 transaction included in an L2 block but not yet submitted to the L1. <strong>Trust Assumption</strong>: The L2 finalization guarantee is dependent on the submission guarantee of the L2 block to the L1 and L1 Finalization.</li>\n<li><strong>L2 Finalized, L1 Finalization pending</strong>: An L2 transaction included in an L2 block submitted to the L1. Trust Assumption: The L2 finalization guarantee is dependent on L1 finalization.</li>\n<li><strong>L2 Finalized, L1 Finalized</strong>: An L2 transaction included in a L2 block that has been included in a finalized L1 transaction. <strong>Trust Assumption</strong>: The L2 transaction finalization guarantee is equivalent to an L1 transaction finalization guarantee in a finalized L1 block.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rip-idea-l2-transaction-status-standard/20511\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rip-idea-l2-transaction-status-standard/20511","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 23:30:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20511"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rip-idea-l2-transaction-status-standard/20511.rss","#text":"RIP Idea: L2 Transaction Status Standard"},"filter":false},{"title":"EIP: Script Registry","dc:creator":"JamesB","category":"EIPs","description":"<p>Discussion topic for EIP-XXXX (Still in draft)</p>\n<p>This is the discussion on a draft EIP for an onchain script registry.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This EIP provides a means to create a standard registry for locating executable scripts associated with contracts.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-5169.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-5169</a> (<code>scriptURI</code>) provides a client script lookup method for contracts. This requires the contract to have implemented the ERC-5169 interface at the time of construction (or allow an upgrade path).</p>\n<p>This proposal outlines a contract that can supply prototype and certified scripts. The contract would be a singleton instance multichain that would be deployed at identical addresses on supported chains.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#overview-3\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>The registry contract will supply a set of URI links for a given contract address. These URI links point to script programs that can be fetched by a wallet, viewer or mini-dapp.</p>\n<p>The pointers can be set using a setter in the registry contract.</p>\n<p>The scripts provided could be authenticated in various ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The target contract which the setter specifies implements the <code>Ownable</code> interface. Once the script is fetched, the signature can be verified to match the Owner(). In the case of TokenScript this can be checked by a dapp or wallet using the TokenScript SDK, the TokenScript online verification service, or by extracting the signature from the XML, taking a keccak256 of the script and ecrecover the signing key address.</li>\n<li>If the contract does not implement Ownable, further steps can be taken:<br>\na. The hosting app/wallet can acertain the deployment key using 3rd party API or block explorer. The implementing wallet, dapp or viewer would then check the signature matches this deployment key.<br>\nb. Signing keys could be pre-authenticated by a hosting app, using an embedded keychain.<br>\nc. A governance token could allow a script council to authenticate requests to set and validate keys.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If these criteria are not met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For mainnet implementations the implementing wallet should be cautious about using the script - it would be at the app and/or user’s discretion.</li>\n<li>For testnets, it is acceptable to allow the script to function, at the discretion of the wallet provider.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY” and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>\n<p>The contract MUST implement the IDecentralisedRegistry interface.<br>\nThe contract MUST emit the ScriptUpdate event when the script is updated.<br>\nThe contract SHOULD order the scriptURI returned so that the owner script is returned first (in the case of simple implementations the wallet will pick the first scriptURI returned).</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">interface IDecentralisedRegistry {\n    /// @dev This event emits when the scriptURI is updated, \n    /// so wallets implementing this interface can update a cached script\n    event ScriptUpdate(address indexed contractAddress, string[] newScriptURI);\n\n    /// @notice Get the scriptURI for the contract\n    /// @return The scriptURI\n    function scriptURI(address contractAddress) external view returns (string[] memory);\n\n    /// @notice Update the scriptURI \n    /// emits event ScriptUpdate(address indexed contractAddress, scriptURI memory newScriptURI);\n    function setScriptURI(address contractAddress, string[] memory scriptURIList) external;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#rationale-5\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>This method allows contracts written without the ERC-5169 interface to associate scripts with themselves, and avoids the need for a centralised online server, with subsequent need for security and the requires an organisation to become a gatekeeper for the database.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"reference-implementation-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#reference-implementation-6\"></a>Reference Implementation</h2>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">import \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\n\ncontract DecentralisedRegistry is IDecentralisedRegistry {\n    struct ScriptEntry {\n        mapping(address =&gt;

I feel very thankful for the people who work so hard on libraries and OS projects, though ideally I should be able to code this all myself with a smile.</p>\n<p>I’ve previously expressed concerns about the quality of writing (and thus, also review) in EIPs, but today the content itself is the cause of my concern.</p>\n<p>Today, I find myself particularly despondent contemplating whether Ethereum can really be the future of software in the way HTTP became the future in 1989; HyperText was fundamentally text based and extensible, and therefore a joy from day one, while Ethereum feels like a stack of workarounds that may rapidly become untenable.</p>\n<p>Compared to the elegance and adaptability of the original web protocols, I find Ethereum esoteric and increasingly difficult to grasp, i.e. getting tougher, especially since Account Abstraction. The nature of the blockchain is challenging enough but the compounding complexity makes the system an almost vertical climb for newcomers and exhausting for experienced developers.</p>\n<p>The core problem with Ethereum seems to be rooted in the protocol’s lack of extensibility. I wonder if the decision to use RLP for message encoding, rather than a more flexible self-describing format that can better tolerate the unknowable, has led to spiralling complications. Each EIP reads like a trick way to get around some past decision and together they resemble a tower of hacks to sniff bytes, wrap payloads within payloads and dodge bullets with binary.</p>\n<p>Importantly, each hack necessitates burdensome code that must be added, tested and maintained in apps, and this pain drives people to centralised libraries and service providers. I think nothing of preparing and shooting off my own HTTP requests, but I’ll happily pay a service to prepare and send a transaction or user operation. This situation is the very antithesis of Ethereum’s values. It’s a more centralising force than the original web and we’ll see giant companies who’s value is pain relief.</p>\n<p>This situation appears to stem from an extreme application of the YAGNI principle. I’m sympathetic that blockchains are severely resource constrained, but do we see this situation as permanent or will there come a time when the trade offs change and it can be reconceptualised? YAGNI is fine for private app code, but does it apply here? When designing the future of all connected software, you probably are going to need a lot of things that evade your imagination right now.</p>\n<p>Each improvement prioritises efficiency and frugality, apparently even in its writing, and I rarely read a discussion about how the proposal can be extended or could handle some hypothetical cases. Given that we now have a good idea of just how often “we do need it”, an Extensibility section might be a prudent mandatory addition to EIPs. Another useful section would be a Realworld Integration Example which would add much needed concretion to the abstract terminology and help it all “click” for people.</p>\n<p>Today, Ethereum’s EIP quagmire feels too much like a “high WTFs per hour” codebase where team-mates churn due to years of untackled debt which repels the very people needed to reform it. As such, I also feel a Developer Pain section might also help authors think through the impact of their improvement on everyone else. This brings me back to the selfish writing: time saved by a few authors is time stolen from many thousands of readers. That must change.</p>\n<p>I’m curious about the community’s thoughts on balancing efficiency with extensibility in protocol design, and how Ethereum might evolve to address these challenges. As it stands, it is a slog.</p>\n<p>I am deeply concerned that it will ultimately prove too steep and too rough going to cross the chasm unless the developer experience is radically improved, without libraries and SaaS companies.</p>\n<p>“An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_of_Paul_the_Apostle\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Saul becomes Paul</a>. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.” — Max Planck</p>\n<p>I’ve not yet come across this in software. New ways frequently win over and convert. Software developers are insatiably curious and tend to relish learning new things. Yet with blockchain, I don’t see the excitement shared among my IRL peers. It’s eerie. I can’t tell if I’m on the bleeding edge or if it’s because no one else is coming.</p>\n<p>I had my doubt today because I was unable to be productive. Without productivity life is stressful, I feel like a loser, lonely, and I wonder if I am making a mistake going down this path.</p>\n<p>Then I reach the for $$$ painkillers.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Luke Puplett</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereums-complexity-is-a-more-centralising-force-than-the-og-web/20432\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereums-complexity-is-a-more-centralising-force-than-the-og-web/20432","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 08:34:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20432"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereums-complexity-is-a-more-centralising-force-than-the-og-web/20432.rss","#text":"Ethereum's complexity is a more centralising force than the OG web"},"filter":true},{"title":"ePBS breakout #4, July 5 2024","dc:creator":"abcoathup","category":"Working Groups","description":"<h3><a name=\"agenda-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#agenda-1\"></a>Agenda</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1083\" class=\"inline-onebox\">ePBS Breakout room #4 · Issue #1083 · ethereum/pm · GitHub</a><br>\n<span data-date=\"2024-07-05\" data-time=\"14:00:00\" class=\"discourse-local-date\" data-timezone=\"UTC\" data-email-preview=\"2024-07-05T14:00:00Z UTC\">2024-07-05T14:00:00Z UTC</span></p>\n<p>Moderator: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/potuz\">@potuz</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#notes-2\"></a>Notes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@ttsao/epbs-breakout4\" class=\"inline-onebox\">ePBS breakout #4 notes - HackMD</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"recording-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#recording-3\"></a>Recording</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC9XsungamU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC9XsungamU</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"additional-info-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#additional-info-4\"></a>Additional info</h3>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethereum Improvement Proposals</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    \n\n<h3><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EIP-7732: Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Separates the ethereum block in consensus and execution parts, adds a mechanism for the consensus proposer to choose the execution proposer.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/epbs-breakout-4-july-5-2024/20429\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/epbs-breakout-4-july-5-2024/20429","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 02:21:38 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20429"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/epbs-breakout-4-july-5-2024/20429.rss","#text":"ePBS breakout #4, July 5 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"Verkle implementers call #20, July 1 2024","dc:creator":"abcoathup","category":"Working Groups","description":"<h3><a name=\"agenda-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#agenda-1\"></a>Agenda</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1089\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Verkle Implementers Call #20 · Issue #1089 · ethereum/pm · GitHub</a><br>\n<span data-date=\"2024-07-01\" data-time=\"13:00:00\" class=\"discourse-local-date\" data-timezone=\"UTC\" data-email-preview=\"2024-07-01T13:00:00Z UTC\">2024-07-01T13:00:00Z UTC</span></p>\n<p>Moderator: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/rudolf\">@rudolf</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"notes-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#notes-2\"></a>Notes</h3>\n<p>Notes by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/rudolf\">@rudolf</a> <em>from <a href=\"https://x.com/rudolf6_/status/1808790395394085224\">X</a></em></p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-1-team-updates-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#h-1-team-updates-3\"></a>1. Team updates</h4>\n<p>Starting things off as usual with quick updates from the client teams:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/jasoriatanishq\">@jasoriatanishq</a> for <a href=\"https://x.com/nethermindeth\">@nethermindeth</a>: continuing testing the verkle sync implementation. Last week implemented the healing part. Anyone can now join the testnet using verkle sync.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/gballet\">@gballet</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://x.com/ignaciohagopian\">@ignaciohagopian</a> for <a href=\"https://x.com/go_ethereum\">@go_ethereum</a>: did a lot of work on the spec. Started implementation of EIP-4762. Still need to re-run the testing framework after it’s complete. Have also spent some time doing a new analysis of Verkle gas cost / code chunking using more recent mainnet transactions. Will be able to share this analysis soon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/kt2am1990\">@kt2am1990</a> for <a href=\"https://x.com/HyperledgerBesu\">@HyperledgerBesu</a>: working on the flat DB refactor for Verkle. Also looking at how we can optimize to reduce the size of the db. Also some performance optimizations around preloading the trie node during block processing, so at the end of the block when have to compute the state root everything is already in memory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/techbro_ccoli\">@techbro_ccoli</a> for the testing team: we now have a successful test framework, and our first release is out. These are the simplest form of the transition tests (mid fork) where the test block starts on the fork transition block. For next steps: filling the “genesis test” (starting at the verkle fork) as opposed to during transition.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-eip-7709-and-eip-2935-updates-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#h-2-eip-7709-and-eip-2935-updates-4\"></a>2. EIP-7709 and EIP-2935 updates</h4>\n<p>There’s been a bit of pushback on how Verkle handles blockhash, and suggestion that we should copy the behavior of 4788. Going forward, EIP-2935 will behave the same way as 4788.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/gballet\">@gballet</a> has opened a PR: <a href=\"https://t.co/MoN8hxVfHQ\">https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8698…</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-3-testnet-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#h-3-testnet-5\"></a>3. Testnet</h4>\n<p>For next testnet: we had a quick discussion on whether it should include deactivating EIP-158. There was no opposition to this on the call. Will also likely be some discussion around this topic of deactivating EIP-158 on this week’s ACD.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-4-the-transition-preimage-distribution-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#h-4-the-transition-preimage-distribution-6\"></a>4. The transition &amp; preimage distribution</h4>\n<p>Gary from Besu team joined to share recent ideas and questions around the transition (migrating state from Merkle to Verkle) and preimage distribution.</p>\n<p>Guillaume and Gary discussed that during the actual transition (which could take a month or more), clients will not be able to snap sync to latest. Only full sync will be possible. For a client syncing from scratch: they would do a snap sync up to the last Merkle Patricia Tree block, and then do a full sync from there. This seems like a reasonable approach since it would only take 2 hours or so to do a full sync in this case.</p>\n<p>On the topic of preimage distribution and including the preimage keys in the execution witness: <a href=\"https://x.com/kt2am1990\">@kt2am1990</a> mentioned that if we can have the address/slot we are touching in each transaction, it might enable some parallelization when we want to import the block. Guillaume will be adding this in next round of spec updates. So we’ll know which are being touched in the tx. One potential downside though is that it will make the witness much larger. Guillaume to make the spec update and then continue discussion on this topic.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-5-cost-of-extcodehashextcodesize-in-eof-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#h-5-cost-of-extcodehashextcodesize-in-eof-7\"></a>5. Cost of extcodehash/extcodesize in EOF</h4>\n<p>Last up, there was some discussion around a few things where EOF differs from legacy code and potentially adds cost: extcodehash, extcodesize, delegatecall. For each of these 3: in addition to reading the code hash you also need to check this is an EOF format. So the question is can we put it directly in the header to avoid this?</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/shemnon\">@shemnon</a> suggested this is a great use case for a flag. If the EOF flag is set, then extcodesize and extcodehash will go down the separate EOF path to signal its EOF code versus an empty account. Importantly this flag would avoid the need to read an extra chunk which would incur extra cost.

We jumped across various concerns here so check the call for the details. In short, there was a call for more regular updates on EIP-4444’s progress, and a call out to various things both rollups and clients can do to more intelligently handle the pipeline from blob producer to blob inclusion on-chain.</p>\n<p>Reminder: Goerli has been deprecated and so clients will (or have already!) dropped support for this testnet.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"recording-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#recording-3\"></a>Recording</h3>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/58_bJD_dmm0?t=35s\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b115373510a81727e66d2e71ec3542fd26fde62e.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"FF1010\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/58_bJD_dmm0?t=35s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:480/360;\"><img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f74a00e8f9c61b7ac507624f601d18a3fd72bf55.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"334040\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/58_bJD_dmm0?t=35s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Execution Layer Meeting 191 [2024-07-04]</a></h3>\n\n  <p>https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1080</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-execution-acde-call-191-july-4-2024/20427\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-execution-acde-call-191-july-4-2024/20427","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 01:55:11 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20427"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-execution-acde-call-191-july-4-2024/20427.rss","#text":"All Core Devs - Execution (ACDE) call #191, July 4 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"RollCall #6, July 10 2024","dc:creator":"abcoathup","category":"Working Groups","description":"<h2><a name=\"agenda-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#agenda-1\"></a>Agenda</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1071\" class=\"inline-onebox\">RollCall #6 · Issue #1071 · ethereum/pm · GitHub</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rollcall-6-july-10-2024/20426\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rollcall-6-july-10-2024/20426","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 01:50:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20426"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rollcall-6-july-10-2024/20426.rss","#text":"RollCall #6, July 10 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"Post-Quantum Proxy Contract Pattern","dc:creator":"srarcharles","category":"Primordial Soup","description":"<p>I want you all to check out my idea.<br>\nNew “Proxy Pattern Smart Contract with Quantum-Resistance Ability”</p>\n<p>I’m concerning about quantum-computer’s attacks on Proxy contract.

However most of these contracts have hardcoded params (for e.g. ring buffer size, target queue length for price computations etc) and are not upgradable.</p>\n<p>Upgrading those params generally require a hardfork overloading the development process and also to some extend bring down the benefit of implementing them as contracts rather than native code (tradeoff of efficiency has already been made for using this path of implementing the EIPs)</p>\n<p>One way to leverage their implementation being contract is to add a mechanism in them to upgrade the params via an online governance proposal. With such a mechanism for eg max blob gas limit could be raised in a phased and coordinated manner for a feature like peerDAS.</p>\n<p>For this purpose a special Beacon Validators Contract can be deployed which triggers the upgrade functions. Note that BeaconBlockRoot contract allow ones to verify if a validator is actually part of an active validator set, as well as its balance via proof against a recent beacon block root. Obviously the system contracts would need to be code/redeployed/adopted to treat a call coming from BVC as privileged. This mechanism also allows system contracts to “opt in” to such an upgrade process.</p>\n<p>The BVC contract will keep track of proposals which will effectively be the up-gradation call to the system contracts. Anyone could add proposals and the validators can vote on it with their effective balance weight using their withdrawal keys and with proof to the beacon header of holding the withdrawal key of an active validator. Once a threshold is reached the BVC can be triggered to call the system upgrade function with the proposed input and the voted threshold (which can also be verified by the system contracts allowing them to have their own customized threshold  for e.g. some contracts can demand very high thresholds)</p>\n<p>Additional mechanics of verifying the active validator weight while triggering the final upgrade can be added in to prevent churning validators to hack a vote as the proof of the validator statuses  can be provided against a recent beacon block root.</p>\n<p>Overall this will also the validator community to be part of ethereum governance especially for the topics around the params that determine the resource consumption. Also the development community has the choice to opt in or not to such an upgrade process and to have its own thresholds of accepting an upgrade.</p>\n<p>Overall this could de-load the developers as well as to get the voice of validator community included for the topics that concern them.</p>\n            <p><small>12 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/beacon-validators-contract-for-online-governance/20404\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/beacon-validators-contract-for-online-governance/20404","pubDate":"Thu, 27 Jun 2024 16:14:31 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20404"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/beacon-validators-contract-for-online-governance/20404.rss","#text":"Beacon Validators Contract for online governance"},"filter":false},{"title":"EIP-7730: Proposal for a clear signing standard format for wallets","dc:creator":"lcastillo-ledger","category":"EIPs","description":"<p>Hi All,</p>\n<p>As Ledger, we want to improve the way user interacts with their wallets by displaying more clearly to them what message / transaction they are going to sign (what we call clear signing).</p>\n<p>Basing the UI on the ABI does not lead to the best experience, the types are too broad and not easily interpreted as is.

This proposal aims to provide a secure, privacy-preserving method for identity verification that can be used by decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This proposal introduces a standard for decentralized identity verification (DID) on the Ethereum blockchain. The standard aims to provide a secure, privacy-preserving method for identity verification that can be used by decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p><strong>Specification</strong>:<br>\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT<br>\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;</p>\n<p>interface IDecentralizedIdentity {<br>\nstruct Identity {<br>\naddress userAddress;<br>\nbytes32 identityHash;<br>\nbytes32[2] verificationHashes;<br>\nbool isVerified;<br>\nuint256 timestamp;<br>\n}</p>\n<pre><code>event IdentityCreated(address indexed userAddress, bytes32 identityHash, uint256 timestamp);\nevent IdentityVerified(address indexed userAddress, bytes32[2] verificationHashes, uint256 timestamp);\nevent IdentityRevoked(address indexed userAddress, uint256 timestamp);\n\nfunction createIdentity(bytes32 identityHash) external;\nfunction verifyIdentity(bytes32[2] calldata verificationHashes) external;\nfunction revokeIdentity() external;\nfunction getIdentity(address userAddress) external view returns (Identity memory);\n</code></pre>\n<p>}</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: The design leverages cryptographic hashes to represent identity information, ensuring that sensitive data is not stored directly on the blockchain. The use of verification hashes allows for flexible identity verification mechanisms, and the inclusion of events ensures transparency and traceability.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Considerations</strong>: Ensure that identity and verification hashes are generated using a secure hashing algorithm to prevent collisions and ensure the integrity of the identity data. Users have control over their identity data, which reduces the risk of unauthorized access and ensures privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback Request</strong>: I would love to hear your thoughts on the proposed standard, especially regarding the hashing methods used for identity verification and any potential improvements to the current design.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Thank you for taking the time to review this proposal. I look forward to your feedback and suggestions.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7734-decentralized-identity-verification-did/20392\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7734-decentralized-identity-verification-did/20392","pubDate":"Wed, 26 Jun 2024 18:41:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethereum-magicians.org-topic-20392"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7734-decentralized-identity-verification-did/20392.rss","#text":"ERC-7734: Decentralized Identity Verification (DID)"},"filter":false},{"title":"Open Graph for Onchain Actions","dc:creator":"kkonrad","category":"Primordial Soup","description":"<h1><a name=\"open-graph-for-onchain-actions-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#open-graph-for-onchain-actions-1\"></a>Open Graph for Onchain Actions</h1>\n<p>Let’s work on a standard that enables EVM transactions to be previewed, signed and sent as URLs.  The idea is to be able to suggest transaction through links, QR codes, buttons, widgets and websites. This allows users to perform blockchain transactions without the need to go to another app or webpage. This would expose onchain action to the entire surface of the web. The basic idea is to do what OG did for social previews but for onchain actions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The <a href=\"https://ogp.me/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open Graph protocol</a> enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Any onchain action can be shared as a rich link (URL). An additional benefit is that some context aware apps such as in-wallet browsers can display additional features. For example, on a website, a swap button could trigger a transaction preview without going to a swap app.</p>\n<p>The fallback is a simple frontend for a given action and that action only. Therefore, a user without a context aware app will be directed to that frontend to make their transaction the traditional way.</p>\n<p>Solana has recently launched pretty much this. See the full specification <a href=\"https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n<p>Prior art also includes <a href=\"https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/frames/spec\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Farcaster frames</a>, which unfortunately only work with Warpcast. There is a need to agree on a standard so that we can avoid yet more fragmentation.</p>\n<p>Next Steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>hear your initial thoughts</li>\n<li>start working with partners: wallets, wallet connection kits, apps.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>FAQ</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What about safety and drainer links? Clients (e.g. wallets) should simulate transactions and give appropriate warnings if they cannot. Additionally, a maintained registry of non-malicious actions should exist.</li>\n<li>Why are we doing this? hugo0 and kkonrad have been working on a standard for a single use case URL-encoded transaction format, Peanut Protocol (sending tokens via links / QR codes) and this is a logical next step.</li>\n<li>What’s next?

This is problematic as sequencing, the choice of who gets to alter what piece of state in what order, influences value flow. The goal of this EIP is to give transactions and smart contracts more control over how they are sequenced through explicit delegation of local sequencing rights.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"technical-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#technical-summary-1\"></a>Technical Summary</h3>\n<p>This EIP aims to enable more fine-grained and multi-party block building by introducing two new EIP-2718 transaction types and one new opcode. These new additions would provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability for transactions to delegate their local sequencing to a specified external party.</li>\n<li>The ability for an external party to build ‘bundles’ of transactions that are run in order in a block.</li>\n<li>The ability for smart contracts to see who put the transaction in a bundle if the transaction was in a bundle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the EIP-2718 transactions would extend normal transactions to include two new fields: <code>bundle_signer</code> and an optional <code>block_number</code>. The <code>bundle_signer</code> would be the entity who is delegated local sequencing rights for the transaction, and the <code>block_number</code> would be the block number that the transaction is valid in if not zero.</p>\n<p>The other EIP-2718 transaction would be a meta-transaction whose only function is to order transactions that delegated sequencing rights to the signer of the transaction. This meta-transaction could only sequence transactions that delegated to it and could also delegate itself to another external party and specify a block number. This transaction would not start an execution context for itself.</p>\n<p>The opcode, potentially named <code>BUNDLE_SIGNER</code>, would expose the most immediate external party who put the transaction into a bundle if present.</p>\n<p>Other relevant pieces of technical information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike searcher PBS bundles, there is no revert protection provided to the sequenced transactions. This is to enable this EVM change to work with all types of EVM block builders, including ones that do not do simulations.</li>\n<li>If a transaction in the meta-transaction’s bundle is invalid, the bundle signer is charged for the invalid transaction as if it were just <code>CALLDATA</code> bytes. This is for DOS protection and due to the inability for a bundle creator to control all state that it is building on.</li>\n<li>If a transaction specifies a <code>bundle_signer</code>, it must be included in a bundle signed by the signer to be valid. This is to prevent competition between the total block builder and the delegated bundle creators.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bc8b64e6c82ff08f6070465f69a686dc00f4c090.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/bc8b64e6c82ff08f6070465f69a686dc00f4c090\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-06-17 at 5.38.55 PM\"><img src=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bc8b64e6c82ff08f6070465f69a686dc00f4c090_2_690x484.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-06-17 at 5.38.55 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"qTWpJmhdqkcKE113ru3akyMd2G4\" width=\"690\" height=\"484\" srcset=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bc8b64e6c82ff08f6070465f69a686dc00f4c090_2_690x484.png, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bc8b64e6c82ff08f6070465f69a686dc00f4c090_2_1035x726.png 1.5x, https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bc8b64e6c82ff08f6070465f69a686dc00f4c090_2_1380x968.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1C1B17\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"example-use-cases-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org#example-use-cases-2\"></a>Example Use Cases</h3>\n<p>Together, these new forms of expression would enable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart contracts to auction off the right to be the first entity to operate on a piece of state, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>AMMs auctioning off the first swap to lessen LVR.
