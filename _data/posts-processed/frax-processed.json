To address this, we propose adding LFXB2027 as a new exit option, offering liquidity providers more flexibility while maintaining the integrity and stability of the Frax ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-6941-proposal-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6941-proposal-details-4\"></a>Proposal Details</h1>\n<p>This approach offers liquidity providers a way to exit their positions while maintaining their investment within the Frax ecosystem, ensuring the protocol’s stability and growth. The following points are important to note about this proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pricing Based on Underlying Assets:</strong> The pricing for the locked liquidity will be based on the current price of the underlying assets at the time of the exchange.</li>\n<li><strong>Exchange with LFXB2027:</strong> Locked liquidity can be exchanged for LFXB2027 at the auction price prevailing at the time of the exchange. An LP that wishes to migrate can sign the migration transaction on the Ethereum mainnet and move their LP token/NFT to the protocol to receive LFXB2027 tokens directly to the same address on the Fraxtal mainnet.</li>\n<li><strong>Extra Option Alongside FXB2029:</strong> It is important to emphasize that LFXB2027 is being introduced as an additional option. Liquidity providers still have the choice to exit their locked positions through FXB2029, ensuring that they can select the exit strategy that best suits their needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Designated Locked Liquidity for Exchange:</strong> Only certain designated pools will be eligible for this exchange option, but this list can be expanded through the governance process.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pool</th>\n<th>Gauge Address</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/USDC</td>\n<td>0x3EF26504dbc8Dd7B7aa3E97Bc9f3813a9FC0B4B0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/DAI</td>\n<td>0xF22471AC2156B489CC4a59092c56713F813ff53e</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li><strong>Option to Retain LPs:</strong> Liquidity providers will have the option to either exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 or LFXB2027 or retain their current locked positions.</li>\n<li>No Ragequit Fee: There will be no Ragequit fee for liquidity providers choosing this exchange method, ensuring a cost-effective transition.</li>\n<li><strong>FXTL points:</strong> Migrators that receive LFXB2027 for their positions will be entitled to all FXTL points multipliers for all LFXB2027 holders, making it a high-yield opportunity within the Frax ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>TimedLocker for FXBs:</strong> The TimedLocker allows liquidity providers to stake their FXB tokens in exchange for fixed-rate FXS rewards, with the total amount of FXB stakable being capped. Locked positions are transferable as vault tokens, enabling users to sell or transfer their stakes without waiting for the lock period to end. Once the set ending timestamp is reached, all positions become unlockable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-6941-voting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6941-voting-5\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Approve the option for liquidity providers to exchange their locked liquidity for LFXB2027 at the auction price.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-adding-lfxb2027-as-an-option-for-locked-liquidity-exit/3242\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-adding-lfxb2027-as-an-option-for-locked-liquidity-exit/3242","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:16:18 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3242"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-adding-lfxb2027-as-an-option-for-locked-liquidity-exit/3242.rss","#text":"[FIP - 3XX] Adding LFXB2027 as an Option for Locked Liquidity Exit"},"filter":true},{"title":"[FIP - 3XX] Frax Finance Annual Budget Request (2024 - 2025)","dc:creator":"amirnader","category":"FIPs","description":"<h3><a name=\"p-6931-authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-authors-1\"></a>Authors</h3>\n<p>Frax Core Team</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6931-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-summary-2\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal seeks to authorize a revised maximum annual budget of <strong>4,100,000 FRAX</strong> for Frax Finance for the fiscal year 2024-2025. The revised budget reflects significant cuts across various categories to ensure financial prudence while continuing to support essential operations and initiatives. The budget is intended to cover four key categories: Development &amp; Operation, Security, Legal &amp; Compliance, and Fraxtal Growth under the Fraxtal Builders Program. Please note that this is a maximum cap, and it is highly likely that not all of it will be used, as we only spent 5,123,990 FRAX last year out of the 9,000,000 FRAX budget that we had during the last fiscal year.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6931-background-and-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-background-and-motivation-3\"></a>Background and motivation</h2>\n<p>As Frax Finance continues to grow and evolve, this budget supports our core operations while enabling strategic growth within the Fraxtal ecosystem. The allocation focuses on maintaining our development and operational capacity, ensuring security, managing legal and compliance obligations, and selectively supporting key initiatives within the Fraxtal ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6931-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-details-4\"></a>Details</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6931-budget-categories-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-budget-categories-5\"></a>Budget Categories</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Development and Operation:</strong> This budget will be used to cover the costs associated with the development and operation of the Frax Finance protocol. This could include salaries for developers, costs of new feature development, maintenance costs, infrastructure costs, and other operational expenses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security (Audits and Bug Bounty):</strong> This budget is allocated to maintaining the security of the Frax Finance protocol. This includes the costs of regular security audits by external firms, running a bug bounty program to incentivize the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities and other measures to ensure the safety and trust of our community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Legal and Compliance:</strong> This budget covers legal and compliance costs to ensure that Frax Finance operates within the legal framework. This could include fees for legal counsel, regulatory compliance costs, potential legal disputes, and other related expenses. Notably, Frax Finance has not encountered any significant legal issues to date, and last year, we spent less than 5% of the allotted legal budget. This allocation remains in place to ensure we are prepared for any unforeseen legal requirements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fraxtal Ecosystem Grants (Fraxtal Builders Program):</strong> This new budget category aims to support the growth of the Fraxtal ecosystem through the Fraxtal Builders Program. Although limited, this budget supports critical initiatives within the Fraxtal ecosystem, focusing on strategic growth and development. And it can be boosted by allocating Frax Finance grants from Superchain grant programs.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6931-budget-allocation-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-budget-allocation-6\"></a>Budget Allocation</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Budget Share Percentage</th>\n<th>Proposed Budget (2024 - 2025)</th>\n<th>Frax Finance Latest Annual Budget (2023 - 2024)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Development and Operation</td>\n<td>73.2%</td>\n<td>$3,000,000</td>\n<td>$3,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Security</td>\n<td>9.8%</td>\n<td>$400,000</td>\n<td>$1,400,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grants</td>\n<td>0.0%</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$600,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reserve Emergency Fund</td>\n<td>0.0%</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$1,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Legal and Compliance</td>\n<td>12.2%</td>\n<td>$500,000</td>\n<td>$3,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fraxtal Ecosystem Grants</td>\n<td>4.9%</td>\n<td>$200,000</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$4,100,000</td>\n<td>$9,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-6931-additional-notes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-additional-notes-7\"></a>Additional Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This proposal represents the maximum caps for each category, not necessarily the exact amounts that will be used.</li>\n<li>This proposal does not cover the costs of liquidity incentivization.

USD0++ is a liquid bond token that represents locked USD0, accruing pills (the points of Usual) over time.

The platform is designed to cater to both web2 and web3 users.</p>\n<p>Moso enables users to shop at any supported web2 retailer such as Walmart, Marriott, and eBay to earn in the crypto asset of their choice. Additionally, Moso offers a white-labeled shopping experience for web3 brands where users can earn up to 100% cash back or more in the ecosystem’s native token. <a href=\"https://shop.galxe.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Galxe Shop</a>, powered by Moso, has seen <strong>$200,000+</strong> in purchases, registered <strong>75,000+</strong> sign-ups, and driven <strong>$100,000+</strong> in $GAL rewards back to users. The rewards are partially funded by both the merchant and Galxe.</p>\n<p>Moso aims to work directly with Frax to provide $FXS cash-back rewards in a Frax Shop, powered By Moso. This partnership will let Moso implement a Fraxtal integration to the Moso Shop Marketplace with the purpose of $FXS being distributed and claimed on Fraxtal as cash-back rewards. This will result in an on-chain transaction on Fraxtal each time a claim is made.</p>\n<p>Moso is thrilled about the opportunity to integrate deeply into the Frax ecosystem as the only retail shop to earn cash back experience fully distributed in $FXS.</p>\n<p><strong>How are the cash-back rewards distributed?</strong></p>\n<p>Moso requests a token grant from Frax of up to $75K USD in $FXS to boost cash-back rates on top of the web2 merchants’ fixed cash-back rates being paid to Moso for driving purchases to these retailers.</p>\n<p>Increased rates will only sometimes be available. Boosted cash-back rates of as much as 100% back in $FXS at selected merchants will be deployed from time to time allowing users to find amazing shopping deals that they otherwise would not have access to. We expect this grant to last Moso at least 6 months.</p>\n<p>When boosted rates are not being deployed, web2 merchants distribute cash-back to Moso. Moso converts the fiat cash-back to $FXS on the backend for distribution to eligible users.

Throughout all of this, Frax can identify valuable, active ecosystem users with a real-world use case. This data can be leveraged in any marketing campaign Frax executes moving forward to continue to capture market share among users.</p>\n<p>Moso plans to distribute loyalty points to users in parallel with the higher cash-back rates in $FXS. Loyalty points can be earned by users continuing to visit the Frax Shop to Earn page daily. To include additional gamification methods, points will also be distributed from purchases at retailers and for engaging with different Frax ecosystem dapps/DeFi integrations.</p>\n<p>Moso also acts as a gateway for users to discover Frax’s best applications and DeFi integrations. Moso will work with the Frax team to understand which applications to highlight on the Frax Shop alongside retailers.</p>\n<p>By engaging with dapps and executing an on-chain action, the user will qualify for points and cash back. Cash-back rewards by engaging with Fraxtal dapps are TBD as that discussion will take place with the application since it revolves around the kickback the dapp can give in return for the conversion. This is the perfrect fit for dapps who already have a referral program in place or are in need of a referral program.</p>\n<p>Each shopping trip will power up to three on-chain transactions on Fraxtal for users engaging with the Frax Shop.

TRON has become a significant player in the stablecoin market, with a total value locked (TVL) reaching an all-time high of $58 billion ( <a href=\"https://defillama.com/stablecoins/Tron\">DefiLlama</a> ), primarily driven by USDT. The absence of both stablecoin alternatives and USD yield-bearing assets on TRON presents a great opportunity for FRAX and sFRAX to shine in this market. FRAX can offer a stable, decentralized alternative to USDT, while sFRAX can meet the demand for yield-bearing assets, providing users with more options for earning returns on their holdings.</p>\n<p>Fraxferry aims to simplify the cross-chain bridging issue for assets, making it easier to deploy Frax-related tokens on other chains.

Despite the strong fundamentals, “protocol’s meme premium” (AKA: valuation) is at a local all-time low. Based on my personal experience in branding/positioning/strategy from corporate, and the feedback I have gotten from people, a significant contributing factor to this local low is the lack of effective branding and marketing strategies that distinctly resonate with both B2C and B2B audiences (B2B in DeFi content is protocol-to-protocol). This proposal addresses these issues by recommending a dual-brand strategy and an enhanced user experience for targeted audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong><br>\nFrax Finance is currently missing out on the meme premium and broader market appeal due to its complex and professional UI, which might be intimidating for average users. This complexity also dilutes the brand’s message and reduces its appeal to potential investors and users who prefer a more straightforward interface.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong><br>\n<strong>1. Brand Segmentation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>B2C Brand:</strong> Develop a separate, consumer-friendly brand for Frax Finance’s retail products. This brand should focus on simplicity, ease of use, and a clean, vibrant interface. Naming of B2C brand yet to be decided but something synonymous to “Frax Lite”.</li>\n<li><strong>B2B Brand:</strong> Maintain a professional, detailed, and data-rich interface for institutional clients and advanced users. This brand should highlight the technical superiority and comprehensive services offered by Frax Finance. Naming of B2B brand yet to be decided but something synonymous to “Frax Pro”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Enhancements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>B2C Interface:</strong> Implement a clean, intuitive UI with easy navigation and a focus on key “normie” actions (e.g., staking, lending, swapping).</li>\n<li><strong>B2B Interface:</strong> Retain a detailed and data-driven interface with advanced features and analytics. Ensure that professional users can access all necessary information and tools without clutter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Content Strategy / Educational Videos (especially applicable to B2C “normie” users):</strong><br>\nVideo content is a powerful tool for educating and engaging users. It allows for complex concepts to be broken down into easy-to-understand visuals and narratives. Creating a YouTube channel with professionally made tutorial videos explaining how to use Frax Finance products can significantly improve user onboarding and retention.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Branding Example and Inspiration:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pendle Finance:</strong> Pendle Finance has successfully created a user-friendly brand that appeals to both retail and institutional clients.</li>\n<li><strong>Merit Circle’s Beam:</strong> Beam was a great rebranding for an L2 launch by Merit Circle. This can be a model for how Frax Finance can reinvent its image and appeal to a broader audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nex steps:</strong><br>\nIf the proposal is passed, a list of potential agencies will be proposed and discussed with the Frax core team. Potential agencies could include firms like IDEO, Frog, or local agencies specializing in fintech and blockchain. If this proposal is approved, I am ready to take ownership of the project, get in touch with the core team, contact companies for quotes, and oversee the project in alignment with the core team. I am also prepared to develop a full-fledged project plan while working with the agency.</p>\n<p><strong>My background:</strong><br>\nI have 7 years of experience in strategy and management consulting, having led rebranding and repositioning efforts for numerous products from a corporate strategy standpoint. Additionally, I have been a DeFi user for 4 years and involved in the crypto space for 5 years. This proposal is based on extensive feedback from numerous “normies” to whom I have introduced Frax, and their insights have been invaluable in further shaping this plan.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Additional note:</strong><br>\nAn important consideration not addressed in this proposal but nonetheless significant is the ambiguity surrounding the monetization of $FXTL. While it is anticipated by the Frax community members that the design of $FXTL monetization will mitigate a potential short-term dump, the current lack of clarity has led to market concerns. Specifically, there is a prevailing assumption that FXS tokens may be sold off once they are awarded to $FXTL holders, potentially creating the current sell pressure on the governance token.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/capture-meme-premium-with-distinct-b2c-and-b2b-branding-strategies/3159\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/capture-meme-premium-with-distinct-b2c-and-b2b-branding-strategies/3159","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 09:16:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3159"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/capture-meme-premium-with-distinct-b2c-and-b2b-branding-strategies/3159.rss","#text":"Capture \"Meme Premium\" with Distinct B2C and B2B Branding Strategies"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP - 380] Create weETH/FRAX Fraxlend Pair on Ethereum Mainnet and Authorize AMO Allocation","dc:creator":"Westwood","category":"Fraxlend","description":"<p><strong>Authors:</strong><br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/u/westwood\">@Westwood</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Propose the creation of a new Fraxlend pair on the Ethereum mainnet: weETH/FRAX.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"details-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#details-2\"></a>Details</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fraxlend Pair Name:</strong> weETH/FRAX - Variable Rate V2</li>\n<li><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum Mainnet</li>\n<li><strong>Max Authorized Allocation:</strong> 10,000,000 FRAX</li>\n<li><strong>Max Loan-to-Value (LTV):</strong> To be decided by the development team</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"background-and-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#background-and-motivation-3\"></a>Background and Motivation</h2>\n<p>Fraxlend is a lending platform that enables the creation of markets between pairs of ERC-20 tokens.

To address this concern and provide a flexible solution, we propose an exchange option to migrate the locked liquidity to FXBs, specifically FXB2029. This provides immediate liquidity to exit LPs starting with the older gauges while also keeping TVL within the Frax &amp; Fraxtal ecosystem, an overall value add for all parties. FXB2029 tokens are liquid with high incentives for liquidity providers, massive FXTL points boosts, and migrators can exit these tokens should they want to leave the ecosystem for any reason by selling them on-chain in Curve pools and other venues and in no way required to hold them until maturity.</p>\n<p>FXB tokens are simple, trustless tokens that resemble a zero-coupon bond that converts to the FRAX stablecoin on maturity. FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXB tokens are only convertible to FRAX stablecoins; they do not guarantee FRAX peg, FRAX value, or yield/interest denominated in any other asset except FRAX.</p>\n<p>By migrating to FXBs, liquidity providers will have an alternative means to manage their deployed capital within the Frax ecosystem, providing them with the flexibility they have requested while ensuring the protocol maintains its needed locked liquidity.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#proposal-details-4\"></a>Proposal Details</h1>\n<p>This approach offers liquidity providers a way to exit their positions while maintaining their investment within the Frax ecosystem, ensuring the protocol’s stability and growth. The following points are important to note about this proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pricing Based on Underlying Assets:</strong> The pricing for the locked liquidity will be based on the current price of the underlying assets at the time of the exchange.</li>\n<li><strong>Exchange with FXB2029:</strong> Locked liquidity can only be exchanged for FXB2029 at the auction price prevailing at the time of the exchange. The auction price has a floor price of .794 at the time of this proposal &amp; it is expected to remain at this floor price. An LP that wishes to migrate can sign the migration transaction on the Ethereum mainnet and move their LP token/NFT to the protocol to receive FXB2029 tokens directly to the same address on the Fraxtal mainnet. They are then free to do whatever they wish with their FXB2029 tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Designated Locked Liquidity for Exchange:</strong> Only certain designated pools will be eligible for this exchange option, but this list can be expanded through the governance process.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pool</th>\n<th>Gauge Address</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/USDC</td>\n<td>0x3EF26504dbc8Dd7B7aa3E97Bc9f3813a9FC0B4B0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/DAI</td>\n<td>0xF22471AC2156B489CC4a59092c56713F813ff53e</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li><strong>Option to Retain LPs:</strong> Liquidity providers will have the option to either exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 or retain their current locked positions.</li>\n<li><strong>No Ragequit Fee:</strong> There will be no Ragequit fee for liquidity providers choosing this exchange method, ensuring a cost-effective transition.</li>\n<li><strong>FXTL points &amp; incentives:</strong> Migrators that receive FXB2029 for their positions will be entitled to all FXTL points multipliers &amp; yield opportunities that are available and upcoming for all FXB2029 holders, making it one of the most high-yield opportunities within the Frax ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-5\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Approve the option for liquidity providers to exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 at the auction price.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>16 posts - 8 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-379-locked-liquidity-standard-exit/3145\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-379-locked-liquidity-standard-exit/3145","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Jul 2024 23:28:44 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3145"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-379-locked-liquidity-standard-exit/3145.rss","#text":"[FIP - 379] Locked Liquidity Standard Exit"},"filter":true},{"title":"[FIP - 377] Change veFXS Reward Distribution Token","dc:creator":"C2tP-C2tP","category":"FIPs","description":"<h1><a name=\"authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#authors-1\"></a>Authors</h1>\n<p>C2tP<br>\nSam Kazemian</p>\n<h1><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>There has been long discussions on how veFXS rewards should be distributed. There is merit to both buying back and distributing FXS and distributing a stable coin such as sFrax or sfrxEth. In the end users can swap for the token they want (albeit liquidity can differ between the tokens).</p>\n<p>The token of choice should be one that “does work” for the protocol and user. The more work done, the better the token choice. For example on Curve the fee token was originally 3Crv LP token. This was because having deeper liquidity on 3Crv was a major source of protocol fees.  Curve has now switched to crvUSD as each crvUSD in distribution is equivalent to a crvUSD being lent out and creating fees.</p>\n<p>One possible choice for Frax could be sFrax. sFrax does a lot of work for the user, but not all that much is gained on the protocol level. This can be an okay tradeoff though if claiming continued to be on mainnet since gas costs are higher and thus times to claim could be much longer for most users.</p>\n<p>On Fraxtal however, gas costs are much less of an issue. Thus reward tokens should be more oriented for Protocol work. This is both good for the user in an indirect way, as well as users can withdraw and convert to something more oriented for their yield whenever they want.</p>\n<p>The best asset choice for the protocol to issue would thus be an FXB. The protocol makes revenue in the background while the frax is waiting to be matured. If users claim and convert the FXB on the market, the protocol still has the underlying working. FXBs themselves also are yield bearing for the user (albeit at probably a slower rate than sFrax).</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to change veFXS revenue to be distributed as a wrapped version of the FXB20291231 issued on Fraxtal. The FXS buyback as part of the FLE system will stay the same.</p>\n<p>The wrapper for this token will automatically use the underlying FXB as collateral in FraxLend and borrow frax for sFrax if interest rates are profitable. Users will gain compounded FXB tokens and can withdraw at any time.  FraxLend AMO will also gain some interest by lending to the FraxLend pair.</p>\n<p>Wrapper can be found here (<a href=\"https://github.com/convex-eth/frax-cvx-platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/fraxtal/cvxFXB.sol\" class=\"inline-onebox\">frax-cvx-platform/contracts/contracts/fraxtal/cvxFXB.sol at main · convex-eth/frax-cvx-platform · GitHub</a>) and is currently under audit. Audit must be cleared to satisfactory levels before being used as the veFXS reward token.</p>\n<p>As of note, the wrapper will contain a migration function to move underlying fxb to a different fxb type. The admin role for setting this migration will be held by the Frax comptroller multisig or Frax Governance.</p>\n<p>Also the current name of the token (cvxFXB) is subject to change if we or the Frax team decide on something better before deployment.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"fees-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#fees-3\"></a>Fees</h1>\n<p>There will be a standard market fee of 10% as a management fee.<br>\nThis fee is only applied to revenue gained via the borrowing aspect of the wrapper and in no way applies to underlying vefxs rewards.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-4\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<p>For: Change veFXS reward token distribution to the cvxFXB FXB wrapper.<br>\nAgainst: Do nothing.</p>\n            <p><small>15 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-377-change-vefxs-reward-distribution-token/3137\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-377-change-vefxs-reward-distribution-token/3137","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 04:18:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3137"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-377-change-vefxs-reward-distribution-token/3137.rss","#text":"[FIP - 377] Change veFXS Reward Distribution Token"},"filter":false},{"title":"Use FXTL to redistribute Fraxtal revenue to users (v2)","dc:creator":"wolfehr","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/u/wolfehr\">@wolfehr</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraxtal is a new Frax product that will generate revenue via sequencer feeds and MEV.</li>\n<li>Frax will redistribute 20% of revenue back to users that add value to the ecosystem (as measured by flox blocksapce rewareds), with the remaining 80% going to veFXS and insurance (78/2 split).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Principals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The FXTL system should incentivize Fraxtal usage, Fraxtal TVL, and building/innovating on Fraxtal.</li>\n<li>Fraxtal’s revenue should be redistributed to users who add value to the ecosystem (as measured by FXTL).

I didn’t include that here because I (personally) don’t think it needs to be a core part of the FXTL system and can be a separate incentive stream that goes into the vault. However, if the majority feels emissions should be baked into the FXTL system long-term or we should include a short-term bootstrapping mechanism to kick start things included in this proposal, I can add it. Please just respond here, telegram, or discord to let me know. Here is ideal so the discussion is all in one place.</p>\n            <p><small>10 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/use-fxtl-to-redistribute-fraxtal-revenue-to-users-v2/3135\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/use-fxtl-to-redistribute-fraxtal-revenue-to-users-v2/3135","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 20:56:57 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3135"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/use-fxtl-to-redistribute-fraxtal-revenue-to-users-v2/3135.rss","#text":"Use FXTL to redistribute Fraxtal revenue to users (v2)"},"filter":false},{"title":"Discussion for a proposal to convert FXTL points to FXS","dc:creator":"Sharkysnakefish","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<p>This proposal consists of two parts. One initial conversion, then a ongoing FXTL conversion running theoretically forever.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Initial conversion.</strong><br>\nAt the one year mark of the launch of Fraxtal, have a opt-in event to convert the current FXTL points so far to FXS. The conversion will be weighted by amount of FXTL points opted in. Use 5 million FXS for this purpose. This will leave us with a market cap of 93 million FXS after the FPIS merger and the initial conversion is completed.</p>\n<p>The reason this event is opt-in is that there might be people who might want to try and game later weekly conversions, adding some game theory to the proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Ongoing FXTL conversion</strong><br>\nEvery year, earmark 1 million of FXS emissions for FXTL points conversion. Every week 19231 FXS is put into a pool. In the next week, people can deposit their FXTL points to redeem a percentage of this pool.</p>\n<p>1 million of yearly FXS emissions seems high. But it is important to remember that the FLE system if successful most likely will be able to absorb these emissions in the future. The proposal also gives ample runway (7 years), if the proposal does not prove successful. Hence new governance actions can be taken well before we reach the 100 million hardcap.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Extra</strong><br>\nAnother important discussion point is the introduction of a lock and multiplier system. This is my proposal for such a system.</p>\n<p>Min. No lock = 0.5x weight<br>\nMax. 4 years lock = 4x weight<br>\nLinear scaling between those options.</p>\n<p>Locking means that you will get more weight the week you are redeeming your FXTL points. After the week is over and the FXS is distributed, it is staked as veFXS gaining value until the lock is over.
