FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXBs allow the formation of a yield curve to price the time value of lending FRAX back to the protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.</p>\n<p>Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.</p>\n<p>Adding new FXBs is beneficial as it expands the FRAX ecosystem’s offerings, enhances liquidity, and provides users with additional tools for managing risk and optimizing investment strategies.

In the ethos of Frax being positive-sum, I propose that we help projects that builds solutions on-top of our products to be integrated or featured directly on the relevant Frax-app site. This proposal was made to outline who can be eligible, in what way they can be integrated or informed about and lastly what information should be given to the users and in what way.</p>\n<p>Solve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helps grow the Frax ecosystem</li>\n<li>Shows in action Frax is positive sum</li>\n<li>Can help Frax grow TVL</li>\n<li>Users become more aware of their options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Proposal 1:<br>\nInform/market directly on the relevant product pages of third-party solutions, so that users can see they have more options. Include a disclaimer that third-party option can have more risk.</p>\n<p>Pros: Easy to implement<br>\nCons: Less alignment with other protocols and do not help in the same degree.</p>\n<p>Proposal 2:<br>\nDirectly integrate third-party solutions into the relevant product pages, strictly as a opt-in option. Each new project that wants to be integrated has to have a proposal with a discussion-phase where they answer out all requirements. Failure to fulfil all requirements leads to automatic disqualification.</p>\n<p>Requirements needed to be fulfilled to qualify for implementation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has to be relevant for the product site it wants to be integrated with.</li>\n<li>Protocol has to be over 2 years old.</li>\n<li>Core members of the protocol should be doxxed (At the minimum to our core team).</li>\n<li>They have audits for all contract upgrades/changes.</li>\n<li>A fee will be taken by the Frax protocol and put into a security fund in case of hacks. This fund will only be used towards users using the directly integrated solution, as a extra security. There is also an expectation that every protocol integrated have a plan in case a hack should happen, and already now take steps to mitigate damage. The fee taken has to reflect the protocols risk and economics. The fee % will be decided on a per-integration basis, and will be a crucial part of the integration proposal and discussion per project proposal.</li>\n<li>There has to be ELI5 explanations made by the protocol on how their system works, with clear pros and cons given to the user.

The Frax ecosystem has traditionally been associated with very serious defi plays and has not thus far drawn significant attention from meme coiners in the space.</p>\n<p>Simply waiting for a community led meme coin to grow to large, hype inducing valuations may take years to develop and will not help Fraxtal supercharge growth and adoption. To this end, the option of supporting meme coins, in a manner that befits a defi focused chain, exists to help in supercharging memes and gaining retail attention.</p>\n<p>The motivation for this FIP has emerged from discussions with some of the leading meme coins in the current FRAX space, namely FraxDOGE (first meme coin on Fraxtal). Notably, memes across Fraxtal have seen only modest growth but would benefit from LP support at greatly increased levels to supercharge their growth.</p>\n<p>Acknowledging that this would be good for any future meme launch and for protocols, the playing field must remain level and as such, the establishment of the Frax Meme collective should ensure that new meme coins that are properly vetted, can be included in the program to supercharge meme growth. Details of this proposal, membership etc, will be discussed below.</p>\n<p><strong>Kick start the OG</strong></p>\n<p>The first step of this proposal is to kick start the meme LP agenda through the allocation of 10,000 FXS to the first meme deployed on Fraxtal, namely FraxDOGE.</p>\n<p>fraxDOGE, has also distributed a full 1% of the total supply to the top 100veFXS holders.

This allocation can be renewed after the 2 months pending the decision of “the Frax Meme Collective” as described below.</p>\n<p>Notably, this allocation will need to go to pools where fraxDOGE has been paired with FXS to ensure additional utility. FXD will utilise RA exchange to allocate their rewards to a fraxDOGE/FXS LP. Any breach of the above or acts of bad faith will mean immediate disqualification from any further support on Frax. Ideally this serves the dual purposes of building our FXS liquidity in the near term.</p>\n<p><strong>Establish The Frax Meme Collective</strong></p>\n<p>The Frax meme collective is designed to be made up of interested community members who will be elected by FXS voters. The collective will initially consist of 5 volunteer members who will self nominate to join the collective. Notably, the Frax Meme Collective are under no obligation to continue to support any token (including FXD) once they are duly elected.</p>\n<p>The collective will establish their business rules, governance etc once they are duly elected.</p>\n<p>The goals of the collective are to:<br>\n-Request monthly funding for meme LP incentives</p>\n<p>-Review memes for user safety, ie burnt liquidity, non-rug, non-tax token type reviews.</p>\n<p>-Allocate meme funding to projects that have passed fair review</p>\n<p>-Publish monthly allocations and ensure compliance with the themes of good behaviour. (ie non FXS dumping to buy tokens etc)</p>\n<p><strong>Frax Collective Elections:</strong></p>\n<p>I propose that Collective members submit a short bio and reason for their desire to join the Collective on the FRAX forum for subsequent short listing and voting via FXS holders. This should occur no more than 2 weeks post the passing of this snapshot. As the authors, we are happy to coordinate this but notably, the authors will not be guaranteed a position.

Acting as a top of funnel to the ecosystem, we have been a one stop shop for everything related to Frax .</p>\n<p>It has been a worthy experiment to see how far an outside entity like Flywheel can support Frax, but it is obvious that there are limits to this model. Flywheel has done its best to amplify Frax and we have to an extent, but after reflecting on the past it is clear that the most effective way that Frax can execute marketing and communications going forward is shifting to an internal strategy.</p>\n<p>With this being said, I am requesting that the core team pause funding for Flywheel going forward. Flywheel will continue with its obligations for Frax until April 12th after which there will be no need to send any more payments. The core team has already started the process of shifting to creating internal positions that focus specifically on marketing/growth.</p>\n<p>Wr would like to thank everyone who has supported us in the past including all veFXS voters (whether you voted for or against) who participated in our funding votes. Some of the most participated votes in the history of Frax was over Flywheel and is a testament to the liveliness of the community as a whole.</p>\n<p>There are multiple tailwinds pushing Frax forward this cycle. The launch of Fraxtal and its push of being the M2 of crypto is positioning the ecosystem to being the easiest place to launch an L3.

This proposal aims to make governance more effective while establishing clear and transparent expectations, with fairness that does not differentiate.</p>\n<p>Solve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This proposal makes sure users who are unhappy with their position have a clear way to get their funds/LP position back with standardized costs.</li>\n<li>It makes future governance for FRAX more effective with less need for discussion and less proposals</li>\n<li>It protects the interest of our protocols liquidity system with a standardized fee which is intended to make it unattractive to ragequit</li>\n<li>It protects the protocol from lowering the collateralization ratio below 100% from ragequit proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal does not in any way or form talk about unlocks, which is another topic best judged from case to case in regards to situation.</p>\n<p>My proposal for a standardized ragequit is:<br>\n10% flat fee<br>\n0.5% fee per month left</p>\n<p>Example 1: 1 month left of lock<br>\n10.5% of LP</p>\n<p>Example 2: 36 months left of lock<br>\n28% of LP</p>\n<p>Due to people being able to claim rewards, it is hard to retract those. To make standardization more easy, the flat rate was increased to 10%. This is more similar with some earlier ragequit proposals. The variable rate of 0.5% per month also accounts for other proposals with higher lock times and with a usual 20% ragequit fee.</p>\n<p>There  is also the worry about the collateralization ratio (from now refrenced as CR) of Frax Finance, and how ragequits impact on our long term goal of 100% CR. I therefore propose that we utilize a oracle to check CR, and if its below 100% ragequitting is not permitted. In this way, we can protect Frax from systemic risk, while still allowing participants that want to ragequit the possibility when it does not unnecessary damage the protocols interests.</p>\n<p>I propose that all new gauges/locks have this option from start, so that this will be optional without going through governance. This means that contracts should have a easy to use front end for ragequitting, which may lead to more development work. The work for the front-end should be prioritized at the core teams discretion, to not distract for more short/mid term important matters. That may even mean a delay for new pairs to get the ragequit function.  For old pairs, one have go through governance to enable a ragequit function. It is important to clearify that this proposal will still be relevant, and the terms outlined in this proposal will still apply in ragequitting of those old pairs. The proposals for old pairs will simply be if one should activate the ragequit function or not.</p>\n<p>I propose LP the protocol takes in fees from the ragequit be added to the FLE, so that the protocol can continue operating the pair or in other ways increase our revenue and liquidity. The protocol  will then manage to keep the pair more stable, even during ragequits. It also benefits from the ragequit because it adds value to the balance sheet.</p>\n            <p><small>25 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/standardize-ragequit-proposals-and-make-it-a-feature-and-not-a-bug/3016\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/standardize-ragequit-proposals-and-make-it-a-feature-and-not-a-bug/3016","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 07:27:24 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3016"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/standardize-ragequit-proposals-and-make-it-a-feature-and-not-a-bug/3016.rss","#text":"Standardize ragequit proposals and make it a feature and not a bug"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP - 348,349] Authorize Fraxlend AMO for new pairs ( sUSDe/FRAX, USDe/FRAX )","dc:creator":"amirnader","category":"AMOs","description":"<h2><a name=\"authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#authors-1\"></a>Authors</h2>\n<p>Frax Core Team</p>\n<h1><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>Authorize Fraxlend AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the following Fraxlend pairs with mentioned max authorized allocation.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Fraxlend Pair Name</th>\n<th>Chain</th>\n<th>Fraxlend Pair Address</th>\n<th>Max Authorized Allocation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>sUSDe/FRAX - Variable Rate V2</td>\n<td>Ethereum</td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n<td>125,000,000 FRAX</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDe/FRAX - Variable Rate V2</td>\n<td>Ethereum</td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n<td>125,000,000 FRAX</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h1><a name=\"background-and-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#background-and-motivation-3\"></a>Background and Motivation</h1>\n<p>Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens.

If you want users to commit long-term but do not want to keep rewarding a pool, you could think of other formulas, like bonds.</p>\n<p>I am posting this not just because I am locked for over 2 years in a Convex FRAX pool that is not getting any rewards, but because I am also providing liquidity in several others with a minimum lock because, after this bad experience, I am scared of being stuck in those with no yield. I doubt that is beneficial for the protocol. You want me to stay there long-term, but I can only do so if I can expect to be treated fairly, which is not the case as of now.</p>\n<p>Before making a specific proposal, I wanted to create this topic so we can talk about it. In my opinion, it is fine if the protocol decides to stop rewarding a pool but, in that case, users should be allowed to exit from it.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/exiting-a-3-years-lock-pool-that-is-not-getting-rewards-anymore/2999\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/exiting-a-3-years-lock-pool-that-is-not-getting-rewards-anymore/2999","pubDate":"Sat, 23 Mar 2024 17:00:26 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2999"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/exiting-a-3-years-lock-pool-that-is-not-getting-rewards-anymore/2999.rss","#text":"Exiting a 3 years lock pool that is not getting rewards anymore"},"filter":true},{"title":"Add Curve BobrCRV/wfrxETH to the FXS gauge controller on Fraxtal","dc:creator":"BobrCRV","category":"Gauges","description":"<p><strong>Proposal Overview:</strong></p>\n<p>Proposal to add BobrCRV/wfrxETH pool to the FXS gauge controller</p>\n<p>CURVEBOBR is a fancoin for enthusiasts of the Curve ecosystem, decentralization, and cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p><strong>BobrCRV Initiative:</strong></p>\n<p>BobrCRV is an initiative by members of the CURVE community and the first memcoin born in the ecosystem.

This is the first in a series of posts outlining the vision. The Frax Singularity Roadmap should be the guiding light of the Frax community.</p>\n<p><strong>Post-Singularity Frax Era</strong><br>\nThe launch of Fraxtal and achievement of effectively 100% CR are milestones that start a new era in Frax. Fraxtal is the substrate that enables the Frax ecosystem; it is the operating system of Frax. Fraxtal completes Frax’s core product offerings – Frax is strategically adding new subprotocols and Frax assets but all the necessary building blocks are now in place. The community can now focus on larger opportunities and paradigm shifting products as well as issuing native Frax Assets across all of the crypto universe.</p>\n<p>In order to get here, Frax has generated $45m+ to achieve effectively 100% CR. This was a huge effort on everyone’s part, including a significant sacrifice from FXS holders to improve the overall health of Frax. The FRAX stablecoin has been largely dormant during this process and FXS revenue sharing was cut by 90% to conserve assets. That can now change entirely.</p>\n<p><strong>Frax: The Only Full Stack Protocol</strong><br>\nFraxtal is the home of Frax Nation &amp; the Fraxtal Network State. With Fraxtal, the Frax community has a sovereign home, culture, and digital space they can call their own. This is why Fraxtal is being built. Frax already issues its own currencies &amp; is fully governed and owned onchain by FXS stakers. Now, Frax has its own full-fledged network in Fraxtal.</p>\n<p>Soon, L3s of Fraxtal will go online. L3s are like fractals and similar to sub-communities that have their own distinct identity &amp; culture but part of the overall Frax Network State. They benefit from earning Frax Asset yields, RWA yields, Fraxtal settlement+security guarantees, and a constant stream of FXTL points to their L3 contract on Fraxtal based on its popularity, usage, and TVL. <strong>All this together governed by FXS which represents an interest in the digital nation of Frax.</strong></p>\n<p>Fraxtal stands on the shoulders of Optimism to create one of the most developer friendly L2’s on Ethereum. While most L2’s simply mirror Ethereum’s incentives, we’ve gone further and innovated on base incentives to create the most compelling possible experience for developers and users - and we will continue innovating.  By owning the entire stack, Frax can introduce features like account abstraction, new precompiles, privacy functionality, aggregated DA, and Superchain interop. These features will dramatically improve the on-chain experience &amp; make Fraxtal the preferred location to hold, stake, and transfer crypto in the coming months and years.</p>\n<p>*<em>With the above in mind, centralized exchanges and payment service providers that integrate Fraxtal chain deposits/withdrawals early can get allocations of FXTL points until the program concludes.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kickstarting Fraxtal</strong><br>\nFraxtal’s innovative Flox Blockspace Incentives have just finished its first epoch of allocating FXTL points to users and popular smart contracts. <strong>This makes Fraxtal the only network to automatically distribute rewards block by block to users &amp; developers for using the chain.</strong> These incentives run for many years &amp; will become known as a core innovation of Fraxtal as users and developers will become accustomed to earning rewards to use blocksapce, unlike any other network.</p>\n<p><em>The road to $100B+ Fraxtal TVL starts now and with the target of EOY 2026.</em> All Frax Assets including FRAX, sFRAX, frxETH (and new Frax Assets) will be issued on Fraxtal first going forward. The Frax Core Developers are actively moving to issue Frax Assets on Fraxtal including native 4626 yield vaults, minting, and redeeming. When Frax assets reach a new ATH supply, so will Fraxtal TVL. This is a unique synergy only possible because of Frax’s full stack system.<br>\nFrax Assets will permeate every chain but the base contracts and assets will exist on Fraxtal mainnet.</p>\n<p><strong>Fraxtal’s Fractal Scaling Roadmap</strong><br>\nFraxtal is targeting 23 L3s in the next 365 days to kickstart the Fraxtal Nation community.  Frax has always taken a positive sum approach and directly supports the community and builders that integrate with us. We believe 23 L3s is the perfect number of chains that we can actively support with direct developer access/incentives/investment and more. The first two L3s are already in the works and we expect to fill the remaining spots in the coming months! L3s wil not only earn FXTL points through Flox, but the 23 L3 slots are for official partners that will get additional support from the Fraxtal Core Devs and large allocations of FXTL total supply.</p>\n<p>If you are deploying any form of L3 or appchain and want to explore joining the Fraxtal Network State early, reach out to the Frax Core Developers &amp; our strategic rollup-as-a-service provider partners: Conduit.xyz, Gelato.network, &amp; Caldera.xyz to express your early interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview of Frax Assets</strong><br>\nFrax is the only protocol in all of crypto that has 4 separate tokens/assets in the top 200. This number will only increase as will the rank of Frax Assets. Thus, it’s important to have a current overview of all Frax Assets &amp; their utility, pegs, and design specs.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Frax Asset</th>\n<th>Utility &amp; Specs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Frax Share (FXS)</td>\n<td>Governance/Staking token of all of Frax Finance, base pair of all FXS Liquidity Engine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FRAX &amp; Staked FRAX (s)FRAX</td>\n<td>Dollar Peg, 4626 yielding vault</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frax Ether &amp; Staked Frax Ether (s)frxETH</td>\n<td>ETH Peg, initial gas token on Fraxtal, 4626 yielding vault, soon to be LRT with v2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frax Bitcoin &amp; Staked Frax Bitcoin (s)frxBTC</td>\n<td>BTC peg, 4626 yielding vault, fully collateralized by BTC on Bitcoin PoW chain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frax Price Index (FPI)</td>\n<td>Flatcoin/CPI peg, no yielding token - peg is inflation resistant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frax Bond (FXB)</td>\n<td>Zero coupon bond tokens that convert to FRAX on maturity similar to US Treasuries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fraxtal Points (FXTL)</td>\n<td>Points that represent usage of the Fraxtal blockchain to be tokenized at a future date.

Now that 100% CR has been effectively reached, FXS can receive all utility and benefits of the entire Frax stack. We propose that the protocol fee switch be turned back on, with 50% of the yield flowing to veFXS and the other 50% used to buy FXS and other Frax assets to pair in the FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE). The FLE will allow Frax to continue building its balance sheet while dramatically increasing liquidity for FXS and paired Frax assets. According to Defillama, even without counting multiple sources of revenue like Fraxtal chain fees and the Fraxlend AMO, <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/frax-finance\">Frax makes over $40m of revenue annualized</a> as of this writing.</p>\n<p><strong>veFXS Revenue Share+Fee Switch Turned ON</strong><br>\nveFXS stakers will get total protocol fees at the passing of this proposal added to the veFXS yield distributor on Ethereum mainnet as well as veFXS yield distributor contract on Fraxtal soon after.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zRPeTqv0QnevW3a7J23my8LMfrf.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5_2_293x293.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"zRPeTqv0QnevW3a7J23my8LMfrf\" width=\"293\" height=\"293\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5_2_293x293.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5_2_439x439.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5_2_586x586.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1A1A1A\"></a></div><br>\n<em>FXS Liquidity Engine will create increasing FXS POL against first Frax Assets but can and will be expanded to other voted pairs by the community.</em><p></p>\n<p>FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE)<br>\nThe FXS Liquidity Engine is a protocol owned liquidity Schelling-point of pairs of every Frax Asset against FXS. Revenue allocated to the FLE is used to buy back half FXS &amp; half Frax Assets to increase the liquidity depth of the pair. The amount allocated to the FLE is based on the trailing price of FXS. If FXS 30-day trailing price is lower than the prior month, then 25% of protocol revenue is allocated to the FXS Liquidity Engine instead of veFXS. If the 30-day trailing price is higher than the prior month, then 25% more of protocol revenue is distributed to veFXS instead.<br>\nThe long term goal is to increase the utility, liquidity, and lending credit to FXS to unprecedented levels as revenue comes in block-by-block.</p>\n<p>Powered by Fraxswap+BAMM, these will be the initial FLE POL pairs:<br>\nFXS-frxBTC pair (more on frxBTC timelines &amp; info in Singularity Part 2)<br>\nFXS-sfrxETH pair<br>\nFXS-sFRAX pair<br>\nFXS-FPI pair<br>\nFLE gauges will be releasing soon to power different FLE pairs including bespoke FLE pairs. FLE gauges that go live with this vote: FXS-frxETH, FXS-FRAX.<br>\nThis liquidity engine is entirely on Fraxtal mainnet and nowhere else so Frax profits directly increase Fraxtal TVL, liquidity, &amp; lending capacity in real time.</p>\n<p>Frax Finance revenue to FXS and the FXS Liquidity Engine is not cyclical and generates consistent revenue through all market cycles to increase POL constantly in all macro conditions. When volatile assets go down in value, revenue from FXBs and (s)FRAX should increase revenues. Thus, the FLE should be a constant, direct value add to FXS holders and stakers alike.<br>\n<em>Note: there are certain strategic assets that will be kept on the balance sheet/treasury including CVX (staked as vlCVX), cvxCRV, cvxPRISMA, &amp; cvxFXN, among other assets that will be added as “strategic assets” in future governance votes. These strategic assets will not be sold or distributed to veFXS holders nor sold to power the FLE.</em></p>\n<p>FPIS Resolution<br>\nThere is a tremendous amount of mental overhead that goes into having a separate token and alternate governance process. For all of Frax’s existence, FXS had been that token until FPIS was released in 2022. To unlock FPI’s growth potential, simplify Frax’s structure and reduce developer and community overhead, we propose that FPIS be absorbed into Frax. Additionally, this brings onto the Frax balance sheet $4.5m of additional profits/assets to bolster the treasury. The important outcome is that the entire Frax community is singularly aligned behind FXS and the success of Fraxtal. Thus, to simplify this resolution, we propose lowering the FPIS to veFXS conversion by 67% to the new 1 FPIS→1.33 veFXS for a 4 year lock and will decay to 0.33 veFXS at the end of the lock period. The conversion of FPIS on the unlock date of March 22, 2028 will be at 2.5 FPIS to 1 FXS if not relocked. This number was reached after careful consideration of all reasonable &amp; civil community feedback both on Telegram &amp; in this thread, especially of long term FXS and FPIS holders that received the FPIS airdrop and staked to keep long term alignment with all of Frax’s core protocols. <strong>This ratio is also exactly the rate that will NOT create any new FXS inflation above the 100m total supply due to 16.4M FXS in the community governed treasury. This merge will distribute less than the idle amount of FXS located there and does not count supply reductions over 4 years due to buybacks through the FXS Liquidity Engine.</strong> Even if 100% of all FPIS 4 year locks unlock without relocking (a highly unlikely event), there will not be an FXS supply increase above 100m ever due to this merge. The result being a merge of two tokens, unifying the community, and keeping FXS supply under 100m. This final ratio dramatically lowers the governance &amp; utility power of FPIS while still merging it into a single FXS token distribution and creating zero new inflation of FXS tokens. Lastly, veFPIS also qualifies for the April 3rd FXTL points snapshot at the 1.33 rate.</p>\n<p><strong>sFRAX &amp; sfrxETH Updated Yield &amp; sfrxETH LRT Functionality</strong><br>\nAt the conclusion of this governance proposal, sFRAX will be set to a 50% cap rate with 5.4% IORB floor rate. This means that sFRAX APR will have a max rate of 50% at the passing of this proposal and a floor rate of the IORB rate compared to the current model that has the IORB rate as the top cap rate. This new system allows sFRAX to become the benchmark DeFi rate to all integrators of sFRAX. Users who currently hold sFRAX now or mint/swap into sFRAX will start receiving the new cap rate immediately after the epoch that this proposal is passed in governance. In order to keep sFRAX at 50% cap rate, Frax will add sUSDeFRAX POL through the Curve AMO. Thus, this proposal is also for a 250m ceiling cap of sUSDeFRAX Curve AMO.</p>\n<p>sfrxETH will have new higher APRs with the advent of Frax Ether v2. In v2, sfrxETH APRs can be as high as the interest rate anyone wishes to pay to borrow validators which means that sfrxETH APRs can and likely will approach, then surpass liquid restaking tokens. sfrxETH will be the standard benchmark of ETH yield based on a fully collateralized LSD design. Additionally, Frax Ether v2 will have direct restaking support officially turning sfrxETH into a liquid restaked token (LRT). This governance proposal greenlights EigenLayer restaking pods and direct EigenLayer deposits for sfrxETH. This allows sfrxETH holders to enjoy higher than average LSD yield, FXTL points if held/used on Fraxtal, as well as EigenLayer points. Frax is also working with EigenLayer to design a Fraxtal AVS that uses both FXS and sfrxETH restaking making Frax one of the only full stack integrations on each level of EigenLayer and giving FXS chain-level staking utility. In the singularity era, sfrxETH will be the leading LRT of DeFi.</p>\n<p><strong>Gradually and then Suddenly: The Full Stack</strong><br>\nIt’s been a long road culminating in the launch of Fraxtal and achieving 100% CR on FRAX.  Frax’s strategy has been to build core pieces of infrastructure internally which in the short term takes a significant investment of time and energy.  If the community zooms in too closely, progress can feel static and individual pieces disjointed. Indeed some have said Frax does too many things, but the reality is if the community zooms out now, they will begin to see the giant flywheel that’s just been completed. We’ve just shipped one of the most innovative L2’s in the space and closed a $45m asset gap to weatherproof FRAX’s balance sheet. Frax Ether v2 is close to release and will offer the most compelling LSD+LRT experience while sFRAX yields will be among the most competitive and reputable yields in DeFi. Protocol fees can once again flow to veFXS and power an FXS liquidity blackhole on our own chain. Frax Assets will also flow to every major chain and capture mindshare &amp; monetary premium for Frax.</p>\n<p>Now, the foundation is in place for Frax and others to build upon and scale quickly upwards. Fraxtal will be at the center of this growth with FXS as the ultimate beneficiary of everything Frax achieves. We’ve built this foundation for the landscape that we see tomorrow, not the one we lived in yesterday. Rather than pondering theoretical new markets and writing whitepapers, Frax has been and always will be shipping live products and seizing markets before others know they even exist. This speed and safety will be enabled by the foundation that we’ve built to date. <strong>The Singularity phase of Frax begins now.</strong></p>\n<p>Part 2 of this roadmap will be posted at a future date after this proposal is voted on in governance.</p>\n            <p><small>29 posts - 17 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-341-frax-singularity-roadmap-part-1/2987\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-341-frax-singularity-roadmap-part-1/2987","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 20:15:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2987"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-341-frax-singularity-roadmap-part-1/2987.rss","#text":"[FIP - 341] Frax Singularity Roadmap Part 1"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP - 340] Proposal for retiring of the Harmony canFRAX and canFXS","dc:creator":"amirnader","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<h2><a name=\"authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#authors-1\"></a>Authors</h2>\n<p>Frax Core Team</p>\n<h1><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>This proposal suggests retiring the outstanding Harmony addresses for the canFRAX and canFXS tokens following the security breach of the Harmony’s Horizon Bridge in 2022.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"background-and-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#background-and-motivation-3\"></a>Background and Motivation</h1>\n<p>Frax Finance previously utilized the Harmony Horizon Bridge to facilitate the transfer of FRAX and FXS tokens to the Harmony network, resulting in the creation of canFRAX and canFXS tokens. Unfortunately, in June 2022, the Harmony Horizon Bridge was compromised in a significant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/harmony-blockchain-crypto-hack/\">security breach</a>, resulting in the loss of a substantial amount of FRAX and FXS tokens that backed the canFRAX and canFXS tokens circulating on Harmony One Network.</p>\n<p>The security breach of the Harmony Horizon Bridge was a severe incident that led to the loss of user funds and undermined trust in the integrity of the Harmony bridge. Frax Finance believes that it is Harmony’s responsibility to reimburse the FRAX and FXS tokens lost in the bridge due to the security breach, rather than burdening Frax Finance with the obligation to reimburse users. While Harmony has created some form of repayment and restitution program for hack victims, it has fallen dramatically short of reimbursing anywhere near the full loss of the Harmony Bridge hack even nearly 2 years after the fact. That is why we believe full responsibility lies on Harmony. Frax Finance is a direct victim of the Harmony Bridge hack just like all affected users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#proposal-details-4\"></a>Proposal Details</h1>\n<p>Given the circumstances surrounding the security breach of the Harmony Horizon Bridge and the loss of FRAX and FXS tokens backing canFRAX and canFXS, it is proposed to retire the outstanding tokens for canFRAX and canFXS tokens.

The Truflation team is in the process of integrating our oracle into Fraxtal which will allow access to our massive library of real-world asset price feeds. Platforms building on top of Fraxtal will be able to build innovative DeFi and real-world products using our real-time immutable price data. We are excited to ideate new products with Fraxtal protocols and look forward to brainstorming with teams. We encourage Frax ecosystem partners to comment on this post to coordinate future development. Integrators and developers can view our Indexes and Data Feeds on the Data Marketplace on the Truflation website.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Bridging Nuon to Fraxtal</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Phase Two of our launch on Fraxtal will involve bridging the flatcoin, Nuon, to Fraxtal.</p>\n<p>Nuon is the world’s first true decentralized flatcoin — a stablecoin with a price peg that rises and falls with inflation rates, shielding holders against loss of value from inflation.</p>\n<p>Current daily inflation levels are measured by Truflation, an independent inflation index oracle. Truflation calculates the Nuon peg daily and shares it with the Nuon protocol, which uses over-collateralization and arbitrage to maintain the peg while offsetting inflation for Nuon flatcoin holders. Nuon can be minted within the Nuon Protocol by depositing approved cryptocurrency collateral. This guarantees over-collateralization for minted Nuon, maintaining a stable peg.</p>\n<p>We see Fraxtal as the perfect place for Nuon considering the DeFi expertise in the Frax ecosystem. Frax’s successful launch and upkeep of Frax Price Index (FPI) showed the long-term focus on building useful products and we hope to work together on the future of inflation-protected and flatcoin products. More information and documentation on Nuon can be found at nuon .fi</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Proposal to create an FPI / Nuon “Flatcoin Basepool”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the synergies between Nuon and FPI, we are proposing the creation of the Flatcoin Basepool on Curve. Much like the FRAX / USDC Basepool, the Flatcoin Basepool will pair FPI and Nuon with other flatcoins and can also include yielding stablecoins. The special oracle pegged Curve pool will use the Truflation inflation price as the peg between Nuon and FPI. Beginning with a pool on Fraxtal, then likely moving towards other chains like ETH Mainnet, Arbitrum, Base, and others based on the incentive appetite from the community. We are requesting feedback from the Frax community on phasing this launch and deciding on incentives. We have additional flatcoin pairs planned with partners that would like to pair their stablecoin, yielding stable, or flatcoin with FPI and Nuon.</p>\n<p>Further collaboration between Frax and Truflation</p>\n<p>As we create and bring liquidity to the flatcoin basepool between FPI and NUON, we will be monitoring the performance of the pool and the peg. In time, if all goes well with the pool, we plan to propose that FPI use the Truflation CPI Oracle as the underlying oracle to track inflation. With the support of the Frax ecosystem, we will return to the forum in the coming months and propose the integration of the oracle into FPI.</p>\n<p><strong>Truflation invites FRAX Finance to contribute to the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>Given Frax Finance’s role in developing flatcoins, Truflation would like to offer 0.1% of the TRUF total token supply to FXS holders.</p>\n<p>As per snapshot on 3/12/24 there were 17,685 FXS holders</p>\n<p>In addition to rewarding FXS holders, Truflation would also like to allocate an additional token supply to Frax Finance DAO Treasury. Once Truflation is used as the underlying oracle to track CPI, we will airdrop another batch of tokens to the DAO’s treasury. To ensure participation in the Truflation ecosystem and its independence in the future towards governance and methodology, these tokens would be locked in the Truflation governance portal in the form of veTRUF. As this partnership progresses, we hope to have Frax as an aligned partner within our ecosystem. We will return in the coming months with more information on the success of the basepool and eventual airdrop to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Requesting feedback from the community</strong></p>\n<p>We are requesting feedback from the Frax community on the actions above. With support from the community, we will progress the discussion to a vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"vote-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#vote-1\"></a>Vote:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>For:  Creating a “Flatcoin Basepool” with Nuon and FPI, pegged to the Truflation CPI Oracle</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fpiip-13-truflation-x-frax-partnership-proposal/2956\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fpiip-13-truflation-x-frax-partnership-proposal/2956","pubDate":"Tue, 12 Mar 2024 14:56:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2956"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fpiip-13-truflation-x-frax-partnership-proposal/2956.rss","#text":"[FPIIP-13] Truflation x Frax Partnership Proposal"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP - 339] Add the Curve CVG/FRAXBP pool to the FXS gauge controller","dc:creator":"Wireshark","category":"Gauges","description":"<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>\nAdd CVG/FRAXBP to the FXS gauge controller<br>\nCurve pool address: <a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crypto-362/deposit\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Curve.fi</a><br>\nPool: 0xa7b0e924c2dbb9b4f576cce96ac80657e42c3e42<br>\nGauge: 0x8a111b47b31bba40c2f0d2f9a8cf6b6c4b50114e<br>\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://app.cvg.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.cvg.finance/</a><br>\nTwitter: <span class=\"mention\">@Convergence_fi</span></p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong><br>\nConvergence is an agnostic “Convex-like” layer, currently deployed atop Stake DAO. In addition to the well-known “Convex-like” behavior of aggregation/optimization of underlying protocols, Convergence also gathers mechanisms inspired from Curve, and Olympus. Gauges and veTokenomics are used to drive emissions, and a <em>Bonding Program</em> has been established. Bonds are used to build Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) and a treasury that allows Convergence to ensure self-sustainability, but also to reward token holders with an intrinsic incentive mechanism that does not rely on underlying protocols’ aggregation.</p>\n<p>Convergence’s main products are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a boosting layer for Curve LPs via Stake DAO</li>\n<li>a yield-bearing locked primitive that acts as a Curve ecosystem index (ysCVG)</li>\n<li>a governance aggregator (mgCVG)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong><br>\nConvergence’s liquidity consists of 2 pools (CVG/WETH and CVG/FRAXBP), where the liquidity is almost entirely owned by the protocol as <em>Protolcol Owned Liquidity</em>.</p>\n<p>The CVG/FRAXBP pool is a secondary pool, which purposes are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>allowing users to buy CVG using stablecoins;</li>\n<li>being a farming venue for the treasury which will accumulate CRV CVX and FXS rewards that will be distributed back to ysCVG holders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, we are looking for a gauge on Frax to maximize earnings from the CVG/FRAXBP pool. The LP will be max locked on Convex/Frax, and vote incentives will be offered to veFXS holders on Votemarket.

With this in mind I propose that until the protocol is fully collateralized by exogenous collateral, fees should be split 75/25 between veFXS holders and the protocol treasury.</p>\n<p>As of now, the protocol has been twap selling FXS to recollateralize FRAX (which is a rational choice) but I believe that switching strategies in this market, while seeming counter-intuitive, wiil actually go further to recollaterize quicker. Switching from selling FXS to buying FXS with protocol revenues and then redistributing will increase FXS price, increase sentiment, and increase community confidence, leading to a higher FXS price, more activity for Fraxtal, and more veFXS locking. It will also increase the distribution and amount of FRAX in the FXS/FRAX LP which is counted against the CR, ultimately achieving our mission of 100% CR.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I believe this is the positive catalyst Frax needs in order to get the flywheel spinning again.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-4\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Redistribute 75% of protocol fees to veFXS, 25% to Treasury.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/re-activate-fee-switch/2950\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/re-activate-fee-switch/2950","pubDate":"Mon, 11 Mar 2024 17:11:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2950"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/re-activate-fee-switch/2950.rss","#text":"Re-activate fee switch"},"filter":false}]}}}
