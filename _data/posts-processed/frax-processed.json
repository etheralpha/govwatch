Users forfeit accessing their money because they expect to get some rewards until they can unlock it, higher rewards than those who have the freedom to leave at any point.</p>\n<p>However, in some cases, the protocol has stopped incentivizing a pool. This means that users are stuck there and do not receive rewards anymore. This is unfair to the user. If the protocol stops adding rewards to that pool, they have trapped the user for up to 3 years in exchange for just some initial rewards.</p>\n<p>Although this may seem beneficial short-term to the protocol, it is not even that positive, as pools not receiving rewards are generally those with minimal volume. But, especially, this is a terrible long-term approach, as those unhappy users are not going to lock ever again, or may even avoid every FRAX product.</p>\n<p>If the protocol stops rewarding a pool, it is only fair to let those locked users exit it. Why do you offer 3 years locks otherwise? If you want users to commit long-term but do not want to keep rewarding a pool, you could think of other formulas, like bonds.</p>\n<p>I am posting this not just because I am locked for over 2 years in a Convex FRAX pool that is not getting any rewards, but because I am also providing liquidity in several others with a minimum lock because, after this bad experience, I am scared of being stuck in those with no yield. I doubt that is beneficial for the protocol. You want me to stay there long-term, but I can only do so if I can expect to be treated fairly, which is not the case as of now.</p>\n<p>Before making a specific proposal, I wanted to create this topic so we can talk about it.

This is the first in a series of posts outlining the vision. The Frax Singularity Roadmap should be the guiding light of the Frax community.</p>\n<p><strong>Post-Singularity Frax Era</strong><br>\nThe launch of Fraxtal and achievement of effectively 100% CR are milestones that start a new era in Frax. Fraxtal is the substrate that enables the Frax ecosystem; it is the operating system of Frax. Fraxtal completes Frax’s core product offerings – Frax is strategically adding new subprotocols and Frax assets but all the necessary building blocks are now in place. The community can now focus on larger opportunities and paradigm shifting products as well as issuing native Frax Assets across all of the crypto universe.</p>\n<p>In order to get here, Frax has generated $45m+ to achieve effectively 100% CR. This was a huge effort on everyone’s part, including a significant sacrifice from FXS holders to improve the overall health of Frax. The FRAX stablecoin has been largely dormant during this process and FXS revenue sharing was cut by 90% to conserve assets. That can now change entirely.</p>\n<p><strong>Frax: The Only Full Stack Protocol</strong><br>\nFraxtal is the home of Frax Nation &amp; the Fraxtal Network State. With Fraxtal, the Frax community has a sovereign home, culture, and digital space they can call their own. This is why Fraxtal is being built. Frax already issues its own currencies &amp; is fully governed and owned onchain by FXS stakers. Now, Frax has its own full-fledged network in Fraxtal.</p>\n<p>Soon, L3s of Fraxtal will go online. L3s are like fractals and similar to sub-communities that have their own distinct identity &amp; culture but part of the overall Frax Network State. They benefit from earning Frax Asset yields, RWA yields, Fraxtal settlement+security guarantees, and a constant stream of FXTL points to their L3 contract on Fraxtal based on its popularity, usage, and TVL. <strong>All this together governed by FXS which represents an interest in the digital nation of Frax.</strong></p>\n<p>Fraxtal stands on the shoulders of Optimism to create one of the most developer friendly L2’s on Ethereum. While most L2’s simply mirror Ethereum’s incentives, we’ve gone further and innovated on base incentives to create the most compelling possible experience for developers and users - and we will continue innovating.  By owning the entire stack, Frax can introduce features like account abstraction, new precompiles, privacy functionality, aggregated DA, and Superchain interop. These features will dramatically improve the on-chain experience &amp; make Fraxtal the preferred location to hold, stake, and transfer crypto in the coming months and years.</p>\n<p>*<em>With the above in mind, centralized exchanges and payment service providers that integrate Fraxtal chain deposits/withdrawals early can get allocations of FXTL points until the program concludes.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kickstarting Fraxtal</strong><br>\nFraxtal’s innovative Flox Blockspace Incentives have just finished its first epoch of allocating FXTL points to users and popular smart contracts. <strong>This makes Fraxtal the only network to automatically distribute rewards block by block to users &amp; developers for using the chain.</strong> These incentives run for many years &amp; will become known as a core innovation of Fraxtal as users and developers will become accustomed to earning rewards to use blocksapce, unlike any other network.</p>\n<p><em>The road to $100B+ Fraxtal TVL starts now and with the target of EOY 2026.</em> All Frax Assets including FRAX, sFRAX, frxETH (and new Frax Assets) will be issued on Fraxtal first going forward. The Frax Core Developers are actively moving to issue Frax Assets on Fraxtal including native 4626 yield vaults, minting, and redeeming. When Frax assets reach a new ATH supply, so will Fraxtal TVL. This is a unique synergy only possible because of Frax’s full stack system.<br>\nFrax Assets will permeate every chain but the base contracts and assets will exist on Fraxtal mainnet.</p>\n<p><strong>Fraxtal’s Fractal Scaling Roadmap</strong><br>\nFraxtal is targeting 23 L3s in the next 365 days to kickstart the Fraxtal Nation community.  Frax has always taken a positive sum approach and directly supports the community and builders that integrate with us. We believe 23 L3s is the perfect number of chains that we can actively support with direct developer access/incentives/investment and more. The first two L3s are already in the works and we expect to fill the remaining spots in the coming months! L3s wil not only earn FXTL points through Flox, but the 23 L3 slots are for official partners that will get additional support from the Fraxtal Core Devs and large allocations of FXTL total supply.</p>\n<p>If you are deploying any form of L3 or appchain and want to explore joining the Fraxtal Network State early, reach out to the Frax Core Developers &amp; our strategic rollup-as-a-service provider partners: Conduit.xyz, Gelato.network, &amp; Caldera.xyz to express your early interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview of Frax Assets</strong><br>\nFrax is the only protocol in all of crypto that has 4 separate tokens/assets in the top 200. This number will only increase as will the rank of Frax Assets. Thus, it’s important to have a current overview of all Frax Assets &amp; their utility, pegs, and design specs.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Frax Asset</th>\n<th>Utility &amp; Specs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Frax Share (FXS)</td>\n<td>Governance/Staking token of all of Frax Finance, base pair of all FXS Liquidity Engine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FRAX &amp; Staked FRAX (s)FRAX</td>\n<td>Dollar Peg, 4626 yielding vault</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frax Ether &amp; Staked Frax Ether (s)frxETH</td>\n<td>ETH Peg, initial gas token on Fraxtal, 4626 yielding vault, soon to be LRT with v2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frax Bitcoin &amp; Staked Frax Bitcoin (s)frxBTC</td>\n<td>BTC peg, 4626 yielding vault, fully collateralized by BTC on Bitcoin PoW chain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frax Price Index (FPI)</td>\n<td>Flatcoin/CPI peg, no yielding token - peg is inflation resistant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frax Bond (FXB)</td>\n<td>Zero coupon bond tokens that convert to FRAX on maturity similar to US Treasuries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fraxtal Points (FXTL)</td>\n<td>Points that represent usage of the Fraxtal blockchain to be tokenized at a future date.

Now that 100% CR has been effectively reached, FXS can receive all utility and benefits of the entire Frax stack. We propose that the protocol fee switch be turned back on, with 50% of the yield flowing to veFXS and the other 50% used to buy FXS and other Frax assets to pair in the FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE). The FLE will allow Frax to continue building its balance sheet while dramatically increasing liquidity for FXS and paired Frax assets. According to Defillama, even without counting multiple sources of revenue like Fraxtal chain fees and the Fraxlend AMO, <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/frax-finance\">Frax makes over $40m of revenue annualized</a> as of this writing.</p>\n<p><strong>veFXS Revenue Share+Fee Switch Turned ON</strong><br>\nveFXS stakers will get total protocol fees at the passing of this proposal added to the veFXS yield distributor on Ethereum mainnet as well as veFXS yield distributor contract on Fraxtal soon after.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zRPeTqv0QnevW3a7J23my8LMfrf.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5_2_293x293.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"zRPeTqv0QnevW3a7J23my8LMfrf\" width=\"293\" height=\"293\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5_2_293x293.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5_2_439x439.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5_2_586x586.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1A1A1A\"></a></div><br>\n<em>FXS Liquidity Engine will create increasing FXS POL against first Frax Assets but can and will be expanded to other voted pairs by the community.</em><p></p>\n<p>FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE)<br>\nThe FXS Liquidity Engine is a protocol owned liquidity Schelling-point of pairs of every Frax Asset against FXS. Revenue allocated to the FLE is used to buy back half FXS &amp; half Frax Assets to increase the liquidity depth of the pair. The amount allocated to the FLE is based on the trailing price of FXS. If FXS 30-day trailing price is lower than the prior month, then 25% of protocol revenue is allocated to the FXS Liquidity Engine instead of veFXS. If the 30-day trailing price is higher than the prior month, then 25% more of protocol revenue is distributed to veFXS instead.<br>\nThe long term goal is to increase the utility, liquidity, and lending credit to FXS to unprecedented levels as revenue comes in block-by-block.</p>\n<p>Powered by Fraxswap+BAMM, these will be the initial FLE POL pairs:<br>\nFXS-frxBTC pair (more on frxBTC timelines &amp; info in Singularity Part 2)<br>\nFXS-sfrxETH pair<br>\nFXS-sFRAX pair<br>\nFXS-FPI pair<br>\nFLE gauges will be releasing soon to power different FLE pairs including bespoke FLE pairs.

When volatile assets go down in value, revenue from FXBs and (s)FRAX should increase revenues. Thus, the FLE should be a constant, direct value add to FXS holders and stakers alike.<br>\n<em>Note: there are certain strategic assets that will be kept on the balance sheet/treasury including CVX (staked as vlCVX), cvxCRV, cvxPRISMA, &amp; cvxFXN, among other assets that will be added as “strategic assets” in future governance votes. These strategic assets will not be sold or distributed to veFXS holders nor sold to power the FLE.</em></p>\n<p>FPIS Resolution<br>\nThere is a tremendous amount of mental overhead that goes into having a separate token and alternate governance process. For all of Frax’s existence, FXS had been that token until FPIS was released in 2022. To unlock FPI’s growth potential, simplify Frax’s structure and reduce developer and community overhead, we propose that FPIS be absorbed into Frax. Additionally, this brings onto the Frax balance sheet $4.5m of additional profits/assets to bolster the treasury. The important outcome is that the entire Frax community is singularly aligned behind FXS and the success of Fraxtal. Thus, to simplify this resolution, we propose lowering the FPIS to veFXS conversion by 67% to the new 1 FPIS→1.33 veFXS for a 4 year lock and will decay to 0.33 veFXS at the end of the lock period. The conversion of FPIS on the unlock date of March 22, 2028 will be at 2.5 FPIS to 1 FXS if not relocked. This number was reached after careful consideration of all reasonable &amp; civil community feedback both on Telegram &amp; in this thread, especially of long term FXS and FPIS holders that received the FPIS airdrop and staked to keep long term alignment with all of Frax’s core protocols. <strong>This ratio is also exactly the rate that will NOT create any new FXS inflation above the 100m total supply due to 16.4M FXS in the community governed treasury. This merge will distribute less than the idle amount of FXS located there and does not count supply reductions over 4 years due to buybacks through the FXS Liquidity Engine.</strong> Even if 100% of all FPIS 4 year locks unlock without relocking (a highly unlikely event), there will not be an FXS supply increase above 100m ever due to this merge. The result being a merge of two tokens, unifying the community, and keeping FXS supply under 100m. This final ratio dramatically lowers the governance &amp; utility power of FPIS while still merging it into a single FXS token distribution and creating zero new inflation of FXS tokens. Lastly, veFPIS also qualifies for the April 3rd FXTL points snapshot at the 1.33 rate.</p>\n<p><strong>sFRAX &amp; sfrxETH Updated Yield &amp; sfrxETH LRT Functionality</strong><br>\nAt the conclusion of this governance proposal, sFRAX will be set to a 50% cap rate with 5.4% IORB floor rate. This means that sFRAX APR will have a max rate of 50% at the passing of this proposal and a floor rate of the IORB rate compared to the current model that has the IORB rate as the top cap rate. This new system allows sFRAX to become the benchmark DeFi rate to all integrators of sFRAX. Users who currently hold sFRAX now or mint/swap into sFRAX will start receiving the new cap rate immediately after the epoch that this proposal is passed in governance. In order to keep sFRAX at 50% cap rate, Frax will add sUSDeFRAX POL through the Curve AMO. Thus, this proposal is also for a 250m ceiling cap of sUSDeFRAX Curve AMO.</p>\n<p>sfrxETH will have new higher APRs with the advent of Frax Ether v2. In v2, sfrxETH APRs can be as high as the interest rate anyone wishes to pay to borrow validators which means that sfrxETH APRs can and likely will approach, then surpass liquid restaking tokens. sfrxETH will be the standard benchmark of ETH yield based on a fully collateralized LSD design. Additionally, Frax Ether v2 will have direct restaking support officially turning sfrxETH into a liquid restaked token (LRT). This governance proposal greenlights EigenLayer restaking pods and direct EigenLayer deposits for sfrxETH. This allows sfrxETH holders to enjoy higher than average LSD yield, FXTL points if held/used on Fraxtal, as well as EigenLayer points. Frax is also working with EigenLayer to design a Fraxtal AVS that uses both FXS and sfrxETH restaking making Frax one of the only full stack integrations on each level of EigenLayer and giving FXS chain-level staking utility. In the singularity era, sfrxETH will be the leading LRT of DeFi.</p>\n<p><strong>Gradually and then Suddenly: The Full Stack</strong><br>\nIt’s been a long road culminating in the launch of Fraxtal and achieving 100% CR on FRAX.  Frax’s strategy has been to build core pieces of infrastructure internally which in the short term takes a significant investment of time and energy.  If the community zooms in too closely, progress can feel static and individual pieces disjointed. Indeed some have said Frax does too many things, but the reality is if the community zooms out now, they will begin to see the giant flywheel that’s just been completed. We’ve just shipped one of the most innovative L2’s in the space and closed a $45m asset gap to weatherproof FRAX’s balance sheet. Frax Ether v2 is close to release and will offer the most compelling LSD+LRT experience while sFRAX yields will be among the most competitive and reputable yields in DeFi. Protocol fees can once again flow to veFXS and power an FXS liquidity blackhole on our own chain. Frax Assets will also flow to every major chain and capture mindshare &amp; monetary premium for Frax.</p>\n<p>Now, the foundation is in place for Frax and others to build upon and scale quickly upwards. Fraxtal will be at the center of this growth with FXS as the ultimate beneficiary of everything Frax achieves. We’ve built this foundation for the landscape that we see tomorrow, not the one we lived in yesterday. Rather than pondering theoretical new markets and writing whitepapers, Frax has been and always will be shipping live products and seizing markets before others know they even exist. This speed and safety will be enabled by the foundation that we’ve built to date. <strong>The Singularity phase of Frax begins now.</strong></p>\n<p>Part 2 of this roadmap will be posted at a future date after this proposal is voted on in governance.</p>\n            <p><small>29 posts - 17 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-341-frax-singularity-roadmap-part-1/2987\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-341-frax-singularity-roadmap-part-1/2987","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 20:15:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2987"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-341-frax-singularity-roadmap-part-1/2987.rss","#text":"[FIP - 341] Frax Singularity Roadmap Part 1"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP - 340] Proposal for retiring of the Harmony canFRAX and canFXS","dc:creator":"amirnader","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<h2><a name=\"authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#authors-1\"></a>Authors</h2>\n<p>Frax Core Team</p>\n<h1><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>This proposal suggests retiring the outstanding Harmony addresses for the canFRAX and canFXS tokens following the security breach of the Harmony’s Horizon Bridge in 2022.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"background-and-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#background-and-motivation-3\"></a>Background and Motivation</h1>\n<p>Frax Finance previously utilized the Harmony Horizon Bridge to facilitate the transfer of FRAX and FXS tokens to the Harmony network, resulting in the creation of canFRAX and canFXS tokens. Unfortunately, in June 2022, the Harmony Horizon Bridge was compromised in a significant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/harmony-blockchain-crypto-hack/\">security breach</a>, resulting in the loss of a substantial amount of FRAX and FXS tokens that backed the canFRAX and canFXS tokens circulating on Harmony One Network.</p>\n<p>The security breach of the Harmony Horizon Bridge was a severe incident that led to the loss of user funds and undermined trust in the integrity of the Harmony bridge. Frax Finance believes that it is Harmony’s responsibility to reimburse the FRAX and FXS tokens lost in the bridge due to the security breach, rather than burdening Frax Finance with the obligation to reimburse users. While Harmony has created some form of repayment and restitution program for hack victims, it has fallen dramatically short of reimbursing anywhere near the full loss of the Harmony Bridge hack even nearly 2 years after the fact. That is why we believe full responsibility lies on Harmony. Frax Finance is a direct victim of the Harmony Bridge hack just like all affected users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#proposal-details-4\"></a>Proposal Details</h1>\n<p>Given the circumstances surrounding the security breach of the Harmony Horizon Bridge and the loss of FRAX and FXS tokens backing canFRAX and canFXS, it is proposed to retire the outstanding tokens for canFRAX and canFXS tokens. Users that hold these tokens can and should seek remediation from Harmony rather than Frax Finance. Frax Finance itself is a victim of the situation and not culpable for liability of a breach it did not cause nor deserve. By retiring canFRAX and canFXS tokens and asking holders of these tokens to directly seek restitution from Harmony, the Frax Finance ecosystem will be strengthened and a burden removed from the protocol’s balance sheet that was never its own fault or doing.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"canfrax-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#canfrax-5\"></a>canFRAX</h2>\n<p>Token Address on Harmony: <a href=\"https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0xfa7191d292d5633f702b0bd7e3e3bccc0e633200\">0xFa7191D292d5633f702B0bd7E3E3BcCC0e633200</a></p>\n<p>Total Supply: 8,139,045.038 canFRAX</p>\n<h2><a name=\"canfxs-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#canfxs-6\"></a>canFXS</h2>\n<p>Token Address on Harmony: <a href=\"https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0x0767d8e1b05efa8d6a301a65b324b6b66a1cc14c\">0x0767D8E1b05eFA8d6A301a65b324B6b66A1CC14c</a></p>\n<p>Total Supply: 123,959.834 canFXS</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-7\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For: Retire Harmony canFRAX and canFXS</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Against: Do nothing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"references-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#references-8\"></a>References:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.merklescience.com/hacktrack/hacktrack-analysis-horizon-bridge-exploit\">Hack Track: Analysis of the analysis of Harmony’s Horizon Bridge Exploit | Hack Track | Merkle Science.

The Truflation team is in the process of integrating our oracle into Fraxtal which will allow access to our massive library of real-world asset price feeds. Platforms building on top of Fraxtal will be able to build innovative DeFi and real-world products using our real-time immutable price data. We are excited to ideate new products with Fraxtal protocols and look forward to brainstorming with teams. We encourage Frax ecosystem partners to comment on this post to coordinate future development. Integrators and developers can view our Indexes and Data Feeds on the Data Marketplace on the Truflation website.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Bridging Nuon to Fraxtal</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Phase Two of our launch on Fraxtal will involve bridging the flatcoin, Nuon, to Fraxtal.</p>\n<p>Nuon is the world’s first true decentralized flatcoin — a stablecoin with a price peg that rises and falls with inflation rates, shielding holders against loss of value from inflation.</p>\n<p>Current daily inflation levels are measured by Truflation, an independent inflation index oracle. Truflation calculates the Nuon peg daily and shares it with the Nuon protocol, which uses over-collateralization and arbitrage to maintain the peg while offsetting inflation for Nuon flatcoin holders. Nuon can be minted within the Nuon Protocol by depositing approved cryptocurrency collateral. This guarantees over-collateralization for minted Nuon, maintaining a stable peg.</p>\n<p>We see Fraxtal as the perfect place for Nuon considering the DeFi expertise in the Frax ecosystem. Frax’s successful launch and upkeep of Frax Price Index (FPI) showed the long-term focus on building useful products and we hope to work together on the future of inflation-protected and flatcoin products. More information and documentation on Nuon can be found at nuon .fi</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Proposal to create an FPI / Nuon “Flatcoin Basepool”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the synergies between Nuon and FPI, we are proposing the creation of the Flatcoin Basepool on Curve. Much like the FRAX / USDC Basepool, the Flatcoin Basepool will pair FPI and Nuon with other flatcoins and can also include yielding stablecoins. The special oracle pegged Curve pool will use the Truflation inflation price as the peg between Nuon and FPI. Beginning with a pool on Fraxtal, then likely moving towards other chains like ETH Mainnet, Arbitrum, Base, and others based on the incentive appetite from the community. We are requesting feedback from the Frax community on phasing this launch and deciding on incentives. We have additional flatcoin pairs planned with partners that would like to pair their stablecoin, yielding stable, or flatcoin with FPI and Nuon.</p>\n<p>Further collaboration between Frax and Truflation</p>\n<p>As we create and bring liquidity to the flatcoin basepool between FPI and NUON, we will be monitoring the performance of the pool and the peg. In time, if all goes well with the pool, we plan to propose that FPI use the Truflation CPI Oracle as the underlying oracle to track inflation. With the support of the Frax ecosystem, we will return to the forum in the coming months and propose the integration of the oracle into FPI.</p>\n<p><strong>Truflation invites FRAX Finance to contribute to the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>Given Frax Finance’s role in developing flatcoins, Truflation would like to offer 0.1% of the TRUF total token supply to FXS holders.</p>\n<p>As per snapshot on 3/12/24 there were 17,685 FXS holders</p>\n<p>In addition to rewarding FXS holders, Truflation would also like to allocate an additional token supply to Frax Finance DAO Treasury. Once Truflation is used as the underlying oracle to track CPI, we will airdrop another batch of tokens to the DAO’s treasury. To ensure participation in the Truflation ecosystem and its independence in the future towards governance and methodology, these tokens would be locked in the Truflation governance portal in the form of veTRUF. As this partnership progresses, we hope to have Frax as an aligned partner within our ecosystem. We will return in the coming months with more information on the success of the basepool and eventual airdrop to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Requesting feedback from the community</strong></p>\n<p>We are requesting feedback from the Frax community on the actions above. With support from the community, we will progress the discussion to a vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"vote-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#vote-1\"></a>Vote:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>For:  Creating a “Flatcoin Basepool” with Nuon and FPI, pegged to the Truflation CPI Oracle</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fpiip-13-truflation-x-frax-partnership-proposal/2956\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fpiip-13-truflation-x-frax-partnership-proposal/2956","pubDate":"Tue, 12 Mar 2024 14:56:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2956"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fpiip-13-truflation-x-frax-partnership-proposal/2956.rss","#text":"[FPIIP-13] Truflation x Frax Partnership Proposal"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP - 339] Add the Curve CVG/FRAXBP pool to the FXS gauge controller","dc:creator":"Wireshark","category":"Gauges","description":"<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>\nAdd CVG/FRAXBP to the FXS gauge controller<br>\nCurve pool address: <a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crypto-362/deposit\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Curve.fi</a><br>\nPool: 0xa7b0e924c2dbb9b4f576cce96ac80657e42c3e42<br>\nGauge: 0x8a111b47b31bba40c2f0d2f9a8cf6b6c4b50114e<br>\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://app.cvg.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.cvg.finance/</a><br>\nTwitter: <span class=\"mention\">@Convergence_fi</span></p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong><br>\nConvergence is an agnostic “Convex-like” layer, currently deployed atop Stake DAO.

With this in mind I propose that until the protocol is fully collateralized by exogenous collateral, fees should be split 75/25 between veFXS holders and the protocol treasury.</p>\n<p>As of now, the protocol has been twap selling FXS to recollateralize FRAX (which is a rational choice) but I believe that switching strategies in this market, while seeming counter-intuitive, wiil actually go further to recollaterize quicker. Switching from selling FXS to buying FXS with protocol revenues and then redistributing will increase FXS price, increase sentiment, and increase community confidence, leading to a higher FXS price, more activity for Fraxtal, and more veFXS locking. It will also increase the distribution and amount of FRAX in the FXS/FRAX LP which is counted against the CR, ultimately achieving our mission of 100% CR.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I believe this is the positive catalyst Frax needs in order to get the flywheel spinning again.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-4\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Redistribute 75% of protocol fees to veFXS, 25% to Treasury.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/re-activate-fee-switch/2950\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/re-activate-fee-switch/2950","pubDate":"Mon, 11 Mar 2024 17:11:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2950"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/re-activate-fee-switch/2950.rss","#text":"Re-activate fee switch"},"filter":false},{"title":"Integrating Onramp.money's Fiat On-Ramp widget with Frax","dc:creator":"ansh89","category":"Miscellaneous","description":"<p>Proposal: Integration of Onramp.money’s Fiat On-Ramp Widget with Frax</p>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<p>The aim of this proposal is to integrate Onramp.money’s fiat on-ramp service into app.frax.finance, enabling users to purchase &amp; sell Frax Share (FXS) and other tokens directly from the dApp using bank transfers and various local payment methods across 30+ countries.</p>\n<p>Details</p>\n<p>About Onramp.money:</p>\n<p>Onramp.money is a leading provider of fiat-to-crypto onramp solution, offering a seamless and secure way for users to buy &amp; sell 300+ cryptocurrencies using local fiat currencies Onramp.money delivers a fast, dependable, and secure platform supporting instant bank transfers and local payment methods.</p>\n<p>We handle all the necessary KYC, regulatory, and compliance requirements.

This allows fETH to hold its value well in any market condition.</p>\n<p>When f(x) Protocol first launched in August of 2023, f(x) introduced the DeFi world to something special: a powerful new defi primitive centered around a complimentary token pair. The f(x) pair, or “stable-leverage pair” primitive is based on a simple concept: split a yield-bearing token (called the base or reserve token) into two parts: a low-volatility (i.e. stable) part and a high volatility (i.e. “leveraged”) part, both tokenized. Stable tokens can be staked in a rebalancing pool to earn yield from the reserve tokens, while the high volatility tokens protect the peg simply by existing, themselves providing a remarkably simple, safe, and cheap way to take ETH leverage.</p>\n<p>As the protocol has gained attention and adoption, our community highlighted the need of a fully decentralized and hard pegged stablecoin. After extensive discussions and governance process, Aladdin DAO is now prepared to introduce f(x) Protocol’s new USD-pegged stablecoin, fxUSD.</p>\n<p>As a stablecoin, fxUSD offers four key features never before combined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built-in yield, derived from LSDs in the reserve</li>\n<li>Scalability: rapidly scalable based on direct demand</li>\n<li>Stability: reliable peg in both directions, backed by f(x)’s invariant</li>\n<li>Resilience: collateralized by Ethereum LSDs, with zero real-world asset exposure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At genesis, we are choosing 5 stablecoins to pair fxUSD with: FRAX (Frax Finance), crvUSD (Curve Finance), pyUSD (Paypal), DOLA (Inverse Protocol) and GRAI (Gravita Protocol). We are aiming for all these pools to have double gauges, on Curve and f(x).

Alchemix also provides FRAX and frxETH vaults, allowing self-repaying loans on these assets, and further utility for holding them. Since the days of the D4 pool, our protocols have been working together with co-incentives to provide additional yield to our LPs and to service additional synthetic alAsset demand from our users. Currently Alchemix and Frax maintain partner pools on Main net, Arbitrum and Optimism, and provide co-incentives on a majority of pools together.</p>\n<p>In addition to direct incentives, Alchemix has long been accumulating and locking CRV, CVX and various other liquidity-driving assets to help scale the size and effectiveness of our pools. (see <a href=\"https://alchemix-stats.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://alchemix-stats.com/</a> for details) Now that the majority of our AMOs operate on pools that pair alAssets with Frax assets, we would like to begin locking FXS as well. In order to do so at the DAO level, we need to be able to lock from our multisig.

This involves attracting projects to foster a self-sustaining ecosystem with community support, stakeholder engagement, and ecosystem expansion. FXS holders under the DAO collaborate to increase liquidity and buy pressure, providing grants to agile projects for rapid deployment on Fraxtal, with a total budget of 1 million USD. The proposal highlights the potential for quick revenue streams through blockspace incentives, allowing projects to scale via on-chain activity and generating revenue for the subDAO’s growth and reinvestment. The goal is to position Fraxtal prominently in the evolving blockchain landscape.</p>\n<p>The foundational Frax team has recently unveiled a groundbreaking Layer 2 solution, driven by a robust vision for exponential growth. Acknowledging the pivotal factors for success, including heightened user activity and liquidity, the team has innovatively introduced FLOX &amp; FXTL points to elevate engagement. This strategic initiative sets the stage for Frax’s competitive positioning in the market, focusing on onboarding projects and establishing unique selling propositions. The subsequent flywheel approach outlined below leverages the innovative features introduced, aiming to maximize Frax’s potential through continuous growth and ecosystem development.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects Launch on FRAX: Attracting projects to initiate on Frax lays the foundation for a robust ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Community Support: Signaling that projects airdropping tokens to veFXS holders will receive substantial marketing and community backing fosters a symbiotic relationship.</li>\n<li>Stakeholder Engagement: Encouraging more veFXS stakers not only boosts buy pressure for FXS but also attracts broader attention due to the steady rise in its value.</li>\n<li>Ecosystem Expansion: As FXS gains traction, there’s an inherent incentive for projects to join or contribute to the flourishing Frax ecosystem, creating synergies.</li>\n<li>Increased Activity: Growing activity in airdrops, staking, and feature utilization cultivates a robust DeFi environment within the FRAX ecosystem, accompanied by a more targeted marketing push.</li>\n<li>Community Growth: An active community leads to a larger marketing push, attracting strategic partners and offering more airdrop opportunities as projects witness swift adoption and revenue generation.</li>\n<li>Repetition: This cyclical process perpetuates continuous growth, establishing a self-sustaining and thriving ecosystem, especially during a bullish market phase where airdrops act as fuel for growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By collectively nurturing this flywheel effect, we have the potential to propel Fraxtal to new heights, positioning it as a prominent player in the evolving blockchain landscape. Moreover, by adding airdrops to FLOX &amp; FXTL, the ‘yield’ for veFXS will increasingly become higher due to the compounding airdrop. FLOX’s innovative designs allow projects to efficiently and effectively distribute their tokens to users. If there is more on-chain activity, the blockspace rewards will increasingly become higher, allowing for a positive reflexive loop.</p>\n<p>The main question arises: Why work on this if the core team can also attract projects? Because the core team is already busy with a myriad of tasks. As FXS holders under the DAO, our core objective is to increase liquidity and buy pressure for FXS and ensure the long-term growth of the Fraxtal ecosystem. There have been many complaints about the lack of price action for FXS. By coordinating together under this proposal, we can speed up the process and help bootstrap the network. The fundamental aim is to create buy pressure for FXS. The route for this is to (1) find projects with a plan or an MVP, (2) provide them with a grant to launch on Fraxtal, and commit a specific amount of tokens to the FLOX mechanism to be distributed to users.</p>\n<p>What kind of projects are we targeting? Mostly, we are looking for ambitious projects who want to launch something with not necessarily high barriers. In other words, if a developer wants to fork specific code from an existing product and launch it on Fraxtal with a specific use case/niche, this is acceptable. Through the blockspace incentives, these teams will be able to generate revenue quickly and innovate around the initial product. We want developers to be able to quickly deploy with an MVP/V1, use airdrops for on-chain activity, and then use blockchain incentives to bootstrap their growth further. Our job is to find the right projects that fit specific needs on Fraxtal and have product-market fit. Rewards will be milestone-based and won’t be given out all at once.</p>\n<p>What would be the amount for each project and the total budget? I would say around 1 million would be a good start, providing 50k - 150k USD in FXS per project. This can be changed based on feedback. Again, we are not necessarily just targeting projects that will have to spend many months/years developing something from scratch. More so, we are looking for agile projects who already have been thinking/working on an MVP or see existing code and aim to fork it and innovate with it on Fraxtal’s tech stack. An example would be an NFT marketplace similar to Stargaze on Cosmos with similar tokenomics, which may be a good idea for Frax as there currently isn’t a similar NFT marketplace. The developer can decide to develop everything from scratch or use existing code and iterate on this code, explaining how it would be innovative and fit with Fraxtal’s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>How would the filtering process work, and who would be in charge, and how can teams apply? We can set up a sub-DAO focused specifically on this effort. I can be part of this process and also get other council members involved who have experience with this and would like to be involved in selecting and helping bootstrap projects. We will set up similar criteria to what we expect, what domains we are searching to innovate, and a multisig for distribution. A form similar to Arbitrum grants (see<a href=\"https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Grant-Application-Form-de318b3dfaea409abbf424c958b3724b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Grant-Application-Form-de318b3dfaea409abbf424c958b3724b</a>) will be created that covers all aspects of the selection process and guidelines. Teams can apply through the Frax website, which could refer them to another page specifically explaining the process and a sign-up form.</p>\n<p>Reward structure for council members/Sub DAO There are different ways to approach this. My initial approach is that council members do not receive any rewards but get part of the airdrop/blockspace incentives from the projects that launch. This allows the council members to align incentives in a way that if the project succeeds (i.e., gains adoption), the subDAO/council members will generate a revenue stream. With this revenue stream, they can potentially reinvest and grow the subDAO and specialize in this niche to help with Fraxtal adoption. Alongside the core team, Frax will have a BD arm under the DAO that can expand in manpower and help Fraxtal get to the next level. There could initially be a low fixed fee to motivate council members if needed. As Fraxtal expands we could change the rules based on results of the first initial distribution of capital.</p>\n<p>The proposed approach involves the DAO facilitating (1) the attraction of high-quality projects and (2) incentivizing their engagement with Frax, particularly through airdrops to FXS stakers. As mentioned above, if the FXS price rises, the cost to fund these projects decreases, ultimately recuperating expenses from the overall growth of FRAX and helping bootstrap the network. Further discussions and refinements are crucial. At this stage, I invite users to provide feedback, both from the community and FRAX team members, before progressing to a more specific proposal and a DAO vote. Your insights and perspectives are crucial in shaping this approach and ensuring its success.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/version-2-fraxtal-turning-air-drops-into-a-rain-of-growth/2907\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/version-2-fraxtal-turning-air-drops-into-a-rain-of-growth/2907","pubDate":"Thu, 15 Feb 2024 14:43:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2907"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/version-2-fraxtal-turning-air-drops-into-a-rain-of-growth/2907.rss","#text":"Version 2: Fraxtal: Turning (Air)Drops into a Rain of Growth"},"filter":false},{"title":"Fraxtal: Turning (Air)Drops into a Rain of Growth","dc:creator":"Milan","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<p>Fraxtal, the innovative new chain, has recently launched, driven by a vision for exponential growth.

The grant, being retroactive, will have details clarified based on specific metrics and goals.

At this stage, I invite users to provide feedback, both from the community and FRAX team members, before progressing to a more specific proposal and a DAO vote, allocating funds in a multisig for project funding. My initial inclination is to earmark 2 million in FXS to support approximately 25 projects over the next 18 months. This allocation is strategically planned to facilitate 25 airdrops, effectively covering the 2 million-dollar expense.

This idea is very much still in its ideation phase and I would like the community’s support in gathering data and suggestions that would allow for a better understanding on how best to implement such a mechanism.</p>\n<p>A veTokenomics Rage Quit mechanism refers to a dynamic in which the protocol allows the immediate premature unlocking of a given user’s veFXS position. If implemented in such a way that the user incurs a sizable enough penalty to discourage unlocking unless critically necessary, while still being reasonable enough that it remains a feasible option when the user encounters a personal liquidity crisis, this creates a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship among all parties involved. The user gains access to liquidity from an illiquid asset, while the protocol accumulates veFXS at an increasingly appealing discount.</p>\n<p>Thus we arrive at an interesting conundrum, what’s the optimal way of dynamically quantifying the market price of rage quitting? I presented the following idea on the telegram chat last weekend and received positive feedback, so I figured I would formally elaborate further in the governance forums. I believe the rage quit fee should be the product of two variables; the elapsed portion ratio of the time horizon given a position’s unlock date, and an elastic representation of the current demand for rage quitting.</p>\n<p><strong><code>rage_quit_fee = elapsed_time_ratio * elastic_demand</code></strong></p>\n<p>The first variable is much easier to understand so let’s get it out of the way. Elapsed Time Ratio refers to the percentage of time that has already elapsed along the total timeline of an individual position’s unlocking timestamp. Thus if the position currently finds itself halfway along a four year lock up period, this would become a 50% multiplier, while if it happened to be three years instead it would only be 25%, etc. It can therefore be represented as the following formula:</p>\n<p><strong><code>elapsed_time_ratio = unlock_timestamp - current_timestamp / unlock_timestamp - lock_timestamp</code></strong></p>\n<p>The elastic demand side of the formula is more subjective and could be quantified in countless different ways, but here I will present one such option and hopefully successfully communicate the reasoning and economic incentives that this version of such a parameter tries to uphold.</p>\n<p>First of all, we need to determine a range along the existing supply where the protocol is willing to rehypothecate a given position at a specific discount. My recommendation would be to use the ratio of locked FXS divided by the FXS total supply and apply it as the boundaries of the rage quitting price curve for veFXS. This means that the larger the ratio of locked tokens is the more the curve smooths over, while the lower the ratio is the sharper the slope becomes, and thus allows the price curve to elastically track the ratio of FXS tokens currently locked at any given time.</p>\n<p>It would therefore be increasingly more beneficial for veFXS holders to encourage a high ratio as it lowers the costs of rage quitting for all users if the individual necessity manifests itself. Coupled with a stronger use case such as being able to take FRAX loans against your position (a suggestion for another day), this could potentially create an environment in which the economic incentives of deciding to lock your FXS becomes a much more attractive proposition.</p>\n<p>For example, with a total supply of 100M FRAX, of which 10M FRAX is currently locked into veFXS, the price curve would be distributed along the equivalent 10% of the veFXS to quantify the cost of the penalty. Meaning that if someone tried to unlock 10% of veFXS (the max amount) with the previous parameters, they would be subject to the maximum point along the price curve, before being multiplied by their elapsed time ratio.</p>\n<p>So hypothetically speaking, if someone locked a position that would equate to 10% of the veFXS supply for the maximum time horizon of four years, and instantly regretted that decision, the corresponding penalty would equate to the full amount of their position. Obviously this specific scenario is probably not practicably feasible but is presented only to demonstrate the theoretical upper limit of the penalty, ie a 100% rage quit fee.</p>\n<p>Let’s examine a less egregious example for comparison. In a scenario with only 5% FXS locked, in which someone tried to unlock a position equivalent to 2.5% of the veFXS supply, they would be penalized at the halfway point of the price curve, or 50%, before being multiplied by their individual elapsed time ratio. By design this would need to be a logarithmic growth curve (think constant product rotated ninety degrees clockwise) since realistically speaking most positions would be relatively small in comparison, so the penalty needs to rise exponentially.</p>\n<p>It would also be wise to implement a lower boundary equivalent to the minimum discount accepted at the zero elapsed time frame in order to account for small positions at the lower end of the price curve. I would like this parameter to also be dynamic but have not personally come up with an interesting way to programmatically quantify that.</p>\n<p>Just to reiterate, the supply impact of your position being unlocked determines the elastic demand along the price curve, which can be represented by the following formula:</p>\n<p><strong><code>elastic_demand = position_size / ( locked_FXS / total_FXS ) * ( total_veFXS - protocol_veFXS )</code></strong></p>\n<p>I would like to mention that I do not have a math background so there’s probably a significantly more elegant way to quantify the rage quit fee than the option presented here. This is just a minimum viable prototype being used to initiate the discussion for what I think to be a relatively simple problem with a comparatively simple solution.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/price-discovery-mechanism-for-vefxs-rage-quitting/2900\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/price-discovery-mechanism-for-vefxs-rage-quitting/2900","pubDate":"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 01:31:32 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2900"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/price-discovery-mechanism-for-vefxs-rage-quitting/2900.rss","#text":"Price Discovery Mechanism For veFXS Rage Quitting"},"filter":true},{"title":"Seed the initial liquidity for $frxETH on f(x) Protocol","dc:creator":"FX_Protocol","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>\n<p>AladdinDAO Core Team</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Allocate USD $50,000.00 in $FXS as incentives to seed the initial liquidity for $frxETH on f(x) Protocol. f(x) Protocol will also allocate USD $50,000.00 in $FXN as well towards the seed liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The f(x) Protocol is a DeFi solution that addresses the need for a stable asset in the cryptocurrency space while mitigating centralization risks and capital efficiency issues. f(x) Protocol was conceived by Aladdin DAO; the US banking crisis in March 2023, combined with the depegging of USDC, highlighted the need for a new type of decentralized, highly scalable stable asset.</p>\n<p>Initially, f(x) Protocol introduced a new concept called a “floating stablecoin” or fETH. fETH is not pegged to a fixed value, but rather gains or loses a fraction of the price movements of ETH. This allows fETH to hold its value well in any market condition.</p>\n<p>When f(x) Protocol first launched in August of 2023, f(x) introduced the DeFi world to something special: a powerful new defi primitive centered around a complimentary token pair. The f(x) pair, or “stable-leverage pair” primitive is based on a simple concept: split a yield-bearing token (called the base or reserve token) into two parts: a low-volatility (i.e. stable) part and a high volatility (i.e. “leveraged”) part, both tokenized. Stable tokens can be staked in a rebalancing pool to earn yield from the reserve tokens, while the high volatility tokens protect the peg simply by existing, themselves providing a remarkably simple, safe, and cheap way to take ETH leverage.</p>\n<p>As the protocol has gained attention and adoption, our community highlighted the need of a fully decentralized and hard pegged stablecoin. After extensive discussions and governance process, Aladdin DAO is now prepared to introduce f(x) Protocol’s new USD-pegged stablecoin, fxUSD.</p>\n<p>As a stablecoin, fxUSD offers four key features never before combined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built-in yield, derived from LSDs in the reserve</li>\n<li>Scalability: rapidly scalable based on direct demand</li>\n<li>Stability: reliable peg in both directions, backed by f(x)’s invariant</li>\n<li>Resilience: collateralized by Ethereum LSDs, with zero real-world asset exposure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a liquidity incentive platform for LSDs, fxUSD offers the lowest cost / highest efficiency way to incentivize token holders and build on-chain utility and liquidity.</p>\n<p>At genesis, we are choosing 2 major ETH LSDs to back fxUSD: Lido’s stETH and Frax’s frxETH. Each LSD will have its own stable-leverage pair, with their own Rebalance Pool. Users can take advantage of the yield provided in the Rebalance Pools or choose to take a long leveraged ETH position, using the x-token variant of their favorite LSD.<br>\nYou can find more details <a href=\"https://medium.com/@protocol_fx_667/fxusd-the-nuts-and-the-bolts-335408276073\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>LSD providers are strongly incentivized to build their own liquidity since their revenue is based on total supply of their LSD asset. When a stable-leverage pair is included in the fxUSD system, a user can mint a stable asset and then collect the LSD yields from the underlying reserve assets. Once that particular LSD’s rebalance pool is deep enough, those stable assets can be withdrawn to as fxUSD. Such withdrawals also increase the yield in the rebalance pool (since yields are only paid to rebalance pool deposits), which again attracts more of the LSD to the reserve. This mechanism deeply aligns LSD providers with fxUSD, because external fxUSD utility indirectly increases their own rebalance pool yields.</p>\n<p>The more stable asset supply we can create, the more capacity we can offer on the leverage side, both of which will provide good utility on top of frxETH.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>In order to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A) create a deeper Rebalance Pool and attract more liquidity on top of frxETH yield and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>B) offer more capacity to mint the complimentary leverage token so as to achieve better user experience for both stable and leverage participants,</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>f(x) Protocol proposes to offer extra incentives in the form of $FXS and $FXN for seed capital.</p>\n<p>Each party, Frax Finance and f(x) Protocol, will offer USD $50,000.00 worth of their native tokens as incentives for seeding the frxETH stable-leverage pair.</p>\n<p><strong>For</strong>: Allocate USD $50,000.00 worth of FXS as incentives for seed capital for frxETH stable-leverage pair</p>\n<p><strong>Against</strong>: Do nothing.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/seed-the-initial-liquidity-for-frxeth-on-f-x-protocol/2899\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/seed-the-initial-liquidity-for-frxeth-on-f-x-protocol/2899","pubDate":"Tue, 06 Feb 2024 10:04:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2899"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/seed-the-initial-liquidity-for-frxeth-on-f-x-protocol/2899.rss","#text":"Seed the initial liquidity for $frxETH on f(x) Protocol"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP - 326] Proposal for Implementing a 10% Protocol Fee on Fraxlend","dc:creator":"amirnader","category":"Fraxlend","description":"<h2><a name=\"authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#authors-1\"></a>Authors</h2>\n<p>Frax Core Team</p>\n<h1><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>This proposal suggests the introduction of a 10% protocol fee on Fraxlend, Frax Finance’s lending platform.

Upon depositing USDC to the smart contract vault, investors are issued tfBILL tokens which represent Limited Partner interest in a BVI registered professional fund that exclusively holds treasury bills. The entity is bankruptcy remote and solely owned by the holders of tfBILL, who have full legal recourse to tfBILL’s underlying securities. The vault is built on TrueFi’s open, transparent, and battle-tested smart contracts and is conveniently offered on Archblock’s institutional-grade frontend marketplace.</p>\n<p>The vault was deployed in September 2023 and currently accepts USDC deposits from KYC’d non-US investors. At the time of writing, the TVL of the vault is approximately $8,600,000 and offers an estimated yield of over 5%.</p>\n<p>tfBILL was built in response to compliance and complexity concerns we continually heard from DAOs and on-chain investors about existing treasury bill offerings. Specifically, many DeFi entities and users expressed difficulty evaluating existing options due to contrived and opaque legal structures with uncertain investor recourse, hidden layers of fees, and aggressive operation in regulatory “grey areas.”</p>\n<p>Since the beginning, the primary goal has been to build an on-chain treasury instrument that is simple, transparent, and secure for all users. Here are some of the key ways tfBILL differentiates itself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compliance-focused: A tokenized asset is only as strong as the regulatory position of its issuer. Given treasury bills are US securities, tfBILL complies with all applicable regulations (i.e. SEC Reg S), only accepting qualified non-US investors with rigorous controls in place. We are in the process of establishing a US feeder fund which will enable direct access to US investors such as Frax.</li>\n<li>Simply T-Bills: tfBILL is directly backed by treasury bills purchased through and custodied by a regulated broker-dealer in the United States. The Fund does not allocate to ETFs which offer greater volatility, higher tracking error, lower liquidity, more counterparties, and higher fees. By purchasing treasuries directly, tfBILL has access to far greater liquidity with over $700 billion in average daily volume to sell/buy into versus less than $400 million for treasury ETFs like SHV.</li>\n<li>Enhanced transparency: Adapt3r Digital has gone one step further than most to ensure the underlying backing of tfBILL is open and accessible to all. Everyday the third-party Fund Administrator provides Net Asset Value attestations, which are subsequently uploaded on-chain and to IPFS. These capital updates are required for fees to be taken from the vault. In every on-chain update the manager includes the Net Asset Value of the fund (and thus tfBILL tokens), the underlying positions/CUSIPs, and the source PDF that the Fund Administrator provides. This same data file is used to update our Transparency Board. Finally, the Fund is audited on an annual basis by Wolf &amp; Co.</li>\n<li>On-demand liquidity: tfBILL is mintable on-chain through Archblock’s interface, utilizing TrueFi’s smart contract architecture. This interface is open 24/7 and currently accepts USDC, but can be expanded to other stablecoins and chains with little friction.</li>\n<li>Battle-tested smart contracts: Single points of failure are the hidden risk embedded in every tokenized asset. By using TrueFi’s battle-tested smart contracts, which have facilitated almost $2 billion in lending volume to date, tfBILL has achieved two significant milestones that differentiate us from all other players in this space: 1) offering a new tokenized asset without compromising on the smart contract level and 2) offering enhanced protections and controls by separating the front-end, blockchain, and d’App from the manager of the product itself. Unlike other treasury bill primitives, TrueFi’s underlying infrastructure is independent from Adapt3r’s operations and is always on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Flow of Funds Diagram</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/e/e6553dbf4e837568d96b8d5c7704f2b9ae0d958f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wRCrGR5YMTbIo8OU6vZh8LYOMoL.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/e/e6553dbf4e837568d96b8d5c7704f2b9ae0d958f_2_624x215.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"wRCrGR5YMTbIo8OU6vZh8LYOMoL\" width=\"624\" height=\"215\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/e/e6553dbf4e837568d96b8d5c7704f2b9ae0d958f_2_624x215.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/e/e6553dbf4e837568d96b8d5c7704f2b9ae0d958f_2_936x322.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/e/e6553dbf4e837568d96b8d5c7704f2b9ae0d958f.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E6DEDA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In conclusion</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Adapt3r Digital and our affiliate, MJL Capital, are deeply aligned with the Frax mission and purpose.

HFXB is designed to aggregate secondary liquidity for FXBs while improving their composability across the DeFi ecosystem. It will also manage FXB rollover and rebalancing for users that aim to maintain exposure to a particular FXB duration. While this post will discuss a particular implementation of HFXB (which benchmarks an average ~6 month duration), Hourglass Frax Bond Indices can theoretically target any duration along the yield curve.</p>\n<p>HFXB’s smart contract design resembles an asynchronous ERC-4626 vault, whereby users can periodically deposit sFrax to mint shares of the vault. This sFrax is then deployed via a rebalancing strategy such that the vault’s average duration is within a margin of the target duration. Shares minted from the vault, otherwise known as the HFXB token, can be freely traded on Curve, redeemed for the underlying, or otherwise be composed across DeFi. HFXB vault rebalancing will happen on the most efficient market it can find, whether that be the individual FXB pools on Curve or the time-bound token marketplace on Hourglass. Further details about HFXB can be found in the <a href=\"https://docs.hourglass.com/technical-documentation/hourglass-index/hfxb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>HFXB is designed to drive meaningful locked liquidity to the Frax protocol by deepening FXB secondary liquidity and simplifying its user experience. Rather than Frax needing to maintain unique liquidity pools on Curve and Fraxlend for each duration FXB, each of which require periodic rollovers, the protocol can incentivize a small number of indices which perpetually facilitate price discovery and liquidity for the Frax yield curve. This has the added benefit of improving FXS incentive efficiency, and as such we propose that HFXB is added to the gauge controller.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"voting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-5\"></a>Voting</h2>\n<p>• For: Add the HFXB/Frax Curve pool to the FXS gauge controller on Arbitrum<br>\n• Against: Do nothing</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-328-330-add-curve-hfxb-frax-to-the-fxs-gauge-controller-on-arbitrum/2877\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-328-330-add-curve-hfxb-frax-to-the-fxs-gauge-controller-on-arbitrum/2877","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 14:16:24 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2877"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-328-330-add-curve-hfxb-frax-to-the-fxs-gauge-controller-on-arbitrum/2877.rss","#text":"[FIP - 328, 330] Add Curve HFXB/Frax to the FXS gauge controller on Arbitrum"},"filter":true},{"title":"Funding for CVX5 Group - Business Development Growth","dc:creator":"boz_m","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<h4><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h4>\n<p>Since its inception in 2020, Frax has been a frontrunner in the DeFi space. As we approach the much-anticipated launch of Fraxtal, forging strategic partnerships to bolster liquidity and Total Value Locked (TVL) is more crucial than ever.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#background-2\"></a>Background</h4>\n<p>Established in late November 2023, CVX5 is a coalition of five dedicated individuals united by a singular vision: to propel the growth of Frax Finance and Convex Finance ecosystems. Our team members - Boz Menzalji, Cryptovestor, Jason Hitchcock, K Khan, and Solace - bring diverse yet complementary expertise to the table.</p>\n<p>Business Development Case Study: <a href=\"https://www.tridig.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Trident Digital Group</a> (“TriDig”):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Educated TriDig on the governance layout of Convex &amp; Curve, including the nuanced intricacies associated with onboarding their proposals</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We coordinated these proposals with the CVX Group that consolidated protocol leads and large holders for effective and communication for maximum awareness and visibility</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We streamlined TriDig’s technical efforts and their contracts with Michael on Curve, acting as a technical advisory and support team</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We advised TriDigs group on their go to market strategies, and highlighted other effective means for a longer incentive runway using complimentary protocols of Convex, such as Aladdin’s CLever</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CryptoVestor/Boz managed the relationship, including calls, introductions to several protocols (that cannot be shared at the moment given sensitive nature of the conversations)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Solace deployed the Frax/USDC “PayPool” on Convex, and got it ready for Votium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cryptovestor/Solace/Boz: Ongoing strategies with key ecosystem partners with the key goal of optimizing incentives, maximizing TVL, driving volume, and utility of those pools for users</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our recent accomplishment with Trident Digital, guiding them to infuse pyUSD liquidity into DeFi, stands as a testament to our capabilities. CVX5 ensured that Trident’s proposals not only met quorum but also facilitated strategic partnerships with major DeFi players. Our collective experience spans across startup development, DeFi fund advisory, private equity investment, and digital marketing, all driven by our shared passion and values in the DeFi sector.</p>\n<p>The primary motivation for CVX5 is achieving a sense of accomplishment through positive sum interactions.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"proposal-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#proposal-3\"></a>Proposal</h4>\n<p>We outlined some of the responsibilities we undertook as part of the community as we believe this positively impacts the ecosystem overall.  Our efforts will continue with the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Act as one of the key ecosystem business development leads entrusted by Frax’s team and community to manage relationships, assisting with educating, onboarding, and strategizing opportunities that benefit the Frax ecosystem at large</li>\n<li>Leverage our network of partners to evangelize Frax’s development and efforts to a diversified audience base</li>\n<li>Qualify inbound prospects that align on values and mutually benefit the ecosystem to increase liquidity, TVL and overall chain utility</li>\n<li>Recruit protocols in the DeFi ecosystem at large to expand to Fractal</li>\n<li>Be an advisory resource to Fractal ecosystem projects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CVX5, leveraging our extensive hands-on experience and strong community ties, proposes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An allocation of $25,000 Frax to integrate CVX5 as an integral part of Frax Finance’s Business Development core initiatives. These initiatives are outlined in the key part above in the case study portion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These funds will be staked for 1-year on our Fraxtal validator and will only be used to pay for overhead costs: operational, security and cloud costs. Although we do not have the details at the time of this proposal, we reserve the right to revisit these costs once testnet is live.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fraxtal Validator: We propose the Frax team to delegate to a future validator such that we are in the top 25% by weight. That ensures Frax has complete custody of assets, and the earnings to CVX5 are in line with community infrastructure providers and contributors, further extending our value-add to secure the network. The earnings will be derived from the fee structure that will allow us to continue funding operations. This can be revisited with the Frax team once more details, such as hardware and architecture requirements are officially public. It’s a risk-free bet by Frax to incentivize delegations contribution efforts from its community partners, like CVX5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the event Fraxtal requires a validator delegation program, we also volunteer to help advise on the structure for delegation to the team. Boz has helped create Akash Network’s delegation program, and managed its community’s contribution for the past four years. You can learn more about it <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/379\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our track record, especially in rallying key CVX groups, has significantly improved communication, visibility, and feedback mechanisms for governance proposals.

With Fraxtal (Fraxchain) around the corner, Flywheel’s role in Frax will only grow in importance and will give us an opportunity to expand the surface level of our coverage and outreach.</p>\n<p>In 2024, our goals are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transform passive observers into active participants in the Frax Ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Cultivate a vibe for Frax that people can identify with and have positive feelings toward.</li>\n<li>Solidify Flywheel as the educational and cultural backbone of Frax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this proposal, we will review</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What we accomplished last year</li>\n<li>How funds will be allocated this year</li>\n<li>Comparisons to efforts by other DAOs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"year-in-review-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#year-in-review-4\"></a>Year in Review</h3>\n<p>Since applying for our last <a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-178-flywheel-grant-renewal-for-2023/2068\">grant</a> in January 2023, we have greatly expanded our efforts offering multiple Frax-focused weekly content items, community activities, and in real-life events.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"online-content-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#online-content-5\"></a>Online Content</h4>\n<p>Looking back on the past year, we are proud to share the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flywheel is the go-to destination for anyone looking to learn or keep up with anything and everything Frax. Whether it’s having a Frax 101 section on our website dedicated to <a href=\"https://flywheeldefi.com/frax-101\">breaking down</a> how different subprotocols and AMOs work, creating <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvAjnnRQIhQMjldRRZI9H5TBjNy5EW16j\">tutorials</a> on how to use the Frax family of products, or being the first to <a href=\"https://flywheeldefi.com/article/fraxchain-the-ultimate-monetary-amplifier\">report</a> on developments like Fraxchain, Flywheel has been effective in its mission of disseminating information about Frax throughout DeFi.</li>\n<li>Our coverage of news and updates are found on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvAjnnRQIhQMNWzLvMBDqAPFsU0sfhY5c\">This Week in Frax</a> which highlights the biggest developments for the protocol on a weekly basis on YouTube, Twitter, and our newsletter. Flywheel now has two bi-weekly programs that supplement our news coverage of Frax including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvAjnnRQIhQP3rUVxFNkhhHT80djw1aZi\">Cryptovestor’s Alpha Corner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvAjnnRQIhQPDdJVso8iNEL4MeXrRDg63\">Frax Check</a>. Cryptovestor’s Alpha Corner features the die-hard Fraximalist, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cryptovestor77\">Cryptovestor</a>, who shares his findings of relevant information of Frax’s development and shipping in newsletter and video form. Frax Check is one of the longest lasting programs of Flywheel that goes straight to the numbers to share the protocol’s health and performance over a two-week time period.</li>\n<li>One of the most highly praised areas of Flywheel is our clips and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@FlywheelDeFi/shorts\">shorts</a> from our long-form video content. Distributing them on both YouTube and TikTok, our clips have been able to receive tens of thousands of views.</li>\n<li>Our flagship Flywheel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEhZWLyGtSg&amp;list=PLvAjnnRQIhQOlA5jPcMC_6BfCnZni7cYk\">podcast</a> takes deeper dives into the Frax protocol from both the core team internally and analysts/commentators externally as well as builds bridges with key opinion leaders and protocols beyond Frax. Our podcast stands out for going deep into subject matters and has become a growing destination for researchers and market participants of all sizes to stay up to date on Frax, DeFi, and everything in between.\n<ul>\n<li>Driven by natural curiosity, the Flywheel podcast interviews the most interesting developments in DeFi and beyond. In the past, we have had industry-heavyweights such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRmy876JzQ8\">Kain Warwick</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6Bn53Ck6_E\">Rune Christiansen</a>, up and coming builders from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOU-I_1vA80\">f(x) protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFziJcZFGkg\">Dolomite</a>, commentators like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgeBT5eQQlk\">Ansem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh-d2KcMysQ\">Gwart</a>, as well as many others.</li>\n<li>We continue to host a wide range of Frax-centric interviews whether it’s with alpha leaks with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa4Kz8KyBnU\">Sam Kazemian</a>, breakdowns of subprotocols with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvnnPj7J67s\">core devs</a>, or hearing out analyst reasonings for their bullishness on Frax with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEYDTXwrKWM&amp;list=PLvAjnnRQIhQOlA5jPcMC_6BfCnZni7cYk&amp;index=12\">Stacy Muur,</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcGFmZXqng4&amp;list=PLvAjnnRQIhQOlA5jPcMC_6BfCnZni7cYk&amp;index=8\">Winter Soldier</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8w_XWJUwXA\">DeFi Cheetah</a>, and others. Furthermore, we have featured an educational clip of frxETH at the beginning of every episode and a link in the description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"real-world-outreach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#real-world-outreach-6\"></a>Real-World Outreach</h4>\n<p>Strikingly in 2023, Flywheel hosted a number of events online and in real life as well as spoke on behalf of Frax on a number of occasions. The purpose of these events was to engage builders and users about Frax beyond the realm of content.</p>\n<p>It’s clear how Flywheel stepped up here, while the core team was heads down shipping, we were on the ground educating and spreading awareness of Frax around the world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acting as a Core Advocate for Frax, DeFi Dave was able to organize six happy hours around the world, speak on behalf of Frax on multiple spaces online and on major occasions in real life, successfully execute Frax’s first-ever hackathon online, and lead the Frax Educational Incentive Program for the community.\n<ul>\n<li>The Frax Happy Hours were a series of in real life events primarily during conference weeks that offered a space to directly engage with Frax. Flywheel was prolific in this endeavor, hosting happy hours at ETHDenver, ETH Tokyo, <a href=\"https://x.com/DeFiDave22/status/1650107057503354889?s=20\">Hong Kong</a>, ETH Waterloo, ETHcc (Paris), and Token2049 (Singapore). Along with spreading awareness of Frax, these happy hours were able to bring together people from across the space to connect and learn from each other in a fruitful manner and friendly environment.</li>\n<li>At ETHDenver this past year, Frax Co-Founder set the tone for 2023 with his talk about <a href=\"https://flywheeldefi.com/article/frax-finance-co-founder-sam-kazemian\">Stablecoin Maximalism</a>, why the Frax Core team believes in this framework, and how Frax is building in that direction. Flywheel took it upon itself to champion stablecoin maximalism, writing an article explaining the philosophical framework and as a Core Advocate, DeFi Dave participated in a number of speaking engagements on behalf of Frax including at Zuzalu and ETHcc.\n<ul>\n<li>Zuzalu was a two-month temporary city organized by Vitalik himself that brought together great minds across frontier tech. Representing Frax, DeFi Dave was accepted as a guest of the community and organized a panel with QiDAO about stablecoins and hosted a <a href=\"https://x.com/DeFiDave22/status/1654185305765736451?s=20\">talk</a> about Frax and Stablecoin Maximalism to 25+ people. At ETHcc, one of the highest regarded conferences outside of Devconnect and Devcon, DeFi Dave gave his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-9f0j8CPE\">speech</a> “Stablecoin Maximalism: DeFi’s Universal Framework ‘’, to a packed audience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In addition, DeFi Dave participated in a number of Twitter spaces on behalf of Frax as well as in panels in real life for Stable Summit in Paris and Singapore.\n<ul>\n<li>Collectively attended by thousands of people, DeFi Dave has joined Twitter spaces with the likes of Arbitrum, OKX, Wombat, Dappos, and countless others educating wider audiences in crypto on what Frax is and how Frax works. At Stable Summit, DeFi Dave represented Frax on a panel in Paris, moderated one in Singapore, and moderated another one in the form of a Twitter Space prior to Istanbul.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Engaging the community, Flywheel was able to lead the FraxBUILD Hackathon and Frax Educational Incentive Program. These initiatives were the first in Frax history that gave builders a clear path to develop in the Frax ecosystem and writers to share their research about Frax in their own words.\n<ul>\n<li>In partnership with Dorahacks, the FraxBUILD hackathon focused on three areas including Product Expansion, Consumer Adoption, and Data Analytics. Engaging participants with workshops and office hours, builders and onlookers alike were able to engage the Frax Core Team in a unique manner with Sam Kazemian even sharing the plans for frxETH v2 along the way. From this hackathon, the Frax ecosystem was given a boost of new projects and platforms including the Fraxlend vault Fraximal (Product Expansion, 1st place), the Sticker protocol which built digital stickers that were backed by frxETH (Consumer Adoption, 1st place), and a <a href=\"https://flywheeldefi.com/article/fraxbuild-hackathon-winners\">numbers of others</a>.</li>\n<li>The Frax Educational Incentive Program was established with the mission of spreading awareness of Frax throughout DeFi and beyond. Since starting in April, writers, threadors, and dashboard creators across the Frax community submitted hundreds of entries and proliferated a wave of content that otherwise would have never existed. The result has been threads that have collectively seen hundreds of thousands of views.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"case-study-how-flywheel-organically-creates-narratives-from-scratch-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#case-study-how-flywheel-organically-creates-narratives-from-scratch-7\"></a>Case Study: How Flywheel Organically Creates Narratives From Scratch</h3>\n<p>A clear example that perfectly encapsulates the power of Flywheel is our campaign for BAMM. BAMM (or Borrow AMM) has been in the works for some time with plans of it being <a href=\"https://youtu.be/p1juUsvPtZw?si=uPJtq4Flc1vZ986P&amp;t=1265\">discussed</a> as early as March 2023. Through research and conversations with members of the core team, Flywheel was able to author an <a href=\"https://flywheeldefi.com/article/bamm-revolutionary-primative\">article</a> of how BAMM worked and organically distribute across social media, creating a conversation about the primitive in the process.</p>\n<p>There were two parts of this campaign, the initial BAMM thread and DeFi Dave’s screenshot. What both were able to do well is spark a discussion and excite people about the innovation. This was especially true when Michael the founder of Curve <a href=\"https://x.com/newmichwill/status/1730875833156272255?s=20\">quote tweeted</a> Dave. Final numbers of this campaign include the BAMM thread reaching 90k impressions and DeFi Dave’s tweet reaching 193k impressions making the culminating total being over 280k impressions. FXS was trending on CoinGecko and discussions about Frax were rampant on Twitter as well as across social media. Although the concept of a Borrow-AMM is nothing new with multiple projects working on some version of it, what Flywheel was able to accomplish was creating a narrative for it from scratch and attaching Frax as one of the primary drivers of the category.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/f/f55e0f820bffe7e2c33fd7fac08d4100d94554f4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/z0CvfPICA28XwoyTVdDtysCE8hm.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/f55e0f820bffe7e2c33fd7fac08d4100d94554f4_2_285x500.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"z0CvfPICA28XwoyTVdDtysCE8hm\" width=\"285\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/f55e0f820bffe7e2c33fd7fac08d4100d94554f4_2_285x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/f55e0f820bffe7e2c33fd7fac08d4100d94554f4_2_427x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/f/f55e0f820bffe7e2c33fd7fac08d4100d94554f4_2_570x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E2E4E0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Our BAMM efforts perfectly illustrate the information distribution pipeline for the Frax ecosystem that we have painstakingly built over the past year and a half. Following this blueprint, we can repeat this result for new primitives &amp; initiatives and put Frax in the position of maximum exposure.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"by-the-numbers-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#by-the-numbers-8\"></a>By The Numbers</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"growth-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#growth-9\"></a>Growth</h4>\n<p>Flywheel’s growth has remained consistent over the past year. Since January of 2023, Flywheel has more than doubled our followers on Twitter from 2500 to 5750 and our YouTube subscribers from 1350 to 2800. Twitter has proven to be our most pivotal outlet in terms of distribution, and in the past 10 months alone we have received over 2 million impressions.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/d/d5e3392f18627db307f37ab3e5a110a0004b5829.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uw8wyfZARxZAQ4tYZUu81lBWzix.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d5e3392f18627db307f37ab3e5a110a0004b5829_2_624x96.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uw8wyfZARxZAQ4tYZUu81lBWzix\" width=\"624\" height=\"96\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d5e3392f18627db307f37ab3e5a110a0004b5829_2_624x96.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d5e3392f18627db307f37ab3e5a110a0004b5829_2_936x144.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/d/d5e3392f18627db307f37ab3e5a110a0004b5829_2_1248x192.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Although promising, these platforms are “rented”, and beyond distribution, it comes with its own set of limitations. This all changed when we moved off of substack and launched our own website <a href=\"http://FlywheelDeFi.com\">FlywheelDeFi.com</a>. Launched in August of 2023, <a href=\"https://flywheeldefi.com/\">FlywheelDeFi.com</a> is the first time Flywheel owns the top of the content funnel, allowing us to engage and capture audiences, new and recurring alike, in a sustainable manner. With our website/newsletter along with distribution channels, Flywheel has grown to a collective audience of 10,000 users.</p>\n<p>Of this audience, in just four months of our website launch we have added 4k more users in which 2/3rds are entering through new doorways into the brand. A huge signal that the audience is engaged with the new website is that users are on the site on an average of 2:12 with over 10% of people further exploring the site beyond the homepage by clicking on at least one more page on the site. Although the new website has been up for a short amount of time, if there is one thing that the data shows, it’s that Flywheel keeps the audience engaged.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"finances-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#finances-10\"></a>Finances</h4>\n<p>The Frax DAO has committed $267.2k to Flywheel between February 8th, 2023 to February 8th, 2024. For the first 5 months, the payout was split 80% in FXS/20% in FRAX at a price of $10 per FXS. For the next 7 months after that, the payout was established to be split 50% in FXS/50% in FRAX at a price of a 30-day TWAP of FXS from the previous month. Other activities we have done for Frax include organizing the FraxBUILD Hackathon for $7.5k and organizing and participating in the Frax Educational Incentives which has totaled to date $16,988.50. In total, that puts Frax’s commitment in 2023 at $291,688.50.</p>\n<p>Since inception, Flywheel has not sold any FXS and have been able to accumulate over 24 sfrxETH, 5,030.2263 FPIS, and 3500 pitchFXS. We have been able to do this from receiving outside investment and support from PIF Labs which alleviates a number of core expenses.

This year, we will list the general responsibilities that Flywheel will be executing on behalf of Frax as well as to keep its own house organized. In order for Flywheel DeFi to still function and operate at the level it does now, then we must be able to fund itself properly. Funding from this grant will be able to support a staff of 6 people which include myself as DeFi Dave (CEO, Core Advocate), Sam McCoulloch, (Executive Producer), Kiet Fong (CFO, Co-Host), Peepo (Media Editor), Carissa Campo (Growth Lead), and Phil Lewy (Content Specialist):</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Item</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Grant Coverage Details</th>\n<th>Staff</th>\n<th>Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Education and Awareness</td>\n<td>Production of Frax-centric content including This Week in Frax, Frax Check, Cryptovestor’s Alpha Corner, etc. Production of flagship Flywheel podcast and include updated education slots that feature Fraxchain, sFRAX, and sfrxETH.

As exemplified in our year in review, we have a long track record of executing in both areas and will continue on that momentum in 2024. Sam, Phil, and Peepo are an iconic trio who have stepped up to make sure that content is curated, published, and distributed in an effective fashion. Sam has been with Flywheel since it’s inception making sure our content machine runs smoothly. Peepo has contributed to Flywheel originally as an artist but has stepped up in a massive way as our media editor, editing long-form podcasts and creating renowned short clips. Phil joined Flywheel as an intern this year and has assisted Sam with posts and social media. Myself and Kiet have been hosting the Flywheel podcast since the beginning and while Kiet publishes is bi-weekly Frax Check, I have stepped up to direct and advise our editor team behind the scenes on direction and strategy.</p>\n<p>Last year, I was asked multiple occasions by the Frax team to speak on different spaces and conferences and am proud to call myself a Core Advocate of the ecosystem. In addition, I have helped the Frax team make relevant connections whether it be with potential collaborators, organizers at conferences, power users, educators and creators, and more. Although many of these actions are behind the scenes and go unnoticed, they are vital to the growth of the ecosystem. This year, I will continue fulfilling my duties in these areas and do whatever is asked of me for Frax.</p>\n<p>In 2023, what made Flywheel stand out in a big way was the quality of events &amp; activities we had both online and offline as well as how we rebranded ourselves to the wider public. From hackathons to happy hours and everything in between, our outreach efforts bolstered Frax’s image in an intangibly valuable manner. A lot of my time was directed at organizing and executing events without a hitch and Carissa was instrumental in helping in this regard. Furthermore, Carissa led our website redesign that serves as a vital online organ in capturing and onboarding people into Frax. This year, she will continue delivering in these areas and helping Flywheel grow it’s reach and impact on behalf of Frax.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Flywheel was able to begin to diversify it’s revenue streams by pursuing collaborations with Brain DAO, Metronome, and ZUSD to the tune of $60k. As more protocols integrate with the Frax ecosystem whether it be on Fraxtal or with the protocol itself, it will give us the opportunity to partner with more projects looking to invest in education efforts to our Frax-centric and DeFi-savy audience.</p>\n<p>EDIT* Instead of receiving funds as FXS set at $6.90 via llamaPay, we are requesting to receive funds on a monthly basis as 50% FRAX/50% FXS with FXS priced at the 30 day avg.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"comparisons-and-benchmarks-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#comparisons-and-benchmarks-12\"></a>Comparisons and Benchmarks</h3>\n<p>Compared to other growth and branding departments, Flywheel’s request is modest. In the most recent MakerDAO Growth Core Unit <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP70#list-of-budget-breakdowns\">Proposal</a>, the requested budget for their brand team alone was $1,825,380.53 with salaries making up $607,200 of the budget. The remaining expenses for the Brand team included Public Relations Mainstream &amp; Crypto ($700,000), Digital Assets for Comms ($300,000), Professional Services ($150,000), and Travel and Events ($68,180.53). Because Flywheel owns its public relations pipeline, there is no need for that expense. Flywheel’s total budget for 2024 is approximately 1/4th of MakerDAO’s Growth Unit’s.</p>\n<p>In November 2023 for devconnect, rAAVE, and ETH Global Istanbul alone, AAVE DAO <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-events-sponsorship-budget/15075\">requested</a> a budget of $550,000.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#motivation-13\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>Flywheel is the Education and Culture subDAO of Frax. We will continue to evangelize the ecosystem and build a community that people want to be apart of. Although we have made tremendous progress, we recognize the journey ahead of us is far from complete and we already have our heads down working to make 2024 a landmark year for Frax and Flywheel. As an ecosystem with multiple tokens in CoinGecko’s Top 100 that together (along with Frax’s subprotocols) hold a total of nearly $2 billion of value, Frax cannot afford anything less than world-class attention and quality that Flywheel delivers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposal-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#proposal-14\"></a>Proposal</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Approve Flywheel Funding of $370k Base &amp; $200k Extra Incentives for 2024</li>\n<li>Against: Do Nothing</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"snapshot-voting-fip-322-flywheel-funding-for-2024httpssnapshotorgfraxethproposal0x2b173824c3e5d372782128bfedbc35b6f75ec8de32236d746ed7e31dd25e97f1-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#snapshot-voting-fip-322-flywheel-funding-for-2024httpssnapshotorgfraxethproposal0x2b173824c3e5d372782128bfedbc35b6f75ec8de32236d746ed7e31dd25e97f1-15\"></a>Snapshot Voting: <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth/proposal/0x2b173824c3e5d372782128bfedbc35b6f75ec8de32236d746ed7e31dd25e97f1\">[FIP-322] Flywheel Funding For 2024</a></h3>\n            <p><small>32 posts - 16 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-322-flywheel-funding-for-2024/2840\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-322-flywheel-funding-for-2024/2840","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jan 2024 15:31:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-2840"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-322-flywheel-funding-for-2024/2840.rss","#text":"[FIP-322] Flywheel Funding For 2024"},"filter":true}]}}}
