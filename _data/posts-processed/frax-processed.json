We are asking the Frax DAO if they would be interested in donating  to help Roman Storm in his legal efforts to ensure we set up proper precedence globally for developers to not be prosecuted for writing code. We will also be conducting co-marketing campaigns to highlight DAO’s, protocols, and people that have donated to this cause.</p>\n<p>I propose creating an NFT on Fraxtal or a POAP to support Roman’s legal defense. All proceeds would go directly to this cause, with the potential for Frax DAO to match donations up to $15K.

However, by leveraging Fraxtal’s infrastructure, we aim to optimize our governance experience and integrate more effectively with our ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Migrating Snapshot voting to Fraxtal will not only streamline our operations but also position Fraxtal as a central hub for governance activities. This move will allow us to accumulate voting power from both our veFXS holders on the mainnet and those on Fraxtal, creating a more unified and influential voting base. Additionally, by setting this precedent, we hope to encourage other projects to consider Fraxtal for their governance needs, further solidifying its role in the broader DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-7041-voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-7041-voting-4\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For:</strong> Approve the migration of Snapshot voting from Ethereum mainnet to Fraxtal.</li>\n<li><strong>Against:</strong> Continue using Ethereum mainnet for Snapshot voting.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-408-migrate-the-snapshot-voting-process-from-the-ethereum-mainnet-to-the-fraxtal-network/3284\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-408-migrate-the-snapshot-voting-process-from-the-ethereum-mainnet-to-the-fraxtal-network/3284","pubDate":"Tue, 10 Sep 2024 16:00:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3284"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-408-migrate-the-snapshot-voting-process-from-the-ethereum-mainnet-to-the-fraxtal-network/3284.rss","#text":"[FIP - 408] Migrate the Snapshot voting process from the Ethereum mainnet to the Fraxtal network"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP - 4XX] Fund the development of the Fraximalist NFT project","dc:creator":"Westwood","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<h3><a name=\"p-7023-authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-7023-authors-1\"></a>Authors:</h3>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/u/westwood\">@Westwood</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-7023-preamble-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-7023-preamble-2\"></a>Preamble:</h3>\n<p>The Fraximalist NFT Collection is designed to be more than just digital art; it’s a unifying force within the Frax ecosystem, giving the community something to rally around and fostering a shared identity. This collection embodies the innovation, culture, and spirit that define Frax, while also supporting the financial structure that makes the protocol strong. By integrating this collection with the broader Frax ecosystem, we aim to enhance community engagement and provide lasting value to all participants.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-7023-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-7023-overview-3\"></a>Overview:</h3>\n<p>The Fraximalist NFT Collection is a unique series of NFTs designed to embody the ethos of the Frax movement. This collection will feature a range of artistic styles across different seasons, with each NFT serving as both a collectible and a functional asset within the Frax ecosystem.</p>\n<p>As the first fully-fledged PFP NFT collection on Fraxtal, the Fraximalist NFT Collection carries additional historical and cultural value. This pioneering project not only represents a milestone for the Frax ecosystem but also contributes to the evolving narrative of Frax, embedding itself in the legacy of financial innovation within the protocol.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-7023-key-features-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-7023-key-features-4\"></a>Key Features:</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Dynamic and Evolving Supply:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The initial minting process will run for one week, during which collectors can mint NFTs with various traits.</li>\n<li>Each season will have a predetermined maximum supply.</li>\n<li>After the minting week, the art will be revealed, and the total supply for that season will be finalized. However, the overall supply of Fraximalist NFTs is not fixed as there will be additional seasons with new mints.</li>\n<li>The supply of Fraximalist NFTs is designed to be deflationary within each season, with no further minting beyond the allotted period for each season.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Refundable NFTs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To add an extra layer of security and trust for collectors, NFTs will be refundable for 95% of their initial purchase price. This partial refund mechanism is designed to maintain fairness and integrity in the distribution of NFTs. It also prevents users from exploiting the system by repeatedly refunding and minting to obtain a “better roll.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Evolving Artistic Themes Across Seasons:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"d-image-grid\">\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\"

tastes.</li>\n<li><strong>Realistic Art:</strong> The third season will present NFTs with a realistic art style, adding depth and variety to the collection.</li>\n<li><strong>Future Seasons:</strong> Subsequent seasons will explore other art styles, to be determined based on community feedback.</li>\n<li><strong>Reason for Seasons:</strong> The seasonal approach is designed to offer variety for different users and collectors, accommodating a wide range of tastes and preferences. By offering different artistic styles in each season, the Fraximalist NFT Collection remains inclusive and appealing to a broader audience within the Frax community.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"p-7023-traits-homage-to-defi-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-7023-traits-homage-to-defi-5\"></a>Traits &amp; Homage to DeFi:</h3>\n<p>The Fraximalist NFT Collection will feature a wide variety of <strong>traits</strong> across categories like headgear, clothing, accessories, and backgrounds, providing significant customization for each NFT. In total, the collection will include <strong>over 100 unique traits</strong>.</p>\n<p>These traits are designed to pay homage to <strong>Frax</strong> and other major <strong>DeFi projects</strong>, such as Curve Finance, Ra, and more. Each trait reflects key elements from these projects, celebrating the broader DeFi ecosystem and its innovators. Subsequent seasons will include new traits as the Fraxtal ecosystem grows.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"p-7023-financial-mechanics-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-7023-financial-mechanics-6\"></a>Financial Mechanics:</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Mint Cost:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mint cost is currently undecided, with a proposed amount of 1,000 FRAX per NFT. This pricing is intended to keep the threshold high, ensuring that the NFTs maintain a high-status value. However, this is subject to debate and will be adjusted based on community feedback.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. FRAX Utilization:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All FRAX from the NFT sales will be deposited into sFRAX, providing a stable yield-bearing investment that supports the Frax ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Profits generated from the sFRAX investments will be utilized to purchase FXS, further enhancing the value proposition for both NFT holders and the broader Frax community.</li>\n<li>The 5% of FRAX held back from refunds will be held in a community owned treasury that can fund future endeavors.</li>\n<li>This mechanism creates a demand sink for FRAX, adding more utility to the stablecoin and supporting its use case within the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>The strategic reinvestment of profits into FXS generates passive buy pressure, further driving the value of FXS and benefiting the entire Frax ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-7023-what-frax-gets-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-7023-what-frax-gets-7\"></a>What Frax Gets:</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Bootstrapped Community:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Fraximalist NFT Collection will bring together both NFT and Frax enthusiasts, creating a bootstrapped, active community that rallies around a shared product and identity within the ecosystem (think The Llamas NFT and Curve)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. New Demand Sink for FRAX:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>With FRAX being the primary currency for minting these NFTs, the collection creates a consistent demand sink for FRAX, adding utility to the stablecoin and ensuring ongoing circulation within the ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Constant FXS Buy Pressure:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profits from NFT sales will be reinvested into FXS purchases, creating regular buy pressure on FXS and supporting its price. This mechanism ensures ongoing support for FXS holders and aligns with the broader financial goals of the Frax protocol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. NFT Demand on Fraxtal:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>As the first major NFT collection on Fraxtal, the Fraximalist series will drive significant attention and demand for NFTs on the Fraxtal chain. This project helps establish Fraxtal as a go-to platform for future NFT projects and Frax-related products, increasing network activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Incubator for Fraxtal-Related Products:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The NFT treasury, funded by sales and refunds, could serve as a future incubator for Fraxtal-related products. These could be developed or funded by the community through the treasury, creating a self-sustaining loop of innovation within the ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-7023-additional-nft-perks-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-7023-additional-nft-perks-8\"></a>Additional NFT Perks:</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Airdrops from Fraxtal Partners:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraximalist NFT holders could be eligible to receive airdrops from Fraxtal’s partners, offering exclusive tokens, project access, or rewards, increasing the tangible value of holding these NFTs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Special Discord Role:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Holding a Fraximalist NFT will grant users a special role in the Frax Discord, providing them with access to exclusive channels, early governance discussions, and community events, fostering deeper engagement with the protocol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. FXTL Point Bonus:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraximalist NFT holders could earn bonus FXTL points within the Frax ecosystem, enhancing their yield or increasing their participation in governance through an additional FXTL allocation.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"p-7023-decentralization-smart-contracts-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-7023-decentralization-smart-contracts-9\"></a>Decentralization &amp; Smart Contracts</h3>\n<p>The Fraximalist NFT Collection is underpinned by a decentralized infrastructure, ensuring that all transactions, minting, and refund processes occur transparently and without third-party interference. The smart contracts for this collection will be written and deployed by <strong>Tibout Shaik</strong>, a renowned developer with a strong track record in the world of decentralized art and NFTs.</p>\n<p>Tibout Shaik, who is well-known for his contributions to various projects on <a href=\"https://256art.com/artist/tibout-shaik\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">256Art</a>, has a history of developing robust, secure, and innovative smart contract solutions in the blockchain space. His experience with high-profile NFT projects ensures that the Fraximalist collection will operate seamlessly, maintaining security and trust within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This ensures that <strong>only you control the funds from your NFT mints</strong>, and no one can rug you. The smart contract’s design guarantees that collectors retain full control of their minted NFTs and refunds. The only tokens that the team will be able to control are the <strong>5% fee</strong> and the <strong>interest earned on sFRAX</strong>. By leveraging this decentralized structure, Frax ensures that all minting, refunds, and interactions are trustless and governed by immutable code.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Long-Term Vision:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Multiple Seasons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the first mint is successful, we plan to expand the Fraximalist NFT Collection into multiple seasons. Each new season will bring fresh designs, themes, and opportunities for collectors to engage with the Frax ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Fraximalist NFTs as a Gateway:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>These NFTs are not just collectibles—they are gateways to Frax’s deeper ecosystem.

Therefore, when lending sFRAX via AMO Frax Finance can be assured of profitability regardless of how much money it deposits in the pool.</p>\n<p><strong>Positives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guaranteed AMO Profitability:</strong> As long as there are no liquidations that take on bad debt, Frax AMO’s will need less managing because FRAX lent into the pool will always be earning more than Frax’s cost of capital</li>\n<li><strong>More liquidity:</strong> For lenders, the sFRAX pools can be thought of as restaking lending pools that allow them to return additional yield on-top of the existing yield they’re already generating from sFRAX. As a result, I’d expect a decent portion of the $47m to be deposited as liquidity.</li>\n<li><strong>Cheaper Borrowing:</strong> Lower borrowing rates because the borrower doesn’t need to subsidize the entire unlent portion of the pool. All unlent sFRAX is still appreciating in value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Negatives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Fraxlend Revenue:</strong> Fraxlend won’t profit off of the intrinsic borrowing cost associated with sFrax, so if the lending rate is functionally 8% Fraxlend will only earn fees on 8 – sFRAX Rate = 2%.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher Gas Fees:</strong> Borrowers will need to unwrap sFRAX for FRAX anytime they want to borrow money.</li>\n<li><strong>Less Clear Borrowing Cost:</strong> The real borrowing cost is abstracted from the user but this can be resolved in the future with a minor UI change.</li>\n<li><strong>No Frax AMO Support:</strong> Frax AMOs don’t directly support sFRAX but they are largely manually managed, so I don’t think the conversion should be problematic. If this is untrue, please let me know in the comments.</li>\n<li><strong>Frax AMO impact on sFRAX yield:</strong> The sFRAX contract does not have functionality to ignore a portion of minted sFRAX when distributing profits, so all AMO Minted sFRAX would receive a portion of profits reducing the underlying sFRAX yield. This could be offset on a 1-week behind basis by adding all profits held by unlent sFRAX back to the sFRAX contract.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Additional Details:</strong> The Fraxlend Fees for sFRAX pools can be raised to account for the lower revenue if we want.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Profile:</strong><br>\nsFRAX is always losslessly convertible to FRAX, so it shares it’s liquidity profile. The Max LTV is identical to that of the sfrxEth pool, so that shouldn’t be a concern.</p>\n<p><strong>Curve Details:</strong> To account for the underlying sFRAX yield, we’ll need to create a new significantly less step Curve. I would suggest a curve where the Borrow limit linearly increases from 0.5% to 4% until hitting 85% utilization, at which point if would mimic the behavior of the Variable 2 curve.</p>\n<p><strong>Closing Thoughts:</strong></p>\n<p>I believe that in the future a significant portion of debt will be denominated in term of the yield-generating primitive much like real-world loans are denominated in terms of SOFR, so we should try to get ahead of the curve.</p>\n<p><strong>Voting:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For:</strong> Approve the creation of the sfrxETH/sFRAX Fraxlend pair on Ethereum Mainnet with the specified max authorized allocation, new curve, and max LTV</li>\n<li><strong>Against:</strong> Do not approve the creation of the new Fraxlend pair.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-403-create-new-sfrxeth-sfrax-fraxlend-pair/3263\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-403-create-new-sfrxeth-sfrax-fraxlend-pair/3263","pubDate":"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 17:54:35 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3263"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-403-create-new-sfrxeth-sfrax-fraxlend-pair/3263.rss","#text":"[FIP - 403] Create new sfrxEth/sFRAX Fraxlend Pair"},"filter":false},{"title":"Define Head of Ecosystem for Frax","dc:creator":"boz_m","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>This is an open question to consolidate a better understanding of the Frax ecosystem for future proposers who are looking to contribute and be a value add to the community.</p>\n<p>Does Frax need an ecosystem lead?

I’m also currently a core member of the CVX5 and recognise the challenges that new protocols and DAOs face when integrating into the DeFi ecosystem. My first purchase of Frax share was just under $5 in October 2021. I have since then been following, voting on FXS snapshot proposals and keeping upto date with the changes and developments.</p>\n<p>As an early investor and active member of the Convex &amp; Frax community. Frax has been one of the frontrunners in the DeFi space. With the recent launch of Fraxtal, forging strategic partnerships to enhance liquidity and Total Value Locked (TVL) has become a top priority. I propose the creation of a Head of Ecosystem Development position.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>The Head of Ecosystem Development will involve engaging and fostering relationships with DeFi protocols and crypto companies, with a focus on GCC countries; Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with the potential to expand to ASEAN countries.</p>\n<p>Dubai is rapidly emerging as a leading hub for crypto enterprises, and continues to accelerate with many crypto firms from the UK and Europe relocating to the UAE. This is driven by a favourable regulatory environment led by Abu Dhabi, an established financial sector, and strong commitment to innovation.</p>\n<p>As Dubai continues in attracting top talent from around the globe, the GCC Ecosystem Lead will be instrumental in building strategic partnerships and ensuring Fraxtal Chain’s growth in this rapidly thriving market.</p>\n<p><strong>Duties:</strong></p>\n<p>Identify and Secure Partnerships: Engage with DeFi protocols, blockchain projects, and crypto companies within GCC countries to establish strategic partnerships.</p>\n<p>Conduct Market Research: Analyse the crypto and DeFi landscape in the GCC countries, identifying trends, opportunities, and potential risks to inform strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>Lead Face-to-Face Meetings: Organise and participate in direct meetings with key people, to discuss collaboration opportunities.</p>\n<p>Develop and Implement Business Strategies: Create and execute strategies to expand Fraxtal Chain’s presence in the UAE, targeting key industry players and positioning the platform for growth.</p>\n<p>Build Relationships with Relocating Companies: Focus on companies from the UK and Europe that are moving to Dubai, establishing Fraxtal Chain as a key partner in their transition.</p>\n<p>Enhance Brand Visibility: Represent Fraxtal Chain at industry events, conferences, and meetups in Dubai and the UAE to increase brand recognition and network with potential partners.</p>\n<p>Report on Progress: Provide regular updates to the executive team on the status of business development efforts, including partnership successes, challenges, and market insights. Also work closely with the Head of Community Development.</p>\n<p>Drive Ecosystem Growth: Work to integrate new DeFi protocols and applications onto Fraxtal Chain, by visiting the crypto hubs, expanding the ecosystem’s functionality and user base.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strategic Partnerships: Establish at least 3 key strategic partnerships with leading DeFi protocols and blockchain projects within the first 3 months that will use Fraxlend and pair with Frax pools on curve.</li>\n<li>Ecosystem Expansion: Onboard at least 3 new DeFi protocols onto Fraxtal Chain within the first 3 months, increasing the platform’s functionality and TVL.</li>\n<li>Brand Visibility: Represent Fraxtal Chain at a minimum of 3 industry events, focusing on networking and promotion to boost brand recognition. Secure media coverage and build relationships with key industry players to enhance the platform’s visibility and reputation.</li>\n<li>Growth Metrics: Achieve a 30% increase in Fraxtal Chain’s user base and a 20% increase in TVL within the first 3 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Previous Successes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CVX5 Group Leadership: As a core member of the CVX5 group, I have played a key role in driving strategic decisions that have led to significant growth in the Curve/Convex ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Frax Community Engagement: My early investment and active participation in the Frax community have provided me with deep insights into the DeFi space, allowing me to contribute to the platform’s success.</li>\n<li>Binance Affiliate Success: As an early user and referral affiliate member of Binance, I contributed to the platform’s rapid growth and adoption during its early stages by referring thousands of people to the exchange.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Salary</strong></p>\n<p>4K Frax distributed every two weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel Expenses</strong></p>\n<p>Travel expenses will be covered on an ad hoc basis for specific events and meetings that require in-person attendance.</p>\n<p>This includes:</p>\n<p>Flights: Economy class airfare will be covered for necessary travel to events, conferences, or partner meetings.</p>\n<p>Accommodation: Reasonable hotel expenses will be covered for the duration of approved trips.</p>\n<p>Ground transportation: Costs for taxis, ride-sharing services, or public transit to/from airports and event venues will be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Per diem: A daily allowance will be provided to cover meals and incidental expenses during approved travel.</p>\n<p>To request coverage of travel expenses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Submit a brief proposal outlining the event/meeting details and expected outcomes</li>\n<li>Obtain approval from the Frax Finance team prior to booking</li>\n<li>Submit receipts and an expense report for reimbursement after the trip expense report for reimbursement after the trip</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goal is to be judicious with travel expenses while ensuring in-person representation at key events that can drive meaningful partnerships and ecosystem growth. Virtual meetings will be utilised when possible to minimise costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Commitment</strong></p>\n<p>37.5 hours of dedicated time per week. Does not include additional time spent after hours meetings and if support ASEAN regions, which will require a lot of travel.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract Terms</strong></p>\n<p>Duration: A 3-month probationary period.</p>\n<p>Review: Re-apply directly with Frax Finance at the end of the term if the Frax Finance team is satisfied with the results.</p>\n<p><strong>Closing Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Today, I signed up for the Frax Governance Forum and am excited to make my first post here. Some of you may have seen my posts on X (Twitter), where I’ve been actively supporting Frax for years. I’ve been rallying votes for Snapshot from Convex and Clever lockers on Telegram, recently helping the latest [Frax] [FIP-398] reach quorum.</p>\n<p>This role differs from [Head of Community Development] as it involves visiting offices and traveling to meet with teams directly. My focus will be on understanding their projects firsthand and exploring how FRAX can benefit. It’s a more hands-on, on-the-ground role compared to an online presence.</p>\n<p>As a crypto enthusiast since 2017 and an early investor in Frax, I have closely followed the evolution of the DeFi space, particularly within the Curve, Convex and Frax ecosystem. My experience as a core member of CVX5 and my deep understanding of the challenges faced by new protocols and DAOs have equipped me with the insights necessary to drive growth and innovation within Frax.</p>\n<p>With Frax emerging as one of the leaders in DeFi and the recent launch of Fraxtal, I believe the creation of a Head of Ecosystem Development role is essential. My proposal focuses on engaging with DeFi protocols and crypto companies, particularly in the rapidly growing GCC region, with the potential to expand to ASEAN markets.</p>\n<p>As Dubai continues to attract top talent and crypto enterprises, the GCC Ecosystem Lead will play a pivotal role in forging strategic partnerships, enhancing liquidity, and driving the growth of Fraxtal Chain. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Frax’s success and look forward to working closely with the community to achieve our shared goals.</p>\n<p>I have taken feedback from some FRAX core team members before creating this proposal.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/MrKKhann\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@MrKKhann</a></p>\n            <p><small>8 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/head-of-ecosystem-development/3257\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/head-of-ecosystem-development/3257","pubDate":"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 06:26:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3257"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/head-of-ecosystem-development/3257.rss","#text":"Head of Ecosystem Development"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP - 402] Create new ETH+ Fraxlend pairs","dc:creator":"MichaelHenry","category":"Fraxlend","description":"<p><strong>Authors:</strong><br>\nMichael Henry</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>\nPropose the creation of 2 new Fraxlend pairs on the Ethereum Mainnet: ETH+/FRAX and ETH+/frxETH</p>\n<p><strong>Pair 1 Details:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fraxlend Pair Name 1:</strong> ETH+/frxETH Variable Rate V2</li>\n<li><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum Mainnet</li>\n<li><strong>Max Loan-to-Value (LTV)</strong>: 90%</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pair 2 Details:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fraxlend Pair Name 1:</strong> ETH+/FRAX Variable Rate V2</li>\n<li><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum Mainnet</li>\n<li><strong>Max Authorized Allocation:</strong> $5,000,000 FRAX</li>\n<li><strong>Max Loan-to-Value (LTV)</strong>: 85% (consistent with existing sfrxETH/USDC pair)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Background and Motivation:</strong><br>\nETHPlus is diversified ETH LST currently backed by 1/3rd sfrxEth, 1/3 wstEth, and 1/3rd rEth.

To address this, we propose adding LFXB2027 as a new exit option, offering liquidity providers more flexibility while maintaining the integrity and stability of the Frax ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-6941-proposal-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6941-proposal-details-4\"></a>Proposal Details</h1>\n<p>This approach offers liquidity providers a way to exit their positions while maintaining their investment within the Frax ecosystem, ensuring the protocol’s stability and growth. The following points are important to note about this proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pricing Based on Underlying Assets:</strong> The pricing for the locked liquidity will be based on the current price of the underlying assets at the time of the exchange.</li>\n<li><strong>Exchange with LFXB2027:</strong> Locked liquidity can be exchanged for LFXB2027 at the auction price prevailing at the time of the exchange. An LP that wishes to migrate can sign the migration transaction on the Ethereum mainnet and move their LP token/NFT to the protocol to receive LFXB2027 tokens directly to the same address on the Fraxtal mainnet.</li>\n<li><strong>Extra Option Alongside FXB2029:</strong> It is important to emphasize that LFXB2027 is being introduced as an additional option. Liquidity providers still have the choice to exit their locked positions through FXB2029, ensuring that they can select the exit strategy that best suits their needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Designated Locked Liquidity for Exchange:</strong> Only certain designated pools will be eligible for this exchange option, but this list can be expanded through the governance process.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pool</th>\n<th>Gauge Address</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/USDC</td>\n<td>0x3EF26504dbc8Dd7B7aa3E97Bc9f3813a9FC0B4B0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/DAI</td>\n<td>0xF22471AC2156B489CC4a59092c56713F813ff53e</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li><strong>Option to Retain LPs:</strong> Liquidity providers will have the option to either exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 or LFXB2027 or retain their current locked positions.</li>\n<li>No Ragequit Fee: There will be no Ragequit fee for liquidity providers choosing this exchange method, ensuring a cost-effective transition.</li>\n<li><strong>FXTL points:</strong> Migrators that receive LFXB2027 for their positions will be entitled to all FXTL points multipliers for all LFXB2027 holders, making it a high-yield opportunity within the Frax ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>TimedLocker for FXBs:</strong> The TimedLocker allows liquidity providers to stake their FXB tokens in exchange for fixed-rate FXS rewards, with the total amount of FXB stakable being capped. Locked positions are transferable as vault tokens, enabling users to sell or transfer their stakes without waiting for the lock period to end. Once the set ending timestamp is reached, all positions become unlockable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-6941-voting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6941-voting-5\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Approve the option for liquidity providers to exchange their locked liquidity for LFXB2027 at the auction price.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-396-adding-lfxb2027-as-an-option-for-locked-liquidity-exit/3242\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-396-adding-lfxb2027-as-an-option-for-locked-liquidity-exit/3242","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:16:18 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3242"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-396-adding-lfxb2027-as-an-option-for-locked-liquidity-exit/3242.rss","#text":"[FIP - 396] Adding LFXB2027 as an Option for Locked Liquidity Exit"},"filter":true},{"title":"[FIP - 397] Frax Finance Annual Budget Request (2024 - 2025)","dc:creator":"amirnader","category":"FIPs","description":"<h3><a name=\"p-6931-authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-authors-1\"></a>Authors</h3>\n<p>Frax Core Team</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6931-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-summary-2\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal seeks to authorize a revised maximum annual budget of <strong>4,100,000 FRAX</strong> for Frax Finance for the fiscal year 2024-2025. The revised budget reflects significant cuts across various categories to ensure financial prudence while continuing to support essential operations and initiatives. The budget is intended to cover four key categories: Development &amp; Operation, Security, Legal &amp; Compliance, and Fraxtal Growth under the Fraxtal Builders Program. Please note that this is a maximum cap, and it is highly likely that not all of it will be used, as we only spent 5,123,990 FRAX last year out of the 9,000,000 FRAX budget that we had during the last fiscal year.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6931-background-and-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-background-and-motivation-3\"></a>Background and motivation</h2>\n<p>As Frax Finance continues to grow and evolve, this budget supports our core operations while enabling strategic growth within the Fraxtal ecosystem. The allocation focuses on maintaining our development and operational capacity, ensuring security, managing legal and compliance obligations, and selectively supporting key initiatives within the Fraxtal ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6931-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-details-4\"></a>Details</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6931-budget-categories-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-budget-categories-5\"></a>Budget Categories</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Development and Operation:</strong> This budget will be used to cover the costs associated with the development and operation of the Frax Finance protocol. This could include salaries for developers, costs of new feature development, maintenance costs, infrastructure costs, and other operational expenses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security (Audits and Bug Bounty):</strong> This budget is allocated to maintaining the security of the Frax Finance protocol. This includes the costs of regular security audits by external firms, running a bug bounty program to incentivize the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities and other measures to ensure the safety and trust of our community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Legal and Compliance:</strong> This budget covers legal and compliance costs to ensure that Frax Finance operates within the legal framework. This could include fees for legal counsel, regulatory compliance costs, potential legal disputes, and other related expenses. Notably, Frax Finance has not encountered any significant legal issues to date, and last year, we spent less than 5% of the allotted legal budget. This allocation remains in place to ensure we are prepared for any unforeseen legal requirements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fraxtal Ecosystem Grants (Fraxtal Builders Program):</strong> This new budget category aims to support the growth of the Fraxtal ecosystem through the Fraxtal Builders Program. Although limited, this budget supports critical initiatives within the Fraxtal ecosystem, focusing on strategic growth and development. And it can be boosted by allocating Frax Finance grants from Superchain grant programs.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6931-budget-allocation-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-budget-allocation-6\"></a>Budget Allocation</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Budget Share Percentage</th>\n<th>Proposed Budget (2024 - 2025)</th>\n<th>Frax Finance Latest Annual Budget (2023 - 2024)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Development and Operation</td>\n<td>73.2%</td>\n<td>$3,000,000</td>\n<td>$3,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Security</td>\n<td>9.8%</td>\n<td>$400,000</td>\n<td>$1,400,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grants</td>\n<td>0.0%</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$600,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reserve Emergency Fund</td>\n<td>0.0%</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$1,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Legal and Compliance</td>\n<td>12.2%</td>\n<td>$500,000</td>\n<td>$3,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fraxtal Ecosystem Grants</td>\n<td>4.9%</td>\n<td>$200,000</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$4,100,000</td>\n<td>$9,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-6931-additional-notes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6931-additional-notes-7\"></a>Additional Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This proposal represents the maximum caps for each category, not necessarily the exact amounts that will be used.</li>\n<li>This proposal does not cover the costs of liquidity incentivization.

In this scenario, the merchant fully funds the rewards.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, users will always be earning cash back in $FXS.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/original/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/5MNjJpUDBHut3vVunb1SH6XxdGu.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.43\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926_2_690x290.jpeg\" alt=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.43\" data-base62-sha1=\"5MNjJpUDBHut3vVunb1SH6XxdGu\" width=\"690\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926_2_690x290.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926_2_1035x435.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/original/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"363C4C\"></a></div><br>\nScreenshot when boosted rates are available.<p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/original/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pS9idoEOL8JGuLSHC519MbuynJj.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.47\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445_2_690x353.jpeg\" alt=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.47\" data-base62-sha1=\"pS9idoEOL8JGuLSHC519MbuynJj\" width=\"690\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445_2_690x353.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445_2_1035x529.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/original/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"434750\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Screenshot when boosted rates are not available.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6843-how-can-a-white-labeled-shop-benefit-frax-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6843-how-can-a-white-labeled-shop-benefit-frax-2\"></a><strong>How can a white-labeled shop benefit Frax?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Powering Transactions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase user engagement and value.</li>\n<li>A great way to get new users onboarded to Frax and Fraxtal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fiat Integration:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seamless integration of fiat currency into tokens, enhancing token utility and value.

Throughout all of this, Frax can identify valuable, active ecosystem users with a real-world use case. This data can be leveraged in any marketing campaign Frax executes moving forward to continue to capture market share among users.</p>\n<p>Moso plans to distribute loyalty points to users in parallel with the higher cash-back rates in $FXS. Loyalty points can be earned by users continuing to visit the Frax Shop to Earn page daily. To include additional gamification methods, points will also be distributed from purchases at retailers and for engaging with different Frax ecosystem dapps/DeFi integrations.</p>\n<p>Moso also acts as a gateway for users to discover Frax’s best applications and DeFi integrations. Moso will work with the Frax team to understand which applications to highlight on the Frax Shop alongside retailers.</p>\n<p>By engaging with dapps and executing an on-chain action, the user will qualify for points and cash back. Cash-back rewards by engaging with Fraxtal dapps are TBD as that discussion will take place with the application since it revolves around the kickback the dapp can give in return for the conversion. This is the perfrect fit for dapps who already have a referral program in place or are in need of a referral program.</p>\n<p>Each shopping trip will power up to three on-chain transactions on Fraxtal for users engaging with the Frax Shop. Fraxtal would be the first L2 ecosystem to be fully integrated into Moso.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user claims $FXS on Fraxtal through Moso to claim their cash back</li>\n<li>The user claims points on-chain via Fraxtal as a reward on Moso</li>\n<li>The user executes a transaction on a Fraxtal dapp through Moso</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/original/2X/7/70f0c8fe2ee53aa0ef9642f0deee41fabb24cc02.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/g77m6bLuefZPTBDEXAHZKDceIEO.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.12.30\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/7/70f0c8fe2ee53aa0ef9642f0deee41fabb24cc02_2_690x339.jpeg\" alt=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.12.30\" data-base62-sha1=\"g77m6bLuefZPTBDEXAHZKDceIEO\" width=\"690\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/7/70f0c8fe2ee53aa0ef9642f0deee41fabb24cc02_2_690x339.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/7/70f0c8fe2ee53aa0ef9642f0deee41fabb24cc02_2_1035x508.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex031/uploads/frax1/original/2X/7/70f0c8fe2ee53aa0ef9642f0deee41fabb24cc02.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"262B32\"></a></div><br>\nReference the screenshot for how Space ID was included in the Galxe Shop.
