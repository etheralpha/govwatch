Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.</p>\n<p>Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.</p>\n<p>Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO on Fraxtal is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-6864-voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6864-voting-4\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Authorize Fraxlend AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the mentioned Fraxlend pair with the mentioned max authorized allocation.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-new-pair-on-fraxtal-ezeth-frax/3192\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-new-pair-on-fraxtal-ezeth-frax/3192","pubDate":"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 21:33:26 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3192"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-3xx-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-new-pair-on-fraxtal-ezeth-frax/3192.rss","#text":"[FIP - 3XX] Authorize Fraxlend AMO for new pair on Fraxtal (ezETH/FRAX)"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP-3XX] Frax AMO Integration on Morpho with USD0++/FRAX and Curve LP USD0/USD0++/FRAX as available markets","dc:creator":"Adli","category":"AMOs","description":"<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>\n<p>Usual Labs Team, 0xloth (Morpho), MEV Capital Team</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to establish an Algorithmic Market Operation (AMO) utilizing Morpho for lending and liquidity management. Specifically, it aims to first integrate USD0++ (0x35D8949372D46B7a3D5A56006AE77B215fc69bC0) and Curve LP USD0/USD0++ markets as collateral on Morpho to support Frax as borrowing assets, enhancing the utility and stability of both assets in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Background and Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>Morpho is a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol that optimizes yield for lenders and reduces borrowing costs for borrowers by having new rate computation functions. This integration aligns with our commitment to decentralization, transparency, and financial empowerment.</p>\n<p>MEV Capital is a DeFi asset manager that already has more than $300M in assets under management and is already curator on Symbiotic and Mellow. Their knowledge in DeFi is now clearly established, making them a natural choice to curate Usual’s Morpho vaults. As such, MEV Capital will be at the disposal of Frax to co-curate the Frax AMO.</p>\n<p>Usual is a new decentralized stablecoins issuer that accepts RWAs as collateral (USYC by Hashnote). USD0++ is a liquid bond token that represents locked USD0, accruing pills (the points of Usual) over time. The USD0/USD0++ Curve LP market provides deep liquidity and low slippage for stablecoin swaps while also accruing pills and fees. By leveraging these assets as collateral within Morpho, we can create a more dynamic and robust lending environment, attracting larger borrowers and creating growth across our ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal involves minting FRAX and depositing it into a designated Morpho lending market (i.e USD0++/FRAX and CurveLP(USD0/USD0++)/FRAX). The goal is to provide sufficient liquidity for FRAX in order to overcome supply-side shortages in lending, thereby fostering growth on the borrowing side. By kickstarting the market for larger borrowers, we aim to create a more dynamic and robust lending environment for FRAX on Morpho and deeper connection in the short term with Usual. Oracle choice will be decided with the Frax team.</p>\n<p>Usual will incentivize the FRAX side with the same conditions as all other lending markets. (Like <a href=\"https://app.morpho.org/market?id=0xb48bb53f0f2690c71e8813f2dc7ed6fca9ac4b0ace3faa37b4a8e5ece38fa1a2&amp;network=mainnet&amp;morphoPrice=0.75\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USD0++/USDC</a> and <a href=\"https://app.morpho.org/market?id=0x864c9b82eb066ae2c038ba763dfc0221001e62fc40925530056349633eb0a259&amp;network=mainnet&amp;morphoPrice=0.75\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CurveLP (USD0/USD0++)/USDC)</a> Those pills will be given to the Frax Treasury.

The platform is designed to cater to both web2 and web3 users.</p>\n<p>Moso enables users to shop at any supported web2 retailer such as Walmart, Marriott, and eBay to earn in the crypto asset of their choice. Additionally, Moso offers a white-labeled shopping experience for web3 brands where users can earn up to 100% cash back or more in the ecosystem’s native token. <a href=\"https://shop.galxe.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Galxe Shop</a>, powered by Moso, has seen <strong>$200,000+</strong> in purchases, registered <strong>75,000+</strong> sign-ups, and driven <strong>$100,000+</strong> in $GAL rewards back to users. The rewards are partially funded by both the merchant and Galxe.</p>\n<p>Moso aims to work directly with Frax to provide $FXS cash-back rewards in a Frax Shop, powered By Moso. This partnership will let Moso implement a Fraxtal integration to the Moso Shop Marketplace with the purpose of $FXS being distributed and claimed on Fraxtal as cash-back rewards. This will result in an on-chain transaction on Fraxtal each time a claim is made.</p>\n<p>Moso is thrilled about the opportunity to integrate deeply into the Frax ecosystem as the only retail shop to earn cash back experience fully distributed in $FXS.</p>\n<p><strong>How are the cash-back rewards distributed?</strong></p>\n<p>Moso requests a token grant from Frax of up to $75K USD in $FXS to boost cash-back rates on top of the web2 merchants’ fixed cash-back rates being paid to Moso for driving purchases to these retailers.</p>\n<p>Increased rates will only sometimes be available. Boosted cash-back rates of as much as 100% back in $FXS at selected merchants will be deployed from time to time allowing users to find amazing shopping deals that they otherwise would not have access to. We expect this grant to last Moso at least 6 months.</p>\n<p>When boosted rates are not being deployed, web2 merchants distribute cash-back to Moso. Moso converts the fiat cash-back to $FXS on the backend for distribution to eligible users. Amazingly, users will always be earning cash back in $FXS since the rewards are partially funded by both the merchant and Frax.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/5MNjJpUDBHut3vVunb1SH6XxdGu.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.43\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926_2_690x290.jpeg\" alt=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.43\" data-base62-sha1=\"5MNjJpUDBHut3vVunb1SH6XxdGu\" width=\"690\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926_2_690x290.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926_2_1035x435.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/2/288eed48a4e3f93693fbd4e56ef7b27b88827926.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"363C4C\"></a></div><br>\nScreenshot when boosted rates are available.<p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pS9idoEOL8JGuLSHC519MbuynJj.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.47\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445_2_690x353.jpeg\" alt=\"photo_2024-07-30 11.10.47\" data-base62-sha1=\"pS9idoEOL8JGuLSHC519MbuynJj\" width=\"690\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445_2_690x353.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445_2_1035x529.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/b/b5555acf4f971975b1fb671877b09f1c4e8d6445.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"434750\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Screenshot when boosted rates are not available.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6843-how-can-a-white-labeled-shop-benefit-frax-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#p-6843-how-can-a-white-labeled-shop-benefit-frax-2\"></a><strong>How can a white-labeled shop benefit Frax?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Powering Transactions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase user engagement and value.</li>\n<li>A great way to get new users onboarded to Frax and Fraxtal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fiat Integration:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seamless integration of fiat currency into tokens, enhancing token utility and value.

Throughout all of this, Frax can identify valuable, active ecosystem users with a real-world use case. This data can be leveraged in any marketing campaign Frax executes moving forward to continue to capture market share among users.</p>\n<p>Moso plans to distribute loyalty points to users in parallel with the higher cash-back rates in $FXS. Loyalty points can be earned by users continuing to visit the Frax Shop to Earn page daily. To include additional gamification methods, points will also be distributed from purchases at retailers and for engaging with different Frax ecosystem dapps/DeFi integrations.</p>\n<p>Moso also acts as a gateway for users to discover Frax’s best applications and DeFi integrations. Moso will work with the Frax team to understand which applications to highlight on the Frax Shop alongside retailers.</p>\n<p>By engaging with dapps and executing an on-chain action, the user will qualify for points and cash back. Cash-back rewards by engaging with Fraxtal dapps are TBD as that discussion will take place with the application since it revolves around the kickback the dapp can give in return for the conversion. This is the perfrect fit for dapps who already have a referral program in place or are in need of a referral program.</p>\n<p>Each shopping trip will power up to three on-chain transactions on Fraxtal for users engaging with the Frax Shop.

The absence of both stablecoin alternatives and USD yield-bearing assets on TRON presents a great opportunity for FRAX and sFRAX to shine in this market.

The goal is to enhance diversification, optimize returns, and support the growth of the Fraxtal network.</p>\n<p>The proposed allocation caps for frxETH Curve AMO are:</p>\n<p>Current Asset Allocation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ETH, WETH: Max 100% Min 50%</li>\n<li>wstETH, stETH: Max 50% Min 0%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Proposed Asset Allocation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ETH, WETH: Max 100% Min 0%</li>\n<li>wstETH, stETH: Max 100% Min 0%</li>\n<li>ezETH, pzETH: Max 20% Min 0%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means the team can allocate up to the specified maximum percentages to the respective pools if deemed advantageous.</p>\n<p>It is important to clarify that the min/max caps specified in this proposal are separate from the “withholding ratio.” The caps are not intended to suggest that we are directing 100% of all ETH minted from frxETH to the AMO. The withholding ratio of ETH is a separate parameter. These max/min caps are put in place to govern the portion of the withheld ETH that will be allocated to the pools within the AMO. more information about the current frxETH balance sheet can be found in <a href=\"https://facts.frax.finance/frxeth/balance-sheet\">Frax Facts</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"background-and-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#background-and-motivation-3\"></a>Background and Motivation</h1>\n<p>Automated Market Operations (AMO) make Frax Finance one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism. In Frax Ethereum, most of our Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) resides on Curve, so setting clear allocation caps is crucial for managing our liquidity effectively and transparently in frxETH Curve AMO.</p>\n<p>Adding ezETH and pzETH to the portfolio offers significant value by providing another assets that aligns with our goals of optimizing returns and enhancing liquidity.

Users can deposit native ETH or LSTs and receive ezETH. It is a reward-bearing token similar to cTokens, and the underlying restaking positions earn rewards reflected in the ezETH price. Rewards are expected in ETH, USDC, and Actively Validated Services (AVSs) reward tokens. This means the value of ezETH increases relative to the underlying LSTs as it earns more rewards in AVS tokens. Withdrawals take at least 7 days due to EigenLayer unstaking requirements, and transfers are facilitated through supplying liquidity or selling ezETH on <a href=\"https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659\">Balancer</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"about-pzeth-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#about-pzeth-5\"></a>About pzETH</h2>\n<p>pzETH is a liquid restaking token representing a user’s restaked position within the Symbiotic ecosystem. Users can deposit stETH, wstETH, wETH, or ETH to receive pzETH. It offers a higher yield than traditional ETH staking by securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs) through restaking. pzETH can be withdrawn from day one and is fully redeemable for the underlying restaked collateral.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-details-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#proposal-details-6\"></a>Proposal Details</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Authorize Holding ezETH: Allow the frxETH AMO to hold ezETH as one of its asset types.</li>\n<li>Set Allocation Caps: Establish the following maximum and minimum allocation caps for the frxETH AMO:\n<ul>\n<li>ETH/WETH Pools: Max 100%, Min 0%</li>\n<li>wstETH/stETH Pools: Max 100%, Min 0%</li>\n<li>ezETH/pzETH Pools: Max 20%, Min 0%</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Deploy Assets on Fraxtal: Allocate a portion of the frxETH AMO to be deployed within the Fraxtal ecosystem.

Despite the strong fundamentals, “protocol’s meme premium” (AKA: valuation) is at a local all-time low. Based on my personal experience in branding/positioning/strategy from corporate, and the feedback I have gotten from people, a significant contributing factor to this local low is the lack of effective branding and marketing strategies that distinctly resonate with both B2C and B2B audiences (B2B in DeFi content is protocol-to-protocol). This proposal addresses these issues by recommending a dual-brand strategy and an enhanced user experience for targeted audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong><br>\nFrax Finance is currently missing out on the meme premium and broader market appeal due to its complex and professional UI, which might be intimidating for average users. This complexity also dilutes the brand’s message and reduces its appeal to potential investors and users who prefer a more straightforward interface.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong><br>\n<strong>1. Brand Segmentation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>B2C Brand:</strong> Develop a separate, consumer-friendly brand for Frax Finance’s retail products. This brand should focus on simplicity, ease of use, and a clean, vibrant interface. Naming of B2C brand yet to be decided but something synonymous to “Frax Lite”.</li>\n<li><strong>B2B Brand:</strong> Maintain a professional, detailed, and data-rich interface for institutional clients and advanced users. This brand should highlight the technical superiority and comprehensive services offered by Frax Finance. Naming of B2B brand yet to be decided but something synonymous to “Frax Pro”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Enhancements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>B2C Interface:</strong> Implement a clean, intuitive UI with easy navigation and a focus on key “normie” actions (e.g., staking, lending, swapping).</li>\n<li><strong>B2B Interface:</strong> Retain a detailed and data-driven interface with advanced features and analytics. Ensure that professional users can access all necessary information and tools without clutter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Content Strategy / Educational Videos (especially applicable to B2C “normie” users):</strong><br>\nVideo content is a powerful tool for educating and engaging users. It allows for complex concepts to be broken down into easy-to-understand visuals and narratives. Creating a YouTube channel with professionally made tutorial videos explaining how to use Frax Finance products can significantly improve user onboarding and retention.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Branding Example and Inspiration:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pendle Finance:</strong> Pendle Finance has successfully created a user-friendly brand that appeals to both retail and institutional clients.</li>\n<li><strong>Merit Circle’s Beam:</strong> Beam was a great rebranding for an L2 launch by Merit Circle. This can be a model for how Frax Finance can reinvent its image and appeal to a broader audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nex steps:</strong><br>\nIf the proposal is passed, a list of potential agencies will be proposed and discussed with the Frax core team. Potential agencies could include firms like IDEO, Frog, or local agencies specializing in fintech and blockchain. If this proposal is approved, I am ready to take ownership of the project, get in touch with the core team, contact companies for quotes, and oversee the project in alignment with the core team. I am also prepared to develop a full-fledged project plan while working with the agency.</p>\n<p><strong>My background:</strong><br>\nI have 7 years of experience in strategy and management consulting, having led rebranding and repositioning efforts for numerous products from a corporate strategy standpoint. Additionally, I have been a DeFi user for 4 years and involved in the crypto space for 5 years. This proposal is based on extensive feedback from numerous “normies” to whom I have introduced Frax, and their insights have been invaluable in further shaping this plan.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Additional note:</strong><br>\nAn important consideration not addressed in this proposal but nonetheless significant is the ambiguity surrounding the monetization of $FXTL. While it is anticipated by the Frax community members that the design of $FXTL monetization will mitigate a potential short-term dump, the current lack of clarity has led to market concerns. Specifically, there is a prevailing assumption that FXS tokens may be sold off once they are awarded to $FXTL holders, potentially creating the current sell pressure on the governance token.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/capture-meme-premium-with-distinct-b2c-and-b2b-branding-strategies/3159\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/capture-meme-premium-with-distinct-b2c-and-b2b-branding-strategies/3159","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 09:16:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3159"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/capture-meme-premium-with-distinct-b2c-and-b2b-branding-strategies/3159.rss","#text":"Capture \"Meme Premium\" with Distinct B2C and B2B Branding Strategies"},"filter":false},{"title":"[FIP - 380] Create weETH/FRAX Fraxlend Pair on Ethereum Mainnet and Authorize AMO Allocation","dc:creator":"Westwood","category":"Fraxlend","description":"<p><strong>Authors:</strong><br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/u/westwood\">@Westwood</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Propose the creation of a new Fraxlend pair on the Ethereum mainnet: weETH/FRAX.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"details-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#details-2\"></a>Details</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fraxlend Pair Name:</strong> weETH/FRAX - Variable Rate V2</li>\n<li><strong>Chain:</strong> Ethereum Mainnet</li>\n<li><strong>Max Authorized Allocation:</strong> 10,000,000 FRAX</li>\n<li><strong>Max Loan-to-Value (LTV):</strong> To be decided by the development team</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"background-and-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#background-and-motivation-3\"></a>Background and Motivation</h2>\n<p>Fraxlend is a lending platform that enables the creation of markets between pairs of ERC-20 tokens.

Each pair functions as an isolated, permission-less market, allowing users to engage in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is designed to generate new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.</p>\n<p>Automated Market Operations (AMOs) enhance FRAX’s capabilities as a leading stablecoin protocol by offering maximum flexibility and opportunities without compromising its core stability mechanisms. To date, multiple AMOs have been deployed on platforms such as Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari.</p>\n<p>Introducing the PEPE/FRAX pair into the Fraxlend AMO on Ethereum Mainnet aligns with this strategic vision. It will facilitate the minting of FRAX, secured by over-collateralized debt, further strengthening the ecosystem. The choice of PEPE as an asset is based on its growing popularity and liquidity, which can attract a broader user base to Fraxlend. Allowing the development team to decide the LTV ensures that the risk parameters are set appropriately based on market conditions and risk assessments.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidity-profile-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#liquidity-profile-4\"></a>Liquidity Profile</h2>\n<p>The liquidity profile of the PEPE token is a crucial factor in the decision to introduce the PEPE/FRAX pair.

To address this concern and provide a flexible solution, we propose an exchange option to migrate the locked liquidity to FXBs, specifically FXB2029. This provides immediate liquidity to exit LPs starting with the older gauges while also keeping TVL within the Frax &amp; Fraxtal ecosystem, an overall value add for all parties. FXB2029 tokens are liquid with high incentives for liquidity providers, massive FXTL points boosts, and migrators can exit these tokens should they want to leave the ecosystem for any reason by selling them on-chain in Curve pools and other venues and in no way required to hold them until maturity.</p>\n<p>FXB tokens are simple, trustless tokens that resemble a zero-coupon bond that converts to the FRAX stablecoin on maturity. FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXB tokens are only convertible to FRAX stablecoins; they do not guarantee FRAX peg, FRAX value, or yield/interest denominated in any other asset except FRAX.</p>\n<p>By migrating to FXBs, liquidity providers will have an alternative means to manage their deployed capital within the Frax ecosystem, providing them with the flexibility they have requested while ensuring the protocol maintains its needed locked liquidity.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#proposal-details-4\"></a>Proposal Details</h1>\n<p>This approach offers liquidity providers a way to exit their positions while maintaining their investment within the Frax ecosystem, ensuring the protocol’s stability and growth. The following points are important to note about this proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pricing Based on Underlying Assets:</strong> The pricing for the locked liquidity will be based on the current price of the underlying assets at the time of the exchange.</li>\n<li><strong>Exchange with FXB2029:</strong> Locked liquidity can only be exchanged for FXB2029 at the auction price prevailing at the time of the exchange. The auction price has a floor price of .794 at the time of this proposal &amp; it is expected to remain at this floor price. An LP that wishes to migrate can sign the migration transaction on the Ethereum mainnet and move their LP token/NFT to the protocol to receive FXB2029 tokens directly to the same address on the Fraxtal mainnet. They are then free to do whatever they wish with their FXB2029 tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Designated Locked Liquidity for Exchange:</strong> Only certain designated pools will be eligible for this exchange option, but this list can be expanded through the governance process.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pool</th>\n<th>Gauge Address</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/USDC</td>\n<td>0x3EF26504dbc8Dd7B7aa3E97Bc9f3813a9FC0B4B0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniswap V3 FRAX/DAI</td>\n<td>0xF22471AC2156B489CC4a59092c56713F813ff53e</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li><strong>Option to Retain LPs:</strong> Liquidity providers will have the option to either exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 or retain their current locked positions.</li>\n<li><strong>No Ragequit Fee:</strong> There will be no Ragequit fee for liquidity providers choosing this exchange method, ensuring a cost-effective transition.</li>\n<li><strong>FXTL points &amp; incentives:</strong> Migrators that receive FXB2029 for their positions will be entitled to all FXTL points multipliers &amp; yield opportunities that are available and upcoming for all FXB2029 holders, making it one of the most high-yield opportunities within the Frax ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-5\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Approve the option for liquidity providers to exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 at the auction price.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>14 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-379-locked-liquidity-standard-exit/3145\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-379-locked-liquidity-standard-exit/3145","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Jul 2024 23:28:44 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3145"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-379-locked-liquidity-standard-exit/3145.rss","#text":"[FIP - 379] Locked Liquidity Standard Exit"},"filter":true},{"title":"[FIP - 377] Change veFXS Reward Distribution Token","dc:creator":"C2tP-C2tP","category":"FIPs","description":"<h1><a name=\"authors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#authors-1\"></a>Authors</h1>\n<p>C2tP<br>\nSam Kazemian</p>\n<h1><a name=\"summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#summary-2\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>There has been long discussions on how veFXS rewards should be distributed.

Curve has now switched to crvUSD as each crvUSD in distribution is equivalent to a crvUSD being lent out and creating fees.</p>\n<p>One possible choice for Frax could be sFrax. sFrax does a lot of work for the user, but not all that much is gained on the protocol level. This can be an okay tradeoff though if claiming continued to be on mainnet since gas costs are higher and thus times to claim could be much longer for most users.</p>\n<p>On Fraxtal however, gas costs are much less of an issue. Thus reward tokens should be more oriented for Protocol work. This is both good for the user in an indirect way, as well as users can withdraw and convert to something more oriented for their yield whenever they want.</p>\n<p>The best asset choice for the protocol to issue would thus be an FXB. The protocol makes revenue in the background while the frax is waiting to be matured. If users claim and convert the FXB on the market, the protocol still has the underlying working. FXBs themselves also are yield bearing for the user (albeit at probably a slower rate than sFrax).</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to change veFXS revenue to be distributed as a wrapped version of the FXB20291231 issued on Fraxtal. The FXS buyback as part of the FLE system will stay the same.</p>\n<p>The wrapper for this token will automatically use the underlying FXB as collateral in FraxLend and borrow frax for sFrax if interest rates are profitable. Users will gain compounded FXB tokens and can withdraw at any time.  FraxLend AMO will also gain some interest by lending to the FraxLend pair.</p>\n<p>Wrapper can be found here (<a href=\"https://github.com/convex-eth/frax-cvx-platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/fraxtal/cvxFXB.sol\" class=\"inline-onebox\">frax-cvx-platform/contracts/contracts/fraxtal/cvxFXB.sol at main · convex-eth/frax-cvx-platform · GitHub</a>) and is currently under audit. Audit must be cleared to satisfactory levels before being used as the veFXS reward token.</p>\n<p>As of note, the wrapper will contain a migration function to move underlying fxb to a different fxb type. The admin role for setting this migration will be held by the Frax comptroller multisig or Frax Governance.</p>\n<p>Also the current name of the token (cvxFXB) is subject to change if we or the Frax team decide on something better before deployment.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"fees-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#fees-3\"></a>Fees</h1>\n<p>There will be a standard market fee of 10% as a management fee.<br>\nThis fee is only applied to revenue gained via the borrowing aspect of the wrapper and in no way applies to underlying vefxs rewards.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-4\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<p>For: Change veFXS reward token distribution to the cvxFXB FXB wrapper.<br>\nAgainst: Do nothing.</p>\n            <p><small>15 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-377-change-vefxs-reward-distribution-token/3137\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-377-change-vefxs-reward-distribution-token/3137","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 04:18:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3137"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-377-change-vefxs-reward-distribution-token/3137.rss","#text":"[FIP - 377] Change veFXS Reward Distribution Token"},"filter":false},{"title":"Use FXTL to redistribute Fraxtal revenue to users (v2)","dc:creator":"wolfehr","category":"Governance Proposals","description":"<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/u/wolfehr\">@wolfehr</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraxtal is a new Frax product that will generate revenue via sequencer feeds and MEV.</li>\n<li>Frax will redistribute 20% of revenue back to users that add value to the ecosystem (as measured by flox blocksapce rewareds), with the remaining 80% going to veFXS and insurance (78/2 split).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Principals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The FXTL system should incentivize Fraxtal usage, Fraxtal TVL, and building/innovating on Fraxtal.</li>\n<li>Fraxtal’s revenue should be redistributed to users who add value to the ecosystem (as measured by FXTL).

However, if the majority feels emissions should be baked into the FXTL system long-term or we should include a short-term bootstrapping mechanism to kick start things included in this proposal, I can add it.

One initial conversion, then a ongoing FXTL conversion running theoretically forever.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Initial conversion.</strong><br>\nAt the one year mark of the launch of Fraxtal, have a opt-in event to convert the current FXTL points so far to FXS. The conversion will be weighted by amount of FXTL points opted in. Use 5 million FXS for this purpose. This will leave us with a market cap of 93 million FXS after the FPIS merger and the initial conversion is completed.</p>\n<p>The reason this event is opt-in is that there might be people who might want to try and game later weekly conversions, adding some game theory to the proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Ongoing FXTL conversion</strong><br>\nEvery year, earmark 1 million of FXS emissions for FXTL points conversion. Every week 19231 FXS is put into a pool. In the next week, people can deposit their FXTL points to redeem a percentage of this pool.</p>\n<p>1 million of yearly FXS emissions seems high. But it is important to remember that the FLE system if successful most likely will be able to absorb these emissions in the future. The proposal also gives ample runway (7 years), if the proposal does not prove successful. Hence new governance actions can be taken well before we reach the 100 million hardcap.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Extra</strong><br>\nAnother important discussion point is the introduction of a lock and multiplier system. This is my proposal for such a system.</p>\n<p>Min. No lock = 0.5x weight<br>\nMax. 4 years lock = 4x weight<br>\nLinear scaling between those options.</p>\n<p>Locking means that you will get more weight the week you are redeeming your FXTL points.

If this idea gains broad community support, it could potentially lead to significant gains for FXS, driven by improved governance and more focused utility.</p>\n<p>If passed, this proposal would require the Frax Core Developers (“the team”) to submit a further governance proposal for an FXTL token distribution that is completely separate from FXS and not convertible or dilutive to FXS supply in any way. The team would be required to submit a governance proposal for the full supply, allocation, time to tokenization, and details of FXTL no later than 90 days after passing.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Simplified Governance</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Streamlined Decision-Making</strong>: Separating FXTL from FXS could streamline governance by reducing the complexity associated with managing multiple functions under a single token. This separation would enable more straightforward, transparent, and efficient governance processes.</li>\n<li><strong>Focused Governance</strong>: With FXTL as a separate token, FXS holders can concentrate on decisions directly affecting FXS, while FXTL holders can focus on matters pertinent to FXTL. This specialization could lead to better-informed decisions and more effective governance overall.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Increased Utility</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Targeted Enhancements</strong>: A dedicated token for FXTL would enable more targeted enhancements and utility, catering specifically to FXTL holders. This could include exclusive features, staking rewards, and incentives designed to drive engagement and value within the FXTL ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility in Development</strong>: A separate FXTL token allows for more flexibility in developing and deploying features specific to FXTL without being constrained by the broader FXS framework.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Market Differentiation</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attracting Diverse Investors</strong>: Distinct tokens for different functionalities could attract more investors and users, thereby increasing the overall market performance of both FXTL and FXS. Investors specifically interested in the utility and potential of FXTL can invest in it directly without being influenced by FXS market dynamics.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Clarity</strong>: Clear differentiation between FXS and FXTL can enhance market clarity, helping potential investors and users understand the unique value propositions of each token.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Economic Synergy</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimized Token Economics</strong>: By tokenizing FXTL separately, the economic models of both tokens can be optimized to better serve their respective communities. This could lead to more robust and sustainable growth for both tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Mitigation</strong>: Segregating FXTL from FXS reduces the risk of one token’s issues adversely affecting the other, thus providing a more stable and resilient economic environment for both tokens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>FRAXTAL and the Importance of an Independent L2 Token</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>FRAXTAL Overview</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is FRAXTAL</strong>: FRAXTAL (FRAX’s Layer 2 solution) aims to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and improve the overall user experience for FRAX ecosystem participants.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefits of L2</strong>: As an L2 solution, FRAXTAL can process transactions faster and cheaper than the Ethereum mainnet, making it an essential component for the future growth and usability of the FRAX ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Need for a Separate Token</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operational Autonomy</strong>: An independent FXTL token would provide FRAXTAL with the operational autonomy needed to develop and expand without being tied to the broader FXS token’s governance and economic constraints.</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized Incentives</strong>: A separate token allows FRAXTAL to create specific incentives and reward mechanisms tailored to its unique needs and objectives, thereby fostering a vibrant and engaged community.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Security and Compliance</strong>: With its own token, FRAXTAL can implement security and compliance measures optimized for its specific environment, enhancing overall system integrity and trust.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Process</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Discussion</strong>: Open this proposal for community discussion on the FRAX forum to gauge interest and gather feedback.</li>\n<li><strong>Drafting Final Proposal</strong>: Based on the community’s feedback, revise the proposal for clarity and comprehensiveness.</li>\n<li><strong>Voting</strong>: Submit the final proposal for a vote by veFXS holders. As per governance protocols, any proposal must undergo a three-day discussion period followed by a five-day off-chain voting period on Snapshot, with results determined by a simple majority and a 7.2m veFXS quorum requirement.</li>\n<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: If approved, work with the core team to implement the tokenization and ensure a smooth transition and integration.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>\n<p>By tokenizing FXTL into a separate token, we can simplify governance, increase utility, and enhance market performance for FXTL and FXS. This strategic decision is aimed at fostering a more robust, efficient, and focused ecosystem for both tokens.

This proposal aims to make governance more effective while establishing clear and transparent expectations, with fairness that does not differentiate.</p>\n<p>Solve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This proposal makes sure users who are unhappy with their position have a clear way to get their funds/LP position back with standardized costs.</li>\n<li>It makes future governance for FRAX more effective with less need for discussion and less proposals</li>\n<li>It protects the interest of our protocols liquidity system with a standardized fee which is intended to make it unattractive to ragequit</li>\n<li>It protects the protocol from lowering the collateralization ratio below 100% from ragequit proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal does not in any way or form talk about unlocks, which is another topic best judged from case to case in regards to situation.</p>\n<p>We propose the following algorithmic solution for a standardized ragequit:<br>\n“USD value of LP position” × Multiplier = “virtual USD Value of Boosted Position”<br>\nL M B<br>\n“LP Staked + Boost [FraxStats]” × “LP Price [FraxStats]” = “virtual USD Value of entire Pool”<br>\nP A N<br>\nnote [FraxStats] refers to the value indicated by app.frax.finance for the equivalently named statistic of any given gauged LP pool during any given period.</p>\n<p>G = “virtual USD Value of Boosted Position” ÷ “virtual USD Value of entire Pool”<br>\nB N<br>\nG = decimal percentage (virtual) USD Value of position relative to (virtual) boosted value of entire pool<br>\nA = LP Price [FraxStats]<br>\nD = LP Amount Staked per position<br>\nL = USD Value of LP Position<br>\nL = A x D<br>\nM= (veFXS-stake-weight-boost + time-lock-boost)<br>\nM = Multiplier<br>\nP = “LP Staked + Boost”[FraxStats]<br>\nB = “virtual USD Value of Boosted Position”<br>\nB = L × M<br>\nP × A = “virtual USD Value of entire Pool”<br>\nP x A = N<br>\nG = (B ÷ N)<br>\nG = (L × M) ÷ (P × A)<br>\nR = FXS allocated to pool per epoch [FraxStats]<br>\nF = FXS Price per epoch [FraxStats]<br>\nF = cumulative avg FXS price of relative epochs (use 3 daily averages [morning/noon/night])<br>\nE = F^y × veFXS (user staked)<br>\nM = “FXS rewarded to LP Position per Epoch”<br>\nM = G × R<br>\nV = “USD Value of FXS rewarded to LP Position per Epoch”<br>\nV = M × F<br>\nV^n = M × F per epoch<br>\n^n = sequential numerical identity of epoch, NOT an exponent (used only as epoch identifier)<br>\n^y = most recent ^n<br>\nT = “Total USD Value of FXS received per (lifetime of) position”<br>\nT = (V^n) + (V^n) … + (V^y)<br>\nC = Function derived from<br>\nvalue of Collateral Ratio %<br>\nIf C=0 unlocks are not permitted.<br>\nC =<br>\n{ CR% ≥ 103% =1<br>\nCR% ≤ 103% = 0}</p>\n<p>Y = Days Remaining til unlock of LP Position<br>\nU = “USD Value of LP Position” – T<br>\nU = L – T<br>\nU = amount due to users after unlock, [post-fxs-repay, pre-fee] (no discount applied)</p>\n<p>D = USD fee discount for cvxFXS and veFXS stakers<br>\nD = (((days-since-veFXS(or cvxFXS)-lockup ÷ (365.25 × 4)) × 50)%) × E<br>\nD ≠ &gt;(50% × T)<br>\nX = Amount Owed minus Discount</p>\n<p>X= ((“Total USD Value of all FXS rewarded to LP” + “0.06844627% of (U) per Day of Lock Remaining[2.5% a year]”) minus D) × function of C</p>\n<p>X = ((T + ((((Y/1461)×10)%)U)) - D) × C<br>\nZ = L – X<br>\nZ = Amount received by User post fees + deductions</p>\n<p>Loop (Z - X) back through CR calculation to ensure CR% ≥ 103% before finalizing unlock</p>\n<p>We propose that all new gauges/locks have this option from start, so that this will be optional without going through governance. This means that contracts should have a easy to use front end for ragequitting, which may lead to more development work. The work for the front-end should be prioritized at the core teams discretion, to not distract for more short/mid term important matters. That may even mean a delay for new pairs to get the ragequit function. For old pairs, one have go through governance to enable a ragequit function. It is important to clearify that this proposal will still be relevant, and the terms outlined in this proposal will still apply in ragequitting of those old pairs. The proposals for old pairs will simply be if one should activate the ragequit function or not.</p>\n<p>We propose LP the protocol takes in fees from the ragequit be added to the FLE, so that the protocol can continue operating the pair or in other ways increase our revenue and liquidity. The protocol will then manage to keep the pair more stable, even during ragequits. It also benefits from the ragequit because it adds value to the balance sheet.</p>\n<p>For voting, the following voting suggestion is proposed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yes to algorithmic solution</li>\n<li>Alternative solution with new discussion phase</li>\n<li>No standardization of ragequit proposals.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As for other alternatives, the original discussion can be found in a link under. However the authors want to emphasize that we believe the current proposal is the most fair and best solution.

Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.</p>\n<p>Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.</p>\n<p>Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO on Fraxtal is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.frax.finance#voting-4\"></a>Voting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For: Authorize Fraxlend AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the mentioned Fraxlend pair with the mentioned max authorized allocation.</li>\n<li>Against: Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-369-372-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-new-pairs-on-fraxtal/3109\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-369-372-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-new-pairs-on-fraxtal/3109","pubDate":"Tue, 25 Jun 2024 20:14:33 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.frax.finance-topic-3109"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-369-372-authorize-fraxlend-amo-for-new-pairs-on-fraxtal/3109.rss","#text":"[FIP - 369, ... , 372] Authorize Fraxlend AMO for new pairs on Fraxtal"},"filter":false}]}}}
