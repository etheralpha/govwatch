Ultimately, DAO token holders are free to vote as they see fit for such proposals, should they emerge from the below process. It is worth reiterating that DAO token holders have already approved minimalistic <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-approve-lido-dao-treasury-management-principles-and-authorize-the-formation-of-a-treasury-management-committee\">Treasury Management Principles</a> to this effect, with the express purpose to remove or automate decision-making from the DAO treasury.</em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"growing-an-ethereum-aligned-ecosystem-around-steth-helps-decentralize-the-network-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#growing-an-ethereum-aligned-ecosystem-around-steth-helps-decentralize-the-network-3\"></a>Growing an Ethereum-aligned ecosystem around stETH helps decentralize the network</h1>\n<p>We think of Lido stETH as a triangle connecting node operators, stETH holders and LDO token holders through Lido stETH software. This software runs autonomously and is designed to align cryptoeconomic incentives to further the purpose of decentralizing Ethereum validation. stETH is a mission-driven software tool with a proven track-record of decentralizing the network of Ethereum validators through 1) permissionless software and 2) market forces (cf. HHI graph below, source: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10777v1.pdf\">Grandjean, Heimbach, Wattenhofer</a>).</p>\n<p>Growing the ecosystem around the above mentioned three participants is a powerful way of accelerating Ethereum decentralization. The more attractive it is to <a href=\"https://dune.com/lido/steth-collateral-compare-to-others\">use</a> stETH as collateral, the more the ecosystem grows. This makes it more appealing to participate as a node operator. In turn, and in particular with the possibility for solo-stakers to join through DVT or Community Staking, this increases the decentralization of Ethereum validation.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/0/0bddd1b1185c7a1779078bead0ceb5b75e8f9194.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1GYuQ5R0guCSriwyLooPjvsfcvW.png?dl=1\" title=\"Y3uQhrFpJbAFijf-imOJzYdKX7dyI7DQ0JoTRXvz6kHZpv4DrOhXbk4h8LRXUYU-WSUTkiYYjrlbzb_bItC5v_pIIb-EeILT4peisSNjSnYZQqWI4WWs3zL8dnvBqN-q-0Fk3aPRxZ9KTk19dExbSII\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/0bddd1b1185c7a1779078bead0ceb5b75e8f9194_2_690x210.png\" alt=\"Y3uQhrFpJbAFijf-imOJzYdKX7dyI7DQ0JoTRXvz6kHZpv4DrOhXbk4h8LRXUYU-WSUTkiYYjrlbzb_bItC5v_pIIb-EeILT4peisSNjSnYZQqWI4WWs3zL8dnvBqN-q-0Fk3aPRxZ9KTk19dExbSII\" data-base62-sha1=\"1GYuQ5R0guCSriwyLooPjvsfcvW\" width=\"690\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/0bddd1b1185c7a1779078bead0ceb5b75e8f9194_2_690x210.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/0bddd1b1185c7a1779078bead0ceb5b75e8f9194_2_1035x315.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/0/0bddd1b1185c7a1779078bead0ceb5b75e8f9194.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F5F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"how-should-lido-dao-help-support-the-growth-of-the-ecosystem-around-it-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#how-should-lido-dao-help-support-the-growth-of-the-ecosystem-around-it-4\"></a>How should Lido DAO help support the growth of the ecosystem around it?</h1>\n<p>Lido DAO has experimented with supporting new protocols in the past through Lido on X.

The intent is not to disburse grants, as with LEGO, but to provide an umbrella framework for endorsement and partnership instead.

It is a governance process for Lido DAO to identify and recognize projects that share the same values and mission, and have a way to positively contribute to the stETH ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The proposal asks for creation of a dedicated Alliance workgroup of Lido Contributors. The group’s purpose is to assess potential new Alliance members, facilitate &amp; guide them in the DAO’s governance process, as well as help with navigating the potential alignment &amp; product development possibilities. For any Alliance application, the workgroup would be expected to weigh in with assessment results as a note for tokenholders and the wider community. The other two workgroup objectives are</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be the first point of contact for Alliance members on an ongoing basis</li>\n<li>Signal the community and propose offboarding Alliance members in case of misbehavior in regards to stETH or Ethereum alignment</li>\n</ol>\n<p>LDO token holders will always be consulted and have a say in the matter by way of a vote whenever there is a major event impacting the operation of the Alliance like any decision to onboard, offboard, or make any changes to the partnership. Such votes would ensure the Alliance Workgroup stays on track in terms of mission and vision alignment and make sure the Allied Partners’ values align closely with the values and ethos of Lido DAO.</p>\n<p>While being an ongoing effort, one can expect the Alliance workgroup to facilitate onboarding batches aligned with regular voting cadence. The actual timing is left to the workgroup’s discretion. Token holders can expect evaluation and recommendation based on prospective Partner’s values alignment, focus and commitment to security and unique and promising ways the partnership can benefit the stETH ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Closer affiliation with Lido DAO and the participants in the stETH Triangle can help spread awareness both for stETH and for Allied Partners and their unique technological solutions, which in turn furthers the decentralization of Ethereum.</p>\n<p>As part of a proposal and where relevant, Partners have the option to offer a token airdrop to the Alliance. Those tokens would be committed to the Alliance in perpetuity. Any action towards airdropped tokens would have to be vetted by both Alliance Workgroup and the Lido DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"lido-alliance-principles-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#lido-alliance-principles-6\"></a>Lido Alliance Principles</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Partners should:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Share philosophy alignment:</strong> Align with Lido DAO’s vibes, centered around the purpose of preserving Ethereum’s decentralization, accessibility and resistance to censorship.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on integrations:</strong> Tailor product integrations for the Lido protocol to enhance the project’s value proposition, expand market reach and foster synergistic growth opportunities.</li>\n<li><strong>Have an Obsessive Security Culture:</strong> Uncompromising, relentless approach to security for users</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Partners should not:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Misrepresent the Alliance:</strong> Partners must avoid misleading references to participation in the Lido Alliance</li>\n<li><strong>Front run the DAO:</strong> The prospect of a partnership or collaboration should not be used for business development or marketing</li>\n<li><strong>Take security shortcuts:</strong> No</li>\n<li><strong>Stealth Allocate:</strong> Attempt to use the Alliance endorsement process to ‘allocate’ part of Lido DAO’s treasury in contravention of the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-approve-lido-dao-treasury-management-principles-and-authorize-the-formation-of-a-treasury-management-committee\">Treasury Management Principles</a> or its rules</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Partner protocols should be, where relevant:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereum-aligned</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Thoroughly vetted from a security perspective</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Open-source, with open-license smart contracts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"conflict-resolution-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#conflict-resolution-7\"></a>Conflict resolution</h2>\n<p>In case of disagreement in relation to a specific partner, LDO token holders would always be able to vote for discontinuation of the partnership with a specific Partner.

Intro</h1>\n<p>In October 2023, the Lido DAO first established the GOOSE (strategic intent) + <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ecosystem-grants-grequest-egg-a-budget-request-framework-in-the-service-of-goose/\">EGG</a> (budget) processes as a way to express what they want DAO contributors to work on. By design, the GOOSE is focused on intent (what and why), while execution (the how) is for contributors + future discussions to determine.</p>\n<p>At the time, I analyzed that the staking market is dominated by network effects, leading to a winner-take-most dynamic. To reach Lido DAO’s expressed purpose of <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-vibe-alignment-purpose-mission-vision/4380\">keeping Ethereum decentralized, accessible to all, and resistant to censorship</a>, and honor its responsibility as a market leader, Lido protocol should be as decentralized and Ethereum-aligned as possible. The resulting “laser focus on security” led to <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/\">three major priorities</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>decentralize the NO set,</li>\n<li>decentralize the governance, and</li>\n<li>make stETH the most used token in the Ethereum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this post, we cover what has changed between the ratification of these goals and today. I discuss both internal achievements and external developments, above all the Ethereum issuance debate, and the rise of restaking. Naturally, the magnitude of these developments raises questions about the DAO’s strategy and whether it is still the best course of action or whether it should be revisited. In this post, the first “reGOOSE”, I want to suggest <strong>how Lido should react to the changing tides, what should change, and what should stay the same.</strong></p>\n<p>In summary, I propose that Lido DAO:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Stay focused on security and decentralization</strong><br>\n<strong>2. Participate in Ethereum staking roadmap research</strong><br>\n<strong>3. Reaffirm that stETH should stay an LST, not become an LRT.</strong><br>\n<strong>4.

The decline in market share has been fueled by the rise of restaking and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) that attracted stake through billions of dollars in speculation-driven, unsustainable subsidies.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Ethereum Foundation researchers have started a debate to dramatically reduce staking incentives, which threatens the economic feasibility of decentralized staking pools.</p>\n<p>These two developments, the so-called issuance debate and the rise of restaking, are important enough to warrant a bit of unpacking, followed by my proposal on how Lido DAO should react to them.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-lido-and-changes-to-issuance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-3-lido-and-changes-to-issuance-4\"></a>3. Lido and changes to issuance</h1>\n<p>The Ethereum issuance (colloquially dubbed “minimal viable issuance”, or MVI) actually conflates several independent debates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Whether Ethereum should take explicit steps to limit the growth of the validator set, and thereby, of % ETH staked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whether Ethereum is spending too much on security, and getting incrementally less in return.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some proponents of changing issuance argue that not capping will eventually lead to a large % of ETH staked, with one or two LSTs “crowding out” ETH as the base token and introducing long-tail risks for security and governance.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, proponents of the status quo argue that effectively capping ETH staked at a relatively low rate could lead to full market capture by centralized providers with cost/scale advantages (e.g. Coinbase, ETFs), crowding out decentralized pools and solo stakers.</p>\n<p>I suggest Lido DAO address the issuance debate in two ways:</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-31-stay-focused-on-security-and-decentralization-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-31-stay-focused-on-security-and-decentralization-5\"></a>3.1 Stay focused on security and decentralization</h2>\n<p>In my view, maximizing the strengths of the validator set and minimizing the risks from LSTs on long-tail security are both important goals, and both sides only want the best for Ethereum. In practice, I see the risk from LSTs as the more manageable problem through continued research and investment in decentralization.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, the marginal staking rate was lowered to zero today, the effect on said decentralization roadmaps would be severe. Investments into decentralization would have to be cut, hurting not only Lido but also supplier technology like DVT and community staking software, ultimately leading to a more centralized and fragile staking layer.</p>\n<p>Today, we are not in that place yet. The grass-roots community has been largely opposed to changing issuance without further extensive research, so the chance of immediate changes (i.e. in the next 12 months) should be low.</p>\n<p>I believe that stETH meaningfully contributes to Ethereum decentralization and want the DAO to continue improving the stETH validator set and decreasing smart contract and governance risks, all the while researching possible alternatives to the MVI endgame.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-32-participate-in-ethereum-staking-roadmap-research-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-32-participate-in-ethereum-staking-roadmap-research-6\"></a>3.2 Participate in Ethereum staking roadmap research</h2>\n<p>In spite of the criticism the MVI proposals have received, the risks that motivate the issuance debate are important to explore further. The arguments in favor of having a low stake rate are not without merit, but the benefits of having a high stake rate (e.g. maximum alignment between holders and stakers) are underexplored as well, and no decision should be made without deeply understanding their tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>We have already seen <a href=\"http://cyber.fund\">cyber.fund</a> start a generous research grant to explore the future of MVI, with some prominent independent researchers in the space <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/content/mvi-grants\">heeding the call</a>. However, the Lido DAO can do more as well, having contributors who foresaw many future dynamics in staking and have developed strong opinions based on years of on-the-ground experience with staking and network economics.</p>\n<p>To that end, I suggest the creation of Lido Research, a new research group tasked with contributing to the future vision of staking in Ethereum, in close collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation, independent incentives and security researchers, and the wider community.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-4-lido-and-restaking-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-4-lido-and-restaking-7\"></a>4. Lido and restaking</h1>\n<p>Restaking is a new economic primitive enabling the same collateral to be put under slashing conditions imposed by multiple validation services (AVSs in the Eigenlayer terminology), increasing capital efficiency for the cost of increased risks. For example, the same ETH might be used as a slashing collateral for Ethereum validation as well as running a data availability node.</p>\n<p>When I discussed restaking in my <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590\">previous GOOSE submission</a>, I saw it as a fundamentally promising technology that would take several years to fully mature. Restaking (in its proper form) adds risk through additional slashing conditions, while rewards from AVSs are expected to remain inconsequential in the beginning.</p>\n<p>What this analysis missed is the hype created by EigenLayer even in the pre-product stage, allowing stakers to farm points in exchange for parking capital. At the time of writing, users have deposited 5m ETH (or $15b) in EigenLayer, most of it before any AVSs are even live. EigenLayer rewards were further augmented by new LRTs launching to tokenize these deposits, and AVS partners to use them, each of which with their own subsidy programs as well.</p>\n<p>These subsidies are not sustainable in the long-term, but today, they have caused a significant number of stakers to choose the superior yield of Eigenlayer + LRTs over the superior security and network effect of stETH.</p>\n<p>I propose the following updated strategy for dealing with restaking:</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-41-reaffirm-that-steth-should-stay-an-lst-not-become-an-lrt-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-41-reaffirm-that-steth-should-stay-an-lst-not-become-an-lrt-8\"></a>4.1 Reaffirm that stETH should stay an LST, not become an LRT.</h2>\n<p>In spite of the current popularity of restaking/LRTs, it would be a mistake to expand stETH into an LRT, for two reasons:</p>\n<p>First, as explained in the original GOOSE, more institutional than retail capital is expected to join Ethereum over the next three years. If the Ethereum staking layer is to stay decentralized, then Lido or another decentralized staking protocol winning that institutional opportunity is essential. In my experience, the more risky and actively-managed nature of LRTs does not align with the risk preferences of these institutions today. Much has been invested into making stETH the most secure and liquid LST; becoming an LRT and adding extra risks would undermine this cornerstone of our strategy.</p>\n<p>Second, while LRTs can offer higher rewards, their nature is closer to ETH-denominated mutual funds or tokenized deposits in an Ethereum lending market. The key attribute of liquid staking was that it’s a commoditized software offering, but with LRTs it’s less likely that large parts of the market share the same risk/reward preference. As a result, LRTs are less likely to attain a significant network effect and deep liquidity, further limiting their adoption. Their actively managed nature may also make them more likely to be qualified as regulated financial services.</p>\n<p>The DAO should stay open to launching additional products on top of stETH, incl. an LRT, if there is sustained market demand for something that feels aligned with the Lido mission. However, stETH should always stay the DAO’s priority, and it should always stay an LST.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-42-support-ethereum-aligned-validator-services-starting-with-preconfirmations-without-exposing-stakers-to-additional-risk-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-42-support-ethereum-aligned-validator-services-starting-with-preconfirmations-without-exposing-stakers-to-additional-risk-9\"></a>4.2 Support Ethereum-aligned validator services, starting with preconfirmations, <em>without</em> exposing stakers to additional risk.</h2>\n<p>It makes sense to talk about validator services independent of the question of becoming an LRT or not, for two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AVSs can be broadly separated into those that require a validator and those that don’t and can work on any type of collateral.</li>\n<li>Not every validator service may require slashing to work, and/or the slashing can be isolated to not impact stETH holders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I believe that Lido should stay at the forefront of what “staking” constitutes and actively explore validator services that support Ethereum’s scaling or security roadmap, and has buy-in from researchers and the Ethereum community.</p>\n<p>In 2022, Lido was the first staking protocol to commit to using mev-boost (out-of-protocol PBS) across all of the participating node operators. Its <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-optimal-mev-policy-for-lido/2489\">thoughtful MEV policy</a> that balanced MEV maximization with choice for node operators and censorship resistance has positively influenced other staking providers across the industry.</p>\n<p>Today, running mev-boost has become a normal and accepted part of every staking operation. It shows that the definition of “what staking is” can expand to include additional services.</p>\n<p>In my view, preconfirmations will be the next widely adopted validator service after mev-boost (though I expect them to be more an evolution than substitution of mev-boost). Preconfirmations allow validators to commit to including a transaction outside the current full-block auction to sequence “based” rollups or DEX trades faster than the current 12 second block time, promising improvements across user experience, security, and interoperability.</p>\n<p>Lido should become the leader in preconfirmations, and start looking for partners to collaborate with. And it should achieve that without exposing stETH holders to additional base risk, e.g. through the use of a dedicated cover fund for every new service.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-43-make-steth-the-1-collateral-in-the-restaking-market-allowing-stakers-to-opt-into-additional-points-on-the-risk-and-reward-spectrum-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-43-make-steth-the-1-collateral-in-the-restaking-market-allowing-stakers-to-opt-into-additional-points-on-the-risk-and-reward-spectrum-10\"></a>4.3 Make stETH the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> collateral in the restaking market, allowing stakers to opt into additional points on the risk and reward spectrum.</h2>\n<p>Apart from internalizing Ethereum-aligned validator services like preconfirmations, there is a second opportunity in becoming the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> collateral used for AVSs that either don’t require validators or are too risky or not Ethereum-aligned enough to pursue in-protocol.</p>\n<p>This choice is in line with keeping stETH the most secure and Ethereum-aligned LST. Instead of entering the domain of active risk-management, the DAO should instead strive to give stakers the ability to opt into different points on the risk/reward spectrum, by e.g. depositing stETH into a restaking protocol or AVS in exchange for both higher risk and reward.</p>\n<p>This requires establishing a flourishing ecosystem of apps and partners on the stETH platform, and is an effort in ecosystem-building, similar to what Lido DAO once achieved with integrations into Ethereum DeFi and the wider CeFi landscape. It requires deeply understanding the AVS and LRT landscape, forging bonds with key players, and aligning the incentives through key partnerships.</p>\n<p>Since DAOs are chronically bad at negotiating strategic partnerships, I suggest the creation of a new ecosystem-building team or initiative for that purpose inside Lido DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-5-summary-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-5-summary-11\"></a>5. Summary</h1>\n<p>In summary, I propose five changes to address the question of MVI/issuance and the rise of restaking:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Stay focused on security and decentralization</strong><br>\n<strong>2. Participate in Ethereum staking roadmap research</strong><br>\n<strong>3. Reaffirm that stETH should stay an LST, not become an LRT.</strong><br>\n<strong>4. Support Ethereum-aligned validator services, starting with preconfirmations, without exposing stakers to additional risk.</strong><br>\n<strong>5. Make stETH the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> collateral in the restaking market, allowing stakers to opt into additional points on the risk and reward spectrum.</strong></p>\n<p>While these are more than cosmetic changes, they leave all of the cornerstones of our previous strategy untouched: the DAO’s purpose of keeping Ethereum decentralized, accessible to all, and resistant to censorship, of building the most widely used LST, of heavy investment into governance and NO set decentralization, and a rising focus on institutional capital.</p>\n<p>Since its inception, the Lido DAO has been a deeply mission-driven organization, putting the health of Ethereum over anything else, while achieving a rare synthesis between OG idealism and pragmatic reality. I am happy to bet that continuing on this path, incrementally chipping away at our ambitious roadmap, and playing long-term games with long-term people, will lead to the greatest success in the end.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimers:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I am <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-for-hasu-to-join-lido-as-strategic-advisor/1940\">Strategic Advisor  to the Lido DAO.</a></em></li>\n<li><em>As outlined in the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355\">GOOSE</a>, this proposal is submitted in its final form, and the rationale offered explains both the high-level and the lower-level goals.

Mode’s Rapid Growth and Ecosystem:</h4>\n<p>Mode is positioned to be the DeFi hub of the Superchain and has received support from Optimism in the form of an OP grant worth 2 million OP. Mode launched just 12 weeks ago and has already grown to 430m in overall TVL and an impressive 340m in dApp TVL in a short timeline since mainnet release. We see these numbers continue to grow as we bring in new assets like wstETH and useful DeFi products to the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>wstETH has already been deployed to Optimism and Base, two of the biggest L2s that are also in the Superchain. The Mode core team feels it is strategically beneficial for the Lido DAO to also consider Mode as the next ecosystem to deploy their asset.</p>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chain/Mode\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFiLlama Ranking</a> | <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/mode\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2Beat Ranking</a></p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-high-demand-for-wsteth-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-2-high-demand-for-wsteth-3\"></a>2. High Demand for wstETH:</h4>\n<p>Lido is a very important and trusted asset within the overall crypto ecosystem. It is the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/all-cryptocurrencies\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">top reward bearing asset by marketcap</a> and its deployment on Mode would unlock new opportunities for our users and the dApps that are deployed within Mode.</p>\n<p>All of the top dApps inside of the Mode ecosystem would love to integrate wstETH from the moment the asset is live on the chain. Our user base would enjoy having access to the reward bearing asset within the Mode ecosystem so they can increase their efficiency for their onchain strategies.</p>\n<p>Mode also has an accelerator program is centred around products that optimize rewards for onchain users. We would love to include wstETH as an asset developers can build off of if the Lido DAO decides to accept ownership of the bridging components outlined in this proposal.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-3-canonical-bridge-for-wsteth-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-3-canonical-bridge-for-wsteth-4\"></a>3. Canonical Bridge for wstETH:</h4>\n<p>Like OP and Base the best approach for deploying wstETH on Mode is through the canonical bridge.</p>\n<p>The Mode core team sees the importance of Lido to our long term success and took action to deploy wstETH to Mode testnet using the same open-source solution used for Optimism deployment (<a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - lidofinance/lido-l2 14</a>). The management of wstETH bridging components are designed to be controlled by the Lido DAO (GitHub - <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/governance-crosschain-bridges\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">lidofinance/governance-crosschain-bridges</a>: This repo contains the crosschain governance bridges used for the Aave markets deployed across different networks). All of the pieces are in place for wstETH to come to Mode and we would propose Lido DAO formally accept ownership of the wstETH bridging components mentioned through signalling a snapshot vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If Lido chooses to accept the deployment of wstETH within the Mode blockchain and take over ownership of the bridging components associated with its deployment this would be a positive and significant step towards diversifying the reward bearing assets within Mode’s ecosystem and open up a new userbase for Lido. Mode users would love to use wstETH for their strategies on dApps within Mode and the recent growth of staking assets in the ecosystem highlights that assets like wstETH will have a bright future within Mode.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"audits-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#audits-6\"></a>Audits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[Governance crosschain bridges (OptimismBridgeExecutor:] (<a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/L2/Governance-Crosschain-Bridges-2022-08-Oxorio-Audit%20Report.pdf\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audits/L2/Governance-Crosschain-Bridges-2022-08-Oxorio-Audit Report.pdf at main · lidofinance/audits · GitHub</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/L2/Lido-L2-2022-07-Oxorio-Smart-Contracts-Security-Audit-Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">wstETH token bridge (L1ERC20TokenBridge, ERC20Bridged, L2ERC20TokenBridge):</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"deployment-artifacts-and-levers-setup-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#deployment-artifacts-and-levers-setup-7\"></a>Deployment artifacts and levers setup</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"deployments-on-mainnet-l1-and-mode-l2-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#deployments-on-mainnet-l1-and-mode-l2-8\"></a>Deployments on Mainnet (L1) and Mode (L2):</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>OptimismBridgeExecutor on L2: <a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/address/0x442a6Bea15718588391C5d1dE261AB2c617eA703\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x442a6Bea15718588391C5d1dE261AB2c617eA703</a>  (Sepolia to Mode decisions forwarder for the Lido DAO Agent)</li>\n<li>L1ERC20TokenBridge on L1: <a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/address/0x458C50a11bcc7979e5F0581a16cf4A72844E5692\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x458C50a11bcc7979e5F0581a16cf4A72844E5692</a> (Sepolia token bridge part for wstETH)</li>\n<li>ERC20Bridged on L2: <a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/address/0xa88689c66391CDBCE7C87E50399dA6818d985Fa7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xa88689c66391CDBCE7C87E50399dA6818d985Fa7</a><br>\nMode representation for wstETH proposed as the canonical one)</li>\n<li>L2ERC20TokenBridge on L2: <a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/address/0xE112a3c47C17581868cDdc1550FBb27fDec3353a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xE112a3c47C17581868cDdc1550FBb27fDec3353a</a><br>\n(Mode token bridge part for wstETH)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"levers-setup-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#levers-setup-9\"></a>Levers setup:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>OptimismBridgeExecutor\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network:443/address/0x442a6Bea15718588391C5d1dE261AB2c617eA703?tab=read_contract#c3a76886\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">getEthereumBridgeExecutor 4</a> is the <a href=\"https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x32A0E5828B62AAb932362a4816ae03b860b65e83#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido DAO Agent (admin)</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ultimate admin and role holder on L1 is the <a href=\"https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x32A0E5828B62AAb932362a4816ae03b860b65e83#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido DAO Agent</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Proxy admin for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ultimate admin and role holder on L2 is the <a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/address/0x442a6Bea15718588391C5d1dE261AB2c617eA703?tab=read_contract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OptimismBridgeExecutor</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Proxies admin for ERC20Bridged, L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Emergency breaks msig on L1 is the already established one ( ):\n<ul>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Emergency breaks msig on L2 is a newly created one ( ) with the same EOA members as for L1:\n<ul>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post -

On this custom-built kb we can add specific docs, articles, github repos, etc., and users will be able to ask questions like “give me an ELI5 version explanation of LIDO”, “what are the differences between LIDO and Rocket Pool?” etc.</p>\n<p>You can already ask some questions about LIDO here on the Brian app.</p>\n<p>We are going to build a kb vertical on the LIDO space, while at the moment there a couple of articles in the “Public Knowledge Base”, that is a general kb with a very good overview of the entire market.</p>\n<p><strong>Stake/Unstake ETH on LIDO</strong></p>\n<p>Development of deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) actions to interact with LIDO protocol. The goal is to allow users to perform these operations by writing the prompt in many different ways (eg. “Stake my eth on lido”, “Deposit 1 eth on lido finance”, “Bridge 1 eth to ethereum and then stake 0.5 eth on lido”).</p>\n<p>The development involves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dataset creation (users and artificial prompts) for deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) actions</li>\n<li>fine-tune of a GPT model with deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) actions dataset and prompt engineering operations for optimizing the model performance (eg. few shots and chain-of-thought)</li>\n<li>Adding the deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) actions on the Brian API using Enso finance to interact with the LIDO protocol and for real-time quotes. Initially the withdrawal will go through a steth-eth swap under the hood so that we do not have to wait for the 1/5-day withdrawal period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this point, the deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) actions are available on the API and App.</p>\n<p>This is not available on the Brian app yet, we are testing the integration internally.</p>\n<p>The same operation can be executed starting from a token other than eth such as usdc. The prompt “Deposit 100 usdc on lido protocol on ethereum” will automatically convert usdc to eth and then deposit to lido protocol.</p>\n<p>The deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) prompts can be used via:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>single prompts → eg. “Deposit 1 eth on lido on ethereum”</li>\n<li>multiple prompts → eg. “bridge 1 eth from arbitrum to ethereum and then deposit 0.5 eth on lido on ethereum”, leveraging the power of prompt to transaction composability</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Payment schedule:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>50% at the beginning of the first task (eta: May 1st)</li>\n<li>50% in one month (eta: end of May)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Payment method:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coin: DAI on Ethereum or Arbitrum (preferred)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Address (Arbitrum multi-sig): 0x129B480AD625bcD1A5c3A1C10d708114726Fa467</p>\n<p><strong>4 - Team</strong></p>\n<p>The Brian founders team is an excellent mix of web3 and AI skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Matteo D’Andreta - Web3 BD and PM (6+ years in web3)</li>\n<li>Paolo Rollo - Full Stack Dev and R&amp;D specialist (6+ years in R&amp;D, web3 and AI)</li>\n<li>Francesco Cirulli - Smart Contract dev and PM (6+ years in web3)</li>\n<li>Marcello Politi - Deep Learning Scientist (3+ years in AI)</li>\n<li>Federico Giancotti - Data Analyst</li>\n<li>Filippo Galuccio - Investment Manager</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lego-grants-stake-unstake-eth-on-lido-with-a-prompt-and-the-creation-of-a-lido-kb/7218\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lego-grants-stake-unstake-eth-on-lido-with-a-prompt-and-the-creation-of-a-lido-kb/7218","pubDate":"Thu, 25 Apr 2024 13:28:24 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7218"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lego-grants-stake-unstake-eth-on-lido-with-a-prompt-and-the-creation-of-a-lido-kb/7218.rss","#text":"LEGO Grants - Stake/Unstake ETH on LIDO with a prompt and the creation of a LIDO kb"},"filter":false},{"title":"Request to help with/freeze $stETH held by Zkasino Exit Scam wallet ($30m - 10,000 victims)","dc:creator":"dkc","category":"The LIP - Lido Improvement Proposal - Process","description":"<p>I am a representative of the victims of the zkasino exit scam, asking LIDO DAO to consider helping/freezing funds of the scammers.

Today LDO holders have important powers over the protocol that can result in important changes to this social contract. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrading the Ethereum liquid staking protocol code.<br>\nManaging the list of the Ethereum consensus layer oracle committee members.</li>\n<li>Changing how the stake is distributed between node operators in a potentially harmful or unexpected way (e.g. adding or removing whitelisted Ethereum node operators).</li>\n<li>Changing the governance structure in an unexpected or potentially harmful way (e.g. minting or burning LDO, changing the parameters of voting systems).</li>\n<li>Changing the total fee percentage of the Ethereum liquid staking protocol outside of the agreed boundaries (as well as defining these boundaries).</li>\n<li>Deciding on how to spend the treasury</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these powers, apart from treasury spends, directly affect stakers. Dual governance v1 allows stETH holders, in the worst case, to delay any proposed changes to the Lido protocol until they have fully exited.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"v1-design-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#v1-design-2\"></a>V1 design</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"unhappy-path-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#unhappy-path-3\"></a>Unhappy path</h3>\n<p><em>Malicious proposal to change the withdrawal vault contract</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>A well-funded LDO holder makes a malicious proposal to change the stETH withdrawal contract and rug users. This proposal gets enough LDO support to pass.</li>\n<li>A small group of users (stETH holders) pick up on this and vote to veto the change. In doing so they both sound the alarm for more users to join, and ensure that neither this proposal, nor any other DAO proposals (apart from treasury spends) can be executed for the time being.</li>\n<li>More users join the veto while the DAO is in this temporarily frozen state (known as <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/mechanism.md#veto-signalling-state\">VetoSignalling state</a>). Some need to take the time to unwind from their DeFi positions. That’s ok.</li>\n<li>The DAO remains frozen until all users that have joined the veto are able to fully withdaw their ETH (assuming the 2nd threshold has been crossed).</li>\n<li>After all users have been made whole the DAO reverts back to its normal state (unless there is another veto motion already in motion).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"happy-path-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#happy-path-4\"></a>Happy path</h3>\n<p><em>Good faith proposal to remove a node operator</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>For some reason or other LDO holders vote to boot a node operator out of the curated set.</li>\n<li>A small group of users (stETH holders) pick up on this and vote to veto the change. In doing so they both sound the alarm for more users to join, and ensure that neither this proposal, nor any other DAO proposals which affect them can be executed for the time being.</li>\n<li>LDO holders realize they’ve made a mistake and de-escalate by voting to cancel all pending proposals (including the one that triggered the veto).</li>\n<li>The de-escalation is successful – stETH holders remove their veto – and the DAO resumes a normal state of affairs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"guiding-objectives-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#guiding-objectives-5\"></a>Guiding objectives</h3>\n<p>The guiding objectives are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Give stakers a way to credibly signal their disagreement with LDO holders and the commitment to leave the protocol if LDO holders don’t cooperate in resolving the incentives conflict.</li>\n<li>Allow for the possibility of negotiation and de-escalation between stETH and LDO holders.</li>\n<li>Introduce an extended timelock on DAO decisions that can be triggered by an active minority of stakers and prolonged as more stakers participate.</li>\n<li>Improve foot voting efficiency by allowing stakers to exit the protocol without being subject to new and pending DAO decisions.</li>\n<li>Don’t overburden users with governance decisions</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"the-importance-of-a-two-phased-veto-with-a-dynamic-timelock-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#the-importance-of-a-two-phased-veto-with-a-dynamic-timelock-6\"></a>The importance of a two-phased veto with a dynamic timelock</h3>\n<p>Well-designed onchain DeFi protocols are able to put users ahead of tokenholders.</p>\n<p>In the sense that even if the protocol is failing, users can still permissionlessly exit with their funds intact, and there’s nothing tokenholders can do about it.</p>\n<p>This is something that is truly new to financial markets and infrastructure. Something that is only made possible by the non-custodial nature of onchain DeFi.</p>\n<p>This power of exit, is an extremely underrated differentiator between onchain Defi and offchain Defi/Tradfi.</p>\n<p>If we want to preserve the right to exit under the most extreme scenarios, a naive Moloch style rage quit mechanism isn’t quit good enough. This is because of how Ethereum’s validator exit queue works – all Ethereum validator exits are processed through a single queue with limited throughput. This rate-limited exit queue means that in the worst case it could take more than a year to exit the protocol. During this time, the DAO could, in theory, pass proposals that could harm these users.</p>\n<p>Placing a naive timelock on DAO decisions (a temporary freeze, so to speak) doesn’t work either because the dynamic nature of the exit queue ensures there is no good way to place an upper limit on the length of this time.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, many users choose to re-deploy their staked capital to other forms of economic activity, and unwinding from these positions can take weeks. If Lido only has a single veto phase, then these users would not be able exit under a worst case scenario.</p>\n<p>In sum, a two-phase veto allows for a relatively small number of users to sound the alarm. In doing so, they can pause Lido governance proposals for long enough to either complete a negotiation and de-escalation process (happy path), or to allow for more users to join the veto and eventually exit (unhappy path). In order to avoid burdening users with politics, giving them exit guarantees is preferable to giving them full governance rights.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"committees-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#committees-7\"></a>Committees</h3>\n<p>While dual governance needs to cover any DAO decision that can potentially affect users of the protocol, it does not cover emergency actions triggered by time-scoped circuit-breaker multisigs and contracts. There are three such committees under the v1 design.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"gate-seal-committee-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#gate-seal-committee-8\"></a>Gate Seal committee</h4>\n<p>The Gate Seal committee is a 3/6 multisig that has the power to pause stETH to ETH withdrawals for a predetermined amount of days (currently set to 6). You can think of it as a safeguard against a withdrawal vulnerability being exploited by an attacker. The pause lasts for x days or, in the case that DAO decisions are blocked by stETH holders, until the execution of DAO decisions is unblocked. Importantly, the Gate Seal committee can only enact a pause once before losing its power (it has to be re-elected by the DAO after that). In case of non-use, the multisig automatically expires on a fixed date in the future – currently set to May 1st 2024 (see the discussion on renewing it <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/renew-gateseal-for-the-withdrawal-queue-and-validator-exit-bus-oracle/7081\">here</a>). At any time, the DAO can vote to appoint a new Gate Seal committee with a new expiration date.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"tiebreaker-committee-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#tiebreaker-committee-9\"></a>Tiebreaker committee</h4>\n<p>The Tiebreaker committee is a more complex multisig that has the ability, under very specific conditions, to execute decisions that were proposed and approved by LDO holders but subsequently blocked by stETH holders. Note that it only obtains this right under two potentially catastrophic edge case scenarios (one in which the Gate Seal committee has paused withdrawals post veto, and another in which there’s an infinite exit loop type bug). If this power didn’t exist, then stETH holders who are in the middle of rage quitting could be prevented from withdrawing indefinitely.</p>\n<p>While the GateSeal committee is optimized for speed of reaction, the Tiebreaker committee is designed for maximum security and wider ecosystem alignment: It is expected to composed of 3 or 4 sub-committees (some of which are expected to be fully-fledged DAOs). Each of these subcommittees represents a distinct interest group within the ecosystem. Any decision it makes needs to be approved by a majority (2/3 or 3/4) of sub-committees. And for each individual sub-committee to approve a decision, the latter should be supported by the supermajority of the sub-committee members. Note that no sub-committee may share members with the Gate Seal committee.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"margin-of-safety-committee-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#margin-of-safety-committee-10\"></a>Margin of safety committee</h4>\n<p>The margin of safety committee is a temporary multisig which effectively has the power to revert Lido governance back to it’s current state (i.e pre dual governance).</p>\n<p>It exists primarily to protect from zero-day vulnerabilities in dual governance. The plan is to have a generous bug bounty to encourage responsible disclosure. It will be dissolved once this bounty program comes to an end.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"parameter-choice-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#parameter-choice-11\"></a>Parameter choice</h2>\n<p>Clearly, getting the parameter selection right is of the upmost importance. While <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/mechanism.md\">the mechanism design overview</a> contains a range of possible values, finalizing these requires more research. The aim is to publish a document with suggested initial values within the next 3-6 months.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-importance-of-launching-before-7002-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#the-importance-of-launching-before-7002-12\"></a>The importance of launching before 7002</h2>\n<p>As things stand today, LDO holders cannot force node operators to exit. This means that in practice, it’s extremely difficult for even a captured DAO to coerce Ethereum aligned operators to do anything they would not wish to do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7002-execution-layer-triggerable-exits/14195\">EIP 7002</a>, expected to be included in the next Ethereum hardfork (c. Q1 2025), will drastically change the balance of power here, by effectively allowing LDO holders to force exit operators. Which is why dual governance ideally needs to go live before then (or shortly afterwards).</p>\n<p>Put another way, post triggerable exits, users need to be able to exit en masse to protect against a malicious withdrawal vault upgrade or undesirable changes to the node operator set.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-does-dual-governance-address-concerns-raised-by-researchers-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#how-does-dual-governance-address-concerns-raised-by-researchers-13\"></a>How does dual governance address concerns raised by researchers?</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"minimises-the-risk-of-cartel-abuse-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#minimises-the-risk-of-cartel-abuse-14\"></a>Minimises the risk of cartel abuse</h3>\n<p>In his seminal essay on <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd\">the risks of LSD</a>, Danny Ryan writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deciding “who” gets to be a NO is a matter of two questions – who is added to the set and who is removed the set. This can be designed in one of two ways in the long run – either via governance (a coin vote or other similar mechanism) or via an automated mechanism around reputation and profitability.</p>\n<p>In the former – governance deciding NOs – the governance token (e.g. LDO) becomes a major risk to Ethereum. If the token can decide who can be a node operator in this theoretical majority-LSD, then the token holders can force cartel activities of censorship, multi-block MEV, etc, or else the NO is removed from the set.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Governance deciding NOs has another distinct risk which is regulatory censorship and control. If pooled stake under one LSD protocol exceeds 50%, this pooled staked gains the ability to censor blocks (and worse-so at 2/3 due to being able to finalize such blocks). In a regulatory censorship attack, we now have a distinct entity – the governance token holders – that a regulator can make requests of censorship. Depending on the token distribution, this is likely a much simpler regulatory target than the Ethereum network as a whole. And, in fact, DAO token distributions are generally pretty terrible with just a few entities deciding most votes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=JKvJw2DT2YQ\">Dual governance</a> goes a long way towards addressing the above concerns. Concretely, if LDO holders tried to remove a node operator from the set unfairly, it would work as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A small quorum of stETH holders (say 2% of total) could signal their opposition to this bad decision and pause the governance execution long enough for more holders to react. As more stETH holders join the opposition, the execution pause is extended further.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While this is happening, LDO holders can elect to cancel the decision, and stETH holders can remove their opposition in response. If LDO holders refuse to revert course, and the number of dissatisfied stETH holders reaches a larger quorum (say 10% of total), all dissatisfied users are exited from the protocol (withdraw their ETH) and the governance execution pause is extended until this process ends.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Importantly, governance can only be brought back to normal state if both LDO governance and participating stETH holders agree to resolve the conflict, or once all dissatisfied stETH holders have exited the protocol.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In sum, by giving stETH holders the power to impose a dynamic timelock on changes which affect them, it becomes impossible for LDO holders to force Lido protocol changes onto them. This significantly reduces the risk of capture (via cartel activities of censorship, multi-block MEV, etc).</p>\n<p>Regarding Danny’s second concern (regulatory censorship and control), stETH’s token distribution is very different and much more diverse than LDO’s distribution. So the combination of LDO and stETH is much more resistant to this sort of censorship. It’s still not as diverse as ETH’s distribution, or the distribution of Ethereum users, but this is only going to improve with time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ensures-the-right-of-exit-under-the-most-extreme-conditions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#ensures-the-right-of-exit-under-the-most-extreme-conditions-15\"></a>Ensures the right of exit under the most extreme conditions</h3>\n<p>Part of the concern today rightfully comes from the fact that stETH holders do not have full exit rights. In the sense that there exist situations in which they can be rugged by malicious LDO holders and/or node operators.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dankrad/status/1715496316917121370\">Dankrad’s words</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A very large Lido makes every decision about Ethereum staking mainly a decision about Lido, while the stETH holders are held “ransom”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By giving users full exit rights, dual governance, in combination with EIP-7002, changes this dynamic. To paraphrase <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_vshapovalov/status/1715622835576557700\">Vasiliy</a>; a winning solution in open staking market can be dominant only as long as it’s actually good; and what’s good is ultimately decided by stakers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protects-against-insider-attacks-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#protects-against-insider-attacks-16\"></a>Protects against insider attacks</h3>\n<p>In Vitalik’s end of year 2022 post on <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/12/05/excited.html\">what excites him</a>, he has a wonderful section devoted to decentralized governance questions.</p>\n<p>As he describes it, there are two big questions to answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] What kinds of governance structures make sense, and for what use cases?</p>\n<p>[2] Does it make sense to implement those structures as a DAO, or through regular incorporation and legal contracts?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to make an interesting distinction between a governance structure and its implementation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A particular subtlety is that the word “decentralized” is sometimes used to refer to both: a governance structure is decentralized if its decisions depend on decisions taken from a large group of participants, and an implementation of a governance structure is decentralized if it is built on a decentralized structure like a blockchain and is not dependent on any single nation-state legal system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The framework he uses to think about this distinction is particularly powerful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One way to think about the distinction is: <strong>decentralized governance structure protects against attackers on the inside, and a decentralized implementation protects against powerful attackers on the outside (“censorship resistance”).</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/a/a4f7d07707a3b0bb43221e6d3ab36468517849d4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nxnfbjaT0fMnqxsEplAoguXRiy8.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-02-12 at 16.02.48\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/a/a4f7d07707a3b0bb43221e6d3ab36468517849d4_2_690x230.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-12 at 16.02.48\" data-base62-sha1=\"nxnfbjaT0fMnqxsEplAoguXRiy8\" width=\"690\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/a/a4f7d07707a3b0bb43221e6d3ab36468517849d4_2_690x230.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/a/a4f7d07707a3b0bb43221e6d3ab36468517849d4_2_1035x345.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/a/a4f7d07707a3b0bb43221e6d3ab36468517849d4_2_1380x460.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEEDEE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Since liquid staking protocols, like Lido, are acting as a thin layer on top of credibly neutral global infrastructure (Ethereum), they are in the same category as stablecoins – in that they need both high protection from outside and inside attacks.</p>\n<p>Viewed through this lens, the current structure of Lido governance is a fine model to get a protocol started, but it’s not adequate for the long term. In particular, as we’ve highlighted above, post triggerable exits a well-funded attacker could buy enough LDO to force exit and replace the existing node operator set with a malicious one.</p>\n<p>Regarding innovations in decentralized governance that can protect against insider attacks, Vitalik lists two possible directions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Some kind of non-financialized governance, or perhaps a bicameral hybrid where decisions need to be passed not just by token holders but also by some other class of user (eg. the Optimism Citizens’ House or stETH holders as in the Lido two-chamber proposal)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intentional friction, making it so that certain kinds of decisions can only take effect after a delay long enough that users can see that something is going wrong and escape the system.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lido’s dual governance makes important steps in both of these directions. While governance is still financialized under this first iteration, it does become a bicameral hybrid.</p>\n<p>There is also significant intentional friction introduced by the fact that the veto is two-phased, and that veto states can be chained together. In other words, there’s been alot of thought put into ensuring that users have the time to see that something is going wrong, unwind from their DeFi positions, and exit the system.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"preliminary-timeline-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#preliminary-timeline-17\"></a>Preliminary timeline</h2>\n<p>If LDO holders approve of this direction – next week’s snapshot vote (scheduled for April 18th) will serve as a temperature check – contributors plan on going forward with a technical implementation, preparing for the testnet runs, as well as engaging multiple parties to challenge the mechanism design, technical implementation, and parameter choices.</p>\n<p>Optimistic timeline is testnet deployment in Q3, with mainnet launch scheduled for late Q3 / Q4. Note that these are approximate dates subject to change depending upon the security checks and testnet results.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"going-forward-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#going-forward-18\"></a>Going forward</h2>\n<p>While dual governance is an important step in reducing governance risks of the protocol, it’s in no way the final step.</p>\n<p>Some ideas for v2 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allow vanilla ETH holders to trigger an extended timelock / veto</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give some sort of veto / tiebreaker power to node operators</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allow for delegation of stETH veto / exit power</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allow for seamless DAO forks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Voter bonds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prediction markets</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"seamless-forking-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#seamless-forking-19\"></a>Seamless forking</h3>\n<p>A promising future research direction involves looking for ways to also improve the efficiency of foot voting by node operators. For example, by allowing a subset of stakers and node operators to coordinate a protocol and DAO fork by re-pointing validator withdrawal credentials to a new contract (assuming consensus layer support).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"minimal-governance-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#minimal-governance-20\"></a>Minimal governance</h3>\n<p>The ultimate solution to the user redemption-risk problem is governance minimization and eventual ossification of the protocol code and parameters. There’s no governance risk if nothing is being governed.</p>\n<p>Gradually minimizing the governance scope is something that Lido contributors see as a necessity in the coming years. However, until the Ethereum specification ossifies, there is only so much that can be done on this front.</p>\n<p>In addition, any immutable code has to be formally verified on the bytecode level to minimize the risk of exploitable compiler bugs. Doing this effectively will require significant changes to the architecture of Lido’s code.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"further-resources-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#further-resources-21\"></a>Further resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/specification.md\">Specification</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/mechanism.md\">Mechanism design</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727/2\">Research post</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrA6VQgh3bk\">Sam’s presentation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=JKvJw2DT2YQ\">Sacha’s presentation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1540652075352313857\">Twitter space with Hasu and Sam</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance\">Github repo</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@sacha/SJk8GHq5T\">FAQ</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dual-governance-explainer-research-distillation/7132\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dual-governance-explainer-research-distillation/7132","pubDate":"Thu, 11 Apr 2024 16:02:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7132"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dual-governance-explainer-research-distillation/7132.rss","#text":"Lido dual governance explainer (research distillation)"},"filter":false},{"title":"Dual Governance: design and implementation proposal","dc:creator":"kadmil","category":"Proposals","description":"<h2><a name=\"what-is-dual-governance-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#what-is-dual-governance-1\"></a>What is Dual Governance</h2>\n<p>The Dual Governance mechanism (DG) is an iteration on the protocol governance that gives stakers 1) a dynamic user-extensible timelock on DAO decisions and 2) a rage quit mechanism taking into account the specifics of how Ethereum withdrawals work.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"current-status-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#current-status-2\"></a>Current status</h2>\n<p>After multiple stages of the research (<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727/26\">the latest update</a>, <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727\">the start of the “continuation” thread</a>, <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance/2382\">the initial post</a>), the mechanism design is now fully fleshed out.

In the worst case of false-positive (pause contracts if no vulnerability is present), the potential downside is limited (only withdrawals get paused, and only by limited time). In that case, leaving the protocol the option to react faster-than-governance-flow seem to be a good call. In the future, committee-driven safety mechanics could be changed to a permissionless zk-proof system. Still, that future is quite far away: it requires both the maturing of production-level zk-based tech and the ossification of withdrawals part of the Lido on Ethereum.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposed-decision-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#proposed-decision-3\"></a>Proposed decision</h3>\n<p>It’s proposed to use the new instance of the GateSeal Blueprint, deployed with GateSeal Factory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GateSeal Blueprint: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xEe06EA501f7d9DC6F4200385A8D910182D155d3e\">0xEe06EA501f7d9DC6F4200385A8D910182D155d3e</a></li>\n<li>GateSeal Factory: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x6c82877cac5a7a739f16ca0a89c0a328b8764a24\">0x6c82877cac5a7a739f16ca0a89c0a328b8764a24</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GateSeal Factory and GateSeal Blueprint contracts were audited during the V2 upgrade: <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/?tab=readme-ov-file#04-2023-statemind-gateseals-audit\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - lidofinance/audits</a></p>\n<p>The new instance of GateSeal will be deployed and announced under the post.

Today, the TMC will be in charge of the trigger and selecting thresholds, but there is no reason why this level-setting and execution couldn’t be done permissionlessly also. One way in which this could be done is by allowing an Aragon vote to set a maximum ceiling of swaps permitted in a rolling 12mo period (~2.6m blocks):</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/6/654de5568d5741ca981b283f7a2b96f34105d0bc.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/esb7aoIST9kql9Rn1x2UyydO7Wk.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/6/654de5568d5741ca981b283f7a2b96f34105d0bc_2_580x500.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"esb7aoIST9kql9Rn1x2UyydO7Wk\" width=\"580\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/6/654de5568d5741ca981b283f7a2b96f34105d0bc_2_580x500.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/6/654de5568d5741ca981b283f7a2b96f34105d0bc_2_870x750.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/6/654de5568d5741ca981b283f7a2b96f34105d0bc_2_1160x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F9FA\"></a></div><p></p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<h2><a name=\"poll-for-treasury-management-committee-members-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#poll-for-treasury-management-committee-members-1\"></a>Poll for Treasury Management Committee Members</h2>\n<p>End date 21-Mar-2024</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/tmc-2-research-and-implement-permissionless-stonks-execution/6861/1\">Click to view the poll.</a></p>\n            <p><small>13 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/tmc-2-research-and-implement-permissionless-stonks-execution/6861\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/tmc-2-research-and-implement-permissionless-stonks-execution/6861","pubDate":"Thu, 14 Mar 2024 14:38:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-6861"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/tmc-2-research-and-implement-permissionless-stonks-execution/6861.rss","#text":"TMC-2: Research and implement permissionless Stonks execution"},"filter":false}]}}}
