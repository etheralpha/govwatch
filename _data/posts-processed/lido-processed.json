This is our first time formally engaging as Community Lifeguards with local crypto communities, and it has been vital to understand the current state of community stakers on the ground and what the next steps should be.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/stakesaurus\">@stakesaurus</a> shared his experience with Bitskwela, a web3-native education project based in the Philipines <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-fleet-pilot/6606/16\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Community Staking Fleet Pilot - #16 by Stakesaurus</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive today into mine, muBuenos, with a little backstory and context that I think can be very useful <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h1><a name=\"mubuenos-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#mubuenos-1\"></a>muBuenos</h1>\n<p>Argentina is a nation full of tech entrepreneurs (they’re the founders of Vercel, MercadoLibre, Globant, OpenZeppelin, and more) deeply affected by a complicated sociopolitical landscape and one of the highest inflations in the world, getting the Argentinian peso to 3-digit annual inflation in 2023.</p>\n<p>This combination has made Argentina one of the world’s biggest crypto communities and contributor base, if not the biggest. I can’t remember who told me this, but rumor has it that a big chunk of smart contracts on Ethereum are deployed in Argentina—at least single-collateral DAI was!</p>\n<p>However, fragmentation and coordination costs are a thing within big communities. <em>Cryptobros</em> in Argentina know everyone, but they kind of don’t at the same time. Despite having all the pieces, they needed something to bring them together and spark the next wave of crypto innovation and adoption.</p>\n<p>All of a sudden, the team behind <a href=\"https://the-mu.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Mu</a> decided to host the second edition of their dev-focused pop-up cities in Buenos Aires. Co-hosted by <a href=\"https://x.com/EtherArgentina\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethereum Argentina</a> and with multiple sponsors and community partners, <a href=\"https://the-mu.xyz/blog/mubuenos\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em><strong>muBuenos</strong></em> was born</a>, bringing enthusiasts with little to no experience under the same roof as seasoned contributors in remarkable projects like Maker, StarkNet, Protocol Labs, or Scroll.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/3/3aa8db0bb0c7ac02af3216c272de4ba4a9df13f4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8mVsOQL1ne32ochht1V0F6RWq6o.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/3/3aa8db0bb0c7ac02af3216c272de4ba4a9df13f4_2_690x405.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"8mVsOQL1ne32ochht1V0F6RWq6o\" width=\"690\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/3/3aa8db0bb0c7ac02af3216c272de4ba4a9df13f4_2_690x405.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/3/3aa8db0bb0c7ac02af3216c272de4ba4a9df13f4_2_1035x607.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/3/3aa8db0bb0c7ac02af3216c272de4ba4a9df13f4_2_1380x810.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CFC5E6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>muBuenos happens amidst one of the biggest changes in Argentina’s sociopolitical landscape in decades. The newly elected president, Javier Milei, is a freedom absolutist with policies that may get crypto treated as an actual viable (and legal) option for the country—and that’s a reason muBuenos is evolving into <a href=\"https://x.com/crecimientoar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>Operación Crecimiento</em></a>, a pro-crypto initiative from the local community, The Mu, and Protocol Labs with support from the local government, but that’s a story for another day.</p>\n<p>Okay, sounds good, but what does it mean for Lido, and what did I exactly do in my time there?</p>\n<h2><a name=\"lido-x-mubuenos-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#lido-x-mubuenos-2\"></a>Lido x muBuenos</h2>\n<p>The goal of the Community Staking Fleet is to help grow grassroots staking interest in local communities—I’m happy to say Lido x muBuenos did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>In all honesty, I didn’t know what to expect. MuBuenos is not the typical community with years of running and a user base with a determinable outcome beforehand, in fact it was born to die in just 6 weeks; on the other hand, it offered a super immersive experience along with a community that was quite mature in itself and that everyone was talking about in a very positive way.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I was greeted upon arrival with a lot of excitement and curiosity (along with some incredible <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_pastry\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">facturas</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernet_con_coca\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fernet</a>) to get more clarity on everything they were reading on Crypto Twitter about Lido, the changes in the issuance curve, or the appearance of restaking all of which I tried to address along the whole engagement.</p>\n<p>To sum it up, during my time there I:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ran 4 staking sessions.</li>\n<li>Participated in the Staking Meetup by SenseiNode &amp; MetaPool in collaboration with Staking Rewards.</li>\n<li>Met with SEEDLatam, a recent LEGO grantee working on a staking educational hub in Spanish and collaborations with local universities, have a look at their proposal <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/seednode-lido/6641\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Made custom Lido x The Mu t-shirts for participants.</li>\n<li>Bought a staking hardware machine.</li>\n<li>Took care of the closing community dinner.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"the-mu-interview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#the-mu-interview-3\"></a>The Mu interview</h3>\n<p>Additionally, as part of the community engagement efforts by the Community Lifeguards, we have begun a series of podcast interviews showcasing the communities—allowing the Lido DAO and community stakers to get to know these local communities better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbBVMnFpsh0\">Community Staking Podcast 13 Ethereum Staking and pop up cities with The Mu</a></p>\n\n<h3><a name=\"the-staking-sessions-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#the-staking-sessions-4\"></a>The staking sessions</h3>\n<p>For the last two weeks of muBuenos I held two sessions per week for a total of two weeks, these were on relevant topics that I agreed upon at the end of each class with a nice staking group that was formed—turns out Nixo from EthStaker was around which was actually a really nice surprise and helpful to provide some more context and other perspectives.</p>\n<p>They were scheduled for 1hr in a 10-seat room, but there was so much interest that we had 15-20 folks in the room for 2 hours on almost all sessions!

That comes with a natural rising interest in Lido, node running and staking boradly speaking—in fact some of the attendees already had experience and knew much of the topics beforehand. I learnt a lot myself from the arguments they were able to put together.</p>\n<p>Plus all the recent changes and narratives in the staking landscape (MVI, restaking, etc.) are very hot topics. There seemed to be rough consensus on the urgency/need of issuance targeting, and curiousity around restaking mechanics and opportunities for community stakers.</p>\n<p>It’s obvious to me that Lido must pay close attention to Argentina and keep supporting the rising community of stakers there, and in order to do that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I still stay in touch with some of the participants, some of whom have repeatedly expressed their willingness to eventually run nodes and participate in Lido CS initiatives.</li>\n<li>Continue supporting community-led projects, and open up new avenues for them to engage and contribute.<br>\nThis was a very good first engagement, followed by a community-led grant to build resources in Spanish and engage universities <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/seednode-lido/6641\" class=\"inline-onebox\">SEEDNode - Lido</a> and other leads coming our way, like the first Staking Day in Latam during Ethereum Argentina ‘24.</li>\n<li>Various institutions are exploring staking, and more now that regulatory clarity seems to be slowly appearing under Milei’s administration. This is good for BizDev/ProRel, but also means that universities and others are closer to running nodes than ever (<a href=\"https://x.com/ETHKipu/status/1808576927843643705\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">some already do</a>, actually).</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-fleet-the-mu-buenos-aires-argentina/7945\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-fleet-the-mu-buenos-aires-argentina/7945","pubDate":"Tue, 30 Jul 2024 01:39:04 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7945"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-fleet-the-mu-buenos-aires-argentina/7945.rss","#text":"Community Staking Fleet: The Mu @ Buenos Aires, Argentina"},"filter":false},{"title":"Accidental Eth Staking","dc:creator":"bschirmer","category":"General","description":"<p>I accidentally unstaked my Eth from my Ledger Live account into another Lido account.

Commit-Boost has off-the-shelf monitoring and proactive tools to identify risks, limit the impact of bugs, and proactively alert teams when / if issues develop from opted-into validator services</li>\n<li>While Commit-Boost’s first use cases are commitments like preconfs, Commit-Boost is maximally neutral and does not limit innovation across the proposer commitment design space. It is proposer commitment agnostic, relay agnostic, transaction flow agnostic, commitment enforcement agnostic, etc. Nothing about Commit-Boost will limit stETH’s ability to be the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> collateral in the restaking market</li>\n<li>Commit-Boost is working with client teams, consultants, researchers, validators (including home stakers and sophisticated stakers), testing with operators in Holesky, helped stand-up devnets and persistent testnets for fast iteration, have a significant portion of the preconf teams already building modules on Commit-Boost, and been engaged with teams across the community who are eager to develop other validator services such as inclusion lists. To ensure Commit-Boost fits the needs of the Lido Community, we are keen to continue to expand this iteration / testing / feedback loop with the Lido Community, apply for a grant from the LidoDAO, and eventual consideration to be part of the Alliance</li>\n<li>In the design, development, sustainment, and governance around Commit-Boost, we have tried to embrace the values of the Lido Community and <a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/toward-an-open-research-and-development-process-for-mev-boost/464\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">previously voiced</a> by the broader community</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Background and What Risks Commit-Boost Addresses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to the call to actions outlined in ReGoose around validator services, most are starting to agree on a common denominator: in the future, beacon proposers will be presented with a broader set of options of what they may “commit\" to–be it inclusions lists or preconfs or other types of commitments such as long-dated blockspace futures–compared to just an external or local payload they see today</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/barnabe.eth/QJ6W0mmyOwjec-2zuH6lZb0iEI2aYFB9gE-LHWIMzjQ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">post</a> from Barnabe captures this well; during block construction, the validator “…creates the specs, or the template, by which the resulting block must be created, and the builders engaged by the proposer are tasked with delivering the block according to its specifications”</li>\n<li>While this all seems great, the challenge is that many teams building commitments are creating new sidecars driving fragmentation and risks for Ethereum and the Lido operator set</li>\n<li>For Ethereum, there are going to be significant challenges and increased risks during upgrades if there are a handful of sidecars that validators are running</li>\n<li>For validators, these risks potentially take us to a world where proposers will need to make decisions on which teams to “bet on” and which sidecars they will need to run to participate in what those teams are offering</li>\n<li>For homestakers, this is difficult and they likely will be unable to participate in more than one of these commitments</li>\n<li>For sophisticated actors, this increases the attack vector and operational complexity as more and more sidecars are required to be run</li>\n<li>Another side effect of this is validators are somewhat locked into using a specific sidecar due to limited operational capacity and the switching costs of running a different sidecar (i.e., vendor lock-in). The higher the switching costs, the more embedded network effects could become if these sidecars only support certain downstream actors / proposer commitment protocols</li>\n<li>This also could create a dynamic where core out-of-protocol infrastructure supporting Ethereum which should be a public good, starts being used for monetization, distribution, or other purposes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Commit-Boost Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Commit-Boost is a community-driven, open-source project developing an unopinionated validator platform to enable safe interactions with commitments. Some of its features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unification: Core devs will be able to interact and work with one standard during Ethereum forks / upgrades / when and if things go wrong</li>\n<li>Backward compatibility + more: Commit-Boost is not only backward compatible with MEV-Boost, but will improve the life of Lido operators who only run MEV-Boost through increased reporting, telemetry / other off-the-shelf tools validators can employ</li>\n<li>Opt-in without running more sidecars: Commit-Boost will allow proposers who want to opt into other commitments to do so without having to run multiple sidecars</li>\n<li>Tools and features to help reduce risks for Lido’s operator set: In the spirit of ReGOOSE, Commit-Boost is specifically designed with off-the-shelf monitoring and proactive tools to identify risks, limit the impact of bugs, and proactively alert teams of issues that may develop from validator services</li>\n<li>Robust support: Commit-Boost the software is supported by a not-for-profit entity. This team will be focused on security and robustness through policies and procedures with follow-the-sun type models where there is support 24/7 if / when things go wrong. This team will also be focused on testing and adjustments needed during hard forks and have a team to interact with to help during adoption, improvements, and sustainment</li>\n<li>Additional revenue: As part of the open innovation that Commit-Boost enables, potential validator services will continue to come online, to capture new revenue opportunities when making commitments</li>\n<li>Not VC-backed Public Good: This team and effort will not be VC-backed. There is no monetization plan. The entity will not sell itself and will not start any monetizable side businesses. As an example, the team is actively working on a grant application to the Lido Community, among other organizations across Ethereum</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Technical Roadmap</strong></p>\n<p>As noted in the Proposal section above, Commit-Boost is already live with an MVP product and heavily engaged with the broader community. We are continuing the development and feature set of Commit-Boost / onboarding new modules and targeting production-ready software and audits kicking off at the end of Q3. More details on the current roadmap are in the Commit-Boost <a href=\"https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client/issues\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">repo</a> and we are keen to get feedback from the Lido Community to prioritize and design features that would be required.</p>\n<p>Some near-term high-level highlights from the roadmap include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimized and functional MEV-Boost module including multiple metrics for reporting and extensions such as configurable timing for get_header / get_payload calls</li>\n<li>Pre-made dashboards on Grafana for all core services</li>\n<li>Improved reliability and integrations for incident response</li>\n<li>R&amp;D / spec signing mechanism to fit as many validator set-ups as possible</li>\n<li>Expanding modularity and optionality (i.e., supporting different types of signatures and modules)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>From the perspective of a Lido Operator</strong></p>\n<p>More details on what it takes to run Commit-Boost as a node operator can be found <a href=\"https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/get_started/overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. Please note that this has not been finalized and over the next few weeks we will be making updates (see roadmap / milestones above):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Commit-Boost client is a single sidecar that acts as a platform to interact with proposer commitment protocols</li>\n<li>Do not need to run multiple sidecars for new commitments</li>\n<li>Not backing one team building proposer commitment protocols letting open innovation happen at the protocol layer with low barriers for switching costs between commitment protocols for the Lido Operator</li>\n<li>No risk of monetization at the sidecar layer. Commit-Boost is a public good supported by a not-for-profit team focused solely on robust support, continued development, and sustainment of Commit-Boost</li>\n<li>Standardized way to provide a signature / opt into a commitment</li>\n<li>Helps monitor key attributes around that signature</li>\n<li>Creates constraints / condition sets and pass these constraints downstream</li>\n<li>Get insight into telemetry around the commitment flow and validator box that can be seen through dashboards such as a - Grafana</li>\n<li>Create bespoke process management logic to ensure safety when making commitments</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>From the Perspective of the Proposer Commitment Protocol</strong></p>\n<p>More details on what it takes to build a module / metrics can be found <a href=\"https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/category/developing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. Please note that this has not been finalized and over the next few weeks we will finalize moving parts that impact module creators (see roadmap / milestones above):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A modular platform to develop and distribute proposer commitments protocols</li>\n<li>A single API to interact with validators</li>\n<li>Support for hard-forks and new protocol requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Commit-Boost Design Principles</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built for validators: Platform that not only can help validators today (i.e., can improve the lives of validators even if they just run an MEV-Boost module) but allows validators to be ready for the market of tomorrow (i.e., preconfs, inclusion lists, etc)</li>\n<li>Neutrality: No opinions, the platform will be proposer commitment agnostic, relay agnostic, transaction flow agnostic, etc. The goal is to build a platform that doesn’t limit the design space downstream while reducing risks of fragmentation for validators and Ethereum</li>\n<li>Unified: Validators run one core sidecar with the ability to opt into many different commitments</li>\n<li>Safety: Open-source code developed with input by the community with community reviews / audits</li>\n<li>Reduce risks: Modularized and transparency are core to reducing risk / overhead for the proposer to manage commitments and their broader operational processes</li>\n<li>Values aligned: Public good with no plans for monetization. We will continuously ask ourselves: would Vitalik run Commit-Boost and can this be designed in a way to increase the decentralization of Ethereum block construction</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Architecture of Commit-Boost</strong></p>\n<p>More details can be found in the Commit-Boost <a href=\"https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documentation</a>. However, below is a schematic of Commit-Boost. It is important to note that the below depiction contains just a few examples of proposer commitment modules that can run on Commit-Boost. The design space for modules is completely open / not gated by the Commit-Boost software and proposers will be responsible for opting into the commitments they wish to subscribe to (i.e., a proposer is responsible for which modules they will subscribe to).</p>\n<p><strong>Terminology</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposer: entity, staking pool NoOp (i.e., Lido), or DVT cluster with the right to propose the next block</li>\n<li>Commitment: a constraint or condition that the proposer choses and agrees to via a signature</li>\n<li>Key Manager: some proposers use key managers or remote signers as part of their proposer / validator duties. Please note, that Commit-Boost is being designed in a way where it does not require validators to run key managers and working on solutions for monolithic set-ups</li>\n<li>Consensus Client: for example, Lighthouse or Teku (see <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Commitment Modules: community-built modules allowing proposers to make commitments, including some of the logic of the proposer commitment protocol</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Signer API: The signer API is one of the core components around Commit-Boost. This is used to provide signatures from the proposer to the proposer commitment protocol. This is still in the design but proxy signatures will be used in nearly all cases (there are some outlier cases). For more details on the API please see <a href=\"https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/api/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.

This will also allow for a bit of time for the market to play out, but via a public good, standardize the last mile of communication to help address the risks (discussed in the background section above) developing. Once the market does play out, and the community can observe some dynamics (the good and the bad), we can and should push for CL changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Robustness, Sustainability, and Security</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Commit-Boost is being developed as a fully open-source project with contributions from teams across the Ethereum tech stack including validators, client teams, relays, builders, consulting firms, researchers, and many others. This effort with input and support from these teams will help develop a robust product integrating many perspectives</li>\n<li>Commit-Boost will go through code reviews and audits once fully developed</li>\n<li>As noted below, there also will be a full-time team that helps maintain and upgrade the software with their core focus on 100% uptime and when there are bugs, robust processes to quickly address and fix</li>\n<li>The software stack is also built with the validator at the core and includes off-the-shelf tools for monitoring as well as reducing and proactively addressing any risks that may arise</li>\n<li>Last, this public good software will have minimal, but critical open governance around future upgrades with input across the Ethereum</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Team Supporting / Governance of Commit-Boost Software</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entity supporting the software: Not-for-profit entity</li>\n<li>Multiple-person team: Multiple devs that fully focus on transparency, sustainment / development, and research with an initial focus around Commit-Boost the software. Based on initial research we suspect this will cost $1m - $2m / year. This funding will largely be related to developer resources.\n<ul>\n<li>Transparency: Open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">repo</a> and governance calls (see below)</li>\n<li>Sustainment / Development: 24/7 follow-the-sun coverage and highly engaged with client teams around upgrades / early in getting testnet support</li>\n<li>Research: Helping with and being a resource for open-source research across the Ethereum staking roadmap</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Governance: This is still a WIP, but at a minimum will run a Commit-Boost, ACD-like calls (first one coming soon) to engage with stakeholders (would be great to have folks from the Lido Community involved) and drive consensus on upgrades / help coordinate around hard forks. A credibly neutral community member will lead these calls / this process and has experience with running governance processes over critical software within the Ethereum community</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reducing risks for Ethereum and the Lido Community</strong></p>\n<p>We are excited to present this effort to the Lido Community and believe the structure, design, and goals directly address key risks developing within Ethereum and for validators. We also see that it not only aligns with the Lido Community but also of the broader Ethereum community. We are excited with the opportunity to potentially be part of and directly work with the Lido Community to support a neutral platform.</p>\n<p>We look forward to feedback and engagement from the Lido Community and their consideration of this proposal. After feedback and engagement with the Lido Community we plan to apply and be considered for a grant from the LidoDAO as well as consideration for the Alliance.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/introducing-commit-boost-to-the-lido-community/7913\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/introducing-commit-boost-to-the-lido-community/7913","pubDate":"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 15:35:03 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7913"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/introducing-commit-boost-to-the-lido-community/7913.rss","#text":"Introducing Commit-Boost to the Lido Community"},"filter":false},{"title":"RockLogic Monthly Notes - 07/2024","dc:creator":"Vithya","category":"Node Operators","description":"<p>Welcome to our monthly news, where we provide you with updates on our efforts to establish a secure Ethereum environment.

This feature prevents proposers from participating in a “race to zero-margin”. By registering exclusively with relays that support the MEV Protect feature (currently just the bloXroute relays for the POC) and opting in to the Proposer MEV Protect feature, the proposer is guaranteed to only receive blocks where they receive over 80% of the block profit. Builders are alerted they can not submit blocks for these slots unless over 80% of the block profit goes to the proposer. The purpose of the POC is to determine the value added by feature, with larger block rewards. The goal is to get to 50K-100K pubkeys participating in the POC and we secured around 20K-30K already).

We now allow validators to use relay proxies in many regions throughout the world (US, EU, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, and Dublin) without having to run their own. These proxies communicate with the relay using gRPC, and are faster than communicating with the relay directly. Validators using relay proxies receive higher paying blocks than those who don’t, due to the validator being able to receive blocks built later in the slot because of the reduced builder-to-proposer latency.

This includes posting in their Delegate Thread and sending personal messages to tokenholders who they know. We recommend notifying the DAO Operations Workstream as early as possible so that the resignation is timely communicated to voters so they can proceed to re-delegate their voting power.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintaining Reliability of the Platform:</strong></p>\n<p>The Delegate Oversight Committee oversees the list of public delegates and will take action in cases where a delegate:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Case</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Does not maintain a voting participation rate above 70% over three months</td>\n<td>1st time: warning, 2nd time: removal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Does not adhere to the code of conduct</td>\n<td>Removal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Attempts to exploit the system for gas fees</td>\n<td>Removal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spreads false information or misrepresents data</td>\n<td>Investigation and potential removal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exhibits abusive or disrespectful behavior</td>\n<td>Removal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Actions include closing the delegate’s forum thread, ceasing gas reimbursement, and informing the community about the delegate’s status change to maintain the integrity of the system.

Incentivizing delegates is not just fair but also prevents conflicts of interest, as it ensures they are focused and dedicated.</p>\n<p>There are cases in the industry when unpaid delegates work in other roles within the DAO, diluting their effectiveness and creating conflicts of interest. By compensating delegates, we maintain their commitment and engagement, and we can rely on strong specialists who are invested in the development of the protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Program Conditions</strong><br>\nIt is proposed to allocate:</p>\n<p><strong>Delegate Insentivization</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$150,000, to be paid in LDO at the TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) over the program’s duration (September 1, 2024 - February 28, 2025). To incentivize active participation and expert contributions to Lido DAO governance, it proposes to incentivize all delegates with more than 2M LDO delegated on Aragon and Snapshot. All participants meeting the criteria will receive equal shares of the allocated grants. No delegate will receive more than $15,000 worth of LDO for any three months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Framework Development and Facilitation</strong>:<br>\nIt will be conducted by the DAO Ops Workstream Members and Agora members, under the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x2baf3275d15a8494ff94fef58d93bedd2fc28bfea8519f7e86474fc72dc25076\">[EGG] st2024, v2, Lido Contributors’ Group Grant Funding</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Program Steps</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Program Approval and Delegate Oversight Committee</strong> <strong>Formation</strong><br>\nThis committee will facilitate delegate operations, evaluate performance, distribute incentives, maintain transparent communication with contributors and token holders, and publicly report all changes and events related to the program.<br>\nThe committee will include:<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/jenya_k\">@Jenya_K</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/kadmil\">@kadmil</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/olga_kniazeva\">@Olga_Kniazeva</a> from Lido DAO Contributors Group, and Charlie Feng, Marcela Ochoa from Agora.</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate Application Process</strong> - applications open 14 days after proposal approval. Interested parties must apply to participate in the rally.</li>\n<li><strong>Rally Phase</strong> - 3 weeks<br>\nToken holders (or “Delegators”) will use a unified delegation interface to delegate their voting power in both Snapshot and Aragon. Marketing activities (e.g. Twitter posts and perhaps spaces) will be held to promote delegation during this time.</li>\n<li><strong>Compiling the List of Eligible Delegates</strong><br>\nAfter the rally, a list of delegates eligible for incentivization within the pilot cycle will be compiled.<br>\n<strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong> be a part of a public delegate platform, and possess more than 2M LDO delegated in both Snapshot and Aragon (2M on Snapshot AND 2M on Aragon).</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluation and Incentives Disbursement</strong> - Delegates will be evaluated quarterly. The evaluation process will be transparent and will include assessments based on the following criteria:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Quantitative criteria</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vote Participation Rate</strong>: Delegates must participate in at least 70% of votes each quarter.</li>\n<li><strong>Number of Delegated Tokens</strong>: Delegates must maintain more than 2 million LDO tokens delegated on both Snapshot and Aragon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Qualitative criterion</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Participation in Proposal Discussions</strong>: Active involvement in discussions on proposals in the forum and other relevant platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The committee will assess the delegate’s fulfillment of key expectations (listed below).</p>\n<p>The committee’s evaluation will be publicly communicated on this forum. <strong>All participants meeting the criteria will receive equal shares of the allocated grants</strong> if not asked not to be paid at the delegate thread.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Expectations of Lido DAO Insetivized Delegate:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Representing Token Holders:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Read, analyze, ask questions, provide public feedback, and make decisions on Lido DAO proposals</li>\n<li>Ensure actions and decisions resonate with the interests of token holders and the community</li>\n<li>Ensure actions and decisions align with <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-vibe-alignment-purpose-mission-vision/4380\">Purpose, Mission, Vision</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Community Engagement and Transparency:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Spark and participate in discussions on forums, crypto Twitter, and other platforms.

A mandatory discussion and feedback 7 days period will follow before finalizing the decision.</p>\n<p>This final step ensures that any decision to exclude a delegate is transparent, deliberative, and open to community input, reinforcing the program’s commitment to fairness and accountability.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding Operations</strong><br>\nFor the pilot program, LEGO will fund a Delegate Oversight Committee after quarter evaluation, for continuous Delegate Incentivisation.</p>\n<p>This proposal will be suggested for approval by the Lido DAO via Snapshot vote. If accepted - $150,000 equivalent in LDO is to be transferred via Easy Track motion to the <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x12a43b049A7D330cB8aEAB5113032D18AE9a9030\">LEGO committee multisig</a> to be used as grants for delegates incentivization program during 01-SEP-2024 - 28-FEB-2025.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#conclusion-6\"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>In summary, this proposal aims to establish a robust framework for public delegate participation and incentivization within the Lido DAO. By creating an official public delegates platform and implementing a six-month Pilot Delegate Incentivization Program, we aim to increase active voting participation and improve the quality of discussions and feedback.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#next-steps-7\"></a><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Snapshot Vote</strong>: The proposal will be put to a Snapshot vote on July 25, if no objection from the community<br>\nIf passed:</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate Application Period</strong>: Applications for delegates will be open from August 2 to August 16.</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate Rally</strong>: The delegate rally will take place from August 19 to September 7.</li>\n<li><strong>Program Start</strong>: The first season of the incentivization program will commence on September 8.</li>\n<li><strong>First Quarter Incentives Distribution</strong>: Incentives for the first quarter of the pilot will be distributed from December 2 to December 8.</li>\n<li><strong>Second Quarter Incentives Distribution</strong>: Incentives for the second quarter of the pilot will be distributed from March 3 to March 7.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"qa-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#qa-8\"></a>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Can voters overwrite a delegate’s vote?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, a holder can always overwrite (mechanics allow tokenholder to change delegate vote after they cast it) a delegate’s vote if they have a different opinion. Even if they share the same opinion, they might overwrite to express personal support for a particular initiative.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is voting power only delegated to public delegates?</strong></p>\n<p>No, delegation is not limited to the public list. The public list and the list of compensated delegates are meant to guide those who need assistance choosing a delegate. You can delegate to yourself, a friend, or form a team and vote privately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Can the Committee automatically revoke voting power from a delegate?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no measure to automatically revoke voting power. All the committee can do is communicate and publicly announce if something is wrong with a delegate, whether they are inactive or behaving oddly. They do not have the authority to manage the tokens of a holder, including revoking delegation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What happens if a delegate who was removed for inactivity wants to return?</strong></p>\n<p>If a delegate is removed for not voting but becomes active again, we would welcome them back. Their previous removal does not prevent them from participating again if they resume their responsibilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How many delegates are expected to be in the incentivization program?</strong></p>\n<p>It is important to note that this is a personal estimate, as this is a pilot program and clarity will improve after its completion. However, it is anticipated that there will be approximately 4 to 6 delegates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Will the framework change in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, this is a pilot cycle, and there will certainly be opportunities to improve the framework based on the experience gained over six months. This is one reason for collaborating with the Agora team, as they are considered one of the strongest teams in user experience and governance in Web3.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>23 posts - 16 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/establish-a-public-delegate-platform-and-delegate-incentivization-program/7858\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/establish-a-public-delegate-platform-and-delegate-incentivization-program/7858","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 07:09:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7858"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/establish-a-public-delegate-platform-and-delegate-incentivization-program/7858.rss","#text":"Establish a Public Delegate Platform and Delegate Incentivization Program"},"filter":false},{"title":"Rated Labs Replacement in the Oracle Set","dc:creator":"hhrated","category":"Node Operators","description":"<p>Rated Labs will be departing from the Lido oracle set, with the transition expected to occur in Q3 2024.

I am writing this post to provide more clarity to contributors of other projects who want to collaborate with Lido contributors and for the wider community to be able to cross-check if collaborations with protocols that claim collaborations with the DAO contributors are legit. Generally, those collaborations are listed on the <a href=\"https://lido.fi/lido-ecosystem\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Lido Ecosystem</a> page.</p>\n<p>In the attempt to create as safe as possible environment for community members and participants in DeFi, DAO contributors created primitives with a straightforward approach to collaborations.</p>\n<p>While security and technical compatibility practices are anchored and there is no flexibility, for community, alignment and usage metrics, most of the points should be covered but are not mandatory as it highly depends on the type or project in discussion.</p>\n<p>Please note these are unofficial guidelines for transparency and are not voted in by the DAO and are applicable for Protocol Relations Guild only.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#security-1\"></a><strong>Security</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thorough Security Audits:</strong> The project should have undergone comprehensive security audits by reputable firms. (For reference these are some of the auditing companies which Lido contributors have worked with and are considered high profile by the contributors: Statemind, Certora, Oxorio, ChainSecurity, SigmaPrime, Hexens, Trail of Bits, Halborn, and other similar reputable auditing companies). Any modification after the audit should be re-audited before it goes in the production.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparent Audit Reports:</strong> Audit reports should be publicly accessible and demonstrate a track record of addressing identified vulnerabilities promptly and effectively. Every smart contract needs to be verified on Etherscan (or similar block explorer where Etherscan is not present) and the code has to match the one from the commit hash mentioned in the latest audit report.</li>\n<li><strong>Strong Security Practices:</strong> Robust security measures should be in place for the minimization of risk and the effect in case of unwanted event. Where multisig is used as an admin role instead of a DAO, the signers should be transparent.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Bounties:</strong>(optional but highly recommended) Along with audits of the codebase, attractive bug bounty programs ensure that the code is regularly assessed by independent security professionals.

Although various venture capital funds are also named defendants in the Complaint, none are responding as or on behalf of Lido DAO, and in fact they are denying they are part of Lido DAO. Thus, the risk of a default judgment against Lido DAO is real if a response is not filed by “Lido DAO”.</p>\n<p>Lido DAO has never characterized itself as a partnership, unincorporated association or other legal entity, and lacks many of the common features of a partnership (such as the alleged ‘partners’ knowing who one another are and a sharing of the profits and losses of an enterprise). There is no partnership agreement or other legal document providing for explicit mechanisms for Lido DAO to appear in or appoint a representative in a litigation. Nevertheless, because Lido DAO is alleged to be such an entity (specifically, a general partnership) in this complaint, Lido DAO tokenholders should pass this vote to enable someone to argue that Lido DAO has not been and cannot be served properly, is not a general partnership or other legal entity, is not a proper defendant to this lawsuit, and that the case should be dismissed.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, this proposal, without admitting and expressly disagreeing that Lido DAO is a partnership, association or other legally cognizable group or entity, is to appoint and fund Dolphin CL, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Dolphin”) to engage legal counsel (currently expected to be Brown Rudnick, led by partner Stephen Palley) and make a limited appearance as “Lido DAO” in the aforementioned case and, without admitting jurisdiction of the court or any other adverse legal fact (including but not limited to the notion that Lido DAO is a legal person), make all necessary or desirable legal arguments to cause the case to be dismissed against Lido DAO on any grounds deemed reasonable, appropriate and non-prejudicial by Dolphin and its counsel. The requested funding is 200,000 DAI, which is expected to be sufficient to pay Dolphin and its legal counsel for services sufficient to draft, file and argue in favor of a motion to dismiss the Complaint as it pertains to Lido DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>\n<p>There are two types of risks relating to the proposal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Risk of Not Passing the Proposal.<br>\nIf “Lido DAO” does not make filings in the case, there is a risk the court will enter a default judgment against “Lido DAO” due to no response to the Complaint being filed. While the ultimate implications of this would be unclear (in part because the legal status of ‘Lido DAO’ is unclear), in a recent case by the CFTC against Ooki DAO, the CFTC obtained a court order for the collection of damages from Ooki DAO and ordering “any third party providing web-hosting or domain-name registration services to shut down the Ooki DAO’s website and remove its content from the internet,” which has resulted in successful takedowns of Ooki-DAO-related web2 infra.<br>\nOn the other hand, a default judgment likely cannot be entered until the case is fully concluded against all parties, and the other parties to the litigation–if they are not dismissed from the case per their motions–would presumably continue litigating in their own defense for some time, even if Lido DAO does not appear to defend itself. However and even though those defendants have an excellent track record of supporting the blockchain industry, none of them are responding to the case as if they <em>are</em> part of Lido DAO, and due to potentially conflicting fiduciary duties there can be no guarantee their arguments will be crafted toward sustainability of Lido DAO and the systems it governs, versus being tailored to eliminate their own likelihood of liability or garnering an early dismissal of themselves from the case while leaving Lido DAO itself as a defendant.<br>\nIf a default judgment is ultimately entered against Lido DAO, we cannot predict whether the court would enter similar orders in this case to those in Ooki DAO (one notable difference is that the plaintiffs here are class-action attorneys, not a government agency), but it is a material risk–particularly if the default judgment is weaponized to cause third parties to deny Lido-DAO-related access to web2 infrastructure, to delist LDO from trading venues, etc.<br>\nFurthermore, third-parties could seek to use a default judgment against Lido DAO or other parties in other legal actions. This can occur via the doctrine of res judicata or non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel which has sometimes been used by the SEC and other regulators. These doctrines are complex so it is not guaranteed they will apply–for example, it could be argued that “Lido DAO” lacks a fair opportunity to litigate here or that the remedies are sufficiently different that res judicata principles would not apply. But a court may ultimately disagree and may apply such doctrines adversely to Lido DAO.<br>\nGenerally, a default judgment is a potential attack vector against Lido DAO and the systems it governs. While there may be various counterattacks to the judgment at various stages, and enforcing the judgment may be difficult for the plaintiffs, it is better if the attack vector does not materialize in the first place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Risks of Passing the Proposal<br>\nThe main risk of passing the proposal is that the claimant in this case might try to build an argument that Lido DAO is capable of being a litigant and therefore should be viewed as legal person that can ultimately suffer an adverse judgment. However, in the Ooki DAO case, the Ooki DAO took the strategy of having no one appear for the DAO, and this fact in itself did not help Ooki DAO—it was still deemed to be a cognizable legal person and still suffered a default judgment and had critical web2 infra dismantled by government orders levied against third parties.<br>\nA second general risk is that if Lido DAO appears and is not dismissed from the case, Lido DAO will face additional expenses and risks as the litigation proceeds. By contrast, if no response is entered for Lido DAO and the other defendants are not dismissed, the other defendants may keep litigating the case and Lido DAO could ‘free ride’ on their efforts to some extent (albeit there is no guarantee their arguments will be optimal for Lido DAO).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>About Dolphin CL, LLC</strong></p>\n<p>Entity Name: Dolphin CL, LLC<br>\nEntity Type: Limited liability company<br>\nJurisdiction: Delaware</p>\n<p><strong>About Brown Rudnick/Stephen Palley</strong></p>\n<p>Stephen Palley is a litigation partner and co-chair of Brown Rudnick’s Digital Commerce group and leads its Digital Assets disputes practice.

It employs the Interest Rate Swap model specifically for LRT assets.</li>\n<li>Maison aims to facilitate the integration of RYS (Re-Staking Yield Swap) assets with Symbiotic stETH LRTs and protocol-based stablecoins.</li>\n<li>Maison plans to launch a loyalty program for new stETH LRTs to ensure consistent liquidity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Background Overview</h2>\n<p>After the liquid staking era, there has been growth in re-staking assets and Pendle-like yield generation protocols. We also see different staked assets developed based on ETH with different yield generation models, etc. Here, we see an opportunity for alternative asset generations that help hedge risk, get yield, and not be frustrated with the choice of fixed or floating rates.</p>\n<p>Our solution is based on well-known and time-tested models.</p>\n<p><strong>1. First, let’s take a look at the Interest Rate Swap.</strong></p>\n<p>An interest rate swap is a forward contract in which one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for another based on a specified principal amount.</p>\n<p>Interest rate swaps usually involve exchanging a fixed interest rate for a floating rate, or vice versa, to reduce or increase exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or to obtain a marginally lower interest rate than would have been possible without the swap.</p>\n<p><em>Interest rate swaps (IRS) notional outstanding increased by 12.5% to $465.9 trillion, accounting for 81.2% of total IRD notional outstanding.</em></p>\n<p><strong>2. Second. It launched an Interest Rate Swap asset: Staking Yield Swaps from BitMEX.</strong></p>\n<p>It is a simple, elegant, and working model, but it was launched in lousy market conditions (it was announced less than a month after the FTX crash), with no market for such assets (no re-staking, no Pendle-like protocols)</p>\n<p><strong>3. Third, Symbiotic Re-Staking</strong></p>\n<p>Re-Staking introduces the next evolution in the Re-Staking Yield Swap markets. Over half of the staked ETH is managed by liquid Re-Staking providers, generating new assets fundamental to the emerging Re-Staking Yield Swaps market.</p>\n<h3>Integration Proposal</h3>\nWe propose launching the Maison protocol's derivatives, the Re-Staking Yield Swap solution, as part of the Lido Alliance. This would grant Re-Staking users access to a new derivatives market built on Symbiotic’s AVS project assets. Lido DAO can expect the usage of stETH as Maison collateral through loyalty programs or specific Symbiotic multipliers, enhancing utility and engagement.\n<h2>Protocol overview</h2>\n<p>This derivative lets traders swap the variable yield from staking LSTs or stablecoins on platforms like Symbiotic, Ethena, Etherfi, Swell, Mind, and others for a fixed interest rate and vice versa. Depending on their position, traders can either pay or receive the fixed rate, offering new opportunities for hedging and speculation on staking yields. Contracts expire quarterly and have specific trading conditions and fees.</p>\n<p>Generally, Re-Staking Yield Swaps (RYS) or Maison RYS are financial instruments that allow users to exchange the variable yield from staking cryptocurrencies for a fixed interest rate and vice versa. This helps traders and investors manage risks and speculate on staking yields.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Re-staking Protocols (Swell, Mind, Etherfi):</strong><br>\nUsers can swap the variable yields from these re-staking protocols for a fixed yield, offering hedging against yield volatility.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Stablecoin Projects (Ethena):</strong><br>\nSimilar swaps can be created for yields from stablecoin projects. Cross-swaps between ETH yields and stablecoin yields can provide diversified trading options.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\nVariable vs. Fixed Yields: Swap the variable staking rewards for a predictable fixed interest rate. The launch of RYS contracts introduces new avenues for trading and hedging, enabling users to speculate on the value of Re-Staking and rewards. This aligns with our commitment to enhancing platform versatility, with further expansions anticipated in the coming weeks and months.\n<p>During the life of a RYS contract, two interest rates are being “swapped” each day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The floating rate will be based on the variable yield from the staking. Every day at 12:00 UTC, a rebase happens – where staking rewards are accrued to the balance.</li>\n<li>The fixed rate represents a trader’s best guess of the average daily staking yield from the contract’s inception until maturity. It’s the rate that traders speculate on and will be annualized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Leverage: Potential to use leverage (e.g., up to 5x or higher) to amplify positions with careful risk management.</p>\n<p>In addition, traders can hold a position if they allocate enough margin to satisfy the maintenance margin requirement. Once this is not the case, the trader will be liquidated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quarterly Contracts: Standardized quarterly expiration for swaps.</li>\n<li>Risk Management: Strategies to handle yield fluctuations and ensure liquidity.\n<ul>\n<li>As for the slashing events, we can use the following event sequence:\n<ul>\n<li>Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitor validator performance to detect and respond to potential issues before they result in slashing.</li>\n<li>Alerting: We are presenting an alert about a slashing for a trader.</li>\n<li>Emergency position closing. Based on this event, we can execute emergency position closing with instant settlement based on the current market Funding position. The funding position recalculates at a moment’s notice of a slashing alert.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One main difference is that traders Pay or Receive the fixed rate on a swap contract rather than Buy or Sell:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Payer pays the fixed rate and receives the floating rate. In other words, the trader has entered a long position.</li>\n<li>The Receiver will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate. In other words, the trader has entered a short position.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p><strong>Symbiotic RYS:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variable Yield Source: Symbiotic staking returns.</li>\n<li>Swap Mechanism: Smart contracts allow users to receive a fixed yield in exchange for their variable yield.</li>\n<li>Leverage: Up to 5x leverage.</li>\n<li>Risk Management: Hedging strategies and collateral requirements.</li>\n<li>Expiration: Quarterly contracts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A trader who has staked wstETH on Symbiotic – and also received fixed on a swap contract – will net receive the fixed rate on their staked wstETH (thus converting the uncertain daily variable rate that is derived from staking wstETH on Symbiotic into a known fixed rate).</p>\n<p>So, say, a trader paid 3% on 1 ETH notional of wstETH RYS contracts. If the floating rate for a particular day is 3.5%, the net amount received by the trader will be:</p>\n<p><code>1 ETH x (3.5% – 3%) x (1 / 365) = 0.000013699 ETH.</code></p>\n<h2>Asset Specification</h2>\n<p>Maison Re-Staking Yield Swap (RYS) Contracts resemble traditional Interest Rate Swaps but differ significantly from perpetual swaps. Unlike perpetual swaps, RYS Contracts are not directly linked to an underlying index, allowing their trading prices to diverge considerably from the index value. This structure gives users unique opportunities and flexibility in trading and hedging strategies.</p>\n<h3>Mechanics of RYS Markets</h3>\nTraders can make or lose money when trading RYS through two mechanisms: PnL Realization and Floating Funding payments.\n<ul>\n<li>Multiplier: Defines the worth of one contract.</li>\n<li>Position Marking: Yield contracts are marked using the Last Price, which determines Unrealised PNL and liquidations.</li>\n<li>Initial and Maintenance Margin: These levels dictate allowable leverage and when liquidation occurs.</li>\n<li>Floating Funding: Positions open during Floating Funding (every 24 hours) will pay or receive funding settled against the Average Entry Price.\n<ul>\n<li>Long traders will pay a fixed rate (their average entry price) and receive the Floating Funding Rate.</li>\n<li>Short traders will receive a fixed rate (their average entry price) and will pay the Floating Funding Rate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Settlement: The expiry date varies per instrument, as the specifications show.</li>\n<li>Basis refers to the contract’s premium or discount compared to the underlying Reference Index due to future expected funding payments and settlements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Floating Funding Index: Observing this index provides insights into current and historical contract funding rates.</p>\n<h3>Position Size and Price Marking</h3>\n<p>The Position Value for RYS contracts depends on the number of days remaining on the swap and the Average Entry Price.</p>\n<p><code>Position Value = Number of contracts * Multiplier * Average Entry Price * days until expiry / 365</code></p>\n<p><code>Mark Value = Number of contracts * Multiplier * Mark Price * days until expiry / 365</code></p>\n<p><code>Unrealized PnL = Mark Value - Position Value</code></p>\n<p>When closing a position, the Pnl that is realized depends on the number of days remaining on the swap as well as on the Average Entry Price and Exit Price:</p>\n<p><code>PnL  = Position Exit Value - Position Entry Value</code></p>\n<h3>Floating Funding</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Funding Interval: Floating Funding is applied every 24 hours at 12:00 UTC. You are subject to Floating Funding only if you maintain an open position at this time. Closing your position before this interval means you won’t incur or receive any funding.</li>\n<li>Fees: Maison imposes a fee of 0.001% on Floating Funding transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use the (Asset) staking yield index (APR) we collect from protocols.</p>\n<p><code>APR = ((Last Reward - Previous Reward) / (Previous Reward)) * (1 / Time Elapsed)</code></p>\n<h2>Trading core specification</h2>\n<p>We have a <strong>mainnet Ethereum asset layer, and we are using an on-chain orderbook hosted on an Optimism-based Appchain with Celestia DA</strong> that manages the matching and settlement layer On-chain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Order Placement: Users sign and place orders through the Off-Chain Order Manager, which batches the orders and directs orders in one batch to the Order Management Contract.</li>\n<li>Off-Chain Order Manager sends events to lock balances on a collateral smart contract to prevent double-spending and balance withdrawal.</li>\n<li>The order Management Contract accepts batches, validates orders and forwards them to the OrderBook Contract for insertion. Also, the order Management Contract manages pairs of RYS assets.</li>\n<li>OrderBook Management: The OrderBook Contract maintains orders in separate bids and asks trees, allowing for efficient management and retrieval.</li>\n<li>Order Matching: The batch post triggers the Matching Engine Contract. It checks for matchable orders in the bid, asks for trees, executes trades appropriate to the collateral contract (settlement to update the balance), triggers the Off-Chain Order Manager to unlock collateral, and updates the order book.</li>\n<li>Order Querying: Users can query order data for display, analysis, or to inform trading decisions. While detailed order data might require interaction with the blockchain, much of the querying for display purposes can be offloaded to off-chain systems that listen to event logs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2> Security</h2>\n<p>We partner with esteemed security professionals and audit firms like Hallborn, Hacken, and Hypernative.

Given the timelines of other parties that will potentially be involved, if the Vault moves forward, it is expected that the implementation will occur in an expedited manner.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"background-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#background-1\"></a>Background</h2>\n<p>In light of the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/regoose-updated-goals-for-lido-in-the-light-of-mvi-and-restaking/7462\">recently updated ReGOOSE goals</a> and as mentioned in the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549\">Simple DVT Expansion proposal</a>, research has been underway in regards to a strategy that could be used to increase the decentralization of the Lido Node Operator set and by leveraging the addition of DVT based validators from Obol &amp; SSV Network.</p>\n<p>Since SSV Network’s mainnet launch, the protocol has seen significant success, partially boosted by its mainnet incentives program. Currently, SSV Network has 24,992 active validators representing over $2.8B of ETH staked, all of which are eligible to receive SSV token incentives.</p>\n<p>In the coming weeks, the Obol team plans to announce a contributions program in conjunction with their <a href=\"https://blog.obol.tech/1-percent-for-decentralisation/\">1% for Decentralization retroactive funding initiative</a>. Stake that is deployed on Obol DVs will contribute 1% of their staking rewards to the retroactive fund. The expectation for Liquid Staking Protocols is that potential future Obol incentives will be allocated to stakers by taking into account the contributions made on the relevant staking platform.</p>\n<p>Within Lido Simple DVT, <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/41\">Obol clusters</a> are about to start the process of scaling their validators while the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/38\">first SSV Network clusters</a> are expected to go live in the coming weeks, with scaling to follow soon after.</p>\n<p>The Snapshot vote for Expanding the Simple DVT Module <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xaca2da3c932542e030db8bf5b6e4420bf4aa98bd57bd62b9b8008a4b7398abb2\">successfully passed through governance</a>, and an on-chain Aragon vote to raise the share limit of the module to 4% is expected in the next two weeks. This proposal has also greenlit the creation of Super Simple DVT clusters, that would allow for quicker scaling of both Obol- and SSV-based DVT clusters via the Simple DVT Module over the next two months.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposal-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#proposal-2\"></a>Proposal</h2>\n<p>Given the additional capacity soon to be available within the Simple DVT Module, the upcoming launch of Obol’s contributions program, and recent revamp of SSV’s incentive program, an opportunity has been presented that can 1. Quicken the adoption pace of DVT via the Simple DVT module, leading to a more <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549/9\">secure, resilient, and decentralized</a> Node Operator set and 2. Drive net-new deposits to the protocol.</p>\n<p>One way to manage the process is to use some intermediary “vault” solution to serve as a focal point for both user deposits and DVT provider incentives.</p>\n<p>The vault strategy would offer capital allocators (stakers) the ability to deposit ETH or WETH into what would be called the Decentralized Validator Vault. This (W)ETH would be staked via Lido, with stakers earning the normal staking rewards from the protocol. 90% of the incentives generated via the Lido protocol Obol &amp; SSV Network validators could be allocated to depositors of the vault, with the remaining 10% allocated to the Node Operators in their corresponding SSV &amp; Obol Simple DVT clusters.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"why-do-this-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#why-do-this-3\"></a>Why Do This?</h2>\n<p>The combination of the expansion of the Simple DVT Module, the launch of Obol’s contribution program, and re-work of SSV’s incentive program presents an opportunity for the DAO to increase the resilience of the Lido Node Operator set via DVT, drive a material amount of net-new deposits into the protocol, and offer capital allocators access to incentives that they otherwise would not receive (as SSV &amp; Obol incentives are based on running validators).</p>\n<p>With the Simple DVT Module expanded to 4%, there will be capacity for 11,868 validators evenly split between Obol and SSV over the coming months. Excluding the 60 active validators running through Simple DVT currently, this suggests capacity for an incremental 377,856 ETH of deposits into the protocol to fill the capacity of the Simple DVT Module.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"vault-mechanics-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#vault-mechanics-4\"></a>Vault Mechanics</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"structure-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#structure-5\"></a>Structure</h3>\n<p>The vault could be introduced and curated by a DeFi protocol, integrating functionality to drive deposits to the Lido protocol and the ability to show monthly snapshots of the allocated points to individual stakers utilizing the vault.</p>\n<p>The capacity of the vault would be controlled via the administrator of the vault (depending on the vault design), reflecting the current depositable capacity of the Simple DVT Module, with an up to 10% additional buffer. These parameter changes would reflect when key limits of clusters within the Simple DVT Module are raised, as explained in the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/1\">Simple DVT Proposal</a> and <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549/7\">Expansion Proposal</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"incentives-eligibility-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#incentives-eligibility-6\"></a>Incentives Eligibility</h4>\n<p>Similar to the current <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/rewards-share-program-2024/6812\">rewards share program</a>, and in order to dissuade possibly deleterious effects to the protocol due to farming incentives, it is suggested that analysis be conducted on vault depositors. In order to be eligible to receive full vault incentives for the capital provided, depositors must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Hold a position for a minimum of 3 days in the vault through the conclusion of the Snapshot period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not unstake existing stETH or wstETH that is then re-staked via the vault from the moment of vault launch. The incentives are calculated on the base of ETH deposited to and persisting within the vault during the relevant snapshot period minus any stETH withdrawn after the launch of the vault.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not sell existing stETH on DEXs/CEXs: this condition does not expel a depositor from all incentives, but reduce corresponding amount of capital provided by the volume of sold ETH. Similar to the above, the incentives would be calculated on the base of non-swapped ETH deposited to and persisting within the vault during the relevant snapshot period.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#summary-7\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>With the expansion of the Simple DVT module imminent, it is an opportune time to consider utilizing both Obol and SSV’s mainnet contributions and incentivization programs to quicken the pace of DVT based validators being added to the protocol.</p>\n<p>This strategy would allow for a faster flow of Simple DVT validators being activated, for capital allocators to access DVT provider incentives, and most importantly, hasten the pace that DVT is rolled out across the expanded Simple DVT Module.</p>\n<p>Parties interested in providing the infrastructure required for such a DVT vault are asked to respond to this post, noting that there is an expedited timeline due to the estimated launch of DVT provider incentive programs.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Lido Alliance with relevant infrastructure capabilities, the Mellow team has been made aware of this discussion post and asked to provide a public showing of interest if they believe they are capable of providing a solution that would cover the above listed requirements. However, this does not preclude another party from expressing interest.</p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/discussion-the-decentralized-validator-vault/7729\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/discussion-the-decentralized-validator-vault/7729","pubDate":"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 19:18:12 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7729"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/discussion-the-decentralized-validator-vault/7729.rss","#text":"Discussion: The Decentralized Validator Vault"},"filter":false},{"title":"RockLogic Monthly Notes - 06/2024","dc:creator":"Vithya","category":"Node Operators","description":"<p>Dear Lido Community,</p>\n<p>Welcome to our monthly news, where we provide you with updates on our efforts to establish a secure Ethereum environment.

Commitments are backed by economic assurances, not by trusted intermediaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Credible</strong>: Because Bolt is proposer-centric, they can be fully held accountable for their commitments. In case of breaches, proposers can be penalized, which ensures the credibility of the commitments.</li>\n<li><strong>Permissionless</strong>: Any proposer can opt-in to the protocol, and any user can request commitments from them. No central authority is needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Compatible</strong>: Bolt is designed to be compatible with the existing PBS pipeline, and eventually ePBS. From the proposer’s perspective, the only change needed is an additional sidecar.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Guided by these principles, we believe Bolt is an effective preconf solution for Lido Node Operators and Ethereum as a whole.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For Ethereum:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bolt accelerates Ethereum’s roadmap</strong> towards stronger censorship resistance properties (Inclusion Lists, PEPC), de-fragmentation (based sequencing), and fast UX (preconfs), without relying on trusted intermediaries.</li>\n<li>Bolt’s <strong>permissionless nature makes it unopinionated</strong> in the current relay and builder market competition. Having an opinionated solution that could potentially favor specific relays or builders is fundamentally unhealthy for Ethereum.</li>\n<li>Bolt’s <strong>proposer-centric credibility</strong> ensures Ethereum does not increase its reliance on trusted entities within the block-production pipeline. This is important so as not to add to existing centralizing pressures.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>For Lido Node Operators:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bolt is economical and easy to integrate for node operators.</strong> Bolt is implemented out-of-protocol and is compatible with the existing block production pipeline.</li>\n<li><strong>Bolt is expressive and future-proof.</strong> Bolt is designed to cover multiple block-space use-cases, while also remaining compatible with the potential transition towards ePBS.</li>\n<li><strong>Bolt is fault-tolerant.</strong> Bolt has an embedded fallback block building mechanism as a last resort to ensure that relays and builders aren’t critical to the proposers’ operation.</li>\n<li><strong>Validators do not need to rely on trusted relationships</strong> to make commitments to further monetize their blockspace.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"bolt-v1-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#bolt-v1-4\"></a>Bolt V1</h2>\n<p>Bolt V1 will support inclusion preconfirmations.

To enable it, proposers must point their beacon node <code>builder-api</code> to the sidecar’s endpoint. From the perspective of the beacon node, the sidecar will look like a regular external block builder.</p>\n<p>The sidecar is responsible for the following tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receiving &amp; validating commitment requests from users through the <code>commitments-API</code></li>\n<li>Turning commitments into constraints and communicating them downstream</li>\n<li>Proposing a safe fallback block in case of any faults</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"modified-mev-boost-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#modified-mev-boost-6\"></a>Modified <code>mev-boost</code></h3>\n<p>The modified <code>mev-boost</code> client will implement the <code>constraints-API</code> and verify those constraints against incoming builder bids, which will have proofs attached. For more information on how proofs and verification will work, see the <a href=\"https://chainbound.github.io/bolt-docs/security/proofs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proofs</a> section.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"registry-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#registry-7\"></a>Registry</h3>\n<p>The Bolt Registry is the smart contract that keeps track of opted-in proposers and their associated stake. The responsibilities of the registry include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registering new proposers via an EOA, verifying their authenticity cryptographically (see the unfinalized <a href=\"https://chainbound.github.io/bolt-docs/architecture#opt-in-procedure-for-proposers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">opt-in procedure</a> below)</li>\n<li>Accounting for the proposer’s stake/collateral, potentially including restaked capital</li>\n<li>Removing proposers that no longer wish to participate in Bolt (with a cooldown period)</li>\n<li>Providing read access to the proposer set (useful for the Bolt RPC and Challenger components)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"bolt-rpc-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#bolt-rpc-8\"></a>Bolt RPC</h3>\n<p>The Bolt RPC will be a public RPC endpoint that will proxy requests from users to opted in proposers according to the lookahead and provide additional functionality like DoS protection and rate limiting. The Bolt RPC will be a separate process from the proposer, and anyone can run one. Proposers can configure the Bolt sidecar to point to their preferred Bolt RPC</p>\n<p>Please refer to our <a href=\"https://chainbound.github.io/bolt-docs/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">technical documentation</a> for more details about Bolt’s architecture, commitment types, use cases, and more!</p>\n<h3><a name=\"delegation-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#delegation-9\"></a>Delegation</h3>\n<p>Bolt’s architecture allows proposers to delegate the task of providing commitments to a trusted third party. This can be achieved by signing a permit message that allows the third party to submit commitments on their behalf. They then have to point their <code>builder-API</code> to the third party’s <code>bolt-sidecar</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>We defer to individual validators, larger node operators, and staking pools on their own policies towards delegation. For example, the allowance of delegation can be addressed within Lido’s <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/No2SULzlSVytoWOJ2Wqa7g?view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethereum Block Proposer Reward Policy.</a> It should be noted that delegation leads to a fully trusted relationship. If the operator commits a fault, the proposerr will get penalized.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"onboarding-process-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#onboarding-process-10\"></a>Onboarding Process</h3>\n<p>The onboarding process requires proposers to opt-into the Bolt protocol. This has two parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Off-chain Validator signature Authentication</strong></p>\n<p>Validators need a signature to validate preconfirmation requests. The exact authentication method is still an open research topic, but <strong>Bolt plans to support a variety of signing methods, such as the Commit Boost signing manager.</strong> Proposers, and their respective key managers, will interact with a commit-boost’s signing manager and proxy key scheme to both authorize respective validators and authenticate commitments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Opt-in Procedure</strong></p>\n<p>Once registered, proposers must post some form of collateral to guarantee economic credibility behind their preconfirmations. The specific method in which this is achieved is left as an open point for now.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are actively looking for validators to take part in Cohort 1 for testing and demoing Bolt. We believe Lido node operators would make ideal partners here. Please reach out if you would like to participate.</p>\n<p><em>Side-note: An experimental (not part of the poc) on-chain registration process could work as follows:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>The Proposer signs a message with their withdrawal address private key to signify that they are requesting to opt-in. The message will need to contain the Ethereum address that the proposer intends to use as signer to authenticate individual preconfirmation requests. This way, proposers in Bolt will have a separate identity from their validators private key.</em></li>\n<li><em>The Proposer sends a transaction to the Registry, requesting to opt-in to Bolt. The transaction must be sent from the same address that was specified in the signed message, which must be passed in the transaction’s data. This way, the ownership of this new ECDSA key-pair is proven on-chain.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"security-culture-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#security-culture-11\"></a>Security Culture</h2>\n<p>The Bolt protocol will be open-sourced and audited allowing for rigorous internal and external examination of all Bolt components. Bolt is designed to be simple and minimal. Along with a modified mev-boost client, Bolt only introduces 2 additional off-chain components: a sidecar and an RPC.</p>\n<p>Chainbound will collaborate with external parties for both on-chain and off-chain components. For example, Bolt can utilize existing battle-tested restaking modules.</p>\n<p><strong>Additionally, Bolt’s interface and standards will be a collaborative output from many teams thinking about similar solutions.</strong> Chainbound will provide maintenance, monitoring and, analytics for continued transparency, integrity, and security of Bolt.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"lido-alliance-chainbound-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#lido-alliance-chainbound-12\"></a>Lido Alliance &lt;&gt; Chainbound</h2>\n<p>Lido’s reGOOSE states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Internalize validator services that align with Ethereum’s roadmap, starting with preconfirmations, without exposing stakers to additional risk</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bolt is not only: (1) a generalized proposer commitments protocol that can facilitate a variety of potential validator services, but also (2) designed with preconfirmations as the primary use case, and (3) aligned with Ethereum’s roadmap towards stronger censorship resistance guarantees, better UX, and defragmentation.</p>\n<p>Bolt does, however, rely on economic security, placing additional slashing risk on proposers. We find this path necessary when introducing proposer-centric commitments so as not to rely on trusted intermediaries. With that said, there are ways to either reduce proposer risk (which can come in the form of insurance funds) or increase rewards (yield) to compensate for said risk.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"lido-alliance-support-for-chainbound-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#lido-alliance-support-for-chainbound-13\"></a>Lido Alliance Support for Chainbound</h3>\n<p>Acceptance into the Lido alliance would be a direct endorsement for Chainbound and Bolt. With this endorsement, Chainbound would appreciate the convergence from Lido stakeholders around Bolt as one of the preconfirmation solutions to test and iterate over. For the Lido working group, Chainbound would appreciate direct collaboration and feedback on Bolt’s design choices, suggestions around auditors and firms, and continuous testing of the software.</p>\n<p>Helping bootstrap Validator Cohort 1, in particular with Lido Node Operators, would be an incredible help, along with ongoing assistance around validator adoption down the line.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"lido-alliance-alignment-collateral-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#lido-alliance-alignment-collateral-14\"></a>Lido Alliance Alignment Collateral</h3>\n<p>We at Chainbound are open to discussing the possibilities here.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"towards-a-proposer-centric-future-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#towards-a-proposer-centric-future-15\"></a>Towards a Proposer-centric Future</h2>\n<p>We hope the design decisions around our protocol reflect our desire to support and grow Ethereum, and therefore, help support Lido, a key steward of the Ethereum community. Proposer agency and trustless proposer commitments are core towards making Ethereum more censorship-resistant and usable.</p>\n<p>We are excited for Ethereum and Lido’s future and hope Bolt can play a part in that!</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-onboard-bolt-to-the-lido-alliance/7724\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-onboard-bolt-to-the-lido-alliance/7724","pubDate":"Tue, 18 Jun 2024 19:56:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7724"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-onboard-bolt-to-the-lido-alliance/7724.rss","#text":"Proposal: Onboard Bolt to the Lido Alliance"},"filter":false},{"title":"EIP-7251: Effects on Rewards & Risks","dc:creator":"Aleksandr_V","category":"General","description":"<p>Hi there!</p>\n<p><strong>The purpose</strong> of this thread is to collect discussion and community alignment with regards to support <code>EIP-7251: Increase the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE</code> in Lido protocol.</p>\n<p>Initially, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/mol_eliza\">@Mol_Eliza</a> and me conducted a study to evaluate the potential impact of this EIP on changes in APR and to assess how consolidation might influence the likelihood of penalties.</p>\n<p><strong>Analysis and Key Findings</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Impact on APR:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>In the event of EIP implementation, we may observe a slight increase in APR from 0.000094% to 0.001958%, depending on various network parameters and validator’s size.

As part of its path to decentralized governance, they have also announced the airdrop of the ZK token.</p>\n<p>Part of the airdrop was allocated to protocols that have deployed and built on their ecosystem with Lido DAO receiving an amount of <a href=\"https://github.com/ZKsync-Association/zknation-data/blob/main/zksync_native_project_list.csv#L52\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">8301475 ZK tokens</a>.</p>\n<p>There are no specified instructions for the DAO on how the airdrop should be distributed.

Our delegation will do its utmost to represent and embody our values to enhance Lido’s governance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> As <a href=\"https://lido.fi/scorecard\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido DAO’s purpose</a> is to “keep Ethereum decentralized, accessible to all, and resistant to censorship”, all of our initiatives and proposals will align with these same principles. Along with this position, and as the ecosystem continues to mature and be driven by its community, we will collaborate in the creation, iteration, and improvement of governance processes to ensure broader participation and that the system remains secure.</li>\n<li><strong>Community-Led Growth &amp; Sustainability:</strong> We will promote and support all initiatives that enable the growth, adoption, scalability, and innovation of Lido’s ecosystem. Our focus will be placed on ensuring that all growth initiatives are reliable, secure, and sustainable over time. We are willing to undertake “protocol activism” regarding Lido’s significance in the web3 ecosystem and our alignment with its guiding principles. We intend to focus and try our best efforts on onboarding and educating stakeholders, as well as advocating for Lido within the broader blockchain and DeFi communities.</li>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> We will always make sure that no DAO decisions will jeopardize the security of the protocol and thus harm users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"our-case-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#our-case-5\"></a><strong>Our case</strong></h1>\n<p>Lido’s innovative infrastructure has revolutionized staking by lowering barriers and boosting the entire crypto ecosystem. Its user-friendly design and elimination of asset locking have propelled Lido to hold ~30% of the <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ETH staking market</a>. This positions Lido’s future developments and challenges as potential tipping points for the entire ETH landscape. Being part of this space will enable us to be informed and continue understanding, building, and participating in the following verticals (among others):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Governance</strong>: The proposed Dual Governance framework -dynamic timelock and rage quit mechanisms- offers a promising balance between wstETH stakers and other stakeholders, ensuring an effective system of checks and balances and strong incentives alignment, representing LDO holders and protocol users’ interests. However, in search of achieving governance minimization, the social layer will remain a critical instance of the collective decision-making and consensus-building process, where a deep understanding of Lido will play a crucial role. Addressing and arbitrating potential disputes and misalignments between the different stakeholders is something that SEEDGov can help.</li>\n<li><strong>Alliances:</strong> We consider that the recently approved Lido Alliance framework comes as a solution in line with the current trends in the web3 ecosystem, effectively balancing efficiency and scalability. Allowing the community to decide on these partnerships ensures both transparency and tangible impact in the decision-making process. At this point, we can’t envision another solution that wouldn’t risk fracturing our ecosystem. SEEDGov consistently conducts research and maintains a global, comprehensive understanding of the DeFi ecosystem, enabling us to evaluate and assess potential partnerships for Lido.</li>\n<li><strong>L2 Expansion</strong>: From SEED we’re highly committed to advancing Lido’s mission of making staking simple, secure, and accessible to everyone. We consider that continuing to integrate wstETH native minting on diverse L2 ecosystems, including various rollups, can drive adoption and liquidity, enhancing an interconnected DeFi ecosystem. More presence on L2 protocols will enhance the overall UX, encouraging more users to stake their ETH and participate in Lido’s ecosystem.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"disclosure-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#disclosure-6\"></a><strong>Disclosure</strong></h2>\n<p>SEEDGov is a broad organization that not only encompasses communities in Latam, but also has high participation in some of the most prominent governances in the ecosystem such as <strong>Optimism, Arbitrum, Uniswap, Gnosis, Starknet, Everclear (Connext), and Maker</strong>. As mentioned above we come to Lido Governance to bring value, in case there is any conflict of interest, we will communicate it to the community members.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/seedgov-delegate-thread/7643\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/seedgov-delegate-thread/7643","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 15:37:49 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7643"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/seedgov-delegate-thread/7643.rss","#text":"SEEDGov Delegate Thread"},"filter":false}]}}}
