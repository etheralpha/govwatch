The auction is implemented on a L2 Rollup based off the OP Stack with minimal changes. The Auction is currently deployed and live on main net<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi#footnote-16018-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-16018-3\">[3]</a></sup> ethereum.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Validators simply need to connect to our new relay implementation, and run an updated Vouch or MEV Boost client. That is all the onboarding process really involves. There is no restaking, no risk to capital for the validators. This proposal would necessitate the adding of the new relay to the Relay must include the list for Lido validators. The onboarding process and current status is discussed more in the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#roadmap</span> section.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a name=\"call-market-mechanics-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#call-market-mechanics-3\"></a>Call Market mechanics</h3>\n<p>XGA facilitates the allocation of blockspace by dividing each block into two parts instead of selling it as a single monolithic entity. One part is designated for high-priority, time-sensitive transactions (⍺-blockspace), while the other is reserved for less urgent transactions (β-blockspace). This segmentation allows users to select the most cost-effective and suitable space for their needs, enhancing transaction efficiency and user value.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"mev-boost-compatibility-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#mev-boost-compatibility-4\"></a>MEV Boost compatibility</h4>\n<p>The second change includes the timing of sales. The first part of the block is sold through <em>mev-boost</em> as is common now for most blocks. The second part of the block is sold as a form of preconfirmation. That is, if a block gets minted at time <em>t</em>, the bottom part is sold in a pre-defined period before. This part is sold in a multi-unit way meaning that several bidders can win blockspace for this part.</p>\n<p>Winners of the <em>beta</em> part of block <em>b</em> can then submit their bundles before the block gets actually minted. <em>In effect, winners of the auction get an inclusion guarantee beforehand.</em> Winners simply “burn” their position on the L2 and submit their L1 transaction.</p>\n<p>In version 1.0, the final merging of alpha and beta portions of the block are handled by our specially designed relay.  This relay is live on mainnet at <a href=\"https://mainnet-auction.securerpc.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://mainnet-auction.securerpc.com</a>. Version 2.0 eliminates this privileged service requirement.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"validator-participation-without-slashing-or-loss-risk-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#validator-participation-without-slashing-or-loss-risk-5\"></a>Validator Participation without Slashing or Loss Risk</h2>\n<p>On the validator side, to participate, a validator must be permissioned to register with this service (the relay). Practically, the validator places the relay as a <em>privileged service</em>. This means that it will ignore bids from other relays during a defined time window, and if it fails to receive a valid response from our relay, it will then consider other bids from other relays. If the validator does not get a valid proposal from our relay, it then will pick the highest submitted block it has got from all other relays. Therefore, there is very little remunerative risk from the validator perspective. Any additional risk is covered by our “Captive Insurance” program, in which we cover any costs that are incurred due to assurance violations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This logic is to ensure against potential service disruptions causing losses for validators. It also provides an enforcement mechanism for the forward contracts to begin with without resorting to slashing. This is why validators must also be approved to register with the relay to participate for version 1.0.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a name=\"captive-risk-retention-protects-validator-revenue-and-capital-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#captive-risk-retention-protects-validator-revenue-and-capital-6\"></a>Captive Risk Retention protects Validator Revenue and Capital</h2>\n<p>Captive Risk Retention (or “Captive Insurance”) is our risk management protocol, which the primary purpose is to insure the risk related to the relay and auction. It provides a direct relationship between the insured and insurer, and is incentive aligned. The aim is to protect validator stake, earnings and market participants against service outages or other exogenous disruptions , ensuring continuity of potential profits and explicit protections for participating parties.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2.5% gross is taken from the ß-auction into the backstop fund. This amount can be adjusted. Should claims exceed the backstop fund, a pro rata charge is applied to the protocol vault of staked assets and liquidated into ETH to cover the shortfall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a name=\"coverage-scope-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#coverage-scope-7\"></a><strong>Coverage Scope</strong></h3>\n<h4><a name=\"service-downtime-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#service-downtime-8\"></a><strong>Service Downtime</strong></h4>\n<p>Provides compensation for any periods when the relay service is either inoperable or inaccessible.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"incorrect-or-malicious-proposals-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#incorrect-or-malicious-proposals-9\"></a><strong>Incorrect or Malicious Proposals</strong></h4>\n<p>Offers protection against losses arising from incorrect or malicious block proposals made by the relay.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"performance-degradation-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#performance-degradation-10\"></a><strong>Performance Degradation</strong></h4>\n<p>Ensures coverage in cases where the relay’s performance deteriorates significantly, affecting validator operations.</p>\n<p>The insurance protocol seeks to provide coverage against a validator not having access to both MEV Boost Auction and the XGA Auction. The MEV Boost auction is protected by failover capacity of 3rd party relays (as described earlier). So long as this mechanism is correctly working, this greatly limits the liability in terms of potential losses that  XGA could end up being on the hook for.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"additional-mev-improvements-and-integrations-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#additional-mev-improvements-and-integrations-11\"></a>Additional MEV Improvements and Integrations</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"buildersearcher-separation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#buildersearcher-separation-12\"></a>Builder/Searcher Separation</h3>\n<p>Searchers no longer need to vertically integrate with builders to enhance their inclusion rate. This is an important development in the market structure as it will lead to more truthful bidding (i.e. higher bidding). Searchers can now focus on their strategies without having to develop relationships with existing builder incumbents. Thus the barrier to entry is reduced, increasing competition overall and leading to higher validator MEV reward share.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"contract-bidding-strategies-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#contract-bidding-strategies-13\"></a>Contract Bidding Strategies</h3>\n<p>By utilizing smart contracts for bidding and introducing a novel tie-breaking rule that emphasizes competitive pressure over simple high bids, the platform encourages fairer pricing and maximizes the value obtained from each auction. This has the added benefit of providing a way for smaller participants to avoid the latency game of request-response based bidding (i.e. API based).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"blockscout-support-for-preconfirmations-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#blockscout-support-for-preconfirmations-14\"></a>Blockscout support for Preconfirmations</h3>\n<p>We are working with the Blockscout team to provide first class support for preconfirmations visualization and tracking for users out of the box.

Endorsement carries some risk for Lido, particularly with newer, untested protocols. However, the premise of the Alliance is precisely to be flexible enough to help emerging projects reach a new stage of growth. So what the endorsement process should focus on is whether the security culture of a project is sufficiently strong and whether the project has the right processes in place.</p>\n<p>As part of the review process, we wanted to share some illustrative questions that we would look to ask projects seeking Lido Alliance endorsement. These questions aim to provide a fuller picture of the security processes of a prospective member.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What are the processes for putting code into production?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the release flow from the security perspective?</li>\n<li>How does the team decide the code is ready for mainnet?</li>\n<li>Does the protocol have public audits?\n<ul>\n<li>Links:</li>\n<li>What parties conducted the audits?</li>\n<li>What’s the issue summary (total issues / total fixed / crits and highs / crits and highs fixed)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How is the deployment verified against the audit?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>What are the processes for managing security through TVL growth?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a bug bounty? if yes — which and where</li>\n<li>Are there limits / thresholds on the project / TVL?

Mellow Protocol offers a series of vault smart contracts tailored to different risk profiles, managed by curators. These vaults rely on the inherent flexibility, composability and security of both Ethereum and restaking providers to mitigate AVS risks effectively.</p>\n<p>The architecture of Mellow Protocol is engineered to adapt to the varying needs of its users while maintaining a high standard of security and transparency. By allowing permissionless LRT curation, Mellow enables depositors more flexibility regarding their desired level of exposure to risk, while still benefiting from the liquidity of staked assets. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting strategies within each vault based on real-time risk assessments and market conditions.</p>\n<p>Mellow’s smart-contract framework is built to be extensible, allowing for the seamless introduction of new features and vault types with minimal changes to the existing codebase. This ensures a low attack surface while facilitating the development of additional products and services.</p>\n<p>To further enhance its robustness and functionality, Mellow Protocol integrates with a variety of DeFi primitives and infrastructures. This integration provides best user experience, enabling seamless interaction with other financial tools and services within the ecosystem. Future iterations of Mellow Protocol are planned to include advanced features such as dynamic rebalancing of vault allocations to optimize risk-adjusted returns and minimize potential losses due to market volatility.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overview of Restaking\n<ul>\n<li>Through restaking protocols, stakers can choose to accept additional slashing conditions on their staked ETH for rewards from protocols whose state is secured by stakers’ assets.</li>\n<li>Typical design enables the validation of various modules, including consensus protocols for L2s and appChains, data availability layers, virtual machines &amp; application layers, creating new revenue opportunities for restakers.</li>\n<li>Restaking protocols share the abundant security of Ethereum consensus by spilling it over to these modules, enhancing the reliability of their consensus and adding extra revenue source to restakers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Launching LRTs will be permissionless for curators/users\n<ul>\n<li>Although LRTs permit delegation to multiple AVS operators, permissioned LRT holders and LRT node operators have little to no choice in how these delegation sets are formed or how risks are managed.</li>\n<li>Holders can only make adjustments by changing the amount of LRT to which they are exposed.</li>\n<li>Allowing LRT curators to issue new LRTs with refined risk/reward ratios in a permissionless manner makes the possibility of malfunctions causing ripple effects and liquidation cascades across the entire ecosystem remote and unlikely.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fees mechanism for curators\n<ul>\n<li>LRT curators are incentivized to set a competitive fee on restaking revenue.

This allows for thorough testing of each module’s logic. We achieve 100% test coverage for each component and perform internal audits, ensuring high code quality and robust security for each component.</p>\n<p>Upon completion, we assess potential edge effects that may arise when integrating various components, including external modules. Previously, when implementing ALM (automated liquidity management) strategies in Mellow, we developed integrations with other DeFi protocols, requiring a deep understanding of not only our own architecture but also that of integrated protocols like Aave and Uniswap. We’ve never had a single security incident.</p>\n<p>We collaborate with renowned security experts and audit firms, including Chainsecurity, Statemind, and Spearbit, and we only release code to production after it has passed external audits.</p>\n<p>Maintaining security for our on-chain products is equally critical. We use real-time monitoring systems, Grafana dashboards and alerting systems to ensure operational integrity, provide tools for problem diagnosis, and also make it a prerequisite to have a public bug bounty program.</p>\n<p>Our Incident Response and Recovery Policy outlines the procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents. It also details recovery steps, such as reverting to secure contract versions and notifying affected parties.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that our products have been operational for over 1.5 years without a single security incident.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"how-will-mellow-help-the-lido-alliance-achieve-its-mission-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#how-will-mellow-help-the-lido-alliance-achieve-its-mission-5\"></a>How will Mellow help the Lido Alliance achieve its mission</h1>\n<p>New integration with Mellow will benefit the whole Lido ecosystem and stakers, making stETH a one-stop vehicle for delegation to operators and different AVSes. stETH liquidity may be increased in addition to becoming prime LST vehicle available for onboarding to Mellow LRT.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum-alignment and commitment to decentralize validation\n<ul>\n<li>By participating in the wide restaking ecosystem, Mellow would help to spread the geographical and technical decentralization efforts Lido does outside Ethereum validation.</li>\n<li>As ETH has moved from Lido to EigenLayer, the weighted average node operator set has <a href=\"https://x.com/enshriningplebs/status/1792304095950242075\">become significantly more concentrated</a>, presenting a risk to decentralized validation</li>\n<li>By encouraging users to use stETH in Mellow, we hope to increase the level of validator decentralization in restaking, positively influencing Ethereum integrity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Use-cases for stETH adoption and integration\n<ul>\n<li>stETH users will find new opportunities to deposit their assets in a restaking marketplace that is more transparent and offers more granularity with regards to risk exposure</li>\n<li>stETH holders may benefit from exclusive opportunities for earning Mellow points</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Opportunities for node operators\n<ul>\n<li>Lido node operators could launch their own composable LRT and take control of the risk management process by selecting AVS’ suitable for their needs rather than face their imposition by LRTs or restaking protocols</li>\n<li>They could also collaborate with curators to reach the same outcome and create bespoke LRTs for their customers, based on stETH</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-mellow-expect-from-lido-alliance-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#what-does-mellow-expect-from-lido-alliance-6\"></a>What does Mellow expect from Lido Alliance</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Endorsement\n<ul>\n<li>Lido DAO’s acceptance of Mellow as a member of the Lido Alliance</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Integrations\n<ul>\n<li>Mellow expects Lido to integrate descriptions and links to deposits in Mellow UI in stETH into the Lido landing page.

In recent years, the Interchain has experienced tremendous growth in user experience, developer functionality, and market cap.</p>\n<p>Throughout this time, the Interchain has maintained a close connection with Ethereum through both its cultural values (decentralization and credible neutrality) and its technology stack. Notably, the Interchain stack has inspired the Ethereum development community to work on single-slot finality, protocol-enforced proposer commitments, application-specific rollups, Ethereum IBC, liquid staking modules, and more.</p>\n<p>To address the challenges of building Interchain DeFi applications, a team spun out of P2P to form Hadron Labs and helped launch Neutron, a secure, feature-rich smart contract platform capable of hosting <a href=\"https://blog.neutron.org/neutron-the-integrated-application-network-2944b2e2cade\">Integrated Applications</a> like Drop.</p>\n<p>Taking Neutron to market, Hadron Labs, in collaboration with Lido contributors, spearheaded the introduction of wstETH into the Interchain while prioritizing security and safeguarding the DAO against vendor lock-in. As part of this initiative, Hadron Labs and Axelar collaborated to deploy the<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-cosmos-initial-deployment/5338/2\"> initial bridge solution</a> and incentivize the adoption of the canonical wstETH standard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://drop.money\">Drop</a> is the spiritual successor of the Lido for the Interchain vision. Its software was initially developed by Hadron Labs engineers, and an independent Drop Foundation was incorporated to support the protocol’s long-term growth and development.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"protocol-overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#protocol-overview-4\"></a>Protocol Overview</h1>\n<p>Drop is a cross-chain liquid staking protocol implemented as an <a href=\"https://blog.neutron.org/neutron-the-integrated-application-network-2944b2e2cade\">Integrated Application</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.neutron.org/\">Neutron</a> network. Its <a href=\"https://cosmwasm.com/\">CosmWasm</a> smart-contract architecture leverages the <a href=\"https://ibc.cosmos.network/main\">Inter-Blockchain Communication</a> (IBC) protocol and Neutron’s <a href=\"https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-txs/overview\">Interchain Transaction</a> (ICTX) and <a href=\"https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-queries/overview\">Interchain Queries</a> (ICQ) capabilities to read the state of other blockchains and adjust delegations made by the protocol’s remotely controlled accounts.</p>\n<p>This architecture enables Drop to provide trust-minimized liquid staking services and scale with minimal additional overhead and risk: provided they are compatible with the IBC protocol, new networks and assets can be onboarded to the solution in a single transaction. The smart-contract components can be reused to provide new products and services (such as alternative LST models - rebasing, auto-compounding, bLuna-esque, etc.) with minimal or no additional code or attack surface.</p>\n<p>Since on-chain performance metrics such as uptime and governance participation can be retrieved in a trust-minimized manner through ICQs, Drop’s validator set management baseline can be automated:</p>\n<p>This frees up resources that can be invested in the active curation of excellent validator sets for the supported network. To further the decentralization of stake and infrastructure, the Drop DAO may incorporate off-chain considerations such as geography, infrastructure, and signing setups into its curation policy.</p>\n<p>Future iterations of Drop Protocol will likely implement Scaling Delegations, distributing stake across validators dynamically to maximize stake/infrastructure distribution, and to minimize slashing risks if an operator’s performance degrades.</p>\n<p>As an Integrated Application, Drop is synchronously composable with an array of DeFi primitives, including Duality (Neutron’s in-protocol orderbook), Astroport (Curve v2 style AMM), Mars (credit protocol enabling lending/borrowing, margin trading, and perps), Levana (perps), Apollo (vault strategies), Fission (yield splitting), Amulet (self-repaying loans), and more. This ecosystem forms a strong, coordinated set of use cases for Drop’s LSTs and their initial distribution, and provides a streamlined, synchronous UX for more advanced use cases such as delta-neutral or leveraged staking/farming.</p>\n<p>Drop is being integrated into key infrastructure and distribution channels such as the Skip API (the most widely used cross-chain router in the Interchain), Nexus (the leading bridge for TIA to Celestia rollups), and more to facilitate 1-click access to Drop’s LSTs from any network or application in the Interchain.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"how-will-drop-help-the-lido-alliance-achieve-its-mission-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#how-will-drop-help-the-lido-alliance-achieve-its-mission-5\"></a>How will Drop help the Lido Alliance achieve its mission?</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"ethereum-alignment-decentralized-validation-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#ethereum-alignment-decentralized-validation-6\"></a>Ethereum alignment / decentralized validation</h2>\n<p>Firstly, through its validator set management, Drop could contribute to the decentralization of data-availability layers (e.g. Celestia) and bridges (e.g. Axelar) that Ethereum rollups and wstETH rely on.</p>\n<p>As a more nimble DAO, Drop is likely to be the first to implement technologies that could prove valuable to Lido on Ethereum, such as scaling delegations, generating strategic insight and data on their effectiveness and trade-offs, and helping design and prioritize improvements to the core protocol.</p>\n<p>More broadly, Drop will contribute to the success of the Interchain, which has consistently generated research, innovation, and technologies that benefit Ethereum and its ecosystem, such as single-slot finality, protocol-enforced proposer commitments, application-specific rollups, Ethereum IBC, etc.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"use-cases-for-steth-adoption-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#use-cases-for-steth-adoption-7\"></a>Use cases for stETH adoption</h2>\n<p>Drop already allocates significant resources to helping design and build distribution and use cases for LSTs in the Interchain. Onboarding Drop to the Lido Alliance would empower Drop to actively drive the distribution and integration of wstETH alongside dAssets, and reduce the operational overhead and focus cost on Lido DAO contributors.</p>\n<p>Drop will contribute to the security, resilience, and user experience of the bridges upon which wstETH and dAssets depend. Thanks to its strategic proximity with the Cosmos Hub’s security aggregation, Mesh Security, and other key projects, it is also well positioned to sponsor the adoption of wstETH as restaking collateral in the Interchain.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Lido Alliance, Drop would be an ideal partner to explore restaking opportunities for wstETH. Drop’s architecture minimizes systemic risk to Lido on Ethereum, and incentive alignment between Lido and Drop would prevent the incentive to vampire attack that other providers may be tempted with.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Lido DAO could use Drop’s protocol architecture as a local outpost for Lido on Ethereum, enabling ETH to be staked with Lido on Ethereum remotely and conveniently.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"opportunities-for-node-operators-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#opportunities-for-node-operators-8\"></a>Opportunities for node operators</h2>\n<p>While inclusion in Lido on Ethereum’s set does not guarantee node operators will be onboarded to Drop’s validator sets, excellent operators that are active in both ecosystems may apply and be onboarded to Drop’s validator sets in the Interchain, driving adoption and strengthening alignment between Lido and its ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-is-drops-security-culture-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#what-is-drops-security-culture-9\"></a>What is Drop’s Security Culture?</h1>\n<p>Drop’s <a href=\"https://github.com/hadronlabs-org/drop-contracts\">codebase</a> is open-source and open-licensed. As a cross-chain protocol, Drop’s architecture minimizes the complexity of asynchronous interactions by following the principle of encapsulated complexity:</p>\n<p>Most protocol functions are broken down into minimal components, which can interface with one another according to strictly defined interfaces. This makes the protocol and its components formally verifiable and helps create a library of secure, battle-tested contracts. This prevents the creation of large, complex, monolithic contracts, which are harder to audit and reason about, and minimizes the risk of human error. It also enables basic components to be securely reused in different combinations to provide new products while minimizing code changes.</p>\n<p>Drop’s codebase has, and will continue to be, thoroughly tested throughout its development cycle. Drop employs both unit tests and comprehensive E2E tests using <a href=\"https://github.com/neutron-org/cosmopark\">cosmopark</a>. The framework’s purpose is to set up the most realistic testing environment possible by spinning up multiple networks, each with its own nodes and the same software versions as their mainnet counterparts, along with IBC channels and relayers, before conducting a battery of tests on the protocol.</p>\n<p>Drop recently completed its first audit with <a href=\"https://www.oaksecurity.io/\">Oak Security</a>, a leading CosmWasm auditing firm. The final audit report will be attached to this proposal upon release from Oak Security. A second audit is being scheduled with <a href=\"https://osec.io/\">OtterSec</a> ahead of launch.</p>\n<p>Starting on the 27th of May, Drop will also undergo formal verification by <a href=\"https://informal.systems/\">Informal Systems</a> using <a href=\"https://github.com/informalsystems/quint\">Quint</a>. This process aims to increase confidence in Drop’s design by ensuring that the system’s behavior—defined within a formal model—satisfies specific properties, which are also delineated in the formal model.</p>\n<p>An early version of Drop is currently deployed on <a href=\"https://docs.neutron.org/deployment/testnet\">pion-1</a>, Neutron’s persistent testnet. The protocol’s instance is being updated to match changes made as part of the Oak Security audit. Once Drop is deployed on mainnet, any further code or protocol parameters changes will be required to undergo comprehensive tests using <a href=\"https://github.com/hadronlabs-org/rehearsal\">Rehearsal</a>, a mainnet forking and testing tool that ensures tests are conducted within the context of the network’s existing state. Drop’s development team has an established set of practices for any on-chain operations through the process of creating detailed launch policies with the set of actions to be performed, check-lists, and emergency scenarios.</p>\n<p>Drop contributors are also setting up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for balance states, code versions, processing of the protocol’s buffers, validator performance, IBC channel statuses, and more. Lastly, granular kill switches have been implemented into the protocol, and an emergency playbook is being developed for the DAO. These kill switches enable the pausing of specific protocol functions to properly respond to any incident without unnecessarily hindering the user experience or third-party integrations.</p>\n<p>A bug bounty program with Immunefi will be set up shortly after mainnet deployment.</p>\n<p>As an Integrated Application on Neutron, Drop inherits the full economic security of more than $2bn ATOM restaked on the Cosmos Hub through <a href=\"https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/\">Replicated Security</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-drop-expect-from-the-lido-alliance-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#what-does-drop-expect-from-the-lido-alliance-10\"></a>What does Drop expect from the Lido Alliance</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Endorsement -

Now, SSV Network has <a href=\"https://explorer.ssv.network/\">nearly 21,000 mainnet validators</a> with a total value staked of over $2.4B. Obol has also expanded their mainnet reach, notably with an <a href=\"https://blog.obol.tech/decentralising-restaking-our-journey-with-etherfi/\">announcement with EtherFi</a> to launch 1,000 mainnet validators, and their recently announced <a href=\"https://blog.obol.tech/1-percent-for-decentralisation/\">1% for Decentralization Initiative</a> that is expected to drive further accessibility of their technology for Node Operators throughout the ecosystem over the coming months.</p>\n<p>While the Simple DVT Module has demonstrated the exciting potential of DVT, more can be done to supercharge the adoption of DVT via validators using the Lido protocol.</p>\n<p>Three constraints have been identified in the existing structure of the module that can be solved via this proposal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Due to the low number of validators per cluster at the current target share of 0.5%, Node Operators are unlikely to be profitable if the number of clusters are expanded,</li>\n<li>Due to the conservative timeline in scaling the number of validators these clusters run, a limited number of DVT based validators can be brought onto the protocol in the near-term, and</li>\n<li>Due to the unbonded nature of the participants in the current Simple DVT clusters, the maximum number of validators per cluster should be limited given the constituent make-up of these clusters.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Separately, research is currently being undertaken to understand how the adoption of Distributed Validator Technology may be used to drive additional value to stakers and the Lido protocol, specifically targeted towards the Simple DVT Module. In this event, additional capacity to onboard validators would likely be required, which can be covered by the combination of these two parts of the proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"component-1-scaling-72-simple-dvt-clusters-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#component-1-scaling-72-simple-dvt-clusters-3\"></a>Component 1: Scaling 72 Simple DVT Clusters</h2>\n<p>Currently, the Simple DVT Module has a target share of 0.5% of Lido stake. As of 21/5/24, this equates to approximately 1,420 validators to be split evenly across Obol and SSV Network clusters. With two LNOSG evaluation rounds and DAO discussion periods complete, 24 Obol clusters and 21 SSV clusters have been proposed for mainnet onboarding so far.</p>\n<p>Given the success of the Simple DVT testnets to date (<a href=\"https://blog.lido.fi/simpledvt-ssv-testnet-results/\">SSV</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.lido.fi/simpledvt-obol-testnet-results/\">Obol</a>) and the initial roll-out on mainnet (targeting at least 250 net-new Node Operators), it is expected that 36 clusters for each DVT provider could be onboarded to the protocol. However, due to the economic differences between running validators in a DV format from single operator run nodes, the current target share presents an issue.</p>\n<p>With current market dynamics, the average rewards for a Node Operator participating in Simple DVT is equivalent to approximately $30 per validator per year. Assuming an equal split of 24 Obol and SSV clusters, the module currently has capacity for each cluster to run approximately 29 validators. For some, this is not enough in terms of rewards to cover operational costs across hardware and time contributed.</p>\n<p>As a result, the proposed solution is to increase the target share of the module. With 2% of the updated target share allocated to the normal Simple DVT clusters, this would represent 5,690 validators to be split between these Obol and SSV clusters. Assuming 72 clusters in this format (36 for each provider), as of 21/5/24 this would represent approximately 80 validators per cluster.</p>\n<p>This would greatly improve the economics for participating operators (especially solo and community stakers) and at least cover the fixed costs for the majority of professional node operators. Meanwhile, the total number of validators that any one cluster would be running would still remain limited, taking into account the unbonded nature of these clusters and greater diversity of participant types.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of the DAO, the rewards structure would not change for these clusters from the existing reward share voted on in the Simple DVT Module proposal.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, the total reward share for the Simple DVT Module is 10%, with the Lido DAO receiving 2% of rewards. In the case of Obol clusters, Node Operators receive 7% (1% each), and Obol receives 1% of rewards. For SSV clusters, Node Operators receive 8% (1.14% each), however operators are responsible for paying the SSV Network Fees and to deposit initial collateral denominated in the SSV token as <a href=\"https://docs.ssv.network/learn/protocol-overview/tokenomics/fees\">outlined in the SSV Network technical documentation</a>.*</p>\n<p>It should be noted that Obol’s reward share supports their recently announced <a href=\"https://blog.obol.tech/1-percent-for-decentralisation/\">1% for Decentralization</a> initiative, a retroactive funding pool that rewards projects and innovations that promote Ethereum’s decentralization.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple DVT Cluster Rewards Share</strong></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Obol Clusters</th>\n<th></th>\n<th>SSV Clusters</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Total stETH Reward Share</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>Total stETH Reward Share</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Direct Treasury share</td>\n<td>2%</td>\n<td>Direct Treasury share</td>\n<td>2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Obol share</td>\n<td>1%</td>\n<td>SSV share*</td>\n<td>0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Node Operators share</td>\n<td>7%</td>\n<td>Node Operators share*</td>\n<td>8%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"component-2-adding-10-super-simple-dvt-clusters-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#component-2-adding-10-super-simple-dvt-clusters-4\"></a>Component 2: Adding 10 Super Simple DVT Clusters</h2>\n<p>While Point 1 of the proposal would expand the available capacity of DVT validators within the protocol, it is still constrained by higher operational load in terms of cluster onboarding as well as a more limited number of validators each cluster should support.</p>\n<p>To solve this, the proposal suggests the addition of 10 Super Simple DVT Clusters, 5 from Obol, and 5 from SSV Network, in addition to the normal Simple DVT clusters discussed above.</p>\n<p>These clusters would consist of members of the Curated Operator set along with Advanced Node Operators (ANOs), a classification that was discussed in the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625\">original Simple DVT Module proposal</a>. ANOs are participants that have demonstrated consistently strong performance from both a qualitative and quantitative standpoint during Simple DVT testnets and/or mainnet. As noted in the original proposal, any cluster running 100+ validators should contain at least 50% of the members with the ANO classification.</p>\n<p>The Lido Node Operator Subgovernance Group would meet to review performance of these operators using mainnet and/or testnet data, and propose the five clusters for each DV provider to the DAO, which would be followed with a week discussion period to consider the proposal, in-line with the existing flow of Simple DVT onboarding.</p>\n<p>In general, the initial ANOs would likely consist of mostly professional node operators, however solo and community stakers are also eligible for this classification.</p>\n<p>Once selected and reviewed by the DAO, these “Super Clusters” would be eligible to run up to 500 validators using the protocol. Key limits would initially start at 50 validators (compared to the initial ~1 week monitoring period in the Curated Node Operator set of 100 validators), and after a two week period a performance report would be shared with the DAO for review.</p>\n<p>If performance looks comparable to the overall operator set, a representative of the Simple DVT Module Committee would simultaneously begin a week-long discussion period to consider raising key limits for these clusters.</p>\n<p>In this format, 5,000 validators would be available for utilizing both Obol and SSV based DVT on mainnet (2,500 each) in an expedited format, while not compromising on the quality of Node Operators involved given that they would consist of members of the Curated Set and experienced Advanced Node Operators.</p>\n<p>From the economics perspective, given the larger number of validators these Super Clusters would operate, a change would be made to the rewards structure. From the module point of view, the existing rewards structure would remain in place. However, as Lido Simple DVT rewards are distributed in both Obol and SSV clusters via a set of splitter smart contracts, the DAO portion of rewards could be increased through the splitter mechanism.</p>\n<p>The proposed reward structure would consist of the following format: the direct DAO treasury reward share would remain at 2%, however an additional 2% would be added to the DAO treasury following reward distribution via the splitter contract. In Obol clusters, participants would receive 5% of rewards, and Obol would continue to receive 1%. In SSV clusters, participants would receive 6%, however they would still be responsible for paying the SSV Network Fees and to deposit initial collateral denominated in the SSV token as <a href=\"https://docs.ssv.network/learn/protocol-overview/tokenomics/fees\">outlined in the SSV Network technical documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Claiming from the splitter is permissionless, meaning any address could trigger the claim flow to the DAO treasury at any point following the stETH rebase. The splitter contracts would be deployed by contributors from Obol and SSV, with verification from Lido contributors to ensure addresses are properly configured. For more information about Simple DVT Reward distribution and the Obol wrapper and 0xsplits set of smart contracts, see the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/23#simple-dvt-reward-distribution-5\">Simple DVT Reward Distribution section of this post</a>.*</p>\n<p><strong>Super Simple DVT Cluster Rewards Share</strong></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Obol Clusters</th>\n<th></th>\n<th>SSV</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Total stETH Reward Share</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>Total stETH Reward Share</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Direct Treasury share</td>\n<td>2%</td>\n<td>Direct Treasury share</td>\n<td>2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Treasury share from splitter</td>\n<td>2%</td>\n<td>Treasury share from splitter</td>\n<td>2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Obol share</td>\n<td>1%</td>\n<td>SSV share*</td>\n<td>0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Node Operators share</td>\n<td>5%</td>\n<td>Node Operators share*</td>\n<td>6%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"onboarding-validator-scaling-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#onboarding-validator-scaling-5\"></a>Onboarding &amp; Validator Scaling</h2>\n<p>Onboarding and evaluations for participants covered in Component 1, the scaling of the existing cluster format would be unchanged from the current process described in the Simple DVT Module proposal. The LNOSG assesses testnet participants, meets to discuss their performance, and proposes clusters to the DAO with a week discussion period before being finalized.</p>\n<p>The Simple DVT Module Committee (SDVTMC) is then responsible for preparing the Easy Track motions to add Node Operators to the Simple DVT Node Operator registry and raising key limits for the clusters. After the initial 5 validators are active for a month, a performance report is presented to the DAO with the potential for a proposal to the DAO from the committee to raise the key limits further. This process is followed for at least the first 3 months of operation, and for any subsequent increases in validator key limits. All actions by the SDVTMC occur via Easy Track, and are vetoable over a 72 hour period by LDO holders.</p>\n<p>For the Super Simple DVT Clusters discussed in Component 2, the process would be very similar. Participants would already have been proposed by the LNOSG and accepted by the DAO to participate in the normal Simple DVT clusters. However, the LNOSG would meet to evaluate Node Operators, and propose participants that fall into the Advanced Node Operator category. This proposal would be shared to the DAO, with a week discussion period to consider the participants and the proposed clusters.</p>\n<p>If accepted, the SDVTMC would then also prepare transactions to add Node Operators to the SDVT Node Operator registry and raise key limits for the clusters via Easy Track motions. Super Clusters would start with an initial key limit of 50 validators, and after two weeks of running those validators a performance report would be shared with the DAO. If performance is comparable to the overall validator set, a proposal would be made to raise the key limits to 200. The process would repeat again, and a proposal could be made to raise these cluster’s key limits to a maximum of 500 validators each.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"risk-factors-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#risk-factors-6\"></a>Risk Factors</h2>\n<p>While the two factors discussed below also exist for Node Operators in the Curated Set, it is important to highlight these risks as this proposal would expand the DVT deployment within the Lido Node Operator set to a scaled approach.</p>\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xf3ac657484444f0b54eba2c251135c47f875e3d1821496247d11bdd7fab0f291\">Snapshot vote for the Simple DVT Module</a>, the DAO chose to utilize the existing <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x8B3f33234ABD88493c0Cd28De33D583B70beDe35\">cover fund vault contract</a> to cover risks from the Simple DVT Module. With 6,356 stETH currently in the contract, the vault would not be sufficient to cover the entire module in the event of a mass slashing or downtime event. In addition, it is possible that a mass slashing of either Obol or SSV Network validators in the module could trigger <a href=\"https://docs.lido.fi/guides/oracle-spec/accounting-oracle#bunker-mode\">bunker mode</a>, impacting validator exits.</p>\n<p>As noted earlier in the proposal, both Obol and SSV have made significant progress in terms of their mainnet adoption since the Simple DVT Proposal went live in October 2023, with more validators active between both DVT providers on mainnet than the entire capacity of the Simple DVT Module at its current 0.5% target share.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"closing-thoughts-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#closing-thoughts-7\"></a>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>The Lido DAO and protocol has been a leader in pushing for the adoption of Distributed Validator Technology since the early stages of the technology, with <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lego-strategic-commitment-to-research-of-ssvs-blox-staking-obol/817\">grants to both Obol and SSV (then Blox)</a> in July 2021.</p>\n<p>When announced, the Simple DVT Module was a meaningful first step in adopting DVT on mainnet and using the benefits it provides to expand the Node Operator set to a larger number of participants. However, with the progress made to date from both the Obol and SSV teams, as well as the successful results of Simple DVT to-date, an expansion of the DAO’s strategy towards DVT seems desirable not only from an operator decentralization perspective, but also to support the protocol’s commitment to its core mission and values, as reiterated <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/regoose-updated-goals-for-lido-in-the-light-of-mvi-and-restaking/7462\">in ReGoose</a>.</p>\n<p>By increasing the target share to 4%, the number of Node Operators that can be added to the protocol will be expanded by continuing to scale the clusters as planned. This will be done in a way to make it worthwhile for participants to contribute to running validators, while simultaneously increasing the distribution of infrastructure and client types utilized and taking advantage of the improved resilience and security that DVT based validators offer.</p>\n<p>At the same time, by introducing the 10 Super Simple DVT clusters, the protocol can more quickly open up capacity for DV based validators operated by Curated Node Operators and Advanced Node Operators, and expand the share of stake operated by more high-quality participants in a way that provides reasonable economic benefits to both participants, DVT providers, and the DAO.</p>\n<p>Research is underway in regards to a strategy that could also utilize this expansion of the Simple DVT Module to provide possible additional rewards to users and the protocol with the focus on expanding DV adoption at scale. This strategy would continue to support the decentralization and security of stETH, while also solidifying its place as the most useful LST in DeFi and for LRTs. A follow up discussion related to this topic is expected in the near future, however this proposal stands on its own.</p>\n<p>If there are no objections or requests for significant changes to the proposal, it is suggested that a Snapshot vote follow this proposal in one week’s time seeking approval for raising the target share to 4% and the adoption of Super Simple DVT Clusters. By voting for this proposal, the Lido Node Operator set can continue on its path to become more decentralized, resilient, and secure, a meaningful step towards achieving the GOOSE goal of Attracting the Best Validator Set. If the Snapshot vote passes, an on-chain Aragon vote will follow to raise the target share of the module to 4%.</p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 8 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549","pubDate":"Thu, 23 May 2024 18:52:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7549"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549.rss","#text":"Proposal: Expanding the Simple DVT Module"},"filter":false},{"title":"LIP-23: Negative rebase sanity check with second opinion","dc:creator":"Greg_S","category":"The LIP - Lido Improvement Proposal - Process","description":"<h2><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>Lido stETH stream contributors propose to improve the safety check for the accounting report in the case of a negative rebase, reducing the possible impact size, but with the requirement for a second opinion for extreme cases.</p>\n<p>It is proposed to change the current AccountingOracle sanity check, which currently does not allow reporting more than a 5% of Consensus layer validator balance and withdrawal vault balance decrease daily, to a sanity check, which will not allow more than ~3.4% per an 18-day window (1.101 ETH decrease per validator concerning the window).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The AccountingOracle contract aggregates all Lido validators’ Beacon Chain balances (<code>clBalance</code> in the report) to the protocol, critical for the daily rebase of the stETH token. It uses a committee of nine Oracle daemons, with a consensus required from at least five, to ensure data integrity.</p>\n<p>The protocol could be harmed if this committee is compromised, malfunctions, or colludes. This risk is acknowledged and constrained by a sanity check that restricts the possible discrepancy in balance that Oracle can report. The current approach to sanity checking allows the Oracle committee to bring up to a 5% reduction of TVL in each report. Given that the governance reaction time is 3-4 days, the malicious or compromised Oracles could reduce the TVL by 15-20%, invoking mass liquidations on lending markets and dropping the price of stETH.</p>\n<p>However, a real negative rebase has very distinct features that can be taken into account to reduce the impact and attack surface while allowing frictionless operation of the protocol even during a mass slashing event.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-execution-plan-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#proposed-execution-plan-3\"></a>Proposed execution plan</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The contract has been developed, reviewed internally, and covered with the test suite (<a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/core/pull/67\">PR</a>).</li>\n<li>The contract implementing the LIP is undergoing the audit by ChainSecurity, the final report will be published once finalized.</li>\n<li>There will be a snapshot vote to gauge the sentiment of DAO.</li>\n<li>The contract will be deployed on testnet and connected with the second opinion oracle as soon as it becomes available.</li>\n<li>Mainnet voting will be covering limit change without a second opinion provider.</li>\n<li>Connecting a second opinion provider to Mainnet is a question of separate discussion and voting.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#summary-4\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Initially, it is suggested that there should be no secondary opinion source but rather an interface to integrate a preferred provider later on. Once available, the ideal secondary opinion source would be a ZKP-based Oracle, similar to those discussed on the forum (more details on this in references). Alternatively, options might be considered such as a third-party Oracle committee or even a multisig-controlled manual quasi-Oracle.</p>\n<p>To enhance the safety of the existing design, a new strategy is suggested: instead of allowing a 5% consensus layer validator balance daily decrease, a 1.101 ETH decrease per active validator over an 18-day period is proposed (or ~3.4% consensus layer validator balance cumulative decrease over the period). This value, drawn from Ethereum specifications, addresses two out of four cases of ‘Natural CLBalance decrease’—attestation penalties and the initial slashing penalty. For addressing the inactivity leak and correlated slashing penalty, which could potentially result in a loss of up to 96.88% of all Lido CLBalance in extreme cases, it is proposed to rely on a DAO vote until a trustless second opinion source is established.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"references-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#references-5\"></a>References</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-23.md\">LIP-23: Negative rebase sanity check with second opinion specification</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e3R2lAl4xXm0vwqNFB02tvv57jjza9gK9zLkM7Jt1Ow/edit\">New values calculation</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-oracle-v2-reporting-sanity-check-parameter-values/511\">Oracle V2 reporting sanity check parameter values</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/expansion-of-lidos-ethereum-oracle-set/2836\">Oracle committee 5/9</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/core/pull/67/\">Github repo</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/zkllvm-trustless-zk-proof-tvl-oracle/5028\">[ZKLLVM] Trustless ZK-proof TVL oracle</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/dendreth-a-trustless-oracle-for-liquid-staking-protocols/5136\">DendrETH: A trustless oracle for liquid staking protocols</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/zk-lido-oracle-powered-by-succinct/5747\">ZK Lido Oracle powered by Succinct</a></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lip-23-negative-rebase-sanity-check-with-second-opinion/7543\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lip-23-negative-rebase-sanity-check-with-second-opinion/7543","pubDate":"Wed, 22 May 2024 12:40:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7543"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lip-23-negative-rebase-sanity-check-with-second-opinion/7543.rss","#text":"LIP-23: Negative rebase sanity check with second opinion"},"filter":false},{"title":"Lido on Ethereum Node Operator (Numic) Security Incident Disclosure - May 21, 2024","dc:creator":"Izzy","category":"Node Operators","description":"<p>On May 14th, Lido DAO contributors were made aware of a security breach that affected an active Node Operator using the Lido on Ethereum protocol (Numic).

This software runs autonomously and is designed to align cryptoeconomic incentives to further the purpose of decentralizing Ethereum validation. stETH is a mission-driven software tool with a proven track-record of decentralizing the network of Ethereum validators through 1) permissionless software and 2) market forces (cf. HHI graph below, source: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10777v1.pdf\">Grandjean, Heimbach, Wattenhofer</a>).</p>\n<p>Growing the ecosystem around the above mentioned three participants is a powerful way of accelerating Ethereum decentralization. The more attractive it is to <a href=\"https://dune.com/lido/steth-collateral-compare-to-others\">use</a> stETH as collateral, the more the ecosystem grows. This makes it more appealing to participate as a node operator. In turn, and in particular with the possibility for solo-stakers to join through DVT or Community Staking, this increases the decentralization of Ethereum validation.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/0/0bddd1b1185c7a1779078bead0ceb5b75e8f9194.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1GYuQ5R0guCSriwyLooPjvsfcvW.png?dl=1\" title=\"Y3uQhrFpJbAFijf-imOJzYdKX7dyI7DQ0JoTRXvz6kHZpv4DrOhXbk4h8LRXUYU-WSUTkiYYjrlbzb_bItC5v_pIIb-EeILT4peisSNjSnYZQqWI4WWs3zL8dnvBqN-q-0Fk3aPRxZ9KTk19dExbSII\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/0bddd1b1185c7a1779078bead0ceb5b75e8f9194_2_690x210.png\" alt=\"Y3uQhrFpJbAFijf-imOJzYdKX7dyI7DQ0JoTRXvz6kHZpv4DrOhXbk4h8LRXUYU-WSUTkiYYjrlbzb_bItC5v_pIIb-EeILT4peisSNjSnYZQqWI4WWs3zL8dnvBqN-q-0Fk3aPRxZ9KTk19dExbSII\" data-base62-sha1=\"1GYuQ5R0guCSriwyLooPjvsfcvW\" width=\"690\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/0bddd1b1185c7a1779078bead0ceb5b75e8f9194_2_690x210.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/0bddd1b1185c7a1779078bead0ceb5b75e8f9194_2_1035x315.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/0/0bddd1b1185c7a1779078bead0ceb5b75e8f9194.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F5F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"how-should-lido-dao-help-support-the-growth-of-the-ecosystem-around-it-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#how-should-lido-dao-help-support-the-growth-of-the-ecosystem-around-it-4\"></a>How should Lido DAO help support the growth of the ecosystem around it?</h1>\n<p>Lido DAO has experimented with supporting new protocols in the past through Lido on X.

It is a governance process for Lido DAO to identify and recognize projects that share the same values and mission, and have a way to positively contribute to the stETH ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The proposal asks for creation of a dedicated Alliance workgroup of Lido Contributors. The group’s purpose is to assess potential new Alliance members, facilitate &amp; guide them in the DAO’s governance process, as well as help with navigating the potential alignment &amp; product development possibilities. For any Alliance application, the workgroup would be expected to weigh in with assessment results as a note for tokenholders and the wider community. The other two workgroup objectives are</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be the first point of contact for Alliance members on an ongoing basis</li>\n<li>Signal the community and propose offboarding Alliance members in case of misbehavior in regards to stETH or Ethereum alignment</li>\n</ol>\n<p>LDO token holders will always be consulted and have a say in the matter by way of a vote whenever there is a major event impacting the operation of the Alliance like any decision to onboard, offboard, or make any changes to the partnership. Such votes would ensure the Alliance Workgroup stays on track in terms of mission and vision alignment and make sure the Allied Partners’ values align closely with the values and ethos of Lido DAO.</p>\n<p>While being an ongoing effort, one can expect the Alliance workgroup to facilitate onboarding batches aligned with regular voting cadence. The actual timing is left to the workgroup’s discretion. Token holders can expect evaluation and recommendation based on prospective Partner’s values alignment, focus and commitment to security and unique and promising ways the partnership can benefit the stETH ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Closer affiliation with Lido DAO and the participants in the stETH Triangle can help spread awareness both for stETH and for Allied Partners and their unique technological solutions, which in turn furthers the decentralization of Ethereum.</p>\n<p>As part of a proposal and where relevant, Partners have the option to offer a token airdrop to the Alliance. Those tokens would be committed to the Alliance in perpetuity. Any action towards airdropped tokens would have to be vetted by both Alliance Workgroup and the Lido DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"lido-alliance-principles-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#lido-alliance-principles-6\"></a>Lido Alliance Principles</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Partners should:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Share philosophy alignment:</strong> Align with Lido DAO’s vibes, centered around the purpose of preserving Ethereum’s decentralization, accessibility and resistance to censorship.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on integrations:</strong> Tailor product integrations for the Lido protocol to enhance the project’s value proposition, expand market reach and foster synergistic growth opportunities.</li>\n<li><strong>Have an Obsessive Security Culture:</strong> Uncompromising, relentless approach to security for users</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Partners should not:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Misrepresent the Alliance:</strong> Partners must avoid misleading references to participation in the Lido Alliance</li>\n<li><strong>Front run the DAO:</strong> The prospect of a partnership or collaboration should not be used for business development or marketing</li>\n<li><strong>Take security shortcuts:</strong> No</li>\n<li><strong>Stealth Allocate:</strong> Attempt to use the Alliance endorsement process to ‘allocate’ part of Lido DAO’s treasury in contravention of the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-approve-lido-dao-treasury-management-principles-and-authorize-the-formation-of-a-treasury-management-committee\">Treasury Management Principles</a> or its rules</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Partner protocols should be, where relevant:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereum-aligned</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Thoroughly vetted from a security perspective</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Open-source, with open-license smart contracts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"conflict-resolution-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#conflict-resolution-7\"></a>Conflict resolution</h2>\n<p>In case of disagreement in relation to a specific partner, LDO token holders would always be able to vote for discontinuation of the partnership with a specific Partner.

The resulting “laser focus on security” led to <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/\">three major priorities</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>decentralize the NO set,</li>\n<li>decentralize the governance, and</li>\n<li>make stETH the most used token in the Ethereum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this post, we cover what has changed between the ratification of these goals and today. I discuss both internal achievements and external developments, above all the Ethereum issuance debate, and the rise of restaking. Naturally, the magnitude of these developments raises questions about the DAO’s strategy and whether it is still the best course of action or whether it should be revisited. In this post, the first “reGOOSE”, I want to suggest <strong>how Lido should react to the changing tides, what should change, and what should stay the same.</strong></p>\n<p>In summary, I propose that Lido DAO:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Stay focused on security and decentralization</strong><br>\n<strong>2. Participate in Ethereum staking roadmap research</strong><br>\n<strong>3. Reaffirm that stETH should stay an LST, not become an LRT.</strong><br>\n<strong>4. Support Ethereum-aligned validator services, starting with preconfirmations, without exposing stakers to additional risk.</strong><br>\n<strong>5. Make stETH the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> collateral in the restaking market, allowing stakers to opt into additional points on the risk and reward spectrum.</strong></p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-2-what-has-changed-since-first-goose-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-2-what-has-changed-since-first-goose-3\"></a>2. What has changed since first GOOSE?</h1>\n<p>In the months since the first GOOSE submission was ratified, significant progress has been made across all of the identified priorities:</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized Governance:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The important <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/dual-governance-design-and-implementation-proposal/\">dual governance</a> design has been completed and ratified by LDO holders. Implementation is in progress with external audits starting in the summer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Decentralized NO Set:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The first staking router modules for Simple DVT added <a href=\"https://x.com/LidoFinance/status/1780317961854636384\">&gt;70 new node operators</a>, including solo-stakers, for the first time pushing the number of operators using the Lido protocol over the 100 mark (goal is 5000 by 2027)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Client diversity has continued to improve, with usage of the current majority Execution Layer client (geth) across Lido validators going from &gt;80% in 2022 to 45% today</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>stETH Adoption:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Important milestones in institutional adoption have been hit, including adoption from qualified custodians, regulated entities, centralized exchanges and other participants who recognize the benefits of stETH in security, liquidity and utility as part of a modular stack for institutional products</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/network-expansion-workgroup-initiative-governance-decision-forwarding-to-non-l2-networks-lip-24/7446\">Security-first</a> deployments of stETH are <a href=\"https://lido.fi/lido-on-l2\">now available</a> on all of the leading Ethereum L2s</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the same time, stETH market share has declined from 32% to 29%, with additional stake sitting in vampire attacks and queued to unstake in the future. The decline in market share has been fueled by the rise of restaking and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) that attracted stake through billions of dollars in speculation-driven, unsustainable subsidies.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Ethereum Foundation researchers have started a debate to dramatically reduce staking incentives, which threatens the economic feasibility of decentralized staking pools.</p>\n<p>These two developments, the so-called issuance debate and the rise of restaking, are important enough to warrant a bit of unpacking, followed by my proposal on how Lido DAO should react to them.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-lido-and-changes-to-issuance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-3-lido-and-changes-to-issuance-4\"></a>3. Lido and changes to issuance</h1>\n<p>The Ethereum issuance (colloquially dubbed “minimal viable issuance”, or MVI) actually conflates several independent debates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Whether Ethereum should take explicit steps to limit the growth of the validator set, and thereby, of % ETH staked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whether Ethereum is spending too much on security, and getting incrementally less in return.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some proponents of changing issuance argue that not capping will eventually lead to a large % of ETH staked, with one or two LSTs “crowding out” ETH as the base token and introducing long-tail risks for security and governance.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, proponents of the status quo argue that effectively capping ETH staked at a relatively low rate could lead to full market capture by centralized providers with cost/scale advantages (e.g. Coinbase, ETFs), crowding out decentralized pools and solo stakers.</p>\n<p>I suggest Lido DAO address the issuance debate in two ways:</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-31-stay-focused-on-security-and-decentralization-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-31-stay-focused-on-security-and-decentralization-5\"></a>3.1 Stay focused on security and decentralization</h2>\n<p>In my view, maximizing the strengths of the validator set and minimizing the risks from LSTs on long-tail security are both important goals, and both sides only want the best for Ethereum. In practice, I see the risk from LSTs as the more manageable problem through continued research and investment in decentralization.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, the marginal staking rate was lowered to zero today, the effect on said decentralization roadmaps would be severe. Investments into decentralization would have to be cut, hurting not only Lido but also supplier technology like DVT and community staking software, ultimately leading to a more centralized and fragile staking layer.</p>\n<p>Today, we are not in that place yet. The grass-roots community has been largely opposed to changing issuance without further extensive research, so the chance of immediate changes (i.e. in the next 12 months) should be low.</p>\n<p>I believe that stETH meaningfully contributes to Ethereum decentralization and want the DAO to continue improving the stETH validator set and decreasing smart contract and governance risks, all the while researching possible alternatives to the MVI endgame.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-32-participate-in-ethereum-staking-roadmap-research-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-32-participate-in-ethereum-staking-roadmap-research-6\"></a>3.2 Participate in Ethereum staking roadmap research</h2>\n<p>In spite of the criticism the MVI proposals have received, the risks that motivate the issuance debate are important to explore further. The arguments in favor of having a low stake rate are not without merit, but the benefits of having a high stake rate (e.g. maximum alignment between holders and stakers) are underexplored as well, and no decision should be made without deeply understanding their tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>We have already seen <a href=\"http://cyber.fund\">cyber.fund</a> start a generous research grant to explore the future of MVI, with some prominent independent researchers in the space <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/content/mvi-grants\">heeding the call</a>. However, the Lido DAO can do more as well, having contributors who foresaw many future dynamics in staking and have developed strong opinions based on years of on-the-ground experience with staking and network economics.</p>\n<p>To that end, I suggest the creation of Lido Research, a new research group tasked with contributing to the future vision of staking in Ethereum, in close collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation, independent incentives and security researchers, and the wider community.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-4-lido-and-restaking-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-4-lido-and-restaking-7\"></a>4. Lido and restaking</h1>\n<p>Restaking is a new economic primitive enabling the same collateral to be put under slashing conditions imposed by multiple validation services (AVSs in the Eigenlayer terminology), increasing capital efficiency for the cost of increased risks. For example, the same ETH might be used as a slashing collateral for Ethereum validation as well as running a data availability node.</p>\n<p>When I discussed restaking in my <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590\">previous GOOSE submission</a>, I saw it as a fundamentally promising technology that would take several years to fully mature. Restaking (in its proper form) adds risk through additional slashing conditions, while rewards from AVSs are expected to remain inconsequential in the beginning.</p>\n<p>What this analysis missed is the hype created by EigenLayer even in the pre-product stage, allowing stakers to farm points in exchange for parking capital. At the time of writing, users have deposited 5m ETH (or $15b) in EigenLayer, most of it before any AVSs are even live. EigenLayer rewards were further augmented by new LRTs launching to tokenize these deposits, and AVS partners to use them, each of which with their own subsidy programs as well.</p>\n<p>These subsidies are not sustainable in the long-term, but today, they have caused a significant number of stakers to choose the superior yield of Eigenlayer + LRTs over the superior security and network effect of stETH.</p>\n<p>I propose the following updated strategy for dealing with restaking:</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-41-reaffirm-that-steth-should-stay-an-lst-not-become-an-lrt-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-41-reaffirm-that-steth-should-stay-an-lst-not-become-an-lrt-8\"></a>4.1 Reaffirm that stETH should stay an LST, not become an LRT.</h2>\n<p>In spite of the current popularity of restaking/LRTs, it would be a mistake to expand stETH into an LRT, for two reasons:</p>\n<p>First, as explained in the original GOOSE, more institutional than retail capital is expected to join Ethereum over the next three years. If the Ethereum staking layer is to stay decentralized, then Lido or another decentralized staking protocol winning that institutional opportunity is essential. In my experience, the more risky and actively-managed nature of LRTs does not align with the risk preferences of these institutions today. Much has been invested into making stETH the most secure and liquid LST; becoming an LRT and adding extra risks would undermine this cornerstone of our strategy.</p>\n<p>Second, while LRTs can offer higher rewards, their nature is closer to ETH-denominated mutual funds or tokenized deposits in an Ethereum lending market. The key attribute of liquid staking was that it’s a commoditized software offering, but with LRTs it’s less likely that large parts of the market share the same risk/reward preference. As a result, LRTs are less likely to attain a significant network effect and deep liquidity, further limiting their adoption. Their actively managed nature may also make them more likely to be qualified as regulated financial services.</p>\n<p>The DAO should stay open to launching additional products on top of stETH, incl. an LRT, if there is sustained market demand for something that feels aligned with the Lido mission. However, stETH should always stay the DAO’s priority, and it should always stay an LST.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-42-support-ethereum-aligned-validator-services-starting-with-preconfirmations-without-exposing-stakers-to-additional-risk-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-42-support-ethereum-aligned-validator-services-starting-with-preconfirmations-without-exposing-stakers-to-additional-risk-9\"></a>4.2 Support Ethereum-aligned validator services, starting with preconfirmations, <em>without</em> exposing stakers to additional risk.</h2>\n<p>It makes sense to talk about validator services independent of the question of becoming an LRT or not, for two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AVSs can be broadly separated into those that require a validator and those that don’t and can work on any type of collateral.</li>\n<li>Not every validator service may require slashing to work, and/or the slashing can be isolated to not impact stETH holders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I believe that Lido should stay at the forefront of what “staking” constitutes and actively explore validator services that support Ethereum’s scaling or security roadmap, and has buy-in from researchers and the Ethereum community.</p>\n<p>In 2022, Lido was the first staking protocol to commit to using mev-boost (out-of-protocol PBS) across all of the participating node operators. Its <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-optimal-mev-policy-for-lido/2489\">thoughtful MEV policy</a> that balanced MEV maximization with choice for node operators and censorship resistance has positively influenced other staking providers across the industry.</p>\n<p>Today, running mev-boost has become a normal and accepted part of every staking operation. It shows that the definition of “what staking is” can expand to include additional services.</p>\n<p>In my view, preconfirmations will be the next widely adopted validator service after mev-boost (though I expect them to be more an evolution than substitution of mev-boost). Preconfirmations allow validators to commit to including a transaction outside the current full-block auction to sequence “based” rollups or DEX trades faster than the current 12 second block time, promising improvements across user experience, security, and interoperability.</p>\n<p>Lido should become the leader in preconfirmations, and start looking for partners to collaborate with. And it should achieve that without exposing stETH holders to additional base risk, e.g. through the use of a dedicated cover fund for every new service.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-43-make-steth-the-1-collateral-in-the-restaking-market-allowing-stakers-to-opt-into-additional-points-on-the-risk-and-reward-spectrum-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-43-make-steth-the-1-collateral-in-the-restaking-market-allowing-stakers-to-opt-into-additional-points-on-the-risk-and-reward-spectrum-10\"></a>4.3 Make stETH the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> collateral in the restaking market, allowing stakers to opt into additional points on the risk and reward spectrum.</h2>\n<p>Apart from internalizing Ethereum-aligned validator services like preconfirmations, there is a second opportunity in becoming the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> collateral used for AVSs that either don’t require validators or are too risky or not Ethereum-aligned enough to pursue in-protocol.</p>\n<p>This choice is in line with keeping stETH the most secure and Ethereum-aligned LST. Instead of entering the domain of active risk-management, the DAO should instead strive to give stakers the ability to opt into different points on the risk/reward spectrum, by e.g. depositing stETH into a restaking protocol or AVS in exchange for both higher risk and reward.</p>\n<p>This requires establishing a flourishing ecosystem of apps and partners on the stETH platform, and is an effort in ecosystem-building, similar to what Lido DAO once achieved with integrations into Ethereum DeFi and the wider CeFi landscape. It requires deeply understanding the AVS and LRT landscape, forging bonds with key players, and aligning the incentives through key partnerships.</p>\n<p>Since DAOs are chronically bad at negotiating strategic partnerships, I suggest the creation of a new ecosystem-building team or initiative for that purpose inside Lido DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-5-summary-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-5-summary-11\"></a>5. Summary</h1>\n<p>In summary, I propose five changes to address the question of MVI/issuance and the rise of restaking:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Stay focused on security and decentralization</strong><br>\n<strong>2. Participate in Ethereum staking roadmap research</strong><br>\n<strong>3. Reaffirm that stETH should stay an LST, not become an LRT.</strong><br>\n<strong>4.

Make stETH the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> collateral in the restaking market, allowing stakers to opt into additional points on the risk and reward spectrum.</strong></p>\n<p>While these are more than cosmetic changes, they leave all of the cornerstones of our previous strategy untouched: the DAO’s purpose of keeping Ethereum decentralized, accessible to all, and resistant to censorship, of building the most widely used LST, of heavy investment into governance and NO set decentralization, and a rising focus on institutional capital.</p>\n<p>Since its inception, the Lido DAO has been a deeply mission-driven organization, putting the health of Ethereum over anything else, while achieving a rare synthesis between OG idealism and pragmatic reality. I am happy to bet that continuing on this path, incrementally chipping away at our ambitious roadmap, and playing long-term games with long-term people, will lead to the greatest success in the end.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimers:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I am <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-for-hasu-to-join-lido-as-strategic-advisor/1940\">Strategic Advisor  to the Lido DAO.</a></em></li>\n<li><em>As outlined in the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355\">GOOSE</a>, this proposal is submitted in its final form, and the rationale offered explains both the high-level and the lower-level goals.

Mode’s Rapid Growth and Ecosystem:</h4>\n<p>Mode is positioned to be the DeFi hub of the Superchain and has received support from Optimism in the form of an OP grant worth 2 million OP. Mode launched just 12 weeks ago and has already grown to 430m in overall TVL and an impressive 340m in dApp TVL in a short timeline since mainnet release. We see these numbers continue to grow as we bring in new assets like wstETH and useful DeFi products to the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>wstETH has already been deployed to Optimism and Base, two of the biggest L2s that are also in the Superchain. The Mode core team feels it is strategically beneficial for the Lido DAO to also consider Mode as the next ecosystem to deploy their asset.</p>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chain/Mode\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFiLlama Ranking</a> | <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/mode\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2Beat Ranking</a></p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-high-demand-for-wsteth-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-2-high-demand-for-wsteth-3\"></a>2. High Demand for wstETH:</h4>\n<p>Lido is a very important and trusted asset within the overall crypto ecosystem. It is the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/all-cryptocurrencies\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">top reward bearing asset by marketcap</a> and its deployment on Mode would unlock new opportunities for our users and the dApps that are deployed within Mode.</p>\n<p>All of the top dApps inside of the Mode ecosystem would love to integrate wstETH from the moment the asset is live on the chain. Our user base would enjoy having access to the reward bearing asset within the Mode ecosystem so they can increase their efficiency for their onchain strategies.</p>\n<p>Mode also has an accelerator program is centred around products that optimize rewards for onchain users. We would love to include wstETH as an asset developers can build off of if the Lido DAO decides to accept ownership of the bridging components outlined in this proposal.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-3-canonical-bridge-for-wsteth-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#h-3-canonical-bridge-for-wsteth-4\"></a>3. Canonical Bridge for wstETH:</h4>\n<p>Like OP and Base the best approach for deploying wstETH on Mode is through the canonical bridge.</p>\n<p>The Mode core team sees the importance of Lido to our long term success and took action to deploy wstETH to Mode testnet using the same open-source solution used for Optimism deployment (<a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - lidofinance/lido-l2 14</a>). The management of wstETH bridging components are designed to be controlled by the Lido DAO (GitHub - <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/governance-crosschain-bridges\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">lidofinance/governance-crosschain-bridges</a>: This repo contains the crosschain governance bridges used for the Aave markets deployed across different networks. All of the pieces are in place for wstETH to come to Mode and we would propose Lido DAO formally accept ownership of the wstETH bridging components mentioned through signalling a snapshot vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If Lido chooses to accept the deployment of wstETH within the Mode blockchain and take over ownership of the bridging components associated with its deployment this would be a positive and significant step towards diversifying the reward bearing assets within Mode’s ecosystem and open up a new userbase for Lido. Mode users would love to use wstETH for their strategies on dApps within Mode and the recent growth of staking assets in the ecosystem highlights that assets like wstETH will have a bright future within Mode.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"audits-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#audits-6\"></a>Audits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[Governance crosschain bridges (OptimismBridgeExecutor:] (<a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/L2/Governance-Crosschain-Bridges-2022-08-Oxorio-Audit%20Report.pdf\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audits/L2/Governance-Crosschain-Bridges-2022-08-Oxorio-Audit Report.pdf at main · lidofinance/audits · GitHub</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/L2/Lido-L2-2022-07-Oxorio-Smart-Contracts-Security-Audit-Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">wstETH token bridge (L1ERC20TokenBridge, ERC20Bridged, L2ERC20TokenBridge):</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"deployment-artifacts-and-levers-setup-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#deployment-artifacts-and-levers-setup-7\"></a>Deployment artifacts and levers setup</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"deployments-on-mainnet-l1-and-mode-l2-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#deployments-on-mainnet-l1-and-mode-l2-8\"></a>Deployments on Mainnet (L1) and Mode (L2):</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>OptimismBridgeExecutor on L2: <a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/address/0x442a6Bea15718588391C5d1dE261AB2c617eA703\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x442a6Bea15718588391C5d1dE261AB2c617eA703</a>  (Sepolia to Mode decisions forwarder for the Lido DAO Agent)</li>\n<li>L1ERC20TokenBridge on L1: <a href=\"https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xD847780c8808fc99727001C43E6C17A198b39729#readContract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xD847780c8808fc99727001C43E6C17A198b39729</a>(Sepolia token bridge part for wstETH)</li>\n<li>ERC20Bridged on L2: <a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/address/0x953757Db814392642e614DaBba794Ef4381D8292\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x953757Db814392642e614DaBba794Ef4381D8292</a> (Mode representation for wstETH proposed as the canonical one)</li>\n<li>L2ERC20TokenBridge on L2: <a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/address/0x2F3a332eff5f45cEA0486464fa4080fcF52Ea876\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x2F3a332eff5f45cEA0486464fa4080fcF52Ea876</a><br>\n(Mode token bridge part for wstETH)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"levers-setup-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#levers-setup-9\"></a>Levers setup:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>OptimismBridgeExecutor\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network:443/address/0x442a6Bea15718588391C5d1dE261AB2c617eA703?tab=read_contract#c3a76886\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">getEthereumBridgeExecutor 4</a> is the <a href=\"https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x32A0E5828B62AAb932362a4816ae03b860b65e83#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido DAO Agent (admin)</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ultimate admin and role holder on L1 is the <a href=\"https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x32A0E5828B62AAb932362a4816ae03b860b65e83#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido DAO Agent</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Proxy admin for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ultimate admin and role holder on L2 is the <a href=\"https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/address/0x442a6Bea15718588391C5d1dE261AB2c617eA703?tab=read_contract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OptimismBridgeExecutor</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Proxies admin for ERC20Bridged, L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Emergency breaks on L1 uses this EOA account <a href=\"https://docs.lido.fi/token-guides/wsteth-bridging-guide/#sepolia\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xa5F1d7D49F581136Cf6e58B32cBE9a2039C48bA1</a>:\n<ul>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Emergency breaks msig on L2 is a newly created one <a href=\"https://safe.optimism.io/home?chain=modeTestnet&amp;safe=modeTestnet:0x3c751b0C5f63462eE29450E61A74521C1AbD233B\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x3c751b0c5f63462ee29450e61a74521c1abd233b</a>:\n<ul>\n<li>WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n<li>DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post -

Read more on the Brian API docs.</p>\n<p><strong>2 - Current stage: Public Beta</strong></p>\n<p>Brian was born during the ETHPrague Hackathon (first bounty prizes from Taiko, AAVE, Gnosis, The Graph and Gateway.fm) in June 2023 and is currently in Public beta - launched on 26th February and that will last for around 5 months.</p>\n<p>Users can perform the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>research info with a prompt on our public knowledge base consisting of docs from the most popular blockchains and protocols (eg. “Explain how LIDO works”);</li>\n<li>send transactions with a prompt on every EVM-compatible mainnet, sidechain or L2 (eg. “Stake 1 eth on LIDO on Ethereum”);</li>\n<li>generate Solidity code and deploy it on every EVM-compatible mainnet, sidechain or L2 (eg. “Code an ERC-20 token named BrianAI with a supply of 10000”);</li>\n<li>Coming soon: research on-chain data on The Graph subgraphs with a prompt (eg. “What are the 5 Uniswap pools with the highest TVLs?”).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have reached these numbers since the start of the Private Beta (started in November and closed in February) and during the Public Beta (started in February).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>546 whitelisted addresses</li>\n<li>10.000 total prompts, divided in:\n<ul>\n<li>3700 research information prompts</li>\n<li>5450 transaction prompts</li>\n<li>800 code generation prompts</li>\n<li>50 subgraphs prompts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On 10th January we also launched the APIs and around 50 unique addresses started implementing our APIs.

On this custom-built kb we can add specific docs, articles, github repos, etc., and users will be able to ask questions like “give me an ELI5 version explanation of LIDO”, “what are the differences between LIDO and Rocket Pool?” etc.</p>\n<p>You can already ask some questions about LIDO here on the Brian app.</p>\n<p>We are going to build a kb vertical on the LIDO space, while at the moment there a couple of articles in the “Public Knowledge Base”, that is a general kb with a very good overview of the entire market.</p>\n<p><strong>Stake/Unstake ETH on LIDO</strong></p>\n<p>Development of deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) actions to interact with LIDO protocol. The goal is to allow users to perform these operations by writing the prompt in many different ways (eg. “Stake my eth on lido”, “Deposit 1 eth on lido finance”, “Bridge 1 eth to ethereum and then stake 0.5 eth on lido”).</p>\n<p>The development involves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dataset creation (users and artificial prompts) for deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) actions</li>\n<li>fine-tune of a GPT model with deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) actions dataset and prompt engineering operations for optimizing the model performance (eg. few shots and chain-of-thought)</li>\n<li>Adding the deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) actions on the Brian API using Enso finance to interact with the LIDO protocol and for real-time quotes. Initially the withdrawal will go through a steth-eth swap under the hood so that we do not have to wait for the 1/5-day withdrawal period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this point, the deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) actions are available on the API and App.</p>\n<p>This is not available on the Brian app yet, we are testing the integration internally.</p>\n<p>The same operation can be executed starting from a token other than eth such as usdc. The prompt “Deposit 100 usdc on lido protocol on ethereum” will automatically convert usdc to eth and then deposit to lido protocol.</p>\n<p>The deposit (stake) and withdraw (unstake) prompts can be used via:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>single prompts → eg. “Deposit 1 eth on lido on ethereum”</li>\n<li>multiple prompts → eg. “bridge 1 eth from arbitrum to ethereum and then deposit 0.5 eth on lido on ethereum”, leveraging the power of prompt to transaction composability</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Payment schedule:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>50% at the beginning of the first task (eta: May 1st)</li>\n<li>50% in one month (eta: end of May)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Payment method:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coin: DAI on Ethereum or Arbitrum (preferred)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Address (Arbitrum multi-sig): 0x129B480AD625bcD1A5c3A1C10d708114726Fa467</p>\n<p><strong>4 - Team</strong></p>\n<p>The Brian founders team is an excellent mix of web3 and AI skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Matteo D’Andreta - Web3 BD and PM (6+ years in web3)</li>\n<li>Paolo Rollo - Full Stack Dev and R&amp;D specialist (6+ years in R&amp;D, web3 and AI)</li>\n<li>Francesco Cirulli - Smart Contract dev and PM (6+ years in web3)</li>\n<li>Marcello Politi - Deep Learning Scientist (3+ years in AI)</li>\n<li>Federico Giancotti - Data Analyst</li>\n<li>Filippo Galuccio - Investment Manager</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lego-grants-stake-unstake-eth-on-lido-with-a-prompt-and-the-creation-of-a-lido-kb/7218\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lego-grants-stake-unstake-eth-on-lido-with-a-prompt-and-the-creation-of-a-lido-kb/7218","pubDate":"Thu, 25 Apr 2024 13:28:24 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7218"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lego-grants-stake-unstake-eth-on-lido-with-a-prompt-and-the-creation-of-a-lido-kb/7218.rss","#text":"LEGO Grants - Stake/Unstake ETH on LIDO with a prompt and the creation of a LIDO kb"},"filter":false},{"title":"Request to help with/freeze $stETH held by Zkasino Exit Scam wallet ($30m - 10,000 victims)","dc:creator":"dkc","category":"The LIP - Lido Improvement Proposal - Process","description":"<p>I am a representative of the victims of the zkasino exit scam, asking LIDO DAO to consider helping/freezing funds of the scammers.

Today LDO holders have important powers over the protocol that can result in important changes to this social contract. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrading the Ethereum liquid staking protocol code.<br>\nManaging the list of the Ethereum consensus layer oracle committee members.</li>\n<li>Changing how the stake is distributed between node operators in a potentially harmful or unexpected way (e.g. adding or removing whitelisted Ethereum node operators).</li>\n<li>Changing the governance structure in an unexpected or potentially harmful way (e.g. minting or burning LDO, changing the parameters of voting systems).</li>\n<li>Changing the total fee percentage of the Ethereum liquid staking protocol outside of the agreed boundaries (as well as defining these boundaries).</li>\n<li>Deciding on how to spend the treasury</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these powers, apart from treasury spends, directly affect stakers. Dual governance v1 allows stETH holders, in the worst case, to delay any proposed changes to the Lido protocol until they have fully exited.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"v1-design-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#v1-design-2\"></a>V1 design</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"unhappy-path-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#unhappy-path-3\"></a>Unhappy path</h3>\n<p><em>Malicious proposal to change the withdrawal vault contract</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>A well-funded LDO holder makes a malicious proposal to change the stETH withdrawal contract and rug users. This proposal gets enough LDO support to pass.</li>\n<li>A small group of users (stETH holders) pick up on this and vote to veto the change. In doing so they both sound the alarm for more users to join, and ensure that neither this proposal, nor any other DAO proposals (apart from treasury spends) can be executed for the time being.</li>\n<li>More users join the veto while the DAO is in this temporarily frozen state (known as <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/mechanism.md#veto-signalling-state\">VetoSignalling state</a>). Some need to take the time to unwind from their DeFi positions. That’s ok.</li>\n<li>The DAO remains frozen until all users that have joined the veto are able to fully withdaw their ETH (assuming the 2nd threshold has been crossed).</li>\n<li>After all users have been made whole the DAO reverts back to its normal state (unless there is another veto motion already in motion).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"happy-path-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#happy-path-4\"></a>Happy path</h3>\n<p><em>Good faith proposal to remove a node operator</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>For some reason or other LDO holders vote to boot a node operator out of the curated set.</li>\n<li>A small group of users (stETH holders) pick up on this and vote to veto the change. In doing so they both sound the alarm for more users to join, and ensure that neither this proposal, nor any other DAO proposals which affect them can be executed for the time being.</li>\n<li>LDO holders realize they’ve made a mistake and de-escalate by voting to cancel all pending proposals (including the one that triggered the veto).</li>\n<li>The de-escalation is successful – stETH holders remove their veto – and the DAO resumes a normal state of affairs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"guiding-objectives-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#guiding-objectives-5\"></a>Guiding objectives</h3>\n<p>The guiding objectives are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Give stakers a way to credibly signal their disagreement with LDO holders and the commitment to leave the protocol if LDO holders don’t cooperate in resolving the incentives conflict.</li>\n<li>Allow for the possibility of negotiation and de-escalation between stETH and LDO holders.</li>\n<li>Introduce an extended timelock on DAO decisions that can be triggered by an active minority of stakers and prolonged as more stakers participate.</li>\n<li>Improve foot voting efficiency by allowing stakers to exit the protocol without being subject to new and pending DAO decisions.</li>\n<li>Don’t overburden users with governance decisions</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"the-importance-of-a-two-phased-veto-with-a-dynamic-timelock-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#the-importance-of-a-two-phased-veto-with-a-dynamic-timelock-6\"></a>The importance of a two-phased veto with a dynamic timelock</h3>\n<p>Well-designed onchain DeFi protocols are able to put users ahead of tokenholders.</p>\n<p>In the sense that even if the protocol is failing, users can still permissionlessly exit with their funds intact, and there’s nothing tokenholders can do about it.</p>\n<p>This is something that is truly new to financial markets and infrastructure. Something that is only made possible by the non-custodial nature of onchain DeFi.</p>\n<p>This power of exit, is an extremely underrated differentiator between onchain Defi and offchain Defi/Tradfi.</p>\n<p>If we want to preserve the right to exit under the most extreme scenarios, a naive Moloch style rage quit mechanism isn’t quit good enough. This is because of how Ethereum’s validator exit queue works – all Ethereum validator exits are processed through a single queue with limited throughput. This rate-limited exit queue means that in the worst case it could take more than a year to exit the protocol. During this time, the DAO could, in theory, pass proposals that could harm these users.</p>\n<p>Placing a naive timelock on DAO decisions (a temporary freeze, so to speak) doesn’t work either because the dynamic nature of the exit queue ensures there is no good way to place an upper limit on the length of this time.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, many users choose to re-deploy their staked capital to other forms of economic activity, and unwinding from these positions can take weeks. If Lido only has a single veto phase, then these users would not be able exit under a worst case scenario.</p>\n<p>In sum, a two-phase veto allows for a relatively small number of users to sound the alarm. In doing so, they can pause Lido governance proposals for long enough to either complete a negotiation and de-escalation process (happy path), or to allow for more users to join the veto and eventually exit (unhappy path). In order to avoid burdening users with politics, giving them exit guarantees is preferable to giving them full governance rights.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"committees-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#committees-7\"></a>Committees</h3>\n<p>While dual governance needs to cover any DAO decision that can potentially affect users of the protocol, it does not cover emergency actions triggered by time-scoped circuit-breaker multisigs and contracts. There are three such committees under the v1 design.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"gate-seal-committee-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#gate-seal-committee-8\"></a>Gate Seal committee</h4>\n<p>The Gate Seal committee is a 3/6 multisig that has the power to pause stETH to ETH withdrawals for a predetermined amount of days (currently set to 6). You can think of it as a safeguard against a withdrawal vulnerability being exploited by an attacker. The pause lasts for x days or, in the case that DAO decisions are blocked by stETH holders, until the execution of DAO decisions is unblocked. Importantly, the Gate Seal committee can only enact a pause once before losing its power (it has to be re-elected by the DAO after that). In case of non-use, the multisig automatically expires on a fixed date in the future – currently set to May 1st 2024 (see the discussion on renewing it <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/renew-gateseal-for-the-withdrawal-queue-and-validator-exit-bus-oracle/7081\">here</a>). At any time, the DAO can vote to appoint a new Gate Seal committee with a new expiration date.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"tiebreaker-committee-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#tiebreaker-committee-9\"></a>Tiebreaker committee</h4>\n<p>The Tiebreaker committee is a more complex multisig that has the ability, under very specific conditions, to execute decisions that were proposed and approved by LDO holders but subsequently blocked by stETH holders. Note that it only obtains this right under two potentially catastrophic edge case scenarios (one in which the Gate Seal committee has paused withdrawals post veto, and another in which there’s an infinite exit loop type bug). If this power didn’t exist, then stETH holders who are in the middle of rage quitting could be prevented from withdrawing indefinitely.</p>\n<p>While the GateSeal committee is optimized for speed of reaction, the Tiebreaker committee is designed for maximum security and wider ecosystem alignment: It is expected to composed of 3 or 4 sub-committees (some of which are expected to be fully-fledged DAOs). Each of these subcommittees represents a distinct interest group within the ecosystem. Any decision it makes needs to be approved by a majority (2/3 or 3/4) of sub-committees. And for each individual sub-committee to approve a decision, the latter should be supported by the supermajority of the sub-committee members. Note that no sub-committee may share members with the Gate Seal committee.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"margin-of-safety-committee-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#margin-of-safety-committee-10\"></a>Margin of safety committee</h4>\n<p>The margin of safety committee is a temporary multisig which effectively has the power to revert Lido governance back to it’s current state (i.e pre dual governance).</p>\n<p>It exists primarily to protect from zero-day vulnerabilities in dual governance. The plan is to have a generous bug bounty to encourage responsible disclosure. It will be dissolved once this bounty program comes to an end.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"parameter-choice-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#parameter-choice-11\"></a>Parameter choice</h2>\n<p>Clearly, getting the parameter selection right is of the upmost importance. While <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/mechanism.md\">the mechanism design overview</a> contains a range of possible values, finalizing these requires more research. The aim is to publish a document with suggested initial values within the next 3-6 months.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-importance-of-launching-before-7002-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#the-importance-of-launching-before-7002-12\"></a>The importance of launching before 7002</h2>\n<p>As things stand today, LDO holders cannot force node operators to exit. This means that in practice, it’s extremely difficult for even a captured DAO to coerce Ethereum aligned operators to do anything they would not wish to do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7002-execution-layer-triggerable-exits/14195\">EIP 7002</a>, expected to be included in the next Ethereum hardfork (c. Q1 2025), will drastically change the balance of power here, by effectively allowing LDO holders to force exit operators. Which is why dual governance ideally needs to go live before then (or shortly afterwards).</p>\n<p>Put another way, post triggerable exits, users need to be able to exit en masse to protect against a malicious withdrawal vault upgrade or undesirable changes to the node operator set.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-does-dual-governance-address-concerns-raised-by-researchers-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#how-does-dual-governance-address-concerns-raised-by-researchers-13\"></a>How does dual governance address concerns raised by researchers?</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"minimises-the-risk-of-cartel-abuse-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#minimises-the-risk-of-cartel-abuse-14\"></a>Minimises the risk of cartel abuse</h3>\n<p>In his seminal essay on <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd\">the risks of LSD</a>, Danny Ryan writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deciding “who” gets to be a NO is a matter of two questions – who is added to the set and who is removed the set. This can be designed in one of two ways in the long run – either via governance (a coin vote or other similar mechanism) or via an automated mechanism around reputation and profitability.</p>\n<p>In the former – governance deciding NOs – the governance token (e.g. LDO) becomes a major risk to Ethereum. If the token can decide who can be a node operator in this theoretical majority-LSD, then the token holders can force cartel activities of censorship, multi-block MEV, etc, or else the NO is removed from the set.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Governance deciding NOs has another distinct risk which is regulatory censorship and control. If pooled stake under one LSD protocol exceeds 50%, this pooled staked gains the ability to censor blocks (and worse-so at 2/3 due to being able to finalize such blocks). In a regulatory censorship attack, we now have a distinct entity – the governance token holders – that a regulator can make requests of censorship. Depending on the token distribution, this is likely a much simpler regulatory target than the Ethereum network as a whole. And, in fact, DAO token distributions are generally pretty terrible with just a few entities deciding most votes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=JKvJw2DT2YQ\">Dual governance</a> goes a long way towards addressing the above concerns. Concretely, if LDO holders tried to remove a node operator from the set unfairly, it would work as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A small quorum of stETH holders (say 2% of total) could signal their opposition to this bad decision and pause the governance execution long enough for more holders to react. As more stETH holders join the opposition, the execution pause is extended further.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While this is happening, LDO holders can elect to cancel the decision, and stETH holders can remove their opposition in response. If LDO holders refuse to revert course, and the number of dissatisfied stETH holders reaches a larger quorum (say 10% of total), all dissatisfied users are exited from the protocol (withdraw their ETH) and the governance execution pause is extended until this process ends.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Importantly, governance can only be brought back to normal state if both LDO governance and participating stETH holders agree to resolve the conflict, or once all dissatisfied stETH holders have exited the protocol.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In sum, by giving stETH holders the power to impose a dynamic timelock on changes which affect them, it becomes impossible for LDO holders to force Lido protocol changes onto them. This significantly reduces the risk of capture (via cartel activities of censorship, multi-block MEV, etc).</p>\n<p>Regarding Danny’s second concern (regulatory censorship and control), stETH’s token distribution is very different and much more diverse than LDO’s distribution. So the combination of LDO and stETH is much more resistant to this sort of censorship. It’s still not as diverse as ETH’s distribution, or the distribution of Ethereum users, but this is only going to improve with time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ensures-the-right-of-exit-under-the-most-extreme-conditions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#ensures-the-right-of-exit-under-the-most-extreme-conditions-15\"></a>Ensures the right of exit under the most extreme conditions</h3>\n<p>Part of the concern today rightfully comes from the fact that stETH holders do not have full exit rights. In the sense that there exist situations in which they can be rugged by malicious LDO holders and/or node operators.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dankrad/status/1715496316917121370\">Dankrad’s words</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A very large Lido makes every decision about Ethereum staking mainly a decision about Lido, while the stETH holders are held “ransom”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By giving users full exit rights, dual governance, in combination with EIP-7002, changes this dynamic. To paraphrase <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_vshapovalov/status/1715622835576557700\">Vasiliy</a>; a winning solution in open staking market can be dominant only as long as it’s actually good; and what’s good is ultimately decided by stakers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protects-against-insider-attacks-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#protects-against-insider-attacks-16\"></a>Protects against insider attacks</h3>\n<p>In Vitalik’s end of year 2022 post on <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/12/05/excited.html\">what excites him</a>, he has a wonderful section devoted to decentralized governance questions.</p>\n<p>As he describes it, there are two big questions to answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] What kinds of governance structures make sense, and for what use cases?</p>\n<p>[2] Does it make sense to implement those structures as a DAO, or through regular incorporation and legal contracts?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to make an interesting distinction between a governance structure and its implementation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A particular subtlety is that the word “decentralized” is sometimes used to refer to both: a governance structure is decentralized if its decisions depend on decisions taken from a large group of participants, and an implementation of a governance structure is decentralized if it is built on a decentralized structure like a blockchain and is not dependent on any single nation-state legal system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The framework he uses to think about this distinction is particularly powerful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One way to think about the distinction is: <strong>decentralized governance structure protects against attackers on the inside, and a decentralized implementation protects against powerful attackers on the outside (“censorship resistance”).</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/a/a4f7d07707a3b0bb43221e6d3ab36468517849d4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nxnfbjaT0fMnqxsEplAoguXRiy8.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-02-12 at 16.02.48\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/a/a4f7d07707a3b0bb43221e6d3ab36468517849d4_2_690x230.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-12 at 16.02.48\" data-base62-sha1=\"nxnfbjaT0fMnqxsEplAoguXRiy8\" width=\"690\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/a/a4f7d07707a3b0bb43221e6d3ab36468517849d4_2_690x230.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/a/a4f7d07707a3b0bb43221e6d3ab36468517849d4_2_1035x345.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/a/a4f7d07707a3b0bb43221e6d3ab36468517849d4_2_1380x460.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEEDEE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Since liquid staking protocols, like Lido, are acting as a thin layer on top of credibly neutral global infrastructure (Ethereum), they are in the same category as stablecoins – in that they need both high protection from outside and inside attacks.</p>\n<p>Viewed through this lens, the current structure of Lido governance is a fine model to get a protocol started, but it’s not adequate for the long term. In particular, as we’ve highlighted above, post triggerable exits a well-funded attacker could buy enough LDO to force exit and replace the existing node operator set with a malicious one.</p>\n<p>Regarding innovations in decentralized governance that can protect against insider attacks, Vitalik lists two possible directions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Some kind of non-financialized governance, or perhaps a bicameral hybrid where decisions need to be passed not just by token holders but also by some other class of user (eg. the Optimism Citizens’ House or stETH holders as in the Lido two-chamber proposal)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intentional friction, making it so that certain kinds of decisions can only take effect after a delay long enough that users can see that something is going wrong and escape the system.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lido’s dual governance makes important steps in both of these directions. While governance is still financialized under this first iteration, it does become a bicameral hybrid.</p>\n<p>There is also significant intentional friction introduced by the fact that the veto is two-phased, and that veto states can be chained together. In other words, there’s been alot of thought put into ensuring that users have the time to see that something is going wrong, unwind from their DeFi positions, and exit the system.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"preliminary-timeline-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#preliminary-timeline-17\"></a>Preliminary timeline</h2>\n<p>If LDO holders approve of this direction – next week’s snapshot vote (scheduled for April 18th) will serve as a temperature check – contributors plan on going forward with a technical implementation, preparing for the testnet runs, as well as engaging multiple parties to challenge the mechanism design, technical implementation, and parameter choices.</p>\n<p>Optimistic timeline is testnet deployment in Q3, with mainnet launch scheduled for late Q3 / Q4. Note that these are approximate dates subject to change depending upon the security checks and testnet results.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"going-forward-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#going-forward-18\"></a>Going forward</h2>\n<p>While dual governance is an important step in reducing governance risks of the protocol, it’s in no way the final step.</p>\n<p>Some ideas for v2 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allow vanilla ETH holders to trigger an extended timelock / veto</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give some sort of veto / tiebreaker power to node operators</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allow for delegation of stETH veto / exit power</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allow for seamless DAO forks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Voter bonds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prediction markets</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"seamless-forking-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#seamless-forking-19\"></a>Seamless forking</h3>\n<p>A promising future research direction involves looking for ways to also improve the efficiency of foot voting by node operators. For example, by allowing a subset of stakers and node operators to coordinate a protocol and DAO fork by re-pointing validator withdrawal credentials to a new contract (assuming consensus layer support).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"minimal-governance-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#minimal-governance-20\"></a>Minimal governance</h3>\n<p>The ultimate solution to the user redemption-risk problem is governance minimization and eventual ossification of the protocol code and parameters. There’s no governance risk if nothing is being governed.</p>\n<p>Gradually minimizing the governance scope is something that Lido contributors see as a necessity in the coming years. However, until the Ethereum specification ossifies, there is only so much that can be done on this front.</p>\n<p>In addition, any immutable code has to be formally verified on the bytecode level to minimize the risk of exploitable compiler bugs. Doing this effectively will require significant changes to the architecture of Lido’s code.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"further-resources-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#further-resources-21\"></a>Further resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/specification.md\">Specification</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/mechanism.md\">Mechanism design</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727/2\">Research post</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrA6VQgh3bk\">Sam’s presentation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=JKvJw2DT2YQ\">Sacha’s presentation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1540652075352313857\">Twitter space with Hasu and Sam</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance\">Github repo</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@sacha/SJk8GHq5T\">FAQ</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dual-governance-explainer-research-distillation/7132\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dual-governance-explainer-research-distillation/7132","pubDate":"Thu, 11 Apr 2024 16:02:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7132"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dual-governance-explainer-research-distillation/7132.rss","#text":"Lido dual governance explainer (research distillation)"},"filter":false},{"title":"Dual Governance: design and implementation proposal","dc:creator":"kadmil","category":"Proposals","description":"<h2><a name=\"what-is-dual-governance-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#what-is-dual-governance-1\"></a>What is Dual Governance</h2>\n<p>The Dual Governance mechanism (DG) is an iteration on the protocol governance that gives stakers 1) a dynamic user-extensible timelock on DAO decisions and 2) a rage quit mechanism taking into account the specifics of how Ethereum withdrawals work.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"current-status-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#current-status-2\"></a>Current status</h2>\n<p>After multiple stages of the research (<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727/26\">the latest update</a>, <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727\">the start of the “continuation” thread</a>, <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance/2382\">the initial post</a>), the mechanism design is now fully fleshed out.

This change aims to directly align staker rewards with the protocol’s primary activity and revenue source, enhancing value accrual to $LDO token holders and improving the overall Lido ecosystem’s health.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To enhance the $LDO token utility, align incentives across the Lido ecosystem, and provide direct, tangible benefits to $LDO stakers through $ETH rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Revenue Sharing Mechanism Adjustment</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Previous Proposal</strong>: A portion of Lido DAO revenue is redirected to buy back $LDO tokens, distributing them to $LDO stakers. (Awful idea, don’t think of it again, thanks)</li>\n<li><strong>Proposed Change</strong>: Redirect a configurable percentage (40-50%, governed by Lido DAO voting) of Lido DAO’s revenue from the protocol treasury directly to $LDO stakers in the form of $ETH.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Implementation of ETH Distribution</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distribute $ETH to $LDO stakers on a weekly basis, proportional to their staked $LDO tokens.</li>\n<li>Maintain the proposed vesting period of 14 days for the distributed $ETH to ensure long-term alignment and commitment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Insurance Fund Considerations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uphold the establishment of a minimum threshold for the LidoDAO insurance fund.</li>\n<li>In the event of a fund reserve shortfall, prioritize fund replenishment through the same revenue redirection mechanism, temporarily pausing $ETH distributions if necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Staking Terms and Conditions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retain the proposed 14-day unstaking cooldown period for $LDO stakers to support protocol stability.</li>\n<li>Implement a risk mitigation mechanism that aligns with industry standards, ensuring the sustainability of the rewards system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Benefits of the Proposed Change</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Direct Value</strong>: $LDO stakers receive rewards in $ETH, offering immediate and tangible value from their participation in the protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Aligned Incentives</strong>: Rewarding stakers in $ETH ensures alignment between the protocol’s success and the stakers’ benefits, fostering a healthier ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>We propose initiating a discussion period of 7 days for community feedback, followed by a signaling vote on Snapshot.</p>\n<p>This period will allow us to refine the proposal further and ensure it meets the community’s needs and expectations.</p>\n<p>By adjusting the rewards mechanism to distribute $ETH, we aim to provide a more compelling and beneficial staking proposition for $LDO token holders, ensuring the Lido protocol’s continued growth and success.</p>\n            <p><small>13 posts - 10 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-for-lido-staking-eth-rewards-for-ldo-stakers/7123\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-for-lido-staking-eth-rewards-for-ldo-stakers/7123","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 23:19:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7123"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-for-lido-staking-eth-rewards-for-ldo-stakers/7123.rss","#text":"Proposal for Lido Staking: $ETH Rewards for $LDO Stakers"},"filter":false},{"title":"Holesky Safe - Q2/2024 Budget Provision - Support & Maintenance","dc:creator":"Eduardo_Protofire","category":"Community Grants / Initiatives","description":"<p>Hi team, I hope everyone is well!</p>\n<p>Following the proposal made by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/ivan_protofire\">@Ivan_Protofire</a> (<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/safe-ex-gnosis-safe-deployment-on-holesky/5726\">Safe (ex.
