Doing so entails several requirements. From those, the most difficult to meet is the required stake of 32 ETH, a prohibitive amount for most.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/staking/solo/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethereum Foundation deemed that solo staking is the best staking option for securing Ethereum</a>, the combination of capital and technical barrier at entry has pushed the solo staker category to represent only 1% to 6.5% of the total stake, based on Dune Analytics and Rated <a href=\"https://blog.rated.network/blog/solo-stakers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">estimation</a>.</p>\n<p>In other words, between 94.5% and 99% of staked ETH is managed by non-solo stakers.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/7/7dbbb6efc0017ad6cabac1e4aa998d334da665ff.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hWhRlELgnV9BkJCH1NnAYU16EPB.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/7/7dbbb6efc0017ad6cabac1e4aa998d334da665ff_2_690x445.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"hWhRlELgnV9BkJCH1NnAYU16EPB\" width=\"690\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/7/7dbbb6efc0017ad6cabac1e4aa998d334da665ff_2_690x445.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/7/7dbbb6efc0017ad6cabac1e4aa998d334da665ff_2_1035x667.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/7/7dbbb6efc0017ad6cabac1e4aa998d334da665ff.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECE6ED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Taken from: <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking</a></p>\n<p><strong>LSPs are an answer</strong></p>\n<p>It has been possible for &lt; 32 ETH holders to participate in a <em>passive</em> manner via Liquid Staking Protocols (LSPs): Pools that receive and accumulate ETH from stakers; and delegate operation of validators to NOs. In this model, the liquid staking protocols (and their NOs) get a cut of the stakers’ yield in exchange for their service.</p>\n<p>Generally, participation as a NO in the most relevant LSPs has been restricted to a handful of teams, which have the reputation and means to do so at scale. For example, Kiln, the largest NO according to <a href=\"https://explorer.rated.network/o/Kiln?network=mainnet&amp;timeWindow=30d&amp;viewBy=operator&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=15&amp;idType=nodeOperator\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Rated</a>, has close to 47,000 active validators, corresponding to ~1,504,000 in staked ETH, or ~$3.7bn at today’s price(at ETH: $2.5k) and equivalent ~4% of all staked ETH. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/exploding_head.png?v=12\" title=\":exploding_head:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":exploding_head:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">.

Imagine a scenario where a subset of the largest NOs stops working —either because of an attack, failure of underlying infrastructure, or even willingly— with a specific LSP, this could result in significant financial loss for both the affected protocol, and their stakers. Such scenario however unlikely, is not impossible.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, liquid staking is a convenient option for &lt;32 ETH holders that want to stake in Ethereum. Yet, this convenience has resulted in actual node operation and PoS validation to become very much centralized.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17759-so-this-situation-is-not-ideal-how-do-we-get-out-of-it-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17759-so-this-situation-is-not-ideal-how-do-we-get-out-of-it-2\"></a>So, this situation is not ideal. How do we get out of it?</h3>\n<p>Luckily, LSPs have become aware of this situation and are opening up to increasingly <em>permissionless</em> models for NOs, with the aim of reducing the share of the established node operators.</p>\n<p>However, to participate as a NO for an LSP, one needs to acquire a certain amount of <em><strong>trust</strong></em>. After all, the LSP is entrusting unknown NOs with their ETH, at the risk of inefficiency, or worse, slashing.</p>\n<p>In consequence, each of these protocols have devised their own way of establishing trust with unknown NOs, as well as different reward mechanisms to attract new potential NOs and compete with other LSPs.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the most relevant protocols’ key points.

However, hundreds of validators can be run within a single node, thus the operational costs of running nodes get reduced in proportion to the total amount of validators per node. One validator manages 32 ETH of stake, so a single node could manage tens of thousands of ETH. However, too much stake on top of a single node is not a very good idea in terms of fault-tolerance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distributing validators over several nodes with tech like Vouch or DVT solutions give effective fault-tolerance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All node operation options require roughly the same amount of tech expertise. This includes running nodes, setting up the validators, monitoring, and maintenance.</p>\n<p>All node operation options give freedom to the operator to choose their preferred stack, and geographical location. This is potentially beneficial as <a href=\"http://clientdiversity.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">diversity is fundamental for systemic resilience</a> of Ethereum.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In this post we have given an overview of the most relevant liquid staking protocols from the perspective of aspiring node operators.

Validators are able to passively opt-in to mev-commit and contribute to network security using stETH. Key facts about mev-commit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chain-abstracted network for real-time bidding in encrypted mempools</li>\n<li>Addresses coordination inefficiencies in transaction execution</li>\n<li>Supports passive opt-in for validators, who may use stETH as collateral via restaking protocols such as Eigenlayer and Symbiotic</li>\n<li>Early adoption on Holesky testnet with interest from Lido operators</li>\n<li>Integration plans include mainnet staking contracts, stETH support, and Lido ETH staking UI integration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’re seeking feedback from the greater Lido community as we continuously align mev-commit with Lido’s mission. With this post we are raising awareness and soliciting input on features to ensure mutual benefits and seamless integration.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17655-introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17655-introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>mev-commit is an innovative network designed that enhances validator yield through commitment games, e.g. preconfirmations. When validators passively opt-in, they simply gain bid revenue as extra value added to their blocks using their existing mev-boost sidecar. From the validators’ perspective, mev-commit bids act as another transaction source that adds value to blocks as it introduces new dimensions to transaction fee expression such as time. Validators may opt-in and use their own security collateral via staking ETH; native restaking; stETH restaking via Eigenlayer; or stETH restaking via Symbiotic.</p>\n<p>mev-commit does NOT require validators to run any additional software, such as sidecars, but instead integrates upstream to mev-boost via block builders or relays to enhance the mev-boost pipeline.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17655-what-is-mev-commit-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17655-what-is-mev-commit-3\"></a>What is mev-commit</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real-Time, Chain-Abstracted Network</strong>: mev-commit is a credible commitment network designed as a compatible layer on top of post-merge PBS infrastructure. It has undergone extensive testing on the Holesky testnet since Jan ‘24 and has passed a first round of audits for mainnet deployment.</li>\n<li><strong>Versatile Bidding Support</strong>: mev-commit supports sending bids for various execution or commitment use cases, with an initial focus on execution preconfirmations for Ethereum. It accommodates both leader-based and leaderless visions, reducing mechanism risk for participants.</li>\n<li><strong>Active Participation and Testing</strong>: Many validator groups are already opted into the network on its testnet, which can be tracked on Holesky contracts or the validator registry dashboard. Actors including MEV searchers, L2s, shared sequencers, and bridges are working on Proofs-of-Concept with mev-commit to test use cases and enhance their transaction UX.</li>\n<li><strong>Net-New Revenue Opportunities</strong>: Bids in mev-commit represent new revenue opportunities for validators, block builders, sequencers, and other mev actors. Holesky test data shows an average 2x increase in block value using mev-commit. Execution service providers commit to these bids and must deliver on their commitments, such as executing transactions in Ethereum blocks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17655-context-and-background-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17655-context-and-background-4\"></a>Context and background</h3>\n<p>Primev, the organization behind mev-commit, was founded in November 2022 following discussions with members of the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots team at Devcon Bogota '22 in which we explored the benefits of a real-time coordination layer. Our team’s experience operating a block builder and relay laid the foundation for mev-commit, an open-source credible commitment network that addresses coordination inefficiencies in an increasingly decentralized and complex transaction execution landscape.</p>\n<p>With mev-commit, communities like Lido can passively opt in to preconfirmations, described as the “next widely adopted validator service after mev-boost” (per Hasu’s ReGOOSE proposal). Some Lido operators have already expressed interest in mev-commit, which already has early adoption from validator groups on the Holesky testnet. Primev has seen recent demand from stETH holders, particularly those utilizing stETH to restake in Symbiotic, following our partnership announcement with Symbiotic. Additionally, Primev has published extensive research on preconfirmations and is building mev-commit in the open, with plans to grow the network with the community through a DAO structure.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17655-how-mev-commit-benefits-yield-for-lido-validators-and-increases-utility-for-steth-holders-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17655-how-mev-commit-benefits-yield-for-lido-validators-and-increases-utility-for-steth-holders-5\"></a>How mev-commit benefits yield for Lido validators and increases utility for stETH holders</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High bar for security practices</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>We prioritize security, rigorously testing mev-commit since the beginning of the year and engaging audit firms and independent security researchers for audits. Security reports will be made publicly available for mainnet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Low-risk profile</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>We’ve aimed to avoid introducing additional risks to LDO token holders and stETH stakers.

We aim to decentralize each network component with input and participation from early users and involved communities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Increase validator yield</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Primev has been championing preconfirmations for over a year in the ecosystem, and has pioneered a set of new mev-originating services through a sufficiently decentralized network. Primev is dedicated to growing the usage of these services and thus benefit participating validators in a continuous and growing manner as we have ecosystem participants build new commitment games and introduce them to the network.</li>\n<li>Notably, mev-commit’s design avoids suboptimal decision making for validators, such as constraining block builders, which can lead to opportunity costs for validators. This leads to opted-in validators with little to no downside potentialwhile maximizing upside potential for net-new yield.</li>\n<li>mev-commit is the only network that is able to provide execution preconfirmations by default, unlocking maximum revenue from preconfirmation bids as users are willing to pay extra for execution guarantees and avoid transaction reversion from being included but not executed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17655-getting-mev-commit-lido-ready-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17655-getting-mev-commit-lido-ready-6\"></a>Getting mev-commit Lido-ready</h2>\n<p>Primev is enacting the below tasks based on early feedback from the Lido community. Our goal is  to integrate mev-commit for a seamless interaction with the Lido community:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Employ mainnet staking contracts:</strong></p>\n<p>This approach mitigates bridging or chain-related risks considering the large amounts staked, relying primarily on Ethereum security to passively opt-in to mev-commit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support stETH as a staking asset</strong></p>\n<p>Leveraging DeFi’s composability, this integration aligns both ecosystems and increases the utility of stETH for gaining additional yield from commitment games. As the Lido community benefits from these games, we will explore additional partnership opportunities to enhance incentives for staking stETH as an opt-in method.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integrate Lido ETH staking into mev-commit’s validator dashboard UI</strong></p>\n<p>This includes supporting stETH and other related actions based on feedback, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience for validators opting into mev-commit. This will give mev-commit opted-in validators an opportunity to accept stETH from the community as collateral, and stETH holders to participate in securing mev-commit and benefit from preconfirmations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Launch a Validator Insurance Pool to enhance low risk profile of participation</strong></p>\n<p>Primev is in the process of launching a 100 ETH Validator Insurance Pool on mainnet to reimburse validators for any potential hazards resulting from opting in to mev-commit.

Reporting of this information is done via permissionless methods on <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-26.md#contracts\"><code>CSVerifier.sol</code></a> contract. To prepare and submit report transactions <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/csm-prover-tool\">csm-prover-tool</a> can be used. This tool allows for 2 operation modes: daemon and CLI. While CLI mode is introduced for the purposes of one-time reporting by Node Operators, daemon mode is used to run the application on a permanent basis. Being launched in daemon mode, the application monitors the state of the Ethereum CL and submits reports about CSM validators being withdrawn or slashed.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17649-gas-estimation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17649-gas-estimation-3\"></a>Gas estimation</h2>\n<p>Each individual reporting operation costs around 300,000 gas.

Currently, only 8% of LDO token holders actively participate in voting, leaving the majority of voting power underutilized. Many token holders are unaware of key governance proposals and discussions, resulting in missed opportunities to participate in governance.</p>\n<p>GovCheck will address this issue by curating and summarizing governance discussions, proposals, and comments within the Lido DAO.

This gap results in LDO token holders being unaware of important governance decisions, leading to underutilized voting power. Many token holders, especially those on Twitter, miss out on critical opportunities to contribute to governance because they are not informed about the discussions and proposals taking place within the DAO. As a result, only a small fraction of LDO holders actively engage in the governance process, leaving much of the voting power untapped.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17495-target-audience-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17495-target-audience-4\"></a>Target Audience</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>LDO Token Holders</strong>: Individuals who hold LDO tokens but are not actively participating in governance due to a lack of awareness or understanding of ongoing proposals and discussions.</li>\n<li><strong>Delegators</strong>: LDO holders who delegate their voting power but want to stay informed about the decisions made on their behalf, ensuring their delegation aligns with their values and interests.</li>\n<li><strong>Active Participants in DeFi</strong>: Users involved in the broader DeFi ecosystem who are interested in governance participation but may not be fully engaged with Lido DAO’s processes and updates.</li>\n<li><strong>Crypto Enthusiasts and Influencers</strong>: People active on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord who can amplify governance discussions and help spread awareness about key proposals and decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance Stewards</strong>: Individuals and teams deeply involved in DAOs and governance processes, seeking accessible, high-quality content to stay updated and influence decision-making within the Lido ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Educational Platforms and Analysts</strong>: Blockchain educators, content creators, and analysts who provide insights to their audiences on governance-related topics and Lido’s ecosystem developments.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17495-solution-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17495-solution-5\"></a>Solution</h3>\n<p>We are governance crawlers who meticulously review discussions, proposals, and comments within the Lido DAO.

Solutions should have a clear path to potentially becoming native to the protocol, aligning with Ethereum’s future upgrades and developments</li>\n<li><strong>Neutrality and Inclusivity</strong>: The technology should enhance the user experience and robustness of the Ethereum network without introducing favoritism or reliance on specific service providers. For instance, it should not require the Lido protocol to favor a specific set of relayers or builders</li>\n<li><strong>Adherence to Community Standards</strong>: The technology should be in line with broader Ethereum community efforts, aiming for interoperability and alignment with other proposals. For example, credible commitments and relays should respect ongoing discussions on standardization and security best practices.</li>\n<li><strong>Security Best Practices</strong>: All technologies and protocols must adhere to the highest standards of smart contract security. This includes regular code reviews, third-party audits, and formal verification where applicable. Developers should ensure that all known vulnerabilities are addressed prior to deployment in any testnet environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Complementary Use Cases</strong>: Proposed technologies should add value to existing use cases and not inhibit the growth or adoption of other innovations.

While this is an exciting area of innovation and opportunity for Lido’s Community, many teams building commitments are creating new sidecars driving fragmentation and risks for Ethereum and the Lido operator set. With this in mind, and to reduce these risks, a group across the Ethereum / Lido Community is working on a new sidecar called Commit-Boost focused on standardizing the last mile of communication between validators and validator services. We expect the first use cases of Commit-Boost to be for PBS (i.e., MEV-boost), Inclusion Lists, and Preconfirmations.</p>\n<p><strong>Commit-Boost Design Principles</strong></p>\n<p>Commit-Boost is a community-driven, open-source project developing an unopinionated validator platform to enable safe interactions with commitments. We believe many of the core design features align with the core principles of the Lido community and a project that directly aligns with the mission of LEGO. Some of its features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unification: Core devs will be able to interact and work with one standard during Ethereum forks / upgrades / when and if things go wrong</li>\n<li>Backward compatibility + more: Commit-Boost is not only backward compatible with MEV-Boost, but will improve the life of Lido operators who only run MEV-Boost through increased reporting, telemetry / other off-the-shelf tools validators can employ</li>\n<li>Opt-in without running more sidecars: Commit-Boost will allow proposers who want to opt into other commitments to do so without having to run multiple sidecars</li>\n<li>Tools and features to help reduce risks for Lido’s operator set: In the spirit of ReGOOSE, Commit-Boost is specifically designed with off-the-shelf monitoring and proactive tools to identify risks, limit the impact of bugs, and proactively alert teams of issues that may develop from validator services</li>\n<li>Robust support: Commit-Boost software is supported by a not-for-profit entity. This team will be focused on security and robustness through policies and procedures with follow-the-sun type models where there is support 24/7 if / when things go wrong. This team will also be focused on testing and adjustments needed during hard forks and have a team to interact with to help during adoption, improvements, and sustainment</li>\n<li>Additional revenue: As part of the open innovation that Commit-Boost enables, potential validator services will continue to come online, to capture new revenue opportunities when making commitments</li>\n<li>For the Community: This team and effort will not be VC-backed. There is no monetization plan. The entity will not sell itself and will not start any monetizable side businesses. As an example, the team is actively working on a grant application to the Lido Community, among other organizations across Ethereum</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What Does Success Look Like and How Does this Benefit the Lido Community</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Commit-Boost is used to increase the decentralization and safety / security of Ethereum’s validator set and provide some autonomy back to proposers to express the ethos of Ethereum in their block</li>\n<li>Develop a product that reduces current and emerging risks for Ethereum and Lido Operators by running one sidecar, but allows teams to opt into many commitments / validator services creating new revenue opportunities</li>\n<li>Robust support and sustainment of Commit-Boost software that improves the lives of validators during upgrades, when things go wrong, and as new features are proposed</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Details Around Deliverables</strong></p>\n<p>There are three main activities we will undertake with this initial grant; development, adoption, and sustainment. The grant will specifically help cover development and adoption as well as lay the foundation for sustainment. Below are some key deliverables, but details can also be found in the Commit-Boost <a href=\"https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client/issues\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">repo</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> This is focused on various key deliverables around Commit-Boost sidecar + PBS module ready for audit features including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CBC1 (Q4): Core Commit-Boost functionality for backward compatibility ready for audit</li>\n<li>CBC2 (Q4): PBS module extensions (i.e., miss slot / get_header) ready for audit</li>\n<li>CBC3 (Q4): Transparency and metrics implemented for PBS module (i.e., Grafana dashboards), and extendable to other modules and ready for audit</li>\n<li>CBC4 (Q4): Research, design and develop as well as get code audit ready to enable containerization of modules</li>\n<li>CBC5 (Q4): Work with module creators / the broader ecosystem to finalize module APIs and get code audit ready</li>\n<li>CBC6 (Q4): Support more flexibility as part of Commit-Boost core functionality such as binaries with code ready for audit</li>\n<li>CBE1 (Q4): Research and potential development around the best path forward for providing signatures not related to PBS. We already support BLS, but need to gather feedback and work towards whether we should support domains or proxy BLS signatures as well as ECDSA. While it is a bit unknown at this time, the grant can also get this part of the code base to audit</li>\n<li>CBE2 (Q4-Q1): We have a simple implementation of our proxy signer, but we need to evaluate and spec proxy signature for multiple validator set-ups / work with client / remote signer teams (this will be impacted by CBE1). While it is a bit unknown at this time, the grant can also get this part of the code base to audit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Budget estimates for Development is $135,000 broken out across Development and Research for $50,000 and Audits estimated at $85,000.</p>\n<p><strong>Adoption</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CBA1 (Q4 – Q1): There are a few key events such as Edge City, Devcon, ETHconomics, and ETH Denver that could really benefit the team to have budget to attend</li>\n<li>CBA2 (2025): There are a few key subscriptions that the team needs to increase broader support for the community / outreach. One example includes a professional Zoom account to record community calls</li>\n<li>CBA3 (throughout development): Enhance documentation with changes / updated code</li>\n<li>CBA4 (Q4 - Q1): One headcount focused on driving BD / coordination / adoption and helping push the overall commitment space forward</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Budget estimates for Adoption is estimated at $65k.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustainment</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CBS1 (Q4): We need to have some legal analysis performed to help decide on the best entity set-up given the structure of Commit-Boost. The output of this analysis is the decision on how best to move forward</li>\n<li>CBS2 (Q4): Set-up entity based on the above analysis</li>\n<li>CBS3 (Q4 – Q1): While we can’t list all items out, get the entity to be functioning with proper disclosures, contract templates for employees, bank accounts, multi-sigs, and many other functions required to run the entity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Budget estimates to lay the foundation for Sustainment is $15k.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the Plan for Commit-Boost the Entity</strong></p>\n<p>We have written about this before, but please see below for the current plan / path we are headed down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set-up similar to a client team, but not-for-profit US-based entity with no VC backing or plans to sell / start side businesses for monetization, and no token</li>\n<li>There will be a global team of a few devs + some business development-type personnel that focus on education and transparency, sustainment / development, and research:\n<ul>\n<li>Education and Transparency: This effort will keep the broader ethereum community educated on the latest through open-source repo and governance calls / governance process</li>\n<li>Sustainment / Development: 24/7 follow-the-sun coverage and highly engaged with client teams around upgrades / early in getting testnet support</li>\n<li>Research Focus: Still a tbd and this is mainly for retention of devs / making sure they are staying plugged into the latest, but helping with open-source research across Ethereum</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>More Details on Education and Governance Around Commit-Boost</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initially, will run a Commit-Boost, ACDC-like call frequently to engage with stakeholders and drive consensus on upgrades / help coordinate around hard forks (more details on call <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#0</span> <a href=\"https://github.com/Commit-Boost/pm/blob/main/Community_Calls/Call0.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>)</li>\n<li>We have also been speaking with others across the ecosystem to figure out the best way to do governance given calls can attract certain types of people (i.e., tougher for non-english speaking etc), but the point is to be open and driven by the community</li>\n<li>While still a work in progress, if a board is required to oversee the Commit-Boost entity their focus will be on entity corporate governance and not on Commit-Boost software or direction and these members will be experts from across the Ethereum community</li>\n<li>We welcome Lido’s ideas around what they have learned over the years</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>We appreciate Lido Community’s consideration of this proposal.

class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17372-purpose-5\"></a>Purpose</h1>\n<p>MSF is looking to sustain its financial independence from government funding, and remain driven by medical needs alone with no interference from political agendas. It is actively seeking to leverage blockchain as means to shorten intermediaries between donors and patients, and sees in cryptocurrencies a new way for philanthropic giving.</p>\n<p>MSF wants Stake2Care to support its Emergency fund, allowing for immediate deployment to any emergency unfolding, and as such to save as many lives as possible, not waiting for financial support to trickle in or support for a particular situation to materialise. This is all the more crucial when crises we intervene in do not make it to the public eye and don’t benefit from Media attention.</p>\n<p>MSF is a direct implementer, guaranteeing support costs are optimal at all times, and not diluted by paying intermediaries to deliver aid. Transparency in disbursement and accountability to our donors and the public are weaved into our ways of working, as we report back on how every amount received is used.</p>\n<p>A donation of 50 CHF can go to fund 3 Surgical kits, one of 100 CHF can fund 25 Cholera vaccines, while one of 200 CHF can provide 28 malnourished children with therapeutic food for 2 weeks, and so on: MSF believes in individual donations put together allow for a unique &amp; direct impact.</p>\n<p>We are a non-profit organisation and 80% of our financial resources are allocated to fulfilling our social mission. Our fundraising costs are among the lowest in the sector, but still account for</p>\n<p>15%: Help us drive this number down, while helping us fund our activities!</p>\n<p>MSF is also highly attuned to the current workload and priorities of the Lido development team, and has successfully endeavoured to remain self-sufficient through the development process of this project - relying on existing learning materials, documentation and code as far as is possible. We believe that there will very few lulls in development for Ethereum and Lido as the Surge, Verge, Purge and Splurge advance - so are keen to begin this work as soon as is possible in Q4 2024 - and liaise closely with the Lido team to schedule future reviews, in-depth testing and go-live as busy schedules allow in the following months.</p>\n<p>—------</p>\n<p>Who is Doctors Without Borders?</p>\n<p>A worldwide movement since 1971:</p>\n<p>Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières, MSF) is an international, independent medical humanitarian organisation that provides medical assistance to people affected by conflict, epidemics, disasters, or exclusion from healthcare. MSF was founded in 1971 in Paris by a group of doctors and journalists with the aim of delivering rapid, effective, and impartial emergency medical aid. Over 52 years old, MSF has become a global movement of nearly 52,000 employees active in more than 70 countries around the world (2023 numbers). MSF is a non-profit, self-governed, member-based organisation.</p>\n<p>Patients first:</p>\n<p>MSF was created in the belief that all people should have access to healthcare regardless of gender, race, religion, creed or political affiliation, and that people’s medical needs outweigh respect for national boundaries. MSF’s principles of action are described in our <a href=\"https://www.msf.org/msf-charter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">charter</a>, which establishes a framework for our activities. MSF seeks to provide high-quality care to patients and advocate for affordable, high-quality medicines. Our actions are guided by medical ethics and by our working principles: impartiality, independence, neutrality, bearing witness, transparency, and accountability.</p>\n<p>MSF in figures:</p>\n<p>In 2023, MSF provided more than 16 million outpatient consultations, more than 3,2 million vaccinations against measles and performed over 125,000 surgical interventions. All these achievements are made possible thanks to more than 7,3 million individual donors and private institutions (private companies and foundations) that provide 98 per cent of the annual funds raised by the MSF movement.

For more information about ERC-6123, please see our paper “ERC-6123: Rethinking Financial Derivatives” (August 2024).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17347-how-will-it-aid-the-lido-ecosystem-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17347-how-will-it-aid-the-lido-ecosystem-2\"></a>How will it aid the Lido ecosystem?</h2>\n<p>The project will aim to validate or invalidate the working hypothesis that stETH-based Ethereum Staking Rate Swaps can provide significant value to the Lido ecosystem, benefiting stakeholders staking with Lido.</p>\n<p>For validators, the hypothesis is that it can provide crucial risk management tools, allowing them to hedge against yield volatility and secure predictable and reliable rewards. This stability could help make Lido staking more attractive to a broader range of participants.</p>\n<p>Benefits to the Lido ecosystem include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Stability: Such swaps can attract more risk-averse participants to the Lido ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Increased Liquidity: The ability to hedge can encourage larger stakes, improving overall liquidity.</li>\n<li>Market Efficiency: Swaps help in price discovery for Lido staking rewards, potentially leading to more efficient markets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Simplified illustrative example:</p>\n<p>Scenario: Alice operates a validator business with significant ETH staked through Lido. She receives stETH in return for her staked ETH. While Alice appreciates the potential rewards, she also needs to manage her cash flow to cover operational costs and make business plans.</p>\n<p>Problem: The Lido Staking User APR is volatile due to various factors such as network activity, validator participation rates, and overall market conditions. This volatility makes it difficult for Alice to predict her income and plan her business expenses.</p>\n<p>Need: Alice wants to stabilize a portion of her rewards for the next 3 months to ensure she can cover her operational costs regardless of Lido APR fluctuations.</p>\n<p>Solution: Alice enters into a 3-month stETH-based swap with a counterparty Bob.</p>\n<p>Benefits for Alice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Predictable Rewards: Alice now knows she will effectively earn a fixed (annualized) rewards rate on the notional amount, regardless of Lido APR fluctuations.</li>\n<li>Risk Management: She is protected against downside risk if Lido APR falls below the fixed rate.</li>\n<li>Operational Stability: With a known rewards stream, Alice can confidently plan her business expenses and investments.</li>\n<li>Retained Upside on Unswapped Portion: Alice can still benefit from rewards increases on any stETH not involved in the swap.</li>\n<li>Flexibility: Alice remains liquid in stETH and can participate in other DeFi activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17347-why-is-it-important-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17347-why-is-it-important-3\"></a>Why is it important?</h2>\n<p>The successful execution of at least three publicized CESR-based Ethereum Staking Rate Swaps suggests precedent and growing demand for using those new financial instruments. In March 2024, FalconX, a digital asset prime brokerage and derivatives service provider completed the first fixed-floating swap using CESR. The two participating firms in the swap are Multicoin Capital, a thesis-driven investment firm, and Parataxis Capital, a multi-strategy investment firm. In May 2024, Nonco, a digital assets trading firm specializing in institutional and professional investors, has completed its first fixed-floating swap. Bastion Trading, a systematic trading firm, structured and priced the transaction. Twinstake announced another industry milestone with the “first swap transaction by a staking provider on the CESR\".</p>\n<p>However, as the native rate within the Lido ecosystem, the Lido Staked Ether (stETH) APR should be the de-facto rate for structuring financial products like swaps and would offer clarity and consistency for ecosystem participants. The Lido APR directly reflects the specific annualized rewards rate from ETH staked through Lido, providing a more accurate and relevant measure of rewards for Lido users compared to the broader and less tailored rate such as CESR.</p>\n<p>In addition, the development of new derivative markets, such as dated futures, is paving the way for the creation of comprehensive reward curves in the digital asset space. These emerging markets provide critical benchmarks for pricing and risk management. Participants leveraging ERC-6123 for executing and settling stETH swaps on-chain will be well-positioned to engage with an expanded suite of financial products and to capitalize on these advancements - including outright futures, outright swaps, and swaps vs. futures spreads.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17347-timeline-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17347-timeline-4\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Deliverable</th>\n<th>Brief Description</th>\n<th>How to measure completion</th>\n<th>Estimate date of completion</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Research paper: stETH Swaps for the Lido Ecosystem</td>\n<td>A comprehensive evaluation of the hypothesis that stETH-based Ethereum Staking Rate Swaps can offer significant value to users.

We are a team of dedicated governance enthusiasts who have been in the crypto governance space for over three years.

We believe this community has some of the strongest and most intelligent community members and we’re grateful to be along for the journey!</p>\n<p><strong>Core Values:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Growth: Our decisions are primarily focused on the growth of the protocol. This often results in how to spend money efficiently, but even more importantly and objecting for unreasonable spends and knowing when to vote no.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transparency: Clear communication with votes and explanations of reasoning, and an equivalent demand for proposals to do the same. Too often we see thousands, if not millions, being rolled up together and glossed over during proposals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accountability: Too often once a decision is done, having proper accountability becomes an afterthought. Whether it’s a DAO promise or a grant or a new program, once a DAO votes something in, we forget about it. Our goal with PGov is to both continue to check in on these decisions as well as ensure that there are proper channels set up to ensure accountability.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance:</strong> We are committed to the code of conduct, mission, and respective values<br>\n<strong>Disclosures:</strong> We are delegates across other Defi protocols.

My name is Irina. I am the Segment Lead within the <a href=\"https://everstake.one/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Everstake</a> team. Before setting the anchor at Everstake, I was part of marketing teams in Web2, working for tech corporations such as Microsoft and Google, and contributing to the growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Many of you may know me from my regular <a href=\"https://x.com/search?q=Node%20Operator%20Community%20Call%20(from%3Aeth_everstake)&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Node Operators Community Call recaps</a>, but besides these, I do tons of <a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">educational content around Ethereum</a> for the community, as I believe that fighting informational asymmetry and biases will help make this space better. I cover covers not only the latest things around Ethereum and explain novel, complicated concepts in simple words but also touch on the broader landscape that shapes the Ethereum we know today and will face tomorrow. More solid materials from my side include Ethereum ecosystem reports within <a href=\"https://everstake.one/crypto-reports\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our reports hub</a>, articles, and talks on the crypto conferences (the last one was on Ethereum governance).</p>\n<p>Thanks for considering my application! Below, you can find out more about my motivation, values, and decision-making approach. If any questions, I will be happy to answer them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17237-contact-information-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17237-contact-information-4\"></a>Contact Information</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>X / Twitter: <a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@eth_everstake</a></li>\n<li>Discord: irina_everstake</li>\n<li>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/irina_everstake\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">irina_everstake</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17237-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17237-motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The recent <a href=\"https://x.com/DefiIgnas/status/1817928935490867309\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Compound governance attack</a> proved once more the importance of true voters’ dedication and accountability to the governance process, thus, in my opinion, the introduction of a Public Delegate Platform is just in time to enforce a sustainable governance process within Lido DAO itself.</p>\n<p>I have been within the Lido ecosystem for a long time, so I see this initiative as a great opportunity to contribute my expertise and usefulness to the protocol evolution, community, and LDO token holders. For the latter, keeping track of all proposals and voting deadlines may be a burden, which may create a perception of centralization, underrepresentation, and the worst—FOMO, as it’s pretty challenging to be on top of everything given the speed of projects within Web3 space.</p>\n<p>As soon as within my Everstake role I also take care of Everstake representation in the Lido governance process, thus if I become a Public Delegate, it won’t be an extra effort for me, as it is something I used to do on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Besides, I find the governance process itself interesting, as this concept matures across the Web3 industry (maybe that’s one of the reasons I write so much about it and my recent conference talk was dedicated to it).</p>\n<p>Below are some examples of my participation in the Lido governance across past few years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Posts (<a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1719766040282845540\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example 1</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1689588674348957696\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example 2</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1636726740004249600\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example 3</a>) explaining the proposal/s on the voting to the community</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://x.com/search?q=%22%F0%9F%97%B3%EF%B8%8F%20%22%20(from%3Airina_everstake)&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Weekly governance highlights</a></li>\n<li>Monthly voting reports (<a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1665016791393763329\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example 1</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1679597852316561414\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example 2</a>): what, when and why</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1616031474083299328\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Overview of all governance across the year</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/increasing-number-of-active-easy-track-motions-run-simultaneously/4075\">Proposal</a> suggested by me (one and only now)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/profile/0x06A90756e57bC7A016Eed0aB23fC36d11C42bBa0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">My Snapshot voting profile</a> (active since I received the LDO grant in March of this year)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Objectives as a Public Delegate</strong><br>\nThese are focused on three main pillars of the Lido ecosystem:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Serve to protocol</em>.

Provide in-depth analysis, qualitative discussions, and feedback on the numerous proposals on the forum, as well as active voting participation to minimize not-reached-quorum on-chain voting.</li>\n<li><em>Serve to LDO, stETH and stMATIC tokenholders</em>. While under the current governance design, only the first are eligible to participate, I aim to represent the voices of various interested parties, as all their interests are crucial to the protocol’s long-term success. For LDO tokenholders specifically, I want to be a reliable and helpful mediator in expressing their will and power of Lido future.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With a good understanding of the Lido governance process and a set process of allocating time for it, I will be a great delegate for your voting power. With your support, my commitment and track record of taking part in Lido governance will continue to make a significant impact within this ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17237-values-and-decision-making-approach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17237-values-and-decision-making-approach-6\"></a>Values and Decision-Making Approach</h3>\n<p><strong>My values</strong><br>\nCore values that will define my decision-making approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Stay true to the Lido Vibe</em>:\n<ul>\n<li>Purpose: Keep Ethereum decentralized, accessible to all, and resistant to censorship.</li>\n<li>Vision: A world in which Ethereum is the co-ordination and value layer of the internet.</li>\n<li>Mission: Make staking simple, secure, and decentralized.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Holistic and sustainable growth</em>: all decisions will be made with the focus on protocol, tokenholders and stakers security and long-term success.</li>\n<li><em>Integrity, transparency and accountability</em>: I will provide clear reasoning for the decisions I will make with the delegated voting power and the live publicly accessed database of all ongoing and completed votings in the form of a table (see the example below—it is the one I currently use for internal purposes that has all Lido governance votings since 2022):<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/c/c541bde4266b6271670715cc73ab5c0e59aa3c20.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/s90UAD6gSvZsGnmByoN0F0vUDte.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/c/c541bde4266b6271670715cc73ab5c0e59aa3c20_2_602x421.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"s90UAD6gSvZsGnmByoN0F0vUDte\" width=\"602\" height=\"421\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/c/c541bde4266b6271670715cc73ab5c0e59aa3c20_2_602x421.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/c/c541bde4266b6271670715cc73ab5c0e59aa3c20_2_903x631.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/c/c541bde4266b6271670715cc73ab5c0e59aa3c20_2_1204x842.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DDDADA\"></a></div></li>\n<li><em>Active participation and voting</em>: I commit to voting in at least 70% of the votes per quarter and providing feedback on the proposals on the forum while continuing active community engagement and informing on the governance process through my X / Twitter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What will define my decision-making process?</strong><br>\nI am attentive to details and have an analytical mindset.

Lemma’s services cover governance design, implementation, initial setup of the foundation from an operations perspective (accounting, bank and exchange accounts, policies, and procedures) and running of grants programs and governance for DAOs.</p>\n<p>The Lemma is presented by a forward think team of professionals that consist of traditional finance professionals and crypto native researchers.</p>\n<p>In our short history we came to recognize the importance of governance and the role delegates play. This role is critical to effective governance of the DAO and being able to move forward with informed decision making.</p>\n<p>We are active contributors to other DAO’s. Assisting with the transparency reports of <a href=\"https://forum.balancer.fi/t/foundation-opco-transparency-report/5875\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Balancer</a> DAO, payments with <a href=\"https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/osmosis-grants-program-v3-renewal/1003\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Osmosis DAO</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dydxgrants.com/post/v1-5-extension-launch\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dYdX</a> grants program.</p>\n<p><strong>Cryptoeconomic Design Expertise</strong></p>\n<p>Lemma’s in-house governance research efforts ensure our industry leading services and will be critically involved with Lido’s Governance. Research is led by <a href=\"https://x.com/blockbanzai\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hugo May</a>, who is an experienced cryptoeconomics researcher and founding member and core contributor of <a href=\"https://justcryptoeconomics.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Just Cryptoeconomics</a>, an open-access and non-profit research group that was founded to advance the field of cryptoeconomics., an open-access and non-profit research group that was founded to advance the field of cryptoeconomics.</p>\n<p>Through this initiative, Hugo explores new theories, models, and frameworks, and the insights we gain often inform the projects Lemma takes on.</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional Expertise</strong></p>\n<p>The Founders of Lemma combines expertise from the traditional auditing world and big data. Karel Olivier worked as an auditor at Deloitte in South Africa, the USA and Cayman Islands bringing together a unique set of experiences where he learned from listed and private companies about controls, diversification and the importance of maintain accurate financial information in the making of informed decision making. Lize Page, has a Masters degree in Data Science. With the volume that is produced on the blockchain, the ability to make sense of this is of invaluable experience. Lemma has advisors who we rely on for council when needed. Petri Basson, from Hash Directors, a Web3 specialized directorship firm is an example. They bring an informed lens to decision making when it comes to operations of the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>We believe that effective governance design is of critical importance to the survival of online public goods. We are well aware of voting fatigue and the implications of the current DAO governance landscape. Having delegates who are informed, willing, active and responsive ensures that the DAO can continue with its mission without the added burden of having to work on “getting out the vote”.</p>\n<p>We bring a different set of skills to the Lido DAO. Being involved with DAOs in their formation stages allows us to see the thinking behind decision making. This experience will provide additional context and feedback to the DAO. We evaluate proposals not only on their merit and cost, but also on what it would mean operationally.</p>\n<p>Our promise to you, the delegates</p>\n<p><strong>Involvement</strong></p>\n<p>We will be involved in proposals. Not only in voting, but in articulating our reasoning and decision-making approach. We intend to offer the same level of diligence in our participation as we do in our operational enablement.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro-activity</strong></p>\n<p>We will be pro-active in our communication. Assessing proposals early-on to allow for changes to be made withing reasonable timelines.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliant and future Focused</strong></p>\n<p>Our primary focus will be on the future of Lido DAO. Each decision will be based on whether this is in line with the growth of the Lido DAO, adds value to the DAO and will allow the DAO to continue with its primary mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance</strong></p>\n<p>We accept the purpose/mission/values of Lido DAO</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure</strong></p>\n<p>We work with other DAOs. Where a proposal is raised in which we have a conflict of interest we will disclose this and abstain from voting or commentary unless it is specifically requested.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lemma-delegate-thread/8214\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lemma-delegate-thread/8214","pubDate":"Sun, 25 Aug 2024 19:42:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-8214"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lemma-delegate-thread/8214.rss","#text":"Lemma - Delegate Thread"},"filter":false},{"title":"Marcbcs - Delegate Thread","dc:creator":"marcbcs","category":"Delegate Platform","description":"<p><strong>Name</strong>: Marc<br>\n<strong>Contact Information</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>X / Telegram / Discord = <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/marcbcs\">@marcbcs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Address</strong>: 0x98308b6dA79B47D15e9438CB66831563649Dbd94</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Background: During the day I work in TradFi, at night I work in Crypto. I’m an economist by training which is what got me into crypto a few years ago: the opportunity to create a better “money”, and from there I never escaped from the rabbit hole. I started my working career in management consulting, first at a top consultancy firm and afterwards as a freelancer. My consulting work has involved from high-level projects advising client’s senior leadership team / board of directors on key strategic matters, to hands-on projects defining and implementing cost reductions. My clients are businesses operating in TradFi Services, Public Sector and Investment Funds amongst others. Currently most of my time is dedicated to Revolut working there in Strategy (10%) &amp; Operations (90%), a decent amount of the time on crypto. After hours, I consult for crypto startups (mostly regulated businesses / CeFi) and I’m an active contributor to Lido in the Treasury Management Committee.</li>\n<li>Expertise: Get shit done in business strategy and operations; break down hard stuff into simple terms so people (from devs, to management to operators) can understand each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make it easier for LDO holders to participate in Lido’s governance: It’s not possible to be on top of everything, specially in an rapidly moving industry like crypto. This is why I myself focus on Lido and delegate my tokens for other projects. If elected, I will stop consulting for other companies to ensure I do a good job here.</li>\n<li>Ensure that Lido continues to be a leader in staking: Lido has a head-start because of it’s large market share with Retail. However, the Institutions are coming and this will be a completely different game. I want to see Lido thrive here and help make it happen.</li>\n<li>Bring the best of the traditional business world to Lido: DAOs are a great invention but have their own set of challenges. I believe that there are a few things we can borrow from traditional businesses improve Lido and I’m well placed to help with that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Values and Decision-Making Approach</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decentralisation</li>\n<li>Meritocracy</li>\n<li>Seek truth (<em>“what do people believe merely by convention and what is truth?”</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance</strong><br>\nI accept <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\">the Lido Public Delegate Code of Conduct </a> and commit to being fully aligned with <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-vibe-alignment-purpose-mission-vision/4380\">Purpose/Mission/Values of Lido DAO</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures</strong><br>\nI work a TradFi job for Revolut, which involves working on crypto. I also have to disclose my relationship with Lido to Revolut to avoid any conflicts of interest, and should one arise, I would inform both parties and anyone who has delegated to me.<br>\nI also advise crypto startups, mostly regulated businesses / CeFi.

Soichiro, with a background in asset management for institutional investors at Goldman Sachs, engages in strategic analysis and business development related to crypto assets. Shinya, with financial system development experience at Goldman Sachs, ensures the technological innovation and robustness of our staking infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Our investors, including Yamaguchi Capital and GMO Web3, support our vision and operations.

We consistently maintain over 99.9% uptime in our staking services, supporting multi-client and multi-region operations.<br>\nAdditionally, we are leading the introduction of the Lido Community Staking Module (CSM) in Japan, hosting monthly events since July 2024 and creating Japanese documentation to promote knowledge dissemination. We have plans for further CSM development (<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/community-grants-csm-resources/7990/6\">link</a>).</li>\n<li><strong>Traditional Finance and Institutional Expertise (TradFi/Institutional)</strong><br>\nOur leadership team brings extensive experience from the traditional finance sector. Our CEO, Soichiro Tokuriki, notably worked at Goldman Sachs, where he specialized in institutional investor relations. As ETH spot ETFs and staking ETFs frows, an influx of institutional capital into ETH staking is anticipated. Lido Institutional is well-positioned to meet this demand, and we believe our expertise in traditional finance and institutional investor relations will significantly contribute to advancing these efforts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17218-motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17218-motivation-4\"></a><strong>Motivation:</strong></h2>\n<p>Lido has a robust ecosystem comprised of numerous stakers—both individual and institutional—as well as a diverse array of node operators including professional staking firms and solo validators. By effectively balancing and aligning the interests of these stakeholders, Lido continues to expand its ecosystem and foster a more decentralized Ethereum network.</p>\n<p>Within this context, providing staking services to institutional investors and advancing the development of community stakers emerge as critical challenges. Driven by these considerations, we are motivated to serve as a Lido DAO delegator with the following objectives.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decentralization of Ethereum Staking Entities (Integration with Institutional Investors)</strong><br>\nWith the recent introduction of Ethereum spot ETFs, there is an anticipated influx of capital from institutional investors into ETH staking. The continued development of stETH, which allows staking while maintaining decentralization, is crucial for the ecosystem. In this context, providing staking solutions to institutional investors—essentially advancing Lido Institution—is of paramount importance. I believe that discussions within Lido DAO from this perspective are necessary, and we are eager to contribute to these discussions.</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralization of Ethereum Node Operators (Revitalization of Community Stakers)</strong><br>\nA key challenge in Ethereum staking is the decentralization of clients and servers. To enhance the geographical decentralization of servers, efforts to increase the number of Community Stakers in regions such as Asia and Africa are essential. We are committed to engaging in discussions around these initiatives and fostering active dialogue in Lido DAO by incorporating feedback from Community Stakers.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17218-values-and-decision-making-approach-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17218-values-and-decision-making-approach-5\"></a><strong>Values and Decision-Making Approach:</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Data-Driven</strong>:<br>\nWe prioritize a data-driven approach to sustain and optimize the Lido ecosystem, which hosts numerous stakers and node operators.

The team is constantly auditing governance contracts, systems, and processes to power our governance data API and governance client which is trusted and widely used across the industry. Boardroom also maintains close relationships with delegates and contributors in most major DAOs and their feedback has been helpful in analyzing tokenholder preferences and relaying industry best practices across the space.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17212-delegate-statement-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-delegate-statement-3\"></a>Delegate Statement</h2>\n<p>We support initiatives that onboard delegates, introduce governance improvements, and uphold agreed-upon governance procedures.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17212-what-we-want-to-see-happen-in-lido-governance-over-the-next-year-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-what-we-want-to-see-happen-in-lido-governance-over-the-next-year-4\"></a>What we want to see happen in Lido governance over the next year</h3>\n<p>We believe it is critical for the community to prioritize sound governance practices that are responsive to the goals of all stakeholders. As such, three things we want to see happen in Lido governance over the next year are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increased Delegate Activity:</strong> We’d like to see a focus on conversations about delegate engagement, retention, and compensation as we help establish a cultural practice of frequent re-delegation and delegate campaigning.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Information Asymmetry:</strong> Keeping up with the latest in DAO governance is cumbersome for the average tokenholder. Boardroom produces the leading weekly DAO governance newsletter and has contributed to several DAOs, including Lido, in the form of helping to reduce information asymmetry by producing easy-to-read Governance updates. As a Lido delegate, we would make solving this problem a priority.</li>\n<li><strong>Experimentation in Governance:</strong> Lido should experiment with innovations in decentralized governance, such as flexible voting, the use of working groups and SubDAOs, and governance privacy enhancements.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17212-reasons-we-want-to-be-a-delegate-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-reasons-we-want-to-be-a-delegate-5\"></a>Reasons we want to be a delegate</h3>\n<p>From our vantage point in the industry, we see many recurring issues in DAO governance. Some examples include information asymmetry, social dynamics hindering newcomer participation, limited access and support for large tokenholders and delegates, and widespread apathy and low participation among tokenholders. These issues create barriers to effective governance, making it difficult for stakeholders to stay informed, contribute meaningfully, and navigate the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Boardroom is well positioned to kickstart initiatives that can address these challenges by improving information dissemination, fostering community engagement, providing support to stakeholders, and promoting a more participatory governance environment in the Lido ecosystem onboarding. As a Lido delegate, Boardroom will offer support to contributors who don’t have the connections or the voting power needed to propose new initiatives and contribute to the governance and growth of the Lido ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17212-disclosure-of-conflicts-of-interest-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-disclosure-of-conflicts-of-interest-6\"></a>Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest</h3>\n<p>Boardroom is a venture-funded company with investors that include delegates in other protocols that could become competitive with Uniswap. Boardroom also has integrations (client and platform) and has provided governance facilitation services to stakeholders in the Optimism, ENS, Compound, and Aave ecosystems.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-17212-public-acceptance-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-public-acceptance-7\"></a>Public Acceptance</h4>\n<p>We apply and accept the Lido Public Delegate Code of Conductand with Purpose/Mission/Values of Lido DAO</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/boardroom-delegate-thread/8200\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/boardroom-delegate-thread/8200","pubDate":"Sat, 24 Aug 2024 20:27:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-8200"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/boardroom-delegate-thread/8200.rss","#text":"Boardroom Delegate Thread"},"filter":false}]}}}
