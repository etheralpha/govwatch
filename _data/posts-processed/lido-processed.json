The team is constantly auditing governance contracts, systems, and processes to power our governance data API and governance client which is trusted and widely used across the industry. Boardroom also maintains close relationships with delegates and contributors in most major DAOs and their feedback has been helpful in analyzing tokenholder preferences and relaying industry best practices across the space.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17212-delegate-statement-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-delegate-statement-3\"></a>Delegate Statement</h2>\n<p>We support initiatives that onboard delegates, introduce governance improvements, and uphold agreed-upon governance procedures.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17212-what-we-want-to-see-happen-in-lido-governance-over-the-next-year-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-what-we-want-to-see-happen-in-lido-governance-over-the-next-year-4\"></a>What we want to see happen in Lido governance over the next year</h3>\n<p>We believe it is critical for the community to prioritize sound governance practices that are responsive to the goals of all stakeholders. As such, three things we want to see happen in Lido governance over the next year are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increased Delegate Activity:</strong> We’d like to see a focus on conversations about delegate engagement, retention, and compensation as we help establish a cultural practice of frequent re-delegation and delegate campaigning.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Information Asymmetry:</strong> Keeping up with the latest in DAO governance is cumbersome for the average tokenholder. Boardroom produces the leading weekly DAO governance newsletter and has contributed to several DAOs, including Lido, in the form of helping to reduce information asymmetry by producing easy-to-read Governance updates. As a Lido delegate, we would make solving this problem a priority.</li>\n<li><strong>Experimentation in Governance:</strong> Lido should experiment with innovations in decentralized governance, such as flexible voting, the use of working groups and SubDAOs, and governance privacy enhancements.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17212-reasons-we-want-to-be-a-delegate-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-reasons-we-want-to-be-a-delegate-5\"></a>Reasons we want to be a delegate</h3>\n<p>From our vantage point in the industry, we see many recurring issues in DAO governance. Some examples include information asymmetry, social dynamics hindering newcomer participation, limited access and support for large tokenholders and delegates, and widespread apathy and low participation among tokenholders. These issues create barriers to effective governance, making it difficult for stakeholders to stay informed, contribute meaningfully, and navigate the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Boardroom is well positioned to kickstart initiatives that can address these challenges by improving information dissemination, fostering community engagement, providing support to stakeholders, and promoting a more participatory governance environment in the Lido ecosystem onboarding. As a Lido delegate, Boardroom will offer support to contributors who don’t have the connections or the voting power needed to propose new initiatives and contribute to the governance and growth of the Lido ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17212-disclosure-of-conflicts-of-interest-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-disclosure-of-conflicts-of-interest-6\"></a>Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest</h3>\n<p>Boardroom is a venture-funded company with investors that include delegates in other protocols that could become competitive with Uniswap. Boardroom also has integrations (client and platform) and has provided governance facilitation services to stakeholders in the Optimism, ENS, Compound, and Aave ecosystems.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-17212-public-acceptance-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17212-public-acceptance-7\"></a>Public Acceptance</h4>\n<p>We apply and accept the Lido Public Delegate Code of Conductand with Purpose/Mission/Values of Lido DAO</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/boardroom-delegate-thread/8200\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/boardroom-delegate-thread/8200","pubDate":"Sat, 24 Aug 2024 20:27:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-8200"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/boardroom-delegate-thread/8200.rss","#text":"Boardroom Delegate Thread"},"filter":false},{"title":"Daedalus Delegate Thread","dc:creator":"daedalus_angels","category":"Delegate Platform","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/3/34aed82e52916083ae6b83fc17510409371527a6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7w3qIHF4aMLPmlckSEZy2YxmUqq.png?dl=1\" title=\"Daedalus_Logo_Black\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/3/34aed82e52916083ae6b83fc17510409371527a6_2_125x125.png\" alt=\"Daedalus_Logo_Black\" data-base62-sha1=\"7w3qIHF4aMLPmlckSEZy2YxmUqq\" width=\"125\" height=\"125\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/3/34aed82e52916083ae6b83fc17510409371527a6_2_125x125.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/3/34aed82e52916083ae6b83fc17510409371527a6_2_187x187.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/3/34aed82e52916083ae6b83fc17510409371527a6_2_250x250.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"000000\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17206-delegate-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17206-delegate-information-1\"></a>Delegate information:</h2>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> Daedalus Collective<br>\n<strong>Address:</strong> 0x04827a54F2e345467beAFEfB9EF76Cb2f2c62D83<br>\n<strong>Forum:</strong> <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/daedalus_angels/summary\">@daedalus_angels</a><br>\n<strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/daedalus_angels\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@daedalus_angels </a><br>\n<strong>Telegram:</strong> <a href=\"https://t.me/ncerovac\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@ncerovac</a> <a href=\"https://t.me/ibidino\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@ibidino</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17206-introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17206-introduction-2\"></a><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>\n<p>Daedalus is a web3 angel collective made up of veteran founders, builders and operators in the blockchain space. Our team of 10 is a strategic blend of engineers and ex CTOs, BDs and marketers, lawyers and economists, all heavily involved and demonstrably commited to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Collectively and over the years, we have either founded or actively contributed to a long list of promising and established protocols (like Yearn Finance, Perpetual Protocol), communities (like lobsterDAO) open-source tools (like smold.app) and infrastructure solutions (like The Graph). We are decentralization maxis and have proven to be longterm, big-picture investors.</p>\n<p>Our full team and track record can be found <a href=\"https://x.com/daedalus_angels/status/1509544280309837826\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17206-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17206-motivation-3\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>\n<p>Given its dominant position among incumbent liquid staking providers and an ongoing commitment to decentralizing its Node Operator set, we clearly see Lido as one of the most important stakeholders in Ethereum’s present and future. Thus, it becomes paramount to create and nurture an efficient, transparent and high-touch approach to Lido’s wholesale governance initiatives and all future proposals.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that voter apathy has plagued both young upstarts and established protocols that pledged to decentralize their capacities. The onus is on the Lido delegates to shoulder the bulk of the operative load and herald the interests of not just the underlying protocol, but of the Ethereum ecosystem at large.</p>\n<p>The Daedalus Collective is a group of seasoned builders, founders and operators helping shape the blockchain space for the better part of the last decade. With a healthy blend of technical and soft skills as well as a track record in helping guide, grow and govern successful projects, we now want to leverage our members’ expertise to help streamline Lido’s governance efforts, demystify future proposals and pending innovations to the broader public, and advocate for both sustainable growth and ecosystem-wide alignment of the Lido protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17206-values-and-decision-making-approach-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17206-values-and-decision-making-approach-4\"></a><strong>Values and Decision-Making Approach</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Clarity and context</strong> - we aim to diminish the massive information asymmetry currently present between most delegates and the wider public. Given many of our members’ history and experience in end-user and community-facing roles, we want to help unscramble the lifecycle of an average proposal and make them more digestible for any Lido community member.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralization</strong> - we support Lido’s ongoing efforts to expand the Node Operator set and employ novel decentralization mechanisms. We pledge to safeguard the decentralization ethos and help align stakeholder interests in its pursuit.</p>\n<p><strong>High-touch</strong> - our involvement goals go beyond merely proactive - we are committed to engaging fully with 100% of incoming DAO proposals.</p>\n<p><strong>Methodical and thorough</strong> - governance proposals are a highly collaborative effort spanning across teams, departments, contributors and community members. We will always engage with all relevant stakeholders as part of our decision-making process, and ensure a constant and open line of communication from the research phase all the way up until the vote is cast.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17206-public-acceptance-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17206-public-acceptance-5\"></a><strong>Public Acceptance</strong>:</h2>\n<p>Daedalus accepts Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct (<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a>) and Aligned with <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, Vision)</a></p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures</strong>:</p>\n<p>Over the past 3 years, Daedalus and its members have backed a number of promising teams and projects across web3 verticals.

The implications of this organizational should increase network resilience, pricing, marginal costs, and advocate for the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17199-introduction-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17199-introduction-3\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The infrastructure supporting these systems, primarily composed of validators, node operators, and service providers, faces substantial operational costs and technological hurdles². The formation of the Ethereum Service Providers Business League (ESPBL) under IRS Code 501(c)(6) represents a different approach to addressing these challenges through collective action³.</p>\n<p>We intend to first provide a cost savings measure, then reassess if such a legal entity would provide additional benefit. It is entirely plausible to operate such collective barging without the need of a legal entity, potentially.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17199-methodology-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17199-methodology-4\"></a>Methodology</h2>\n<p>This study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of potential cost savings with qualitative assessment of organizational structure and its implications. Data on operational costs were collected from a sample of 20 Ethereum service providers, with projections made for a five-year period assuming a 20% year-over-year growth in membership (re: Node Operator participation). This should be a below estimate in the stated growth metrics for adding Node Operators as we currently understand them today.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17199-results-and-discussion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17199-results-and-discussion-5\"></a>Results and Discussion</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17199-economic-impact-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17199-economic-impact-6\"></a>Economic Impact</h3>\n<p>Our analysis indicates that the ESPBL could potentially reduce operational costs for its members by 15% through collective negotiation with cloud and bare metal service providers. For an average member spending $12,000 monthly on hosting services, this translates to annual savings of $21,600. Extrapolating to the initial 20 members, the total annual savings for the Ethereum ecosystem could reach $432,000 in the first year, potentially growing to $907,200 by the fifth year with 42 members (Table 1).</p>\n<p>Table 1: Projected Annual Savings</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>Members</th>\n<th>Annual Savings (USD)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>432,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>518,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>626,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>756,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>42</td>\n<td>907,200</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-17199-technological-implications-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17199-technological-implications-7\"></a>Technological Implications</h3>\n<p>The formation of the ESPBL may have significant implications for the technological development of the Ethereum network:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Network Resilience</strong>: By reducing operational costs, the ESPBL could enable a more diverse set of validators and node operators, potentially increasing the decentralization and resilience of the network⁴.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Accelerated Innovation</strong>: Cost savings could be reinvested into research and development, potentially accelerating technological advancements in areas such as scalability and energy efficiency⁵.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security Standardization</strong>: As a unified entity, the ESPBL could play a crucial role in developing and promoting technical standards for Ethereum infrastructure, potentially leading to improved interoperability and efficiency⁶. This cross cuts past just simple Validator service providers and can extend into AVS’s for example.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17199-initial-target-ovh-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17199-initial-target-ovh-8\"></a>Initial Target: OVH</h2>\n<p>I spoke with OVH in person, they gave me this to show proof?

We believe staking will play a crucial role for asset managers in the future and use validators as a way to get closer to the tech for the ecosystems we support and meet really strong builders that we can partner with on our venture business.</p>\n<p>Proof Group has been natively staking Ethereum since the merge and strongly believes in Ethereum’s role in the future of decentralized finance. We recently joined the SSV Testnet <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> and are looking forward to becoming a larger voice/ contributor in the Lido ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation, values and decision making</strong></p>\n<p>Why I think our participation in this Lido’s delegate program makes sense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although Proof Group is relatively new to the Lido ecosystem, we are extremely versed in Ethereum staking. Delegators can trust Proof Group as a voice for Ethereum staking because we truly have skin in the game and built our staking business by self-staking all of our own assets as opposed to just receiving delegations from others.</li>\n<li>We can provide a newer voice to the Lido community, especially through the DVT lens. Lido is actively looking to decentralize their operator set and improve their client diversity. Proof Group will be an excellent voice for newer operators and delegators looking to improve decentralization in the Lido set.</li>\n<li>Our engineering team prides ourselves on actively making core protocol contributions. We are actively making PRs to Github of ecosystems we support (IE: m3diumrare-GitHub).</li>\n<li>Governance in web3 can admittedly use a lot of work. Some of our team has a background in TradFi where we have observed how governance in the equity markets works. We have a lot of views on how we can take some of the best of what goes on with proxy voting at large asset managers and vastly improve on it for a web3 audience.</li>\n<li>We truly believe in Ethereum and envision much of the financial rails of the future to be built on it. Lido is the most important player in the Ethereum ecosystem and we feel it is our duty to support governance for the Lido &amp; Ethereum community at the grassroots level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public acceptance</strong></p>\n<p>We accept Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct and Aligned with Lido’s Mission Statement.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures</strong></p>\n<p>Proof Group holds liquid assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, &amp; other top 50 tokens as part of our investment business. We are also investors in several other Liquid &amp; Re-staking protocols such as Rio Network, Karak, &amp; Stader.</p>\n<p>None of this would affect our role as a delegate on Lido.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/proof-group-delegate-thread/8190\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proof-group-delegate-thread/8190","pubDate":"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 20:53:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-8190"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/proof-group-delegate-thread/8190.rss","#text":"Proof Group: Delegate Thread"},"filter":false},{"title":"ProRelGuild Delegate Thread","dc:creator":"Marin","category":"Delegate Platform","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-17192-delegate-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17192-delegate-information-1\"></a>Delegate information:</h2>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>\nProRelGuild consists of four members who are actively contributing to Lido DAO and paving the road to stETH adoption, growth, and industry-wide collaborations.

Just as sci-fi cyborgs (‘cybernetic organisms’) augment humans (natural persons) with robotic organs and limbs or microchip or optics implants, BORGs augment state-chartered entities (legal persons) with autonomous software such as smart contracts. Crucially, legal entities that are BORGs do not merely use autonomous technologies as an incidental part of their business–instead, much like a human might have a robotic prosthesis surgically attached to his shoulder, BORGs are legally governed by autonomous technologies through tech-specific rules implanted in their charter documents. DAO-adjacent BORGs, like the proposed Lido Alliance BORG, require that all or most of the BORG’s assets be held in multisig smart contracts empowering the relevant DAO to directly provide feedback to, and exert certain checks and balances against potential misconduct by, the BORG’s human managers.</p>\n<p>The general reasons for using a DAO-adjacent BORG to ‘wrap’ DAO-related multisigs, committees, working groups and similar structures are summarized in Delphi Labs’ seminal article <a href=\"https://delphilabs.medium.com/assimilating-the-borg-a-new-cryptolegal-framework-for-dao-adjacent-entities-569e54a43f83\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Assimilating the BORG</a>.</p>\n<p>More specifically, in the case of the Alliance working group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There may be a need or desire to enter into legal agreements with Lido Allies (or related entities or individuals) in order to express and legally enforce each Lido Ally’s commitments to the Lido community and expectations of support from the Lido community. A legal entity is needed to serve as counterparty to such agreements as Lido DAO cannot enter in agreements itself as it lacks legal personality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Alliance working group may need to receive or hold tokens or certain rights in future tokens from pre-token Lido Allies—a legal entity may be needed to own/hold such rights.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For regulatory reasons, Lido DAO should avoid looking like an on chain ‘venture fund’ or ‘commodities pool’ that holds diversified assets, and thus such assets should be owned by a separate legal entity. (See e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/investreport/34-81207.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The SEC DAO Report</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If unincorporated, the Alliance working group runs a risk of receiving involuntary legal classifications, which may carry personal liability for the working group members.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If unincorporated, the Alliance working group may lack continuity as a result of personnel turnover.

The BORG does not have any members or beneficiaries, but rather is governed by a relatively change-resistant ruleset embodied in its legal documents (see <a>here</a>) and the associated multisig smart contracts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cayman foundation companies are a popular choice for DAO wrappers, protocol ‘foundations,’ and other crypto-/DeFi-/web3-related entities. The same features that make such entities useful in those contexts also render them suitable for a DAO-adjacent BORG such as the Lido Alliance Program, i.e.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tax-free status within the Cayman Islands;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Memberless” structure so that the entity need not be ‘owned’ by any person(s) and can therefore be operated for non-profit, community-aligned purposes;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Limited liability for managers and service providers of the entity (except in the event of fraud, crime, or the knowing and intentional breach of the entity’s rules or applicable laws);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Governance customizability capable of accommodating novel smart-contract-based rules and mechanisms; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A jurisdiction with a longstanding commitment to fostering digital asset endeavors and an ecosystem of law firms and other service providers deeply embedded in the crypto ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Lido Alliance BORG is requesting an initial budget of $125,000 for 2024, as part of the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/egg-st2024-v2-continuity-grant-funding-to-achieve-goose-goals/\">st2024 v2 EGG </a>request approved in July and is expected to require a yearly budget of $250,000 from 2025 to operate, which will be requested through subsequent EGG requests. The budget includes director fees, local law firm fees, contributor compensation and any other operational expenses, following the <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ecosystem-grants-grequest-egg-a-budget-request-framework-in-the-service-of-goose/\">EGG budget requests framework</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Board of Directors of the BORG is responsible for running all aspects of the Lido Alliance program and is in charge of the BORG overall. The Directors must sit on all multisigs of the BORG. The initial Directors of the BORG would initially be <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/adcv\">@adcv</a> and dsm of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi/u/steakhouse\">@steakhouse</a>. Any future Directors would be approved by Lido DAO and the Board. An individual Director can be removed either by the Board itself or by Lido DAO. An individual Director may also unilaterally resign.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Guardians of the BORG are additional members of the BORG’s multisigs appointed by the Board. They generally should follow the Board’s instructions but may refuse to sign a multisig transaction based on security or compliance considerations. The initial Guardians of the BORG would be shik_happens, mac3w, jenya_k, olga_k, alex_l</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All Lido Allies must be approved by the Board and Lido DAO, and the BORG would hold all tokens contributed by Lido Allies in the Alliance Multisigs, which will (at minimum) be 4/7 multisigs consisting of the Directors and the Guardians. Lido DAO’s co-approval is required for all usages of the Lido-Ally-contributed tokens as a security measure–this requirement is initially imposed by virtue of the BORG’s Bylaws, and Lido contributors and MetaLeX hope to create additional onchain enforcement of these rules as well, though the technical ability to do so may vary from chain to chain. The addresses and other details of all Alliance Multisigs must be published by the BORG for the Lido community. Operational funds would be held separately at the discretion of the Board and are currently expected to be held in 3/5 multisigs (also using EasyTrack on a quarterly schedule). Mentioned EasyTrack set is requested to be added with a following configuration for the operational multisig:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>AllowedTokensRegistry:<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4AC40c34f8992bb1e5E856A448792158022551ca\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> 0x4AC40c34f8992bb1e5E856A448792158022551ca</a></li>\n<li>TopUpAllowedRecipients: (address TBD)</li>\n<li>AllowedRecipientsRegistry: (address TBD):\n<ul>\n<li>allowedRecipients: 0x606f77BF3dd6Ed9790D9771C7003f269a385D942 (ops MS address);</li>\n<li>limit: 250,000 * 10^18 (i.e. $250K);</li>\n<li>periodDurationMonths: 3</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The permitted purposes of the BORG are to further the Lido Alliance Program as it was approved by Lido DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The BORG Personnel (including the Directors and Guardians) do not owe any direct duties to Lido DAO or Lido community members, but owe duties to the BORG entity, and the BORG entity’s purposes are restricted to fulfilling the Lido Alliance Program, which benefits the Lido DAO and broader Lido community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alliance Multisig Members have obligations to identify material conflicts of interest and, in certain circumstances, disclose them to the Lido community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lido DAO approval would be required for any liquidation of the entity or any amendment of the entity’s documents that adversely affect the Lido community or any sub-constituency thereof.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The BORG has a ‘supervisor’, which is a statutory role in the Caymans intended to monitor a foundation company’s compliance with the entity’s own rules. The initial supervisor, intended to be temporary, is MetaLeX Pro LLC, the same law firm that led the creation of the BORG in consultation with various Lido contributors. This role is currently un-compensated and MetaLeX has committed to perform the role without additional compensation for up to three months. The final supervisor is expected to be a “Lido OpsBORG” or similar entity, which is currently in ideation phase and will be separately proposed to Lido DAO once various details are finalized.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If an “Adverse Event” occurs, Lido DAO may directly appoint an “Emergency Supervisor” for the BORG. “Adverse Event” is defined to include egregious violations of law or the BORG’s own rules by the BORG or BORG Personnel in connection with the BORG’s activities, certain crimes independently committed by BORG Personnel (whether or not related to the BORG’s activities), and sustained deadlocks within the BORG’s governance/decision-making. The Emergency Supervisor would have broad powers under the BORG’s Bylaws and Caymans law, including the power to investigate the Adverse Event, bring lawsuits against BORG personnel in the name of the BORG and to remove and appoint Directors. The Emergency Supervisor role is intended to be temporary and the Emergency Supervisor must resign once the Adverse Event is handled or, in any event, the Emergency Supervisor’s tenure is automatically terminated after 12 months if not renewed by Lido DAO. Lido DAO also has the power to directly set the compensation of Emergency Supervisors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The BORG Personnel are indemnified by the BORG entity, within certain customary limits. This indemnification would be paid solely out of operating funds and not any of the Lido-Ally-contributed assets, unless Lido DAO approves to use additional funds of the BORG to indemnify the BORG personnel who acted on behalf of the BORG.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The BORG Personnel would not have personal liability to the BORG for their BORG-related activities except to the extent they engage in gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The BORG Personnel must satisfy various eligibility criteria including not being subject to sanctions, not having previous egregious criminal convictions, and being reasonably sophisticated regarding blockchain technologies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17171-additional-reading-references-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17171-additional-reading-references-5\"></a>Additional Reading / References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/publicDocs/tree/main/Lido-Alliance-BORG/coreDocs/coreDocs-08-20-24/pdfs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido Alliance BORG Bylaws, Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-alliance-an-ethereum-aligned-ecosystem/7475\">Proposal for Lido Alliance: An Ethereum-Aligned Ecosystem</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delphi Labs, <a href=\"https://delphilabs.medium.com/assimilating-the-borg-a-new-cryptolegal-framework-for-dao-adjacent-entities-569e54a43f83\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Assimilating the BORG</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://metalex.substack.com/p/the-metalex-whitepaper\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MetaleX Whitepaper</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://lawcom.gov.uk/project/decentralised-autonomous-organisations-daos\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UK Law Commission Scoping Paper on DAOs</a> (covering DAO-adjacent BORGs in substantial detail)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17171-voting-discussion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17171-voting-discussion-6\"></a>Voting &amp; Discussion</h2>\n<p>Note: The Lido Alliance program has already been approved by the Lido DAO.

Our team’s core competencies include growth, business development, Grants, Defi growth and marketing. We have served as Growth advisors for multiple Blockchain ecosystems and Defi Protocols. These include Ecosystems like Near, Aurora, Kava and more.

Lido is the natural ally of Compound with wstETH being the top collateral for most of the Compound Markets. Our collaboration increased with Lido in the past months with our drive to list wstETH as collateral on most of the existing Compound Markets. The close collaboration with Lido members sparked the interest within the team to contribute deeper to the Lido ecosystem.</p>\n<p>ReservoirDAO team plays an active role in the governance of top DAOs like Optimism, Arbitrum, Compound. In our attempt to contribute to the greater governance processes, we are aiming to expand our governance contribution to Lido DAO (Uniswap being the other DAO of interest)</p>\n<p>Working closely with the Lido DAO service providers, we are confident in the continued success of the Lido ecosystem and look forward to contributing on our part for the community’s success.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17164-values-and-decision-making-approach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17164-values-and-decision-making-approach-6\"></a>Values and Decision Making Approach</h2>\n<p>We support decisions and initiatives that bring more activity and market share to Lido.

Since early 2023, I have been a Lido token holder and a self-proclaimed Lido Ambassador on X and actively participated in several voting proposals within the Lido DAO.<br>\n<strong>Experience:</strong><br>\nI helped over 400 Dapps and EVM/non-EVM chains launch their token/cross-chain bridges during the peak of 2022. Additionally, an effort secured over $200 million in TVL for the protocol, despite the challenging market conditions of 2023.<br>\nInitiated the creation of a user-friendly support portal with an intuitive guide and ticket-based system on Zendesk, serving 3,000 daily users.<br>\nLastly, experience working on several DAO grant proposals in many crypto ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation &amp; Approach:</strong></p>\n<p>Lido is one of the most critical, irreplaceable component of Ethereum and DeFi, I understand the importance of reGoose 2024, especially in decentralized governance and the robustness of the protocol &amp; Ethereum-aligned. As a DAO participant, I’ve observed that past proposals are often voted on by a small group of familiar voters, which can create a perception of centralization and potential legal risks.<br>\nAs a token holder, I recognize the need for the Lido protocol to maintain stability for long-term success. I aim to represent the voices of token holders in the Lido DAO forum to promote an inclusive atmosphere.</p>\n<p>My approach involves engaging with token holders whenever possible to understand their motivations and represent their interests in Lido DAO discussions and future proposals that align with Lido’s Vibe.

My expertise is in staking, home node operations / solo staking, mechanism design, infrastructure and decentralization.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lido is an extremely important project for Ethereum. Lido’s focus, vision and execution has turned it into the single biggest controller of staked ETH. It’s easy to see how there are many decisions, by action or inaction, that are possible for Lido to take, that will shape both projects and protocol.</li>\n<li>Decentralized Governance is powerful, and can dangerous: governance attacks are happening due to plain token voting, unchecked processes and community apathy. Lido’s delegation approach is an important step to ensure that such an important project for Ethereum is governed properly while still following DAO principles.</li>\n<li>Considering my mission to protect and shape Ethereum to the best of my abilities, and the possibility of helping Lido take the right paths, and that the path of Lido is deeply entrenched with Ethereum’s future, I feel deeply compelled to give my best to steer Lido according to what I believe are the right values (see next section).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Values and Decision-Making Approach</strong> (Core Values, Decision-Making Process)<br>\nLido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, and Vision) asserts that Lido pursues the decentralization of Ethereum (understood as the coordination and value layer of the internet) by making staking simple, secure, and decentralized. This Vibe perfectly aligns with my values and the work I’ve been dedicated to for the past five years.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Decentralization focus</strong> Decentralization is a key component of what I value about Ethereum. But, what do I mean with Decentralization?<br>\nDecentralization is a spectrum where different desirable properties emerge. Such properties are resilience to government capture, boycott, censorship, zero-day exploits, power grid failures and other geographically bounded events… It is these properties which turn Ethereum into a desirable platform for running unstoppable applications (or becoming the co-ordination and value layer of the internet, as written in the Vibe)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Balancing Stakeholder Interests:</strong> When the interests of different stakeholders conflict, I will always anchor my decisions in Lido’s Vibe, which aligns with the broader mission of Ethereum’s decentralization. I believe that decisions should benefit both Lido and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. For example, if a proposal offers short-term gains for one group but could harm the long-term decentralization of Ethereum, I would lean towards a decision that prioritizes long-term, sustainable decentralization, ensuring that Lido remains aligned with its core mission. Should the mission change, I would consider my mandate as changed too and I would have to reevaluate whether I am the most appropriate person to pursue it and defend it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Leveraging Expertise in Staking and Infrastructure:</strong> Given my expertise in staking and decentralized infrastructure, I am well-positioned to contribute to Lido’s roadmap. I consult and draw from teams, facilitate strategic partnerships, and provide in-depth analysis of proposals related to staking and infrastructure. My experience with Dappnode in building a decentralized network of node runners will be invaluable in helping Lido become a stronger decentralizing force for Ethereum. I am committed to using this expertise to ensure that Lido’s infrastructure and governance practices contribute to a more robust and decentralized Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance</strong>:  I, Pol Lanski, accept the Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct (<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\">link</a>) and Aligned with <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\">Lido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, Vision)</a></p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures</strong>:<br>\nI am the project lead at Dappnode, who has received funding from LEGO grants.

My journey into staking began as a solo staker, driven by a deep interest in Ethereum and helping improve its decentralization. Over time, I recognized the limitations of solo staking—such as the lack of liquidity and flexibility—and switched to staking via stETH. This gave me a firsthand appreciation of the value that Lido brings to the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Driven by a desire to contribute more directly to Lido’s mission, I became a Lido Operator for the DVT router with <a href=\"https://ssv.network\">SSV</a>, where I’ve focused on increasing client diversity by adopting minority clients like <a href=\"https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth\">Reth</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2\">Nimbus</a> while maintaining exceptional performance.</p>\n<p>My goal is to push the limits of innovation in the staking ecosystem, not only by enhancing the security and resilience of Lido’s infrastructure but also by ensuring that Lido continues to set the standard as the premier, user-focused staking experience.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17106-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17106-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Ethereum is constantly evolving—there are ongoing proposals that would radically shift the staking landscape and greatly affect Lido: <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/sticking-to-8192-signatures-per-slot-post-ssf-how-and-why/17989\">SSF</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/increase-the-max-effective-balance-a-modest-proposal/15801/46\">Max EB</a>, <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/electra-issuance-curve-adjustment-proposal/18825\">MVI Adjustments</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353\">Preconfs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJLERWmQ2uw\">MCP</a>—just to name a few. This is a critical juncture in Lido’s timeline, and navigating these changes effectively will be pivotal to ensuring the protocol’s long-term success. Understanding these technical shifts is essential for making informed decisions that secure Lido’s future.</p>\n<p>As a Lido DAO delegate, I aim to leverage my experience as a developer and staker to navigate these challenges effectively. My goal is to ensure Lido remains a leader in staking, balancing innovation with stability, and making decisions that benefit both the protocol and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17106-values-and-decision-making-approach-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17106-values-and-decision-making-approach-3\"></a>Values and Decision-Making Approach</h2>\n<p>My approach to governance is guided by the following core values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Technical Excellence:</strong> I prioritize decisions that advance Lido’s technical infrastructure to <em>enhance security, scalability, and user experience</em>. My focus is on ensuring that Lido continues to lead in client diversity and protocol security while maintaining a robust and resilient staking environment, ultimately supporting the long-term success of the protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Holistic Perspective:</strong> My combined experience as a staker, operator, and developer provides a unique viewpoint on the ecosystem.

Additionally, they face external challenges like regulatory uncertainty.</p>\n<p>I believe in a decentralized future, even if it seems naive. However, the current state of crypto is plagued by misaligned incentives that prioritize short-term speculative gains over the core DeFi values of self-sovereignty and custody.</p>\n<p>Equally concerning is the trend of McKinsification in DAOs, where decisions are increasingly made by one or two professional consultant delegates. This discourages individual participation, as their opinions and votes have less impact.</p>\n<p>To make DeFi DAOs viable, we must align incentives to encourage active participation in governance from the broader crypto community.</p>\n<p>I see potential in Lido DAO’s incentivized delegation approach. It creates career opportunities for individual delegates while strengthening and decentralizing DAOs, making them less prone to corruption.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17092-values-and-decision-making-approach-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17092-values-and-decision-making-approach-4\"></a>Values and Decision-Making Approach</h2>\n<p>Community must be at the core of every DAO.</p>\n<p>Without giving the community a say in protocol governance, we’re no better than the Web2 companies we aim to replace—companies that view their “community” merely as users to extract value from.</p>\n<p>I will support initiatives that align token holders with the protocol, such as revenue sharing or other methods to bring value to the token.</p>\n<p>Token holders are frustrated with exploitative tokenomics that only benefit early insiders who acquired tokens at much lower prices, leaving no upside for new investors. Without incentives to buy and hold tokens, the attractiveness and health of DAOs decline.</p>\n<p>Finally, I will highlight key votes and decisions of the DAO on X and my blog, as I believe the general public is often unaware of important actions being taken.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17092-public-acceptance-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17092-public-acceptance-5\"></a>Public Acceptance</h2>\n<p>I accept Lido’s Public Delegate Code of Conduct and our Public Delegate Platform signals my alignment with the mission, vision, and purpose of Lido DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17092-disclosures-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17092-disclosures-6\"></a>Disclosures</h2>\n<p>I am the co-founder of Pink Brains at https:// pinkbrains. io, a DeFi creator studio dedicated to promoting DeFi projects through educational content.

Wintermute was founded in July 2017 by three Optiver veterans. Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO, was previously head of ETFs (screen and OTC) at Optiver Europe, one of the largest ETF market-making desks. Since our inception, we have traded over $4.9T USD in volume and expanded our presence across 80+ (de)centralised exchanges and various (non)EVM chains, continuously supporting the ecosystem for our partners and their communities.</p>\n<p>Alongside our trading arm, Wintermute Ventures and Wintermute Governance support and work with leading crypto projects &amp; DAOs with the goal of truly adding value, enabling partnerships, and helping shape a positive outcome for the ecosystem. We’re eager to bring our DeFi, Institutional, and Governance expertise to the Lido DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17086-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17086-motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>At Wintermute, we believe that a decentralized world needs robust and progressive governance systems.

We embrace and align with the Infinite Garden philosophy as a community through:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Enhancing the Quality of Discussions and Feedback:</strong> Our practice in producing detailed analyses on whitepaper and DAO proposals for each of our WPRC sessions aligns with Lido DAO’s objective of improving the quality of discussions and feedback. WPRC’s rigorous approach ensures that proposals are thoroughly evaluated, leading to more informed and effective decision-making.</li>\n<li><strong>Nurturing Knowledge:</strong> We focus on fostering knowledge and healthy debate, emphasising the importance of cultivating rather than controlling the ecosystem. This approach supports the long-term health of the network, promoting resilience and ongoing learning within the community.</li>\n<li><strong>Ecosystem-Agnostic, Independent Perspectives:</strong> WPRC is composed of Web3 veterans, engineers, and thinkers—ranging from experienced contributors to newcomers in the Ethereum ecosystem—who engage in structured, thoughtful discussions on whitepapers across the entire Web3 landscape. Our approach is ecosystem-agnostic and maintains a neutral lens, fostering open dialogue that encourages the generation of new ideas and innovations. We believe that these discussions play a critical role in enhancing both the sustainability and the evolution of the broader Ethereum ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Our discussions are designed to contribute to an ecosystem’s continuous improvement, with a focus on long-term outcomes rather than immediate gains.</li>\n<li><strong>Organic Community Growth:</strong> WPRC’s growth from a small group to a robust community of over 250 people has been entirely organic, driven by the quality and relevance of our discussions. This growth reflects our ability to engage members without resorting to promotion, maintaining a focus on substantive contributions.</li>\n<li><strong>Increasing Active Voting Participation:</strong> WPRC encourages active engagement among its members, with a selection of core working group members nominated in this paper who are prepared to participate in Lido DAO’s governance. By facilitating informed discussions, we help ensure a higher rate of active and meaningful voting participation, directly supporting Lido DAO’s governance goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Attracting and Activating New Token Holders:</strong> WPRC’s open and inclusive culture demystifies complex governance issues, attracting new participants to Lido DAO. By fostering understanding and promoting insightful discussions, we help promote more active DAO governance, encouraging broader participation and informed decision-making.</li>\n<li><strong>Providing Web3 Expertise and Advisory:</strong> With members skilled in governance, blockchain tech, community growth, and more, WPRC offers valuable insights that can guide Lido DAO’s strategic direction and governance practices, aligning with the DAO’s aspirations for expert feedback and advisory.</li>\n<li><strong>Supporting Innovation in Commons and Public Goods Funding:</strong> Our exploration of new models for funding public goods can help Lido DAO lead in promoting sustainable, community-driven solutions, contributing to the broader Ethereum ecosystem’s health and sustainability.</li>\n<li><strong>Strengthen Community and Wider Ecosystem Ties:</strong> WPRC’s commitment to open, neutral, and inclusive dialogue strengthens ties not only within the Ethereum ecosystem but also with projects beyond it that are active in governance. By fostering collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas across various blockchain ecosystems, we help build a more cohesive, resilient and censorship resistant network through Proof of Stake, Proof of Governance, and beyond with the Lido DAO.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion, WPRC seeks to become a delegate within Lido DAO to bring informed insights and align with the core values that define Ethereum and its community. Our goal is to enhance the quality of governance proposals, increase active voting participation, and foster more diverse community engagement. We are motivated by the belief that inclusive, informed discussions are crucial for the health and growth of all Web3 ecosystems. By providing a structured platform for holistic analysis of blockchain technologies and governance mechanisms across various disciplines, WPRC is poised to contribute meaningfully to Lido DAO’s governance efforts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17040-values-and-decision-making-approach-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17040-values-and-decision-making-approach-5\"></a>Values and Decision-Making Approach</h3>\n<p>WPRC’s Core Values are established as below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of honesty and ethical behavior in all our discussions.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus:</strong> Our discussions are strictly centered around the content of the whitepapers, ensuring that the dialogue remains on-topic and productive.</li>\n<li><strong>No Promotion:</strong> We maintain a strict policy against the promotion of projects or events within our discussions.</li>\n<li><strong>Permissionless Participation:</strong> We believe in the inclusivity of our community, allowing anyone with a genuine interest to participate.</li>\n<li><strong>Healthy Debate:</strong> We encourage open dialogue and the challenging of assumptions, ensuring a dynamic and engaging environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Decision-Making Process:</strong> WPRC operates on a democratic basis where all members have the opportunity to contribute to discussions and decisions. Paper selections are made through community voting, and decisions are taken with the collective input of all active members. The reading process is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper Selection: Members propose whitepapers, and the community votes to select two for each session.</li>\n<li>Meetings: We meet every 2-3 weeks, beginning with a 10-minute reading period, followed by a roundtable discussion.</li>\n<li>Discussion Focus: Our sessions are centered solely on the whitepapers, strictly avoiding any promotional content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on our existing decision-making process which has proven to create productive discussions around whitepapers and DAO proposals, we propose to extend this discussion format to deliberating on important decisions to be made in Lido DAO. We believe that our collective approach and healthy debate will lead to both sustained and well-considered contributions to decision-making in the DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-17040-public-acceptance-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17040-public-acceptance-6\"></a>Public Acceptance</h3>\n<p>WPRC accepts and aligns <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/core/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the Lido Public Delegate Code of Conduct</a> and commits to being aligned with <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-vibe-alignment-purpose-mission-vision/4380\">Purpose/Mission/Values of Lido DAO</a>.

I have been participating on all stages of the Aave DAO, from inception to a relatively good maturity at the current moment. Also, I contributed to the majority of the DAO verticals: from high-level discussions regarding DAO strategy and decentralisation, to low level implementation, passing through all types of operational aspects.<br>\nMy profile on the Aave governance forum is <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/eboado\">THIS</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I have important technical expertise in DeFi, governance systems and, in general, everything blockchain related. That means that 1) my opinions and decisions will have a rational base and 2) probably I can give meaningful operation feedback regarding both procedures and technology surrounding Lido.<br>\nAmongst others, on BGD Labs we created the Aave Governance v3 system, currently powering on-chain the Aave DAO. Also, we developed a.DI, bridging infrastructure <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/network-expansion-workgroup-initiative-governance-decision-forwarding-to-non-l2-networks-lip-24/7446\">currently used by Lido</a> to forward governance decisions to non-Ethereum networks.<br>\nFinally, we have an active role reviewing the majority of all proposals created on the Aave governance, and designed all tooling and procedures surrounding them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My main interest for participating in the program is because I’m aware of the good values of the Lido contributors I interacted with: aside from high technical competence, I perceive a clear focus within Lido on evolving its ecosystem in a way that benefits not only Lido as expected, but the industry itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I believe I am a very neutral party: I like the ethos and approach of Lido and even if I see no reason for that to happen, if I perceive clear derailing from them in the future, will stop being a delegate. Same time, I will not compromise my neutrality by participating in anything going clearly against Lido DAO’s interests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lastly, I compromise to seriously participate on the governance processes of Lido, including voting itself, but also discussions in this forum and providing rationales about my voting.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17009-public-acceptance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17009-public-acceptance-4\"></a>Public acceptance</h2>\n<p>I accept Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct (<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\">link</a>) and Aligned with <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\">Lido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, Vision)</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17009-disclosures-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17009-disclosures-5\"></a>Disclosures</h2>\n<p>Through BGD Labs, I’m currently an active contractual contributor to the Aave ecosystem, which should not create any type of conflict, as Aave and Lido have been pretty close partners since the very beginning.<br>\nAdditionally, I own $AAVE and other assets, but that should not have any type of influence in my Lido participation.<br>\nI expect that specific technical Lido contributors review the contents of governance proposals, and I assume no liability if those contents create damage I was not aware of.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/eboadom-delegate-thread/8079\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/eboadom-delegate-thread/8079","pubDate":"Wed, 14 Aug 2024 11:11:34 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-8079"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/eboadom-delegate-thread/8079.rss","#text":"Eboadom Delegate Thread"},"filter":false},{"title":"Idea of Solo Staking Loyalty Points (SSLP)","dc:creator":"nana","category":"General","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-17002-abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17002-abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This post focuses on the issue of solo stakers quitting staking and joining Staking Service Providers (SSPs) as liquidity and cost structures improve through SSPs. As one of the solutions to a future where the staking market becomes centralized and imposes an inflation tax on users, we propose a community-based approach for solo stakers called Solo Staking Loyalty Points (SSLP) firming. Combining SSLP with the CSM module improves solo staker liquidity and reduces capital efficiency, adding an incentive for solo stakers to contribute honestly in the long term.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17002-problem-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17002-problem-2\"></a>Problem</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Solo stakers are under selection pressure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Delegated stakers may flatten the supply curve, inducing an upward trend in staking volume and forcing users to pay more costs than necessary. If the supply curve flattens, delegated stakers will be induced to take all by winners, and it may be more rational for solo stakers to transition to delegated stakers.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons for this situation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Benefit: Liquidity is improved by Liquid Staking Tokens (LST)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Endogenous yield y: The endogenous return obtained only by staking in consensus is the sum of issuance reward y_i and execution reward y_v (y_i + y_v).</li>\n<li>Exogenous yield y_c: The exogenous return from DeFi and restaking generated by LST has a total yield of y_c.</li>\n<li>Total yield Y: The sum of the staker’s total return introspective yield and exogenous return (y + y_c). Staking will not occur unless the total return Y (= y + y_c) is higher than a certain threshold Y_c at which there is a desire to lock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, assume that an ETH holder is willing to lock ETH when the total return Y exceeds 0.04. The situation in which a staker will lock the ETH they hold is:</p>\n<p>Y &gt; Y_c</p>\n<p>If we substitute 0.04 for Y_c:</p>\n<p>y + y_c &gt; 0.04</p>\n<p>This shows that the higher the value of y_c, the lower the introspective yield y_i required for staking can be, and vice versa.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Cost: The cost structure is simplified, including the reduction in capital efficiency (staking is possible even with less than 32 ETH) and long-term commitment.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial cost: The cost required at the start of staking. Generally, it includes technical skills, hardware, and collateral capital.</li>\n<li>Long-term cost: The long-term cost of protecting the locked ETH, the reduction in liquidity due to locking, taxes, and increased risk premium. This can also be seen as the time cost of updates, the high-speed line and data capacity for additional Internet connections, and the ongoing commitment of accurately exercising the protocol’s work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Long-term costs are likely to influence stakers’ ongoing decisions more than initial costs. Solo stakers bear all costs themselves. In the case of SSPs, the cost structure differs depending on the node operator and the participant (ETH holder).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSP node operators have a fixed cost for staking and receive a portion of the revenue earned by participants as a fee. In situations where costs are high and revenues are low, they can increase efficiency by reducing the number of nodes and increasing the number of validators on each node.</li>\n<li>Participants only delegate the amount of stake to the node operator, so there are no costs, but instead they pay a portion of the revenue as a fee. Since the issuance of LST does not affect the decrease in liquidity, the fees paid may not feel like a cost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this way, costs are equally borne by solo stakers and node operators, but the cost for users participating in SSPs is low. Since the barriers to solo staking are replaced by the SSP operator, users who use SSPs do not have a large increase in the costs required to make additional staking. In addition, if they can receive LST, liquidity increases, they can access additional yields, and there is no need for long-term commitments.</p>\n<p>As staking service providers simplify the staking experience (cost structure) and improve staking liquidity, the inequality Y &gt; Y_c’ becomes more likely to hold even if the introspective yield y becomes smaller.</p>\n<p>As a result, the amount of staked is induced to tend to increase, and more ETH than necessary is staked. The effect is that the protocol issues more rewards than necessary for security, forcing users to pay inflation taxes. Also, in a world where a lot of ETH is staked, solo stakers who do not have access to the exogenous yield y_c are at an even greater disadvantage.</p>\n<p>It is important for Ethereum to consider maintaining solo stakers, as they contribute greatly to the censorship resistance of the network.</p>\n<p>The community is discussing <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cut Issuance</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/dr-changestuff-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-mev-burn/17384\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MEV-burn</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/unbundling-staking-towards-rainbow-staking/18683\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Rainbow Staking</a>, and other ideas that target MVI. I am optimistic about these ideas, but there are complex tradeoffs, so in the short term I would like to look at simple solutions such as Lido’s CSM and Smoothing Pool as well.</p>\n<p>Lido’s CSM module is designed to significantly lower the node operation profitability and entry barrier for individual stakers by depositing about 2 ETH as collateral to Lido on Ethereum after creating the deposit data, and 32 ETH is assigned to the deposit key.</p>\n<p>At this time, the profits from node operation are distributed equally among validators who participated in attestations a certain threshold number of times according to the number of validators who operate each person’s rewards. In other words, it is likely that rewards earned by Curated Modules (36 professional node operators commissioned by Lido, such as Kiln) through MEV maximization, etc., are often returned to CSM participants. Thanks to this mechanism, even individual stakers can earn greater profits than with an individual 32 ETH stake.</p>\n<p>As a result, the CSM module opens the path to validators to more potential individual stakers, bringing decentralization and diversity to LoE validators. Solo Staking Loyalty Points (SSLP) firming is an additional idea based on CSM, and its purpose is to further contribute to the maintenance of solo stakers. In the short term, increasing the number of solo stakers through mechanisms such as the CSM module is important for improving the censorship resistance of the network.</p>\n<p>So, in addition to the MEV Smoothing pool mechanism such as the CSM module, I would like to consider ideas to incentivize solo stakers to behave honestly for a long time.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17002-so-what-to-do-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17002-so-what-to-do-3\"></a>So what to do?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Pointize access to variable rewards (MEV + Fee)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Solo stakers earn Loyalty Points. Points should measure the period a solo staker has been active and the validity of their attestations.</p>\n<p>Points accumulate over specific periods and are transferable. Points can be exchanged for variable rewards. However, the number of SSLPs earned increases in proportion to the length of time active. 1 month → 10 points, 2 months → 12.5 points, 3 months → 15 points…, n.</p>\n<p>The exchange of pooled variable rewards for points is designed with a base exchange rate called the pool base reward, and a weighting that increases proportionally to the number of points held. This provides an additional incentive for solo stakers to contribute to the network for a long time and continue earning SSLPs. Example: 10 points → pool base reward * 1, 20 points → pool base reward * 1.1, 30 points → pool base reward * 1.2,…n.</p>\n<p>These two simple mechanisms - awarding points for long-term honest behavior and increasing the access rate to variable rewards based on the number of points held - create a system where solo stakers can earn higher profits/year by contributing honestly to the network for a long time, accumulating points, and exchanging a large number of points for variable rewards at once, rather than accumulating points in a short period to access variable rewards.</p>\n<p>A simple prediction is that demand for trading points themselves may emerge. Solo stakers who want to earn variable rewards in the short term might be able to earn higher rewards than the pool base reward by exchanging points for tokens in the market, rather than exchanging points for variable rewards. Point buyers have an incentive to collect points, as the weighting of the exchange rate increases as they accumulate points.</p>\n<p>Increasing the incentive to earn points may lead to a tendency to become solo stakers and collect points.</p>\n<p>Overall, the point mechanism offers the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved liquidity: While solo staking cannot improve liquidity like LSTs, points may have a similar effect.</li>\n<li>Cost improvement: By integrating with the CSM module, solo staking becomes possible with 2ETH, lowering the capital requirements for short-term costs.</li>\n<li>Compatibility with the roadmap: As an additional idea, receiving SBTs along with SSLPs from the protocol to identify solo stakers could be beneficial, as it may allow for preferential treatment for solo stakers from consensus in the medium to long term.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By incorporating a point mechanism into the CSM module in this way, liquidity can be improved and the cost structure can be enhanced, which may lead to an increase in solo stakers. The only barrier to becoming a solo staker will be the long-term cost.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-17002-concerns-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#p-17002-concerns-4\"></a>Concerns</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>At what rate will points be awarded?</li>\n<li>How will the pool base reward be calculated when exchanging for variable rewards?</li>\n<li>How will the pool base reward be weighted by points?</li>\n<li>Can it really increase the execution reward y_v of solo stakers?</li>\n<li>Will it really be exchanged in the market at a higher price than the pool base reward?</li>\n<li>Can solo stakers using CSM truly fulfill their role as solo stakers?

I am an <a href=\"https://people.ucd.ie/paul.dylan-ennis\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">academic</a> with a research specialism in Ethereum protocol governance. I have written a book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Absolute-Essentials-Ethereum-Business-Economics/dp/1032334185\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Absolute Essentials of Ethereum</a> and a number of <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=rbkT1JgAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">academic articles</a> on Ethereum and Bitcoin culture. I teach the first Ethereum-only module at University level, called <a href=\"https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=MODULE&amp;MODULE=MIS41220\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Ethereum Ecosystem</a>. However, most of you probably know me as the author of a number of <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/author/dr-paul-j-dylan-ennis/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CoinDesk Opinion</a> columns on Ethereum culture and values.</p>\n<p>Ethereum address/ENS: 0x1f76a6Bf03429480472B3695E08689219cE15ED6</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Of all the DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem, my sense is that Lido DAO is the one that needs the most careful consideration of its proposals given the large amount of ETH staked with the protocol. In recent years, we have seen a certain professionalism of the DAO delegate role that I think has likely helped in terms of efficiency and participation. However, in this particular case, I believe it is important to be a delegate with few obligations elsewhere (I am a delegate for zkSync, but nowhere else). While I can’t promise you the polished documentation provided by professional DAO delegate operations, I can promise you my careful, cautious and well-researched assessment of proposals. I will bring to bear my academic mindset to consider proposals not just in terms of immediate concerns, but with Lido’s philosophy and Ethereum’s culture and history in mind. I also hope to use my experiences to teach Lido as an exemplary DAO in the classroom.</p>\n<p><strong>Values and Decision-Making Approach:</strong> My view is that Ethereum culture is ultimately undergirded by a commitment to cypherpunk values, which I consider to be decentralisation, permissionlessness, censorship resistance and credible neutrality. I consider these to be the lines that demarcate what is acceptable or not when it comes to Ethereum’s long term vision and that I have through my work a long history of defending their centrality. I will use these principles as a conceptual map in analysing any proposals and making decisions. I will always ensure my reasoning is clearly explained and contextualised and ensure that they are made in light of the ideas and not personalised or subjective. I believe this will be possible because as an academic I am afforded a certain freedom in terms of time to consider and think about these proposals.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Acceptance:</strong> I accept Lido DAO delegate Сode of Сonduct (<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPwqjn5NiNVFKjxxBnYHivgempeyNNpMNotGYMCXitRd3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a>) and Aligned with <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido’s Vibe (Purpose, Mission, Vision)</a></p>\n<p><strong>Disclosures:</strong> None.
