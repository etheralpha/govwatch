Today LDO holders have important powers over the protocol that can result in important changes to this social contract. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrading the Ethereum liquid staking protocol code.<br>\nManaging the list of the Ethereum consensus layer oracle committee members.</li>\n<li>Changing how the stake is distributed between node operators in a potentially harmful or unexpected way (e.g. adding or removing whitelisted Ethereum node operators).</li>\n<li>Changing the governance structure in an unexpected or potentially harmful way (e.g. minting or burning LDO, changing the parameters of voting systems).</li>\n<li>Changing the total fee percentage of the Ethereum liquid staking protocol outside of the agreed boundaries (as well as defining these boundaries).</li>\n<li>Deciding on how to spend the treasury</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these powers, apart from treasury spends, directly affect stakers. Dual governance v1 allows stETH holders, in the worst case, to delay any proposed changes to the Lido protocol until they have fully exited.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"v1-design-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#v1-design-2\"></a>V1 design</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"unhappy-path-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#unhappy-path-3\"></a>Unhappy path</h3>\n<p><em>Malicious proposal to change the withdrawal vault contract</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>A well-funded LDO holder makes a malicious proposal to change the stETH withdrawal contract and rug users. This proposal gets enough LDO support to pass.</li>\n<li>A small group of users (stETH holders) pick up on this and vote to veto the change. In doing so they both sound the alarm for more users to join, and ensure that neither this proposal, nor any other DAO proposals (apart from treasury spends) can be executed for the time being.</li>\n<li>More users join the veto while the DAO is in this temporarily frozen state (known as <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/mechanism.md#veto-signalling-state\">VetoSignalling state</a>). Some need to take the time to unwind from their DeFi positions. That’s ok.</li>\n<li>The DAO remains frozen until all users that have joined the veto are able to fully withdaw their ETH (assuming the 2nd threshold has been crossed).</li>\n<li>After all users have been made whole the DAO reverts back to its normal state (unless there is another veto motion already in motion).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"happy-path-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#happy-path-4\"></a>Happy path</h3>\n<p><em>Good faith proposal to remove a node operator</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>For some reason or other LDO holders vote to boot a node operator out of the curated set.</li>\n<li>A small group of users (stETH holders) pick up on this and vote to veto the change. In doing so they both sound the alarm for more users to join, and ensure that neither this proposal, nor any other DAO proposals which affect them can be executed for the time being.</li>\n<li>LDO holders realize they’ve made a mistake and de-escalate by voting to cancel all pending proposals (including the one that triggered the veto).</li>\n<li>The de-escalation is successful – stETH holders remove their veto – and the DAO resumes a normal state of affairs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"guiding-objectives-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#guiding-objectives-5\"></a>Guiding objectives</h3>\n<p>The guiding objectives are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Give stakers a way to credibly signal their disagreement with LDO holders and the commitment to leave the protocol if LDO holders don’t cooperate in resolving the incentives conflict.</li>\n<li>Allow for the possibility of negotiation and de-escalation between stETH and LDO holders.</li>\n<li>Introduce an extended timelock on DAO decisions that can be triggered by an active minority of stakers and prolonged as more stakers participate.</li>\n<li>Improve foot voting efficiency by allowing stakers to exit the protocol without being subject to new and pending DAO decisions.</li>\n<li>Don’t overburden users with governance decisions</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"the-importance-of-a-two-phased-veto-with-a-dynamic-timelock-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#the-importance-of-a-two-phased-veto-with-a-dynamic-timelock-6\"></a>The importance of a two-phased veto with a dynamic timelock</h3>\n<p>Well-designed onchain DeFi protocols are able to put users ahead of tokenholders.</p>\n<p>In the sense that even if the protocol is failing, users can still permissionlessly exit with their funds intact, and there’s nothing tokenholders can do about it.</p>\n<p>This is something that is truly new to financial markets and infrastructure. Something that is only made possible by the non-custodial nature of onchain DeFi.</p>\n<p>This power of exit, is an extremely underrated differentiator between onchain Defi and offchain Defi/Tradfi.</p>\n<p>If we want to preserve the right to exit under the most extreme scenarios, a naive Moloch style rage quit mechanism isn’t quit good enough. This is because of how Ethereum’s validator exit queue works – all Ethereum validator exits are processed through a single queue with limited throughput. This rate-limited exit queue means that in the worst case it could take more than a year to exit the protocol. During this time, the DAO could, in theory, pass proposals that could harm these users.</p>\n<p>Placing a naive timelock on DAO decisions (a temporary freeze, so to speak) doesn’t work either because the dynamic nature of the exit queue ensures there is no good way to place an upper limit on the length of this time.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, many users choose to re-deploy their staked capital to other forms of economic activity, and unwinding from these positions can take weeks. If Lido only has a single veto phase, then these users would not be able exit under a worst case scenario.</p>\n<p>In sum, a two-phase veto allows for a relatively small number of users to sound the alarm. In doing so, they can pause Lido governance proposals for long enough to either complete a negotiation and de-escalation process (happy path), or to allow for more users to join the veto and eventually exit (unhappy path). In order to avoid burdening users with politics, giving them exit guarantees is preferable to giving them full governance rights.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"committees-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#committees-7\"></a>Committees</h3>\n<p>While dual governance needs to cover any DAO decision that can potentially affect users of the protocol, it does not cover emergency actions triggered by time-scoped circuit-breaker multisigs and contracts. There are three such committees under the v1 design.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"gate-seal-committee-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#gate-seal-committee-8\"></a>Gate Seal committee</h4>\n<p>The Gate Seal committee is a 3/6 multisig that has the power to pause stETH to ETH withdrawals for a predetermined amount of days (currently set to 6). You can think of it as a safeguard against a withdrawal vulnerability being exploited by an attacker. The pause lasts for x days or, in the case that DAO decisions are blocked by stETH holders, until the execution of DAO decisions is unblocked. Importantly, the Gate Seal committee can only enact a pause once before losing its power (it has to be re-elected by the DAO after that). In case of non-use, the multisig automatically expires on a fixed date in the future – currently set to May 1st 2024 (see the discussion on renewing it <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/renew-gateseal-for-the-withdrawal-queue-and-validator-exit-bus-oracle/7081\">here</a>). At any time, the DAO can vote to appoint a new Gate Seal committee with a new expiration date.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"tiebreaker-committee-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#tiebreaker-committee-9\"></a>Tiebreaker committee</h4>\n<p>The Tiebreaker committee is a more complex multisig that has the ability, under very specific conditions, to execute decisions that were proposed and approved by LDO holders but subsequently blocked by stETH holders. Note that it only obtains this right under two potentially catastrophic edge case scenarios (one in which the Gate Seal committee has paused withdrawals post veto, and another in which there’s an infinite exit loop type bug). If this power didn’t exist, then stETH holders who are in the middle of rage quitting could be prevented from withdrawing indefinitely.</p>\n<p>While the GateSeal committee is optimized for speed of reaction, the Tiebreaker committee is designed for maximum security and wider ecosystem alignment: It is expected to composed of 3 or 4 sub-committees (some of which are expected to be fully-fledged DAOs). Each of these subcommittees represents a distinct interest group within the ecosystem. Any decision it makes needs to be approved by a majority (2/3 or 3/4) of sub-committees. And for each individual sub-committee to approve a decision, the latter should be supported by the supermajority of the sub-committee members. Note that no sub-committee may share members with the Gate Seal committee.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"margin-of-safety-committee-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#margin-of-safety-committee-10\"></a>Margin of safety committee</h4>\n<p>The margin of safety committee is a temporary multisig which effectively has the power to revert Lido governance back to it’s current state (i.e pre dual governance).</p>\n<p>It exists primarily to protect from zero-day vulnerabilities in dual governance. The plan is to have a generous bug bounty to encourage responsible disclosure. It will be dissolved once this bounty program comes to an end.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"parameter-choice-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#parameter-choice-11\"></a>Parameter choice</h2>\n<p>Clearly, getting the parameter selection right is of the upmost importance. While <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/mechanism.md\">the mechanism design overview</a> contains a range of possible values, finalizing these requires more research. The aim is to publish a document with suggested initial values within the next 3-6 months.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-importance-of-launching-before-7002-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#the-importance-of-launching-before-7002-12\"></a>The importance of launching before 7002</h2>\n<p>As things stand today, LDO holders cannot force node operators to exit. This means that in practice, it’s extremely difficult for even a captured DAO to coerce Ethereum aligned operators to do anything they would not wish to do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7002-execution-layer-triggerable-exits/14195\">EIP 7002</a>, expected to be included in the next Ethereum hardfork (c. Q1 2025), will drastically change the balance of power here, by effectively allowing LDO holders to force exit operators. Which is why dual governance ideally needs to go live before then (or shortly afterwards).</p>\n<p>Put another way, post triggerable exits, users need to be able to exit en masse to protect against a malicious withdrawal vault upgrade or undesirable changes to the node operator set.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-does-dual-governance-address-concerns-raised-by-researchers-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#how-does-dual-governance-address-concerns-raised-by-researchers-13\"></a>How does dual governance address concerns raised by researchers?</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"minimises-the-risk-of-cartel-abuse-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#minimises-the-risk-of-cartel-abuse-14\"></a>Minimises the risk of cartel abuse</h3>\n<p>In his seminal essay on <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd\">the risks of LSD</a>, Danny Ryan writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deciding “who” gets to be a NO is a matter of two questions – who is added to the set and who is removed the set. This can be designed in one of two ways in the long run – either via governance (a coin vote or other similar mechanism) or via an automated mechanism around reputation and profitability.</p>\n<p>In the former – governance deciding NOs – the governance token (e.g. LDO) becomes a major risk to Ethereum. If the token can decide who can be a node operator in this theoretical majority-LSD, then the token holders can force cartel activities of censorship, multi-block MEV, etc, or else the NO is removed from the set.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Governance deciding NOs has another distinct risk which is regulatory censorship and control. If pooled stake under one LSD protocol exceeds 50%, this pooled staked gains the ability to censor blocks (and worse-so at 2/3 due to being able to finalize such blocks). In a regulatory censorship attack, we now have a distinct entity – the governance token holders – that a regulator can make requests of censorship. Depending on the token distribution, this is likely a much simpler regulatory target than the Ethereum network as a whole. And, in fact, DAO token distributions are generally pretty terrible with just a few entities deciding most votes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=JKvJw2DT2YQ\">Dual governance</a> goes a long way towards addressing the above concerns. Concretely, if LDO holders tried to remove a node operator from the set unfairly, it would work as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A small quorum of stETH holders (say 2% of total) could signal their opposition to this bad decision and pause the governance execution long enough for more holders to react. As more stETH holders join the opposition, the execution pause is extended further.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While this is happening, LDO holders can elect to cancel the decision, and stETH holders can remove their opposition in response. If LDO holders refuse to revert course, and the number of dissatisfied stETH holders reaches a larger quorum (say 10% of total), all dissatisfied users are exited from the protocol (withdraw their ETH) and the governance execution pause is extended until this process ends.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Importantly, governance can only be brought back to normal state if both LDO governance and participating stETH holders agree to resolve the conflict, or once all dissatisfied stETH holders have exited the protocol.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In sum, by giving stETH holders the power to impose a dynamic timelock on changes which affect them, it becomes impossible for LDO holders to force Lido protocol changes onto them. This significantly reduces the risk of capture (via cartel activities of censorship, multi-block MEV, etc).</p>\n<p>Regarding Danny’s second concern (regulatory censorship and control), stETH’s token distribution is very different and much more diverse than LDO’s distribution. So the combination of LDO and stETH is much more resistant to this sort of censorship.

In particular, as we’ve highlighted above, post triggerable exits a well-funded attacker could buy enough LDO to force exit and replace the existing node operator set with a malicious one.</p>\n<p>Regarding innovations in decentralized governance that can protect against insider attacks, Vitalik lists two possible directions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Some kind of non-financialized governance, or perhaps a bicameral hybrid where decisions need to be passed not just by token holders but also by some other class of user (eg. the Optimism Citizens’ House or stETH holders as in the Lido two-chamber proposal)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intentional friction, making it so that certain kinds of decisions can only take effect after a delay long enough that users can see that something is going wrong and escape the system.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lido’s dual governance makes important steps in both of these directions. While governance is still financialized under this first iteration, it does become a bicameral hybrid.</p>\n<p>There is also significant intentional friction introduced by the fact that the veto is two-phased, and that veto states can be chained together. In other words, there’s been alot of thought put into ensuring that users have the time to see that something is going wrong, unwind from their DeFi positions, and exit the system.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"preliminary-timeline-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#preliminary-timeline-17\"></a>Preliminary timeline</h2>\n<p>If LDO holders approve of this direction – next week’s snapshot vote (scheduled for April 18th) will serve as a temperature check – contributors plan on going forward with a technical implementation, preparing for the testnet runs, as well as engaging multiple parties to challenge the mechanism design, technical implementation, and parameter choices.</p>\n<p>Optimistic timeline is testnet deployment in Q3, with mainnet launch scheduled for late Q3 / Q4. Note that these are approximate dates subject to change depending upon the security checks and testnet results.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"going-forward-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#going-forward-18\"></a>Going forward</h2>\n<p>While dual governance is an important step in reducing governance risks of the protocol, it’s in no way the final step.</p>\n<p>Some ideas for v2 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allow vanilla ETH holders to trigger an extended timelock / veto</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give some sort of veto / tiebreaker power to node operators</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allow for delegation of stETH veto / exit power</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allow for seamless DAO forks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Voter bonds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prediction markets</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"seamless-forking-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#seamless-forking-19\"></a>Seamless forking</h3>\n<p>A promising future research direction involves looking for ways to also improve the efficiency of foot voting by node operators. For example, by allowing a subset of stakers and node operators to coordinate a protocol and DAO fork by re-pointing validator withdrawal credentials to a new contract (assuming consensus layer support).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"minimal-governance-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#minimal-governance-20\"></a>Minimal governance</h3>\n<p>The ultimate solution to the user redemption-risk problem is governance minimization and eventual ossification of the protocol code and parameters. There’s no governance risk if nothing is being governed.</p>\n<p>Gradually minimizing the governance scope is something that Lido contributors see as a necessity in the coming years. However, until the Ethereum specification ossifies, there is only so much that can be done on this front.</p>\n<p>In addition, any immutable code has to be formally verified on the bytecode level to minimize the risk of exploitable compiler bugs. Doing this effectively will require significant changes to the architecture of Lido’s code.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"further-resources-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#further-resources-21\"></a>Further resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/specification.md\">Specification</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/mechanism.md\">Mechanism design</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727/2\">Research post</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrA6VQgh3bk\">Sam’s presentation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=JKvJw2DT2YQ\">Sacha’s presentation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1540652075352313857\">Twitter space with Hasu and Sam</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance\">Github repo</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@sacha/SJk8GHq5T\">FAQ</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dual-governance-explainer-research-distillation/7132\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dual-governance-explainer-research-distillation/7132","pubDate":"Thu, 11 Apr 2024 16:02:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-7132"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dual-governance-explainer-research-distillation/7132.rss","#text":"Lido dual governance explainer (research distillation)"},"filter":false},{"title":"Dual Governance: design and implementation proposal","dc:creator":"kadmil","category":"Proposals","description":"<h2><a name=\"what-is-dual-governance-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#what-is-dual-governance-1\"></a>What is Dual Governance</h2>\n<p>The Dual Governance mechanism (DG) is an iteration on the protocol governance that gives stakers 1) a dynamic user-extensible timelock on DAO decisions and 2) a rage quit mechanism taking into account the specifics of how Ethereum withdrawals work.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"current-status-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#current-status-2\"></a>Current status</h2>\n<p>After multiple stages of the research (<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727/26\">the latest update</a>, <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727\">the start of the “continuation” thread</a>, <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance/2382\">the initial post</a>), the mechanism design is now fully fleshed out.

I opened the link to redeem them, and had to enter my private key. I had to authorize for staking earlier though the process was a bit different but that was long time ago, so since it came from inside the Ledger live app I assumed it was ok, and that it comes from the staking/staked eth, not even thinking it was valuable or something but just following the intstructions. But no it wasn’t, my entire ledger has been robbed. I had about 44k (13 eth) staked and is now staked elsewhere.

A new Stonks instance is created with specific params and the DAO is proposed to add that contract to the Easy Track allowed recipients.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. Tokens are transferred from the DAO Treasury to the Stonks instance via Easy Track top up factories or Aragon vote.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Order placement. TMC requests Stonks to deploy a new Order contract via placeOrder function and it automatically sends all available assets there. After deployment the Order emits an event about it’s creation, sets an allowance to the CoW vault relayer contract and waits until this order is completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Order creation. Easy Track UI checks for <code>Order Created</code> events and if it detects one, allows TMC to create an offchain order on Cow Protocol. This UI is trustless and can be used by anyone.

The idea is to create a canonical version of <code>stETH</code> on these networks, being wrapped on top of <code>wstETH</code> (sort of ‘wrapped twice’). This approach will streamline the process of moving <code>stETH</code> across Ethereum rollups, making use of the existing <code>wstETH</code> infrastructure and liquidity venues on L2 networks.</p>\n<p>As a practical example, explore a design of upgrading the <code>wstETH</code> custom bridge on the Optimism network. The design relies on the previously presented <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2/tree/main/contracts/optimism\"><code>lido-l2</code></a> reference architecture and can be easily re-used for the OP-stack compatible networks or fairly simply adjusted for diverge rollup solutions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-on-wsteth-vs-steth-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#motivation-on-wsteth-vs-steth-2\"></a>Motivation on wstETH vs stETH</h2>\n<p>The wstETH token has been successfully integrated on various L2s: Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, zkSync Era, Linea, Mantle providing the ultimate easiness for DeFi integrations being a straightforward value-accruing token using the ‘lock-and-mint’ L1→L2 bridging approach.</p>\n<p>In contrast to wstETH, stETH depends on the rate changes to recalculate each user’s balance (e.g., perform a <a href=\"https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/lido#rebase\">rebase</a>). There is an essential UX property: the stETH token balance represents the underlying Ether value expected to be redeemed 1:1 via the protocol upon a withdrawal request.</p>\n<p>Beyond just updating an account’s balance in the wallet, having rebasable stETH on L2 hypothetically unlocks the following use cases and scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>staking/withdrawal requests originated from L2s with accuracy accounting for the stETH rebases that occurred during the bridging period</li>\n<li>performing gas payments in <code>stETH</code> with amounts corresponding to ether on rollups that opted in to support token gas payments (e.g., following the Account Abstraction)</li>\n<li>cross-domain <code>stETH</code> deposits/withdrawals (L1 and L2s) for CEXes</li>\n<li>custodians and service providers to support L2s directly (DeFi interactions, deposits/withdrawals) as they can charge fees with each rebase while users still see their balance changing each day</li>\n<li>once main routine user activity migrated from L1 to L2, there should be UX available as it was previously (rebasable token)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-and-flows-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#abstract-and-flows-3\"></a>Abstract and flows</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/e/e58452e98b584c6a44b8c2f3cfe97536f6eb71f9.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wKoQhL7JGpJW6VW314UsY8RkAbf.png?dl=1\" title=\"threeNewFlows\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/e/e58452e98b584c6a44b8c2f3cfe97536f6eb71f9_2_679x500.png\" alt=\"threeNewFlows\" data-base62-sha1=\"wKoQhL7JGpJW6VW314UsY8RkAbf\" width=\"679\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/e/e58452e98b584c6a44b8c2f3cfe97536f6eb71f9_2_679x500.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/e/e58452e98b584c6a44b8c2f3cfe97536f6eb71f9_2_1018x750.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/e/e58452e98b584c6a44b8c2f3cfe97536f6eb71f9_2_1358x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"212940\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The ‘lock-and-mint’ wstETH bridge extension (i.e., <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2/tree/main/contracts/optimism\"><code>lido-l2</code></a>) introduces a set of the new bridging flows:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"bridging-steth-from-l1-to-l2-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#bridging-steth-from-l1-to-l2-4\"></a>Bridging stETH from L1 to L2</h4>\n<p>User locks stETH, and the bridge contract wraps it into wstETH. The amount of wrapped tokens is then forwarded through the already implemented wstETH bridging path (e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2/blob/277631b5b323312f57fc1aed7ec79e75f4b7e912/contracts/optimism/L1ERC20TokenBridge.sol#L46\">wstETH on Optimism</a>) with the intent to have stETH on the L2 end. Therefore, the L2 bridge mints wstETH and wraps it back to stETH.</p>\n<p>The design facilitates the L2 stETH bridged amount is being the same as was sent from L1 in most cases by attaching the token rate data with each bridging request.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"bridging-back-steth-from-l2-to-l1-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#bridging-back-steth-from-l2-to-l1-5\"></a>Bridging back stETH from L2 to L1</h4>\n<p>The bridge transfers stETH from a user upon request,  unwraps it to wstETH, and burns that wstETH on L2 side. The amount of burned tokens is then forwarded through the established path with the goal of receiving stETH on the L1 end. To achieve this, the L1 bridge, in turn, unlocks wstETH and unwraps it to stETH.</p>\n<p>Since the withdrawal process can take up to a week (a common case for optimistic rollups), it’s expected that the stETH amount will be different on the L1 side upon the withdrawal completion due to rebases happened during the withdrawal delay (i.e., challenge period) of a rollup, and user rewards/penalties will be attributed properly.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"forwarding-the-wstethsteth-in-protocol-rate-from-l1-to-l2-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#forwarding-the-wstethsteth-in-protocol-rate-from-l1-to-l2-6\"></a>Forwarding the wstETH/stETH in-protocol rate from L1 to L2</h4>\n<p>Include the token rate as a part of the calldata in each L1 to L2 bridging request.

To achieve this, the same approach of <code>L1-&gt;L2</code> messaging is used, while the inclusion itselft is guaranteed when the sequencing window duration passes (e.g., 12h for Optimism, 24h for Arbitrum).</p>\n<p>It’s also assumed that general rollup failures and communication loss of <code>L1-&gt;L2</code> messaging would mean that L2 blocks are not produced and the L2 state is not going forward.

It covers governance discussions, snapshot votes, github PRs, and github code repositories.</p>\n<p>We use AI to summarise and give context to the information, among other things.</p>\n<p>I’d love to hear any feedback and how I can make this more useful and specific for Lido. For example, i do plan to add Easy Track proposals and on-chain proposals eventually, but are there any more pressing/valuable information that the Lido community would need?</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/ecosystem-summaries-to-help-the-community-stay-up-to-date/6842\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://research.lido.fi/t/ecosystem-summaries-to-help-the-community-stay-up-to-date/6842","pubDate":"Fri, 08 Mar 2024 15:12:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"research.lido.fi-topic-6842"},"source":{"@url":"https://research.lido.fi/t/ecosystem-summaries-to-help-the-community-stay-up-to-date/6842.rss","#text":"Ecosystem summaries to help the community stay up to date"},"filter":false},{"title":"LIP-21: Simple On-chain Delegation","dc:creator":"zuzu_eeka","category":"The LIP - Lido Improvement Proposal - Process","description":"<h2><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>Lido DAO-ops workstream contributors propose implementing Simple On-chain Delegation to address the security and operational hurdles arising from the lack of delegation for on-chain voting.</p>\n<p>The Simple On-chain Delegation allows LDO token holders to delegate their voting power to other addresses and delegates to participate in on-chain voting on behalf of their delegated voters.</p>\n<p>This quick and cost-effective solution involves some simplification of the user experience; however, it is intended to address urgent needs while the contributors are working on a more comprehensive solution.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#motivation-2\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>\n<p>In the current conditions, reaching a quorum in on-chain voting has become highly challenging, and several consecutive votes failed to reach a quorum. The absence of an on-chain delegation is a blocker for stable and sufficient participation in on-chain voting and protocol development.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#abstract-3\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This proposal is intended to allow LDO holders to designate addresses as their delegates. Delegates will be able to take part in on-chain voting using the voting power delegated to them. Each delegate will be able to use the voting power of multiple delegated voters.</p>\n<p>Alongside that, it’s proposed to add <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/lidodao-token-rewards-plan-trp/3364\">TRP (Token Rewards Plan)</a> participants the ability to delegate their LDO rewards.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"projects-objective-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#projects-objective-4\"></a>Projects objective</h2>\n<p>Three vectors can be directly or indirectly solved through on-chain delegation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Activate the voting power of the voters who are already involved in the governance process and have delegated their voting power on off-chain <a href=\"http://snapshot.org/\">snapshot.org</a> but have never participated in on-chain voting.</li>\n<li>Ease the on-chain voting process for those who are already involved in the governance process and participate in on-chain voting but irregularly. There are various reasons for this: limited and complex access to cold wallets given the short 48-hour voting phase or multi-sig as a token holder.</li>\n<li>Attract those willing to participate in the governance process when Lido DAO determines an open delegation mechanism with a list of delegates.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Contributors to the DAO operations value stream are targeting a 20-30M LDO increase in the quarterly active voting power participation for on-chain votes (for Q4 2023, the quarterly active VP on on-chain votes accounted for ~90M LDO, and on off-chain <a href=\"http://snapshot.org/\">snapshot.org</a> ~120M LDO).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"design-requirements-and-trade-offs-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#design-requirements-and-trade-offs-5\"></a>Design Requirements and trade-offs</h2>\n<p>A proper full-fledged delegation mechanism involves maintaining an accounting to track actual delegated voting power at any moment accurately. Implementing this is a complex and time-consuming project.</p>\n<p>The current solution is a simplified version that addresses three basic requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is a mapping of token holders’ and delegates’ addresses; the token holder can set a delegate and cancel the delegation, and the delegate can obtain the addresses of all those who have delegated to them.</li>\n<li>A delegate can vote on behalf of a token holder or a list of token holders.</li>\n<li>A token holder has an ultimate authority, they can override the delegate’s decision on a vote.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/mag_right.png?v=12\" title=\":mag_right:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":mag_right:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> You can dive into the design description of the solution in the <strong>specification: <a href=\"https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-21.md\">LIP-21.

The Original Program consists of sharing some of the middleware usage fees with selected applicants who have demonstrated their commitment to furthering the adoption of stETH.</p>\n<p>The Original Program was detailed in<a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/tiered-rewards-share-program-a-sustainable-approach-to-steth-growth/4851\"> this forum post</a> and approved by<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x9279cd4addefdd9185d024f471f1a29561f61556ae209cdda5dffb1fd73b181e\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Snapshot</a> (end date June 30, 2023).</p>\n<p>While test driving the Original Program since its launch, the Rewards Share Committee (the “<strong>Committee</strong>”) noticed that the Original Program was not as effective as hoped. It found that Participants that had not previously attracted large levels of stETH adoption (in the range of 40,000 - 50,000 stETH) did not attract new stETH adoption after being onboarded to the Program, meanwhile it produced stress and load on the contributors to keep it alive.</p>\n<p>Based on this experience, the Committee has identified a number of changes that are required to enable the Original Program to operate more effectively.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#proposal-2\"></a>Proposal</h1>\n<p>On behalf of the Committee, I propose the following new Rewards-Share Program to replace the Original Program:</p>\n<p>As with the Old Program, the new program helps spread awareness about liquid staking technology and liquid staking tokens like stETH. The program consists of sharing some of the middleware usage fees with selected applicants who have demonstrated their commitment to furthering the adoption of stETH.</p>\n<p>The program operates in three-phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Onboarding</strong>: This phase involves the initial application and evaluation process. Prospective participants need to meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the proposal below. The Committee will review and vote on applications, then add the accepted addresses to the program. As part of this phase the Committee shall be free to and may negotiate bespoke terms with promising prospective participants (the “<strong>Agreed Terms</strong>”).</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards-Share</strong>: Once onboarded, participants who attract new ETH are eligible for rewards-share. The Committee will monitor participants’ stETH contributions and calculate rewards based on the Agreed Terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Offboarding</strong>: The program is designed with defined termination points for all participants. The offboarding phase happens either when a participant voluntarily leaves the program, does not renew their participation, gets disqualified due to violation of the program’s rules or the Agreed Terms, is discontinued by a DAO vote, or the rewards pool for rewards-share is exhausted and not renewed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of these phases is explained in detail below.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"onboarding-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#onboarding-3\"></a>Onboarding</h1>\n<p>Prospective participants can be wallets, institutions, protocols, crypto services, neobanks, and custody services, or other types of participants with solutions that are capable of integrating the Lido middleware solution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minimum Threshold</strong>: Participants must demonstrate that they have already driven at least 40,000 ETH in stake coming from users of the Lido Middleware .</li>\n<li><strong>Committee Discretion</strong>: If an applicant does not meet the Minimum Threshold, the Committee can still assess applications from projects that show potential for driving stETH adoption. Evaluating factors may include the uniqueness of the product or any other qualities that the Committee recognizes as indicative of future growth potential. All Committee decisions are final and are not subject to review.</li>\n<li><strong>Commitment</strong>: Participants must not breach applicable laws and have to resort only to legal means when advocating for the further adoption of the stETH liquid staking token. Participants are free to advocate for the adoption of alternative liquid staking tokens (ALSTs) and liquid staking solutions, but must not do this in a way that shows the middleware or stETH in a bad light, must not use derogatory language when referring to the middleware solution or stETH and/or should use the same or very similar amounts of efforts to spread awareness about stETH as it does for ALSTs.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing compliance with the program</strong>: As described below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Application Process</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Committee will review applications and make a decision on whether to reject or accept an applicant.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The identity of participants will not be public, however participants’ addresses and rewards-share amounts may be publicly disclosed.</li>\n<li>The applicants will be eligible to earn rewards from the date they are accepted.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Applications must have the following information and be submitted to the Committee:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Platform name</li>\n<li>Background information</li>\n<li>Evidence that the Minimum Threshold has been met</li>\n<li>How you intend to make use of the program</li>\n<li>Ethereum address and if it is an externally owned account (EOA) or smart-contract (this will determine how transfers are made)</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Update a public record with the participant’s address (only addresses, no names).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Applicants (both successful and unsuccessful) will not be reimbursed for any time, costs or expenses incurred in applying for the program. Decisions of the Committee are final.</p>\n<p><strong>Program compliance and conditions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Participants are expected to comply with the rules of the program on an ongoing basis and not just on the date they apply to be included. Participants shall certify that they fully understand how the middleware operates, and will undertake to not use the middleware for unintended purposes, as described well and in detail in these independent third party interface maintainers’ <a href=\"https://lido.fi/terms-of-use\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Terms of Use</a></li>\n<li>The snapshot vote determines the size of the rewards-share pool (“<strong>Rewards Pool</strong>”) and the amount and terms of the stETH token reward program, and can modify them through another vote</li>\n<li>The DAO can vote to stop, pause, and resume the program at any time</li>\n<li>The DAO can, at any time, vote to change the operating conditions of the program</li>\n<li>The program does not have a specific time frame.

The percentage is determined by the Committee during the application process and applies for a period of 12 months, or such other period as may be agreed by the Committee in exceptional cases (the “<strong>Rewards Share Percentage</strong>”). The maximum Rewards Share Percentage that the Committee may agree to is 50% of the DAO’s 5% share of staking rewards - i.e. 2.5%).</p>\n<p>For each individual ETH staked as a result of the rewards share program participants’ efforts, those participants shall be entitled to rewards for a period of 12 months starting from the date the ETH was staked, or such other period agreed by the Committee in exceptional cases. The amount of rewards-share is determined by the total cumulative ETH staked by the participant and/or by users via participants’ products and services.</p>\n<p>A participant’s rewards share will be determined by the amount of ETH originating from a participant’s products and services. A necessary prerequisite for the recognition of the staked amount is that the staking transactions must be unambiguously attributable to the participant’s products and services based on the on-chain data. This might be achieved by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The integration of a unique referral code provided to the participants of the previous referral programs that tracks staked ETH</li>\n<li>Or by using on-chain data from a router smart contract that interacts exclusively with the participant’s own tokens and/or tokens belonging to the users of the participant’s products and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Committee can disqualify any staking transactions if they are too ambiguous or difficult to attribute to a participant’s products and services with a sufficient level of confidence.</p>\n<p><em>For example, let’s say prior to enrollment, the amount of ETH staked through participant A’s products and services is 60,000 ETH and the Committee agreed to a 25% Rewards Share Percentage.</em></p>\n<p><em>If as a result of the 60,000 ETH stake a middleware usage fee in the amount of 1,000 ETH is programmatically collected, Participant A would receive 250 ETH as their share (25% of 1000 ETH). This reward-sharing continues for each ETH staked, starting from the date each ETH is staked, and generally lasts for 12 months. If Participant A decides to stake additional ETH during this period, each new ETH will also earn rewards for 12 months from the date it was staked.</em></p>\n<p><em>The actual reward amount could be higher or lower depending on the actual staking rewards generated during this period.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Rewards-Share Calculation</strong></p>\n<p>All participants will be provided a unique referral code, that can be integrated at the website or protocol level, to track ETH they stake using Lido protocol. The Committee will check activity within calendar months (ex. Jan 1st-31st) and will share rewards with participants quarterly or such other period as may be agreed by the Committee.</p>\n<p>These actions determine the amount of rewards-share:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ETH Contribution</strong>: The total amount of ETH staked by relevant users of the Lido middleware, meaning the participants themselves and/or users of their products and services (for avoidance of doubt this does not include swapping ETH for stETH through crypto exchanges).</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards Share Percentage</strong>: the Rewards Share Percentage agreed by the Committee, up to a staking duration: Rewards share lasts 12 months from the time each ETH was staked, unless otherwise agreed by the Committee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>For example, Participant A initially staked 40,000 ETH and the Committee has agreed to a 20% Rewards Share Percentage. Later, they staked an additional 20,000 ETH. Rewards are earned per ETH staked and last for 12 months from the staking date. Thus, Participant A earns rewards for both the initial and additional ETH stakes based on the agreed Rewards Share Percentage.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Rewards-Share Disqualification Activities</strong></p>\n<p>Listed below is a non-exhaustive list of samples of activities that are detrimental to the program and can result in disqualifying ETH from being included in rewards-share. Only ETH involved in disqualification is excluded, not all ETH. The Committee will filter for all new staked ETH within calendar month checking periods. These activities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unstaking: If ETH has been staked and unstaked in a period, then only net amount will be counted towards rewards-share</li>\n<li>Selling stETH on DEXs/CEXs: Trading stETH on decentralized or centralized exchanges</li>\n<li>Cycle-staking: Repeatedly staking ETH, selling or unstaking the resulting stETH, and then staking again</li>\n<li>One-sided stETH liquidity provisioning on DEXs: Providing liquidity for only one side of a decentralized exchange pool</li>\n<li>Secondary leveraged staking: Engaging in leveraged staking on platforms like Aave, Compound, or Spark are eligible for rewards-share. However, rewards-share for stETH originating from leveraged staking will be disqualified if the position risk ratio (borrowed funds/borrow limit) is above 0.95 or if the corresponding staking transactions take place:\n<ul>\n<li>While the deviation of the stETH:ETH swap rate from 1:1 is greater than 1%</li>\n<li>When a temporary increase of the liquidation threshold for (w)stETH collateral is enacted</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>For example, Participant A has contributed 60,000 ETH and the Committee has agreed to a Rewards Share Percentage of 25% of the DAO’s 5% share of staking rewards. However, 10,000 ETH from Participant A are associated with disqualifying activities, such as providing liquidity only on one side of a DEX pool, or repeatedly cycle staking (staking ETH, unstaking it, staking again), the 10,000 ETH associated with this activity will no longer be eligible for the rewards-share.</em></p>\n<p>These activities do not disqualify the participant from the program outright, just the ETH directly involved in disqualification activities. However, if ETH originating from a participant is repeatedly involved in disqualification activities, the Committee can disqualify a participant from the program completely.</p>\n<p>The Committee can disqualify participants if it has reason to believe that a participant is involved in illegal or fraudulent activities.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"unstaked-eth-and-the-social-unstake-deduction-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#unstaked-eth-and-the-social-unstake-deduction-6\"></a>Unstaked ETH and the Social Unstake Deduction</h3>\n<p>Unstaked ETH will be deducted from the amount of tokens eligible for rewards-share. For unstaked ETH that is difficult to track directly to its source <em>(mixed with tokens from other sources, or split between different addresses etc.)</em> - we created the social unstake deduction.</p>\n<p>This technique indirectly adjusts eligible ETH for rewards-share by considering the total unstaked ETH during a calendar month and the proportion of that unstaked ETH contributed by rewards-share participants. This mechanism was invented to overcome limitations imposed by stETH fungibility - it is hardly possible to determine the origin of a particular unstaked token.</p>\n<p><em>For example, imagine a total of 10m ETH staked with 1M ETH coming from the rewards-share program. Participant A is responsible for 900k ETH, and participant B is responsible for 100k ETH. If users unstake 1k ETH with an uncertain origin, the social unstake deduction is applied. In this case, 10% of the 1k unstaked (100 stETH) is used as the deduction and is proportionally deducted from each participant’s share of tokens eligible for rewards-share.</em></p>\n<p>The social unstake deduction will not be enabled by default. It will be used as an emergency brake in case of mass unstaking of participants in the rewards-share program.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the total amount of withdrawals that are difficult to attribute directly to participants in a month exceeds 40% of the average monthly new stake for the last three months, then the social unstake deduction will be applied. By default, the deduction will be disabled the next month if withdrawals don’t exceed the threshold.</li>\n<li>The social unstake deduction will be enabled on a permanent basis if multiple participants are systematically cheating through cycle staking to get higher rewards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"avoiding-the-social-unstake-deduction-with-whitelisted-addresses-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#avoiding-the-social-unstake-deduction-with-whitelisted-addresses-7\"></a>Avoiding the Social Unstake Deduction with Whitelisted Addresses</h3>\n<p>The whitelisted address is a way for participants to avoid the social unstake deduction. stETH sent to the whitelisted address will be exempt from the social unstake deduction but will be subjected to direct unstake deduction instead if withdrawals take place.</p>\n<p><em>For Example, let’s say participant A requests to have their Ethereum address (<code>0x123abc...</code>) whitelisted by the Committee, which is granted. Initially, they decide to stake 60,000 ETH through Lido protocol and send it to the whitelisted address. For as long as the 60,000 stETH is in the whitelisted address, the social unstake deduction is not applied for that 60,000 stETH.</em></p>\n<p>This process allows the Committee to easily track a participant’s contribution.</p>\n<p>The process for creating and defining a whitelisted address is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Request for Whitelisting: A participant submits a request to the Committee to have an address whitelisted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Address Verification: Verifying a participant’s address and identity is used through telegram and discord channels, on-chain analytics, and other sources (ie, social media accounts)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Eligible addresses can be:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Externally owned account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proxy contract</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smart contract</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any Ethereum address that can verify the existence and balance of stETH by the Committee over a rewards period</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"offboarding-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#offboarding-8\"></a>Offboarding</h1>\n<p>The Rewards-Share Program is designed with a predetermined termination point, marking the onset of the offboarding phase. This phase can be triggered under several circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voluntary Departure: Participants may decide to leave the program at their own discretion.</li>\n<li>Non-renewal: After expiry of the agreed period of active participation, participants must reapply for the program. If a participant does not renew their participation, they automatically enter the offboarding phase.</li>\n<li>Disqualification: If a participant violates the program’s rules stipulated herein, they can be disqualified and pushed into the offboarding phase.</li>\n<li>Rewards Share Discontinuation: The DAO reserves the right to vote for the conclusion or non-renewal of the Rewards Pool. If such a vote passes, all participants are moved to the offboarding phase.</li>\n<li>Exhaustion of Rewards Pool: If the Rewards Pool for rewards-share is exhausted and not renewed, all participants will no longer receive rewards-share.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a participant’s status in the program is terminated and is no longer earning rewards-share going forward, stETH before termination will still be earning rewards (e.g. for 12 months from time of actual staking). However, should the Rewards Pool be depleted or the DAO decide to vote to discontinue the program, the rewards-share distribution will consequently cease for all participants.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-committee-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#the-committee-9\"></a>The Committee</h1>\n<p>The Committee will control a multi-signature wallet with authority to whitelist, filter, and distribute stETH protocol rewards. The Rewards Share Program gives the Committee broad discretion and authority when deciding and managing the rewards share activities, so in case of doubt it should be considered that the Committee is free to make any decisions except the ones which are expressly reserved herein and require a DAO vote. The Committee shall be free to make any and all legal arrangements that it might deem necessary to give effect to the reward share program.</p>\n<p>Whenever it sees fit and/or necessary, the Committee would be able to designate and reserve certain amounts of tokens from the Rewards Pool for specific purposes or projects with the idea to be able to meet any specific or bespoke commitments towards program participants.</p>\n<p>In exceptional cases and to ensure engagement, where an applicant does not meet the Minimum Threshold but has a significant growth potential, the Committee would be able to make arrangements so that the participants that meet their bespoke growth commitments are entitled to retroactive rewards share for a period of up to six months before the date on which they met their target (which could be set above, but not below, the Minimum Threshold and is at the Committee’s discretion).</p>\n<p>Multisig disclosure: Use <a href=\"https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xe2A682A9722354D825d1BbDF372cC86B2ea82c8C\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xe2A682A9722354D825d1BbDF372cC86B2ea82c8C</a> rewards share multi-signature wallet that is ministerially administered by the Committee signers.

This means $LDO token holders can leverage their holdings to engage in strategic trades and potentially increase their returns.</p>\n<p>Revolutionary Interest Rate Model: The new interest rate model dynamically adjusts rates to maintain optimal utilization, maximising lender revenue and minimising borrower costs. This model benefits $LDO token holders by potentially offering higher yields on their deposits.</p>\n<p>Repay Using Collateral: V2 allows users to repay loans and margin trade positions using the position’s collateral. This feature provides flexibility for $LDO token holders, enabling them to manage their investments more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Expanded Asset Availability: Fringe Finance V2 supports a wide range of assets across multiple chains, including $LDO on the Ethereum network. This broad asset support, combined with features like multi-asset lending and integration of advanced price feeds, opens up new avenues for $LDO token holders to diversify their DeFi activities and enhance their earning potential.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"incentive-program-a-catalyst-for-lender-profits-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://research.lido.fi#incentive-program-a-catalyst-for-lender-profits-2\"></a>Incentive Program: A Catalyst for Lender Profits</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/original/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/18QKcLgEMU60sjjCCtJMdtkmKe4.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"18QKcLgEMU60sjjCCtJMdtkmKe4\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_690x388.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/08024c886cd254f9d307d705ee6d6c49362e3f50_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"6A694B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This program directly rewards lenders for their deposits, creating a cycle that benefits all participants in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The incentive program is structured around five lender Total Value Locked (TVL) milestones, with rewards issued as each target is met and sustained.</p>\n<p>The rewards, issued in FRIN tokens, are calculated based on the proportion of interest earned by a lender’s deposits relative to the total interest earned on the platform.
