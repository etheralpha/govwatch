Thank you all so much for your passion, and sincere efforts to improve Octant as a whole. We would not be where we are today without your inputs, feedback, and active participation.</p>\n<p>As an update on our Proof-of-Uniqueness / Anti-Sybil work, I’d like to quickly post what I wrote yesterday on the topic and below that I will give you all a short update on what we are doing for the upcoming epoch(s)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Over the past months we have heard a lot of feedback from the Octant community relating to our use of Gitcoin Passport. Anti-sybil is extremely important to us - it protects the sanctity and validity of our epochs. We do not take this lightly. We also want you to know that we hear you, and we agree. We need a better system, one that provides a high level of anti-sybil while providing the best user experience we can. This is a complex issue, and one that will not be solved easily. We are exploring different options, consulting various anti-sybil experts, and seeking to optimize our products based on your feedback.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately at this point in time, none of the options we have explored provide us with a high enough degree of security or provide you with an easy user experience. Many of these options are not yet mature enough to meet our needs, or yours. Others put a high $$ cost on your shoulders, and that is not something we ever want to do. For now, we will be continuing with Gitcoin Passport for Epoch 5 (<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/octantapp.eth/proposal/0x85a35ebd0db500e60e360f39a8828b49cee01c7511ba5fb66b622715db80fee2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">potentially with a lower PoU score, snapshot vote pending</a>), while we ramp up our research and exploration of alternative solutions. Please continue to send us feedback, ideas, and new solutions about this topic - we want our community to be involved, and moving forward we want to ensure that our design decisions to reflect your needs.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So, what else are we doing for Epoch 5 and beyond? Following our anti-sybil analysis, we will be implementing a “timeout” zone for suspected sybils in order to protect trust in our matching system, and ensure the best outcomes for all our grantees. This is not a permanent ban or blacklisting and all suspected addresses will be alerted to this status during the Allocation Flow, and prompted to dispute it. Accounts who are suspected as sybils will still be able to donate their rewards to projects, but will not be eligible for any Matching Reward donations. <strong>We will never stop wallets from donating their rewards</strong> as that negatively affects our grantees.</p>\n<p>To be completely transparent, suspected Sybils will not be able to be removed from timeout before the allocation window for Epoch 5 ends. We know this is not the best solution, and we will be exploring a dispute window that enables suspected Sybils to be notified of their status prior to the allocation window of Epoch 6, and enable successful disputes to receive full Matching Rewards during that epoch.</p>\n<p>For Epoch 5, we know there might be false positives. I am truly sorry if this affects you. Please know that this was my call, and I knowingly chose to balance the sanctity &amp; trust of matching donations over the risk of false positives affecting users, in order to best benefit the Epoch 5 Grantees. I will re-iterate that we do not want these false positives to be punished moving forward. If you are affected by this, please reach out to me - I would love to talk to you and understand your pain points with this system, and how we can work together to make it better.</p>\n<p>Again, thank you so much for your active participation here on the governance forum, and continued Public Goods support through Octant.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Ben</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/anti-sybil-for-epoch-5-beyond/500\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/anti-sybil-for-epoch-5-beyond/500","pubDate":"Fri, 13 Sep 2024 13:53:23 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-500"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/anti-sybil-for-epoch-5-beyond/500.rss","#text":"Anti-Sybil for Epoch 5 & Beyond"},"filter":false},{"title":"Project Eligibility From One Round To The Next","dc:creator":"james","category":"Mechanism Design","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-1081-project-eligibility-from-one-round-to-the-next-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-1081-project-eligibility-from-one-round-to-the-next-1\"></a>Project Eligibility From One Round To The Next</h2>\n<p>We just hosted the first Octant Town Hall, where we focused our discussion primarily on a crucial topic: the handling of project eligibility, rollover, and the overall process for managing projects from one funding round to the next.</p>\n<p>The reason this discussion is so important is because we see the need to balance fairness in project funding both for projects that have participated in previous rounds, and also new projects that are just applying to Octant for the first time.</p>\n<p>You can watch the full video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTq9SSqgUw\">here on our Youtube channel</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Context setting:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Current Process:</strong> Currently, projects that rank in the top 50% of each round automatically roll over to the next round, provided they meet their reporting requirements. This system was designed because the onboarding snapshot poll that we conduct would be an absolute mess if every project would have to reapply each round.</li>\n<li><strong>Concerns Raised:</strong> We heard a lot of concerns that this system could entrench certain projects, making it difficult for new or lesser-known initiatives to secure funding (or after every round). There was a sentiment that the automatic rollover could limit opportunities for innovation and diversity in funded projects. I personally agree.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Potential Solutions:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cool Down Periods:</strong> One proposed solution was implementing a “cool down” period for projects that have been funded consecutively over several rounds. This would allow new projects to have a better chance of securing funding by limiting how often established projects can reapply.</li>\n<li><strong>Project Reporting and Metrics:</strong> Another suggestion was to introduce stricter reporting requirements for projects that repeatedly receive funding. This would ensure that ongoing funding is justified by demonstrable impact and progress, thus maintaining accountability and transparency.</li>\n<li><strong>Themed Rounds</strong>:  A new concept discussed was the introduction of themed rounds. These would be specialized funding rounds focused on specific areas of development or community interest within the Octant ecosystem. The idea behind themed rounds is to encourage innovation and collaboration by directing resources toward particular goals or challenges identified by the community. Themed rounds could bring fresh energy into the funding process, attracting projects that might not have applied in a general round. This approach could also help Octant address specific needs within the ecosystem more effectively, ensuring that critical areas receive the attention and support they need.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> We want to continue this discussion here on our governance board to gather further insights from the community.  So we are now opening the floor for everyone to continue sharing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should we remove the automatic rollover?</li>\n<li>Should there be a cool off period for projects?</li>\n<li>Should we run themed rounds to get more granular with the focus of each round?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What are your thoughts, I would love to hear them!</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/project-eligibility-from-one-round-to-the-next/487\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/project-eligibility-from-one-round-to-the-next/487","pubDate":"Thu, 29 Aug 2024 17:57:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-487"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/project-eligibility-from-one-round-to-the-next/487.rss","#text":"Project Eligibility From One Round To The Next"},"filter":false},{"title":"2077 Collective - Proposal for an Octant Grant to Accelerate Ethereum and onboard new users, builders, and investors through coordinated marketing efforts","dc:creator":"0xyanshu","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br>\n2077 Collective is a community focused on promoting Ethereum and it’s ecosystem and accelerating its adoption in the real world. Ethereum is a public good, but even the best protocol won’t speak for itself. 2077 Collective is an open community where everyone who wants to do so can use their skills to promote Ethereum.</p>\n<p>Ethereum has evolved significantly since its inception, now home to over 70 rollups (as per L2beat), its current landscape is fragmented, which makes it challenging for users and developers to navigate the ecosystem. The social layer is weakened, with communities scattered across various rollup projects and lacking a unifying Schelling point in Ethereum itself.</p>\n<p>The authors of this proposal have identified the following problems with Ethereum’s marketing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum doesn’t have a marketing team but its competitors do. This affects the Ethereum brand and negatively affects public sentiment, mindshare, and developer/user adoption. There’s an established community of researchers and developers focused on building and scaling Ethereum. But there’s no unified community focused on promoting it.</li>\n<li>Ethereum underallocates to coordinated marketing. The Ethereum community takes a hands off approach—in the interests of decentralization and credible neutrality—and eschews coordinated promotion and marketing of Ethereum and Ethereum projects. However, the lack of a central organization coordinating efforts to market Ethereum leads to inconsistent, incoherent, and ineffective promotional campaigns for the protocol and ecosystem projects.</li>\n<li>Ethereum lacks strong voices and advocates. Builders and researchers are often too humble and would rather build in stealth than take up the task of advocating for Ethereum online and in meatspace. Excessive humility and aversion to self-promotion among Ethereans results in underappreciation of innovative projects in the Ethereum ecosystem and low interest in cutting-edge R&amp;D work undertaken by core developers and researchers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By harnessing the power of effective marketing, communication, and community engagement, the Collective aims to build an open social coordination layer that bridges these gaps. Our work will amplify Ethereum’s impact, ensuring that it is recognized not just as a technical marvel, but as a transformative force for societal good.</p>\n<p>Through our efforts, we will drive adoption, foster trust, and help Ethereum maintain its leadership position in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem. We aim to onboard new users and developers by providing them with the guidance and resources they need to navigate the Ethereum landscape effectively, making the technology more approachable and its benefits more apparent to a global audience.</p>\n<p>Learn more about 2077 Collective - <a href=\"https://2077.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://2077.xyz/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Public Repository:</strong><br>\nYou can check out our official Discord for all public updates and discussions, where we have 5 groups in charge of the collective operations, guild leads (developer guild, writer guild, social media guild, videographer guild, researcher guild, designer guild, marketer guild, Business developer guild) 3 support for guild leads.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget Breakdown</strong><br>\n<strong>Milestone 1: 15 ETH for Content Development: Etherpedia, EIP Coverage, and 2077 Research</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Etherpedia</strong>: Publish 50+ articles as part of the Ethereum Roadmap Series, covering key topics like The Merge, The Surge, and others.</li>\n<li><strong>EIP Coverage:</strong> Publish detailed articles on all 10 major EIPs for the upcoming Pectra update, enhancing community understanding and engagement.</li>\n<li><strong>2077 Research:</strong> Release 10+ deep-dive technical articles on advanced Ethereum topics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2: 30 ETH for Regional Expansion</strong><br>\n<strong>Expected Outcome:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community Establishment:</strong> Expand the 2077 Collective’s presence into Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Africa, establishing communities with over 500+ members in each region.Engage local stakeholders through tailored initiatives to foster a supportive ecosystem for Ethereum enthusiasts and contributors.</li>\n<li><strong>Event Organization:</strong> Organize a series of in-person (IRL) and online events aimed at educating and onboarding participants into Ethereum.

Our approach supports freedom of speech and access to information, regardless of geographic location or socio-economic status. By empowering users to bypass censorship and maintain connectivity, we promote the free flow of information and support fundamental rights.</p>\n<p>NetSepio aims to advance the values of freedom and privacy, especially for activists and individuals concerned about online security. By leveraging decentralized VPN (ÐVPN) and decentralized Wi-Fi (ÐWi-Fi) technologies, the platform enables users to bypass censorship and access information freely, a critical feature for those operating in regions with restricted internet access. The Erebrus Protocol, which powers NetSepio, ensures that no single entity can control the network, embodying the principles of decentralization and privacy. Advanced technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and encryption provide a secure environment for users to engage in sensitive activities without fear of surveillance or retribution.</p>\n<p>The platform also raises awareness about online security through AI-driven threat detection tools and blockchain transparency. These technologies not only enhance the security of the network but also educate users on the importance of vigilance in their online activities. By offering these advanced tools via an open-source platform, NetSepio empowers individuals to understand and mitigate online risks, fostering a culture of security awareness. Adaptive bandwidth allocation and robust DNS firewalls further contribute to a secure and efficient online experience, ensuring that users can access information quickly and safely even in critical situations.</p>\n<p>Additionally, NetSepio tackles the issue of location tracking commonly associated with public Wi-Fi networks by decentralizing Wi-Fi connectivity. Traditional Wi-Fi connections expose BSSID data, risking live location tracking. NetSepio’s approach mitigates this risk by creating a resilient and distributed connection network, making it difficult for malicious entities to pinpoint a user’s location. This feature is invaluable for activists and whistleblowers who need to safeguard their anonymity. By combining these comprehensive security measures, NetSepio not only enhances freedom and privacy but also promotes a more informed and proactive approach to online security.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-1030-supporting-decentralization-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-1030-supporting-decentralization-12\"></a><strong>Supporting Decentralization</strong></h2>\n<p>NetSepio champions decentralization through several key initiatives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Decentralized VPN and Wi-Fi Technologies</strong>: Our integration of decentralized VPN and Wi-Fi technologies fosters a resilient and distributed network. This approach reduces reliance on centralized infrastructure and enhances the overall reliability of internet access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Community Participation</strong>: We encourage community involvement by allowing individuals to run nodes and contribute to the network. This collaborative ecosystem helps maintain a robust and decentralized internet infrastructure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Resilient Connectivity</strong>: By developing decentralized Wi-Fi hotspots and VPN nodes, NetSepio ensures that connectivity remains unaffected by centralized failures or government-imposed shutdowns. This distributed approach supports a more stable and reliable internet experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promoting Decentralized Infrastructure</strong>: Through DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), we are building a global network of nodes that enhances internet reliability and democratizes access. This infrastructure supports the principles of decentralization and user empowerment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NetSepio’s efforts in supporting decentralization are reflected in our commitment to creating a robust, censorship-resistant network. By integrating decentralized technologies and promoting community engagement, we contribute to a more resilient and equitable digital landscape.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-1030-team-information-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-1030-team-information-13\"></a><strong>Team Information</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shachindra — CEO and Founder:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/shachindra92\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Anish Mishra — CISO:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/ansrajanmishra\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ashish Gupta — Business Lead:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/ashishgupta1527\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Anshita Deshmukh — UI/UX &amp; Design:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/AnshitaDeshmukh\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shubham Prajapati — System Architecture and Code Review:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/p-shubh\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Soumalya — Blockchain Developer:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/soumalya340\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Vaibhav Gadhave — Fullstack Developer:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/vaibhavvvvv\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rushikesh Nimkar — Full Stack Developer:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Rushikeshnimkar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ashwini — Application Testing and QA</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-1030-social-proof-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-1030-social-proof-14\"></a><strong>Social Proof</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Awards:</strong> Filecoin Browser3000 hackathon, Filecoin Apollo cohort, Aptos Singapore Hackathon, IVS Crypto Demoday in Japan, Manta Network micro-grants, Soonami Venturethon, ETH SEA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Partnerships:</strong> peaq ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Verification Links:</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.akindo.io/wave-hacks/vjkjjzddvTZ74LoVD?tab=products\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Akindo Wavehacks</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/netsepio\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Filecoin Apollo cohort</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/project/netsepio\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aptos Singapore Hackathon</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/soonami_io/status/1811346244767211804\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Soonami Venturethon</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ethereum_sea/status/1824806825914769525\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ETH SEA</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peaqnetwork/status/1820754248793289214\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">peaq</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-1030-transparency-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-1030-transparency-15\"></a><strong>Transparency</strong></h2>\n<p>NetSepio commits to transparent fund usage.

It currently supports 17+ adapters, including all major GMP protocols such as Wormhole, LayerZero, Axelar, CCIP and 3 ZK light clients (Telepathy, DendrETH and Spectre).</p>\n<p>Its design focuses on 'additive security’ - enhancing cross-chain security by aggregating multiple security mechanisms, as opposed to trusting a single one.</p>\n<p>Put simply, Hashi acts as a multi-sig of bridges.</p>\n<p>Let’s imagine a user wants to send a message from chain A to chain B. To achieve this, Hashi has adapters for several oracles (including bridges, zk light clients, networks of validators…):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user initiates the transaction</li>\n<li>Hashi checks that the request exists in Chain A through the selected oracles</li>\n<li>In Chain B, Hashi waits for the selected oracles to reach the consensus</li>\n<li>When a majority of oracles validate the message, the message is approved</li>\n<li>Hashi activates the target contract (which for example could be a cross-chain token transfer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only way for such a system to fail would be attacking simultaneously all the selected cross-chain rails in a coordinated way!</p>\n<p>To extend its capabilities, we launched Hashi Everywhere, an initiative that enables the relaying of block headers across any chain. Hashi Everywhere allows for the use of storage proofs and access to the cross-chain state of contracts</p>\n<p>Hashi’s vision for the multi-chain world is to eliminate bridge hacks, just as multi-sig smart accounts enhance security for user funds compared to EOA wallets.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, we need a paradigm shift in how we approach cross-chain state validation.</p>\n<p>Apart from pushing cross-chain messages via multiple sources, Hashi’s block header relay feature can become a game changer for cross-chain applications.<br>\nUsing multiple adapters (ZK light clients and GMP bridges), Hashi periodically relays block headers from any chain to any other, allowing application developers to ‘cross-check’ the state of a remote chain. The state (finalized block header) of a remote chain is the ultimate source of truth for the network.</p>\n<p>Our ultimate goal is to provide developers with credibly neutral access to cross-chain state and facilitate users adopting additive cross-chain security while maintaining Hashi as a public good.</p>\n<p>Recently, Hashi has successfully undergone three comprehensive <a href=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi/v0.2/audit-report\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">security audits</a>, ensuring the security and integrity of Hashi’s infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Repository:</strong></p>\n<aside class=\"onebox githubrepo\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/gnosis/hashi\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/gnosis/hashi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\" data-github-private-repo=\"false\">\n  <img width=\"690\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/6e98066839f6d3d48ff9f86e014416b31f22a090_2_690x344.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EAEBED\">\n\n  <h3><a href=\"https://github.com/gnosis/hashi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - gnosis/hashi: An EVM hash oracle aggregator</a></h3>\n\n    <p><span class=\"github-repo-description\">An EVM hash oracle aggregator</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/ec3a06f14b99c936e0211616325bdb044001a293_2_500x500.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"080808\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/original/1X/46ff363e24853180271c1713e01c3f5765e08568.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F7F8\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Introduction | hashi</a></h3>\n\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-budget-breakdown-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-budget-breakdown-1\"></a><strong>Budget Breakdown</strong></h3>\n<p>Milestone 1: $60,000 - Deployment on Multiple Chains (Target: Q4 2024)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expected Outcome</strong>:<br>\nThe deployment of Hashi across seven Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains will expand its reach and utility across various blockchain ecosystems. This milestone includes the initiation of block header relays between blockchains, utilizing multiple zk light clients and General Message Passing bridges simultaneously.<br>\nThe chains targeted for this deployment include Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Smart Chain, and Base.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cost Breakdown</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gas Costs</strong>:<br>\nThe following examples provide an idea of the gas costs.<br>\nThe average gas cost per route (Chain A → Chain B) per month, using a single oracle, is approximately 0.0638 ETH.<br>\nFor ten routes using two oracles, the gas cost per month is estimated at 1.2768 ETH. With the Ether price as of August 21st at $2601, this equates to approximately $3320.89 per month for the ten routes.<br>\nOver three months, a setup with two oracles covering ten routes, in gas costs alone would amount to approximately $9,962.67, with fluctuations in ETH price and gas market conditions potentially affecting these costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deployment and Configuration</strong>:<br>\nThis includes the work of a DevOps engineer responsible for deploying and configuring the contracts and off-chain components required for message relaying across the supported chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hashi Explorer Integration</strong>:<br>\nAs part of the deployment, messages relayed across chains will be integrated into the Hashi Explorer, providing developers with easy access to real-time message status. This step enhances the usability of Hashi for developers and improves transparency within the ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operations and Management</strong>:<br>\nOngoing operations costs include the management of off-chain infrastructure, ensuring that the relaying of messages and block headers remains secure, reliable, and consistent across all supported chains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given these costs and operational requirements, we have estimated a $60,000 budget allocation for this milestone, ensuring that Hashi is effectively deployed and maintained across multiple chains.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Milestone 2: $40,000 - Gas Cost Optimization (Target: Q1 2025)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expected Outcome</strong>:<br>\nThis milestone focuses on optimizing gas costs by off-loading certain operations from the mainnet to verifiable off-chain computing solutions such as zkVMs and teeVMs. These optimizations will help reduce the operational costs associated with cross-chain transactions, making Hashi more accessible and cost-effective for users while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<p><strong>R&amp;D Focus</strong>:<br>\nThis optimization task will require R&amp;D work, involving two FTEs. They will focus on designing, testing, and implementing these off-chain computing solutions to ensure that they effectively reduce gas costs without compromising security.<br>\nThe $40,000 budget is allocated to operational costs and funding associated with this R&amp;D effort. The outcome of this milestone is expected to significantly enhance the efficiency and scalability of Hashi, positioning it as a more sustainable solution for cross-chain transactions in the long term.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Funding Requested: $100,000</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Plans should you fall below, reach, or exceed funding goals</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Below Funding Goals</strong>: If the funding falls below the target, priority will be given to relaying block headers from chain to chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Meet Funding Goals</strong>: All planned milestones will proceed as outlined, ensuring the broad deployment, and cost optimizations of Hashi.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exceed Funding Goal</strong>s: Should the funding exceed the target, additional resources will be allocated towards expanding the scope of deployment to include more chains, improving the developer tools and community engagement, and increasing the frequency of block header relays. This would further improve the robustness and adoption of Hashi across the cross-chain ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\"></a><strong>Impact Measurement and Reporting</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Inputs &gt; Activities &gt; Outputs &gt; Outcomes &gt; Long Term Impact</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Short-term Outcomes (0-3 months):</strong></p>\n<p>Completion of Initial Milestones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial deployment across multiple Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains to begin, with block header relays initiated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mid-term Outcomes (3-6+ months):</strong></p>\n<p>Increased Adoption and Engagement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hashi will be operational across seven Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains, providing secure cross-chain communication.</li>\n<li>We anticipate a growing number of developers and projects integrating Hashi into their cross-chain protocols, driven by the additive security and flexibility offered.</li>\n<li>The implementation of gas cost optimization will further reduce the barriers to adoption, making Hashi more cost-effective and accessible, leading to higher user engagement and increased adoption rates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Long-term Impact (5+ years):</strong></p>\n<p>Establishment as a Cross-Chain Security Standard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We aim to make Hashi a widely recognized standard for secure cross-chain communication, with broad adoption across multiple blockchain ecosystems.</li>\n<li>Over the next five years, we expect Hashi to be integral to the security infrastructure of many leading blockchains, ensuring a more secure, future-proof and vendor-lock-in-free ecosystem.</li>\n<li>The long-term impact includes setting a new benchmark for cross-chain security, reducing the frequency and severity of cross-chain exploits, and fostering trust and reliability in multi-chain environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcomes Measurement:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quantitative Metrics</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Number of Chains Integrated: Tracking the number of chains where Hashi is deployed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cross-Chain Messages Relayed: Measuring the volume of cross-chain messages / block-header relays handled by Hashi, indicating its usage and reliability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User Engagement: Monitoring the number of developers and projects actively using Hashi.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Qualitative Metrics</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>User Feedback: Collect feedback from developers to assess satisfaction with Hashi’s integration and functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Community Growth: Evaluate the growth of the Hashi community, including participation in discussions, and contributions to the project’s development.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tools for Measurement</strong>:<br>\nHashi Explorer: We developed and launched the initial version of the Hashi Explorer, a tool designed to oversee and monitor the validation progress of cross-chain transactions. In time, the explorer will be used also to monitor the relay of block headers across chains, user interactions, and transaction volumes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach will allow us to track and report both the immediate and long-term impacts of Hashi, providing clear evidence of the project’s success and possible areas for future improvement.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-interim-reporting-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-interim-reporting-3\"></a><strong>Interim Reporting</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Regular Updates:</strong><br>\nWe will provide updates on our progress on a quarterly basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone Verification:</strong><br>\nEach milestone will be verified through progress reports.

To maintain its accessibility and benefit to the broader community, we have chosen to operate Hashi through grant funding, ensuring that it remains free to use for developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Grants-Focused Approach</strong><br>\nAs of today, Hashi does not generate revenue through product sales, subscriptions, or fees. Instead, our financial sustainability relies on securing grants from key players in the cross-chain space. This strategy allows us to continue developing and enhancing Hashi without imposing costs on the community, ensuring that it remains a public good accessible to all.</p>\n<p>We will continue to pursue grant opportunities from organizations and initiatives that align with our vision of secure and decentralized cross-chain communication. These grants will be crucial in funding ongoing development, maintenance, and expansion efforts, allowing us to scale Hashi and integrate it across more chains.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic Partnerships</strong><br>\nWe have established significant collaborations with major industry players.<br>\nHashi is being integrated for its credibly neutral, secure interoperability across chains, within solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OWsJCyW2g4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Safe</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.key.space/syncing-other-l1#proof-of-concept\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">KeySpace</a> by Coinbase Wallet.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-case-studies-and-testimonials-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-case-studies-and-testimonials-5\"></a><strong>Case Studies and Testimonials</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Gathering Feedback:</strong></p>\n<p>We will collect feedback by creating dedicated Telegram groups, allowing us to engage directly with developers and users who are actively integrating or using Hashi. This approach has proven effective in the past, enabling us to gather real-time insights, address any concerns, and understand the needs of our community.</p>\n<p><strong>Showcasing Success:</strong></p>\n<p>The feedback and testimonials collected will be compiled and presented through our quarterly reports.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-advancing-values-of-freedom-and-privacy-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-advancing-values-of-freedom-and-privacy-6\"></a><strong>Advancing Values of Freedom and Privacy</strong></h3>\n<p>Hashi advances the value of freedom by empowering users and developers to conduct cross-chain operations securely and flexibly.<br>\nBy allowing the easy configuration of setups with multiple cross-chain solutions, Hashi gives developers the freedom to choose the security mechanisms that best suit their needs. Additionally, Hashi enables seamless switching between different cross-chain solutions, ensuring that developers are not locked into any single provider and can adapt their security setup as needed.</p>\n<p>While Hashi is not specifically a privacy-oriented solution, its focus on enhancing security and flexibility supports the broader value of freedom in the cross-chain ecosystem. Users can operate with greater confidence, knowing that their cross-chain transactions are protected by a robust, configurable framework that adapts to evolving security needs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-supporting-decentralization-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-supporting-decentralization-7\"></a><strong>Supporting Decentralization</strong></h3>\n<p>Hashi inherently supports decentralization by actively promoting the use of multiple cross-chain solutions and security systems, as opposed to trusting a single entity.<br>\nInstead of relying on a single provider, Hashi’s framework allows users to use simultaneously various cross-chain protocols, reducing the risks associated with vendor lock-in, potential vulnerabilities, and the inability to adapt to changing security needs.<br>\nThis approach prevents single points of control or failure from compromising the integrity of cross-chain operations.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-team-information-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-team-information-8\"></a><strong>Team Information</strong></h3>\n<p>Our team comprises six people, including two tech leads, one senior engineer, one full-stack engineer, one devops engineer and one project manager and has a proven track record in developing cross-chain solutions.</p>\n<p>It is led by Georgios Gontikas and Thomas Bertani.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/geogont\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Georgios</a> has been active in the industry since 2017.

It has always been permissively open-source (MIT License) and credibly neutral (no VC funding or quid-pro-quo funding).</p>\n<p><strong>Public Repository:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethers on GitHub</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-989-budget-breakdown-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-989-budget-breakdown-1\"></a><strong>Budget Breakdown</strong></h3>\n<p>The budget for Ethers tends to be an on-going process, still being established. It is entirely managed by a single person, and an additional developer is being added to assist. But as such, there is no accounting team or marketing team (and hence no marketing budget).</p>\n<p>Historically, all funding went into a central treasury, from which a salary of $24k/year was paid to RicMoo for the last few years (prior to that it was entirely pro bono in his spare time ;)). This year, the salary will be increased, likely to around $120k/year.</p>\n<p>Funding otherwise is spent on server resources, software licenses, corporate obligations, and necessary travel.</p>\n<p>Milestones are also fluid, as Ethers follows trends in the Ethereum ecosystem. For example, a month prior to BLOb support being added, there would have been no milestone for BLObs, since they were unknown at the time.</p>\n<p>General milestones however include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assistance; via Discord, GitHub and other channels, a significant amount of time is used helping individuals both with ethers and general blockchain concepts and development</li>\n<li>Improving Documentations</li>\n<li>Improving performance</li>\n<li>Creating applications on top of Ethers to ensure it still meets the needs of developers</li>\n<li>Responding to GitHub issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Funding Requested: $ / ETH</strong></p>\n<p>There is no set amount in mind, but $1k/mo towards server costs would be wonderful as well as anything to help offset salaries drawn from the treasury would be nice. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p><strong>Plans should you fall below, reach or exceed funding goals:</strong></p>\n<p>Ethers does receive funding from a variety of sources, so regardless of funding, Ethers will continue to best library it can be. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-989-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-989-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\"></a><strong>Impact Measurement and Reporting</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Short-term Outcomes (0-3 months):</strong></p>\n<p>The main short-term deliverables are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First-class Account Abstract support (using a smart-contract wallet should be no different than using an EOA or Ledger)</li>\n<li>Performance improvements</li>\n<li>Full ENSv2 support</li>\n<li>Automatic socket (WebSocket and IPC) re-subscription on disconnect</li>\n<li>Many smaller feature requests which exist on the GitHub repository</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mid-term Outcomes (3-6+ months):</strong></p>\n<p>While market-share has never been a goal of Ethers, a core advantage of Ethers has been its documentation, which will receive a significant increase in time and resources. A second developer has been tagged to help out expand the docs and add more examples. Excellent documentation helps engagement, adoption and growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Impact (5+ years):</strong></p>\n<p>Looking 5 years into the future is beyond difficult, but a lot of the historic funding Ethers has received has gone into a treasury to ensure Ethers can thrive and hire additional help as required, even during times where it is difficult to acquire additional funding.</p>\n<p>The goal of Ethers has always been just to provide the best possible library for its purpose. It was created by RicMoo, for RicMoo. So, it will continue being a tool maintained by someone who uses it extensively himself. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes Measurement:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics are hard for open-source software, but some (albeit fairly weak signal) metrics include monthly downloads (currently 5.4m/month) and GitHub stars (currently 7,900).

Most of the funds currently live at donations.ethers.eth, but a few other accounts are used as well (mostly due to legacy programs which make changing it difficult).</p>\n<p>Generally, sufficient assets from any donation are sold for fiat (via CEX) to cover tax obligations. USDC (DAI and other stable coins) is usually used first, for paying server fees, infrastructure and software licenses. Governance tokens are generally kept (aside from tax obligations) in the treasury and not sold; any significant sale of governance tokens would be discussed with the relevant teams in advance.</p>\n<p>Salaries and services are paid for in fiat from a Canadian bank, held under the “Genetic Mistakes Software Inc” corporation, a company started by RicMoo in 2011, which is also the target of any assets converted via the CEX.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-989-other-funding-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-989-other-funding-11\"></a><strong>Other funding</strong></h3>\n<p>Ethers has received many forms of funding over its 6 years, since 2018.

Owning such hardware is not feasible for everyone. So, if one is serious about verifiable computing, she has to either rely on centralized providers(e.g. AWS instances) or start her own prove-maxi network. Centralization has its own drawbacks, so better to focus on decentralized options instead. To meet the compute needs of clients and serve proving jobs, one would need a network of provider PCs whose hardware specs are maxed-out. Getting such a network of expensive gadgets up, however, requires a complex set of incentives to keep the nodes busy. This application entry deviates from the usual solutions and proposes a parallel proving scheme to execute zkVM programs on computationally weak nodes.<br>\nzkVM proving is only feasible on  strong hardware. With weak specced hardware as worker nodes, hopes for generating ZK proofs start to fade away quickly. But not completely! The solution turns out, is to divide the task and prove individual sub-tasks parallely. Risc0 allows for the programs building on top of its SDK, to customize the degree to which proving stresses the hardware. The customization follows the natural limitation set by the finite fields used for generating proofs. As you may already know, Risc0 uses STARKs for proof generation and it has to stay efficient while mathematically consistent for yielding provable programs. This forces Risc0 to choose fields whose ability to generate proofs is capped at a certain number of operations(16.78M as of today). But real world programs are larger and so Risc0 team had to find a way to make proving of infinitely size programs possible. This unfortunate(or fortunate in our case) limitation enables dividing a zkVM program into several items(called segments in Risc0 jargon) and proving them one by one. The final proof is then obtained by aggregating individual proofs. We have run experiments and have found out that by customizing the segment size to ranges that make proving possible on systems with 4-8GB of memory, we can capitalize on available stock hardware and prove zkVM programs in a parallel manner while keeping the overhead manageable. This gotcha seems to eliminate the need for forming a network off elite PCs.<br>\nzkVM proving finds and important application in scaling the Ethereum network. L2 zkRollups need to generate proofs that ensure their transactions are valid. Each proof is then posted to the Ethereum network(the L1) for verification. This scheme is a promising approach to scale Ethereum’s transaction throughput. The agent responsible for generating proofs in zkRollups is called the <em>sequencer</em>. Its main role is to batch L2 transactions and have them sent for L1 verification. Being a critical part of zkRollups, the sequencer routines require strong computers to run as expected. Right now, almost all of the mainstream L2 zkRollups use centralized infra(e.g. strong AWS instances) to generate proofs. We, however, would like to test a scenario where the proving is done on stock hardware(i.e. 8+ years old CPU, 8 GB RAM). Our goal is close on in/beat 5 minutes finality of Linea sequencer proving(as a L2 zkRollup example). If successful, we expect to secure big performance gains while enjoying decentralization guarantees obtained by proving jobs on a p2p network.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Repository:</strong> [<a href=\"https://github.com/WholesumNet\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">WholesumNet · GitHub</a>]</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-953-budget-breakdown-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-953-budget-breakdown-1\"></a><strong>Budget Breakdown</strong></h3>\n<p>We hope to raise at least <strong>4 * $5,000 = $20,000</strong>  that would support 1 full-time developer for the duration of the test(~4 months).</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1</strong>:<br>\nDuration: 45 days<br>\nBudget: $7,500<br>\nGoals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design a network protocol for proving zkVM programs</li>\n<li>Reach out to Golem, Swarm, … for node(worker) inclusion and partnering with them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deliverables:<br>\nThe action plan and protocol specifications ready for implementation</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2</strong>:<br>\nDuration: 45 days<br>\nBudget: $7,500<br>\nGoals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Come up with Risc0 transformers that emulate Linea/… sequencer proving</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deliverables:<br>\nA protocol implemented into client and server applications, written in Rust</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3</strong>:<br>\nDuration: 30 days<br>\nBudget: $5,000<br>\nGoals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To test the whole setup and see if it works</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deliverables:<br>\nResults and reports of how the test went</p>\n<p><strong>Funding Requested: $20,000</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Plans should you fall below, reach or exceed funding goals:</strong><br>\nFall below:<br>\nWe are grateful for any amount we raise here and won’t quit.</p>\n<p>Reach:<br>\nWe go as planned.</p>\n<p>Exceed:<br>\nWe would bring in additional brains.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-953-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-953-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\"></a><strong>Impact Measurement and Reporting</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Inputs &gt; Activities &gt; Outputs &gt; Outcomes &gt; Long Term Impact</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Short-term Outcomes (0-3 months):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We expect to have transformed a typical Linea(or other L2 zkRollup) sequencer proving job to the format Risc0 zkVM accepts by the end of milestone 2.

Generally, I consider myself someone interested in computers. I have been active in computing industry since 2010. I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from computer vision to UX research. I got into crypto in 2020 when I found myself in need of raising funds for my EBook reading software called “readaratus”. Ran out of money and so decided to do freelance jobs and there I found out about Gitcoin grants and hackathoons. Jumped in and won some hackatoons(some Golem ones too) and got myself partially fed for a year or so. Meanwhile, I joined a Gitcoin workstream project called “dCompass” in late 2021 that aimed to revamp Gitcoin Quests. At dCompass, I did studies about user experience of Quests and wrote technical reports and laid out a vision for an interactive learning environment. dCompass failed to raise funding and was shut down in Q2 2022. It was then in summer 2022 that I was offered a grant from the Swarm team to join forces of dStorage(Swarm) and dCompute(Golem) networks in an interoperability attempt to create a world computer called “Sovr project”. Sovr was shut down later in Q2 2023 due to lack of interest from developers to use our tooling.

Lotteries are one of them, but the way they work right now make them easily manipulable, corruptible or inefficient when allocating resources. We are blending lotteries with Ethereum values to make them a great source of fairly and transparently distributed funding for public goods.</p>\n<p>To make lotteries fair, we’re researching and implementing onchain randomness technology. For our current version, we’re using new drand scheme that uses BLS on BN254 instead of BLS12-381 to make <a href=\"https://drand.love\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">drand</a> available <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@kevincharm/rJA4r_Iia\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">on any EVM</a> - a contribution done by our contributors. For the picking of winning numbers, we borrow some lesser-known algorithms from the latest in cryptography (e.g., stateless shuffles, grand product check) to achieve gas-efficient lotteries for both users and operators. More specifically, we’re using the Feistel Shuffle for this purpose.

These methods can (and will) be used at deeper levels of the tech stack (even the Ethereum Base Layer, read about Verfiable Delay Functions). We also believe that there’s a centralisation risk in relying on sponsors to fund public goods. They can indirectly define what are public goods and decide which ones are being funded.

If we exceed our funding goals we’ll just do more of the above mentioned milestones to get a little closer to financial sustainability.</p>\n<p>We have a long backlog of product ideas, so we will keep working on them.

But if we can implement an easy-to-use UI more publishers will compete for running ads which will increase prices.</li>\n<li><strong>Product growth</strong>: Driving product growth in the short term helps us justifying continuing to work on Kiwi News generally.</li>\n<li><strong>Protocol hardening</strong>: At the moment, the contributor that runs our Dune Dashboard cannot sync his node because of the bug. Once we fix it, he can work more independently again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Mid-term Outcomes (3-6+ months):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>[Describe the anticipated outcomes from the project, such as increased user engagement, adoption rates, or community growth.]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The onchain ads UI will validate whether there is actual demand for onchain ads and if it makes sense to spend more time on this.</p>\n<p>Generaly speaking, reaching more sustainable revenue model would let us focus more on product and community activation. That would lead to better user engagement, which - in our case - leads to more signal and better content and commments shared on our platform.</p>\n<p>That in turn leads to more growth, since for Kiwi, our content and the community is what makes people pay for the app.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Impact (5+ years):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>[Describe the long-term vision for your project, including how it will create lasting changes and benefits for the community or ecosystem.]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Kiwi reaches more adoption, it will serve as a forum for nuanced conversations about Ethereum. We believe that - just like Hacker News keeps web2 community in check - Kiwi could do the same for Ethereum.</p>\n<p>That would lead to less builders following hype, more scrutinity for bad actors and making it harder to run scams.</p>\n<p>Even if some users wouldn’t read Kiwi everyday, we can serve as a tool for double-checking current hypes, since users’ comments and different type of content shared on Kiwi can help to get out of the social bubbles.</p>\n<p>Plus Kiwi could keep serving as a repository of quality links and conversations. Since Google isn’t a good search engine for crypto, we could build one based on Kiwi’s content.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes Measurement:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>[Explain how you will measure the outcomes and impact of your project, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Include specific metrics or indicators you will use, such as user engagement, adoption rates, community impact, and user satisfaction. Also share the tools you’ll be using for this purpose.]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main goal for now is getting to financial sustainability for us two co-founders as this will guarantee us to run the project over the long term. So all outcome measures are ultimately just lagging indicators to increase our income to a point where it becomes sustainable.</p>\n<p>Yet, our main mission is improving the Ethereum community by delivering high-quality crypto content &amp; conversations to builders.</p>\n<p>Therefore, most of our metrics are based on that goal.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Number of users clicking the links per day</strong></p>\n<p>If many people click our crypto building-related links, it means that we surface content they think is valuable.</p>\n<p>We track link clicks by adding a “<a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/outbound?url=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://news.kiwistand.com/outbound?url=</a>” param to each outbound link, and then publish the results on our stats page in <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/users\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Daily Active Devices section</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Number of users submitting, upvoting, and commenting on links</strong></p>\n<p>Every action on the protocol level takes and EIP712 signature, which means that we can easily track each submission, comment and upvote from our users.</p>\n<p>We publish the results on our <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/users\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">User stats page</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Number of links stored on the protocol</strong></p>\n<p>If the links and comments are high-quality and follow our <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/guidelines\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">guidelines</a>, the more content, the better. Therefore we track this number on a <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/basics\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cumulative Total Messages chart</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Number of people who paid to use the product</strong></p>\n<p>At this point people can use Kiwi for free by following our bots, RSS feeds or the alt client. But for us the best signal is when people decide to pay a few $ to use Kiwi.</p>\n<p>Therefore we track this number by following our <a href=\"https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x66747bdc903d17c586fa09ee5d6b54cc85bbea45\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kiwi Pass NFT contract</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Adoption rate</strong></p>\n<p>We track how many users who minted a Kiwi Pass are active.

We make around $500/month from Kiwi Pass Sales, and made $1,800 from organizing two writing contests. We are in talks with 5 different projects to organize more contests.</p>\n<p>To become sustainable, we need to increase our revenue by a lot. We are very lean and - apart from running servers - we just have to pay ourselves some basic salary.</p>\n<p>The basic salary has to cover expenses such as rent, food, and so on, which is around $5,000/month before taxes. Half of it goes to tax, social insurances, etc.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we need around $10,000/month to be able to keep on working full-time on Kiwi without having to take some extra gigs.</p>\n<p>We are exploring different models.</p>\n<p>We don’t want to take VC funding because we believe that projects such as Kiwi should stay credibly neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>So we are exploring ideas such as:</strong><br>\na) ads,<br>\nb) subscription model,<br>\nc) user donations,<br>\nd) job board,</p>\n<p>and a few others.</p>\n<p>We’re super serious about financial sustainability and talk about it a lot on our semi-public Telegram channel for Kiwi Pass holders.

Kiwi, contrarily to X or HN, will always remain vibrant and open to innovation because this is how it was architected. The operators of HN and X will always remain powerful because they monopolize the software that their community uses to communicate. We think this is unaceptable and so we want to demonstrate with Kiwi that an alternative model is possible.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-949-supporting-decentralization-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-949-supporting-decentralization-7\"></a><strong>Supporting Decentralization</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re supporting decentralization in a few ways:</p>\n<p><strong>P2P Protocol</strong>.

We’re also sharing our revenue with the top posting accounts. It’s contrary to the traditional web2 social model where users post content so that the platform can sell more ads.</p>\n<p><strong>Open-source</strong>. Kiwi’s entire codebase, including the front-end, back-end, and protocol, is open-source. This allows anyone in the community to fork the project, contribute to its development, or create their own versions of Kiwi. So even if we are not around, people can keep developing the project.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-949-team-information-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-949-team-information-8\"></a><strong>Team Information</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Tim Daubenschutz</strong><br>\n<em>(Tech &amp; Product)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worked on the precursor of NFTs @ <a href=\"https://github.com/ascribe/onion\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ascribe.io</a> in 2015,</li>\n<li>Co-created Soulbound tokens.

We emerged from conversations in the EthFinance and EthStaker communities, and aim to provide credibly neutral infrastructure for the Ethereum staking ecosystem. The relay has been in continuous operation for nearly 2 years and serves over 850,000 validators, including many solo stakers, Rocketpool users, and large professional staking operations. Between 1-5% of all Ethereum mainnet blocks pass through Aestus.</p>\n<p>MEV remains a valuable part of revenue for Ethereum PoS consensus participants, but it is critical to the long-term health of the network that we minimize centralization pressures and ensure MEV profits are equitably distributed amongst all validators. Aestus operates as a public good, free from commercial interests and adhering to principles of credible neutrality.</p>\n<p>Aestus was originally imagined to be a short-term enterprise destined only to fill a short-term gap between the Merge and the development of enshrined proposer-builder separation (“ePBS”). This pathway to an in-protocol solution has been significantly more challenging than initially anticipated and remains somewhat elusive. Aestus intends to remain in operation until we outlive our purpose.</p>\n<p>Recently, there has been considerable interest and extensive research towards improving Ethereum UI/UX by supporting cross-chain (L2) atomic synchronicity, including instantaneous inclusion and execution guarantees (preconfs), and using L1 validators to secure L2s.

Our flagship products include our production-capable beacon chain and validator client. Additionally, we maintain public repositories of useful tools for public use, such as BLS, SSZ, Discv5, Gossipsub, and Noise. Our work contributes to the backbone infrastructure required to keep the Ethereum blockchain progressing within the rules as defined by the specification. Lodestar’s niche is its implementation language, TypeScript. Our software and tooling are uniquely situated for researchers and developers for rapid prototyping, including our Prover, a verified web3 provider using light clients to increase decentralization and security of the JSON-RPC. Millions of developers around the world are familiar with TypeScript, and Lodestar’s high-quality codebases serve as excellent introductions to the Ethereum world, with the goal of increasing client diversity and attracting new talent. Our project does not generate any revenue and relies on funding from open-source donations and foundations to continue developing in the core Ethereum ecosystem. Our repository and supporting libraries are all open source and mostly licensed under Apache 2.0.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Repository:</strong></p><aside class=\"onebox githubrepo\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\" data-github-private-repo=\"false\">\n  <img width=\"690\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/3a4c3cccfa446d7968f7540221f2cef97d143348_2_690x344.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"F1F3F3\">\n\n  <h3><a href=\"https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - ChainSafe/lodestar: 🌟 TypeScript Implementation of Ethereum Consensus</a></h3>\n\n    <p><span class=\"github-repo-description\">🌟 TypeScript Implementation of Ethereum Consensus</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<h3><a name=\"p-919-budget-breakdown-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-919-budget-breakdown-1\"></a><strong>Budget Breakdown</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Funding Requested:</strong><br>\nThe operating costs to run this program are approximately USD $1.9m per year.

As we continue to evolve, it’s important for us to align Octant’s processes and mechanisms with our values and mission. We’ve recently taken a closer look at how we can improve the way we measure and present the success of the projects we support, and we want to share our intentions and upcoming changes with you.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-understanding-octants-impact-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-understanding-octants-impact-2\"></a>Understanding Octant’s Impact</h3>\n<p>One of our core goals is to ensure that Octant is not just a platform for funding public goods but also a space where the impact of these projects is clearly visible and easily understood. We want to make sure that the projects you choose to support when you donate your Octant rewards are making a tangible difference, and that this difference is communicated effectively. To do this, we’ve focused on two key areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clearer Reporting Requirements</strong>: Based on feedback conducted in a recent survey, we’re refining how projects report their progress and outcomes. This will help us, and participating projects, track the effectiveness and impact of their work more accurately.</li>\n<li><strong>Better User Support</strong>: We want to provide you with the tools and information you need to make informed decisions. By improving what’s displayed in the Octant app, we’re aiming to make your experience smoother and more transparent.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-changes-to-reporting-requirements-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-changes-to-reporting-requirements-3\"></a>Changes to Reporting Requirements</h3>\n<p>From our recent survey, we’ve gathered valuable insights into what you care most about when it comes to the projects on Octant. Here’s what we learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Highest Importance</strong>: Potential Impact and Previous Impact of projects are what you value the most. These metrics are critical in helping you decide where to allocate your support, so we’ll be making sure these are prominently displayed when you first look at projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium Importance</strong>: Details like the team’s background, how funds are being used, and development activity are also important. These will be available on each project’s page within Octant, giving you the context you need without overwhelming the initial decision-making process.</li>\n<li><strong>Lower Importance</strong>: Metrics like sustainability plans, community support, governance structures, and user testimonials were ranked lower. These will still be available but might be housed in more specialized sections, or through tools like KarmaGap for those who want to dive deeper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based upon these results, we will be looking to implement many of these these features into the Octant app over the coming epochs.</p>\n<p>We have already implemented some changes for projects that have received funding previously.  Please scroll down through this page and be sure to check the template that corresponds to your project here: <a href=\"https://docs.octant.app/reporting-templates.html#project-proposal-template\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Octant Docs</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-why-these-changes-matter-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-why-these-changes-matter-4\"></a>Why These Changes Matter</h3>\n<p>By focusing on what’s most important, we can ensure that the projects funded through Octant are impactful and aligned with the values of our community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For Recently Funded Projects</strong>: Reporting requirements will start light, focusing on early outputs. As projects progress, their reporting will shift to include more detailed outcomes and impact assessments.</li>\n<li><strong>For Long-Running Projects</strong>: Those that have received funding before the most recent round,  they will have stricter reporting requirements, focusing on not just outputs, but the outcomes of those outputs. This ensures that projects are not only delivering on their promises but are also growing and evolving in ways that benefit the broader community.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-your-opinion-matters-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-your-opinion-matters-5\"></a>Your Opinion Matters</h3>\n<p>We’re committed to making Octant a platform where your voice matters. We’re listening closely in how you think we can improve Octant.  Through surveys, direct 1 on 1’s, and consistent discussion on our governance board, we’re very confident that Octant has a bright future because of your feedback. These changes are just the beginning, and we’re really excited to continue building with you!</p>\n<p>Thank you for being an integral part of this journey.</p>\n<p>Warm regards,</p>\n<p>The Octant Team</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/improving-our-processes-for-octant-recipients/409\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/improving-our-processes-for-octant-recipients/409","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 22:50:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-409"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/improving-our-processes-for-octant-recipients/409.rss","#text":"Improving Our Processes For Octant Recipients"},"filter":false},{"title":"Mechanism Institute: Democratizing Cryptoeconomics","dc:creator":"sofiacos","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/original/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/utLfUYdkuqNuev7wxEdTeoXib3w.png?dl=1\" title=\"hero 2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_690x175.png\" alt=\"hero 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"utLfUYdkuqNuev7wxEdTeoXib3w\" width=\"690\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_690x175.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_1035x262.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_1380x350.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"999894\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-847-project-description-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-847-project-description-1\"></a><strong>Project Description</strong></h2>\n<p>Mechanism Institute is a research initiative that shapes building blocks for digital-age institutions.

In due time, if a governance structure can be battle tested and the team is confident, we see the community taking more and more ownership over key aspects of Octant, maybe everything in total minus ownership of staking… But 1 step at a time <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>So we started out with that intention, to design a governance framework that would empower our community to initially govern the recent Community Fund.  What began as a simple experiment to give more power to our community has lead to a lot of learnings for the Octant core team in how we can improve the next version of this moving forward.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"chronology-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#chronology-2\"></a>Chronology</h3>\n<p>This first started with bringing together the contributors in January, where we had our first call mid February, &amp; with calls taking place every 2 weeks to 1 month.  Organization over the first rounds operation began to formalize in March, with key pieces coming together (roles, Charmverse setup etc) in April.  In May, we opened up applications to the public for 3 key directives (<a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/octant-community-fund/octant-community-fund-hq-8956739992421918\">Marketing, Tooling, &amp; Public Goods ecosystem collaboration</a>), and in early June the final votes were approved for 11 applicants.  47.99 ETH has been awarded, and all projects are moving forward with their work.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"group-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#group-3\"></a>Group</h3>\n<p>Before this process began, we had a tremendous amount of support from key allies in the space, and naturally, inviting many of them to join us in the development of this framework made sense.  Their expertise in different areas cannot be understated, which further cemented my feelings in what is the superpower of web3, <em><strong>‘diversity’</strong></em>. One of the problems from managing this, was that we didn’t have a clear idea in what the optimal group size would be.  So the group grew to almost 20 people!  Whenever you have a large group like this, coordination can be quite tricky, so participation within the monthly or bi monthly calls began to fluctuate.  But nevertheless, with a largely committed group. it ended up working out well.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"timing-scope-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#timing-scope-4\"></a>Timing &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>I as the core team member putting all of this together, was a bit naive in how long some of these processes can ultimately take.  Taking a step back, it was not the initial intention to have this group of individuals being the driving force behind decision-making over how the first round of funds would be distributed.  Instead, this group was brought together to design a broader community governance framework so that the Octant community (at least at a larger scale than this group) could participate in some capacity in the first round.</p>\n<p>This work takes a while, and definitely not something that you can whip up quickly, without potential problems rearing their faces.  So in March, with the realization that staking rewards coming in and ready to allocate May 1st, we pivoted from the longer term design, to this group being that decision-making body.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this went as well as it possibly could have.  But that isn’t to say there weren’t some drawbacks.  Naturally, when you bring a group in for a different intention, there are going to be issues with what some of the members had committed to, both in timing, and requirements.  With that in mind, I cannot express my gratitude enough for the flexibility, and the work, that each of these members had contributed.  They made for a very productive first round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"evolution-moving-forward-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#evolution-moving-forward-5\"></a>Evolution Moving Forward</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to understand where we are now is that Octant governance is moving on two separate tracks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We are going to continue running Octant Community Fund rounds, with the next taking place in October/November.  Changes with this upcoming round will include: holding an open process for community members to participate in being on the next council, while getting really clear on expectations for those who participate next round.  Additionally, we’ll be refining what will be the directives of intent for proposals.  Some of that will be based upon early learnings in what was effective from this first round.  Lastly it’s worth noting that the treasury for this next round will be ~2x what it was this first round.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Separately, <a href=\"https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/\">Hats Protocol</a> a recent grantee, will collaborate with key stakeholders and the core team to resume the initial efforts of designing a long-term governance structure for the Octant community. Their work will focus on supporting Octant’s journey towards progressive decentralization.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is much more I can share about this process, but this may be a good stopping point for now.  I want to emphasize that we are looking interested community members to consider applying to be a part of this upcoming round.  More details will be shared on this soon!</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/reflections-from-the-first-community-fund-round/381\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/reflections-from-the-first-community-fund-round/381","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jul 2024 23:48:57 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-381"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/reflections-from-the-first-community-fund-round/381.rss","#text":"Reflections From The First Community Fund Round"},"filter":false},{"title":"About the Governance category","dc:creator":"james","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Octant is steering this ship towards more community ownership.

The reason we moved quicker than we had planned was because our last round experienced full exposure of why a plutocracy doesn’t work from a community members perspective.  Why have a system that wishes to be a platform that aggregates funds based upon user preferences if there are only a few users that actually have influence over the funds?</p>\n<p>I agree.</p>\n<p>So moving to QF, and using Gitcoin Passport was the path forward that we felt was better than remaining a plutocracy.  We did explore a lot of other options. ALOT.  Nothing else seemed to be a better alternative at this stage.  People wouldn’t be happy with getting on a call with BrightID.  People sure as hell wouldn’t be happy scanning their eyeball.  DisruptionJoe made it clear that the FDD option isn’t an option right now…</p>\n<p>So I’m here to listen, because trying to filter through comment after comment on twitter, and the sub threads that get created is really hard to manage.  Got any ideas?  Maybe creating a social graph of trust, along with Passport until we can move to what would work even better?  I’m really curious to hear your thoughts.</p>\n            <p><small>27 posts - 12 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/whats-a-good-enough-approach-for-sybils-in-the-near-future/375\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/whats-a-good-enough-approach-for-sybils-in-the-near-future/375","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 22:37:34 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-375"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/whats-a-good-enough-approach-for-sybils-in-the-near-future/375.rss","#text":"What's a good enough approach for sybil's in the near future?"},"filter":false}]}}}
