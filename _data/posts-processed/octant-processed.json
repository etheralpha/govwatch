It currently supports 17+ adapters, including all major GMP protocols such as Wormhole, LayerZero, Axelar, CCIP and 3 ZK light clients (Telepathy, DendrETH and Spectre).</p>\n<p>Its design focuses on 'additive security’ - enhancing cross-chain security by aggregating multiple security mechanisms, as opposed to trusting a single one.</p>\n<p>Put simply, Hashi acts as a multi-sig of bridges.</p>\n<p>Let’s imagine a user wants to send a message from chain A to chain B. To achieve this, Hashi has adapters for several oracles (including bridges, zk light clients, networks of validators…):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user initiates the transaction</li>\n<li>Hashi checks that the request exists in Chain A through the selected oracles</li>\n<li>In Chain B, Hashi waits for the selected oracles to reach the consensus</li>\n<li>When a majority of oracles validate the message, the message is approved</li>\n<li>Hashi activates the target contract (which for example could be a cross-chain token transfer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only way for such a system to fail would be attacking simultaneously all the selected cross-chain rails in a coordinated way!</p>\n<p>To extend its capabilities, we launched Hashi Everywhere, an initiative that enables the relaying of block headers across any chain. Hashi Everywhere allows for the use of storage proofs and access to the cross-chain state of contracts</p>\n<p>Hashi’s vision for the multi-chain world is to eliminate bridge hacks, just as multi-sig smart accounts enhance security for user funds compared to EOA wallets.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, we need a paradigm shift in how we approach cross-chain state validation.</p>\n<p>Apart from pushing cross-chain messages via multiple sources, Hashi’s block header relay feature can become a game changer for cross-chain applications.<br>\nUsing multiple adapters (ZK light clients and GMP bridges), Hashi periodically relays block headers from any chain to any other, allowing application developers to ‘cross-check’ the state of a remote chain. The state (finalized block header) of a remote chain is the ultimate source of truth for the network.</p>\n<p>Our ultimate goal is to provide developers with credibly neutral access to cross-chain state and facilitate users adopting additive cross-chain security while maintaining Hashi as a public good.</p>\n<p>Recently, Hashi has successfully undergone three comprehensive <a href=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi/v0.2/audit-report\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">security audits</a>, ensuring the security and integrity of Hashi’s infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Repository:</strong></p>\n<aside class=\"onebox githubrepo\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/gnosis/hashi\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/gnosis/hashi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\" data-github-private-repo=\"false\">\n  <img width=\"690\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/6e98066839f6d3d48ff9f86e014416b31f22a090_2_690x344.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EAEBED\">\n\n  <h3><a href=\"https://github.com/gnosis/hashi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - gnosis/hashi: An EVM hash oracle aggregator</a></h3>\n\n    <p><span class=\"github-repo-description\">An EVM hash oracle aggregator</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/ec3a06f14b99c936e0211616325bdb044001a293_2_500x500.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"080808\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/original/1X/46ff363e24853180271c1713e01c3f5765e08568.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F7F8\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Introduction | hashi</a></h3>\n\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-budget-breakdown-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-budget-breakdown-1\"></a><strong>Budget Breakdown</strong></h3>\n<p>Milestone 1: $60,000 - Deployment on Multiple Chains (Target: Q4 2024)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expected Outcome</strong>:<br>\nThe deployment of Hashi across seven Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains will expand its reach and utility across various blockchain ecosystems. This milestone includes the initiation of block header relays between blockchains, utilizing multiple zk light clients and General Message Passing bridges simultaneously.<br>\nThe chains targeted for this deployment include Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Smart Chain, and Base.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cost Breakdown</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gas Costs</strong>:<br>\nThe following examples provide an idea of the gas costs.<br>\nThe average gas cost per route (Chain A → Chain B) per month, using a single oracle, is approximately 0.0638 ETH.<br>\nFor ten routes using two oracles, the gas cost per month is estimated at 1.2768 ETH. With the Ether price as of August 21st at $2601, this equates to approximately $3320.89 per month for the ten routes.<br>\nOver three months, a setup with two oracles covering ten routes, in gas costs alone would amount to approximately $9,962.67, with fluctuations in ETH price and gas market conditions potentially affecting these costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deployment and Configuration</strong>:<br>\nThis includes the work of a DevOps engineer responsible for deploying and configuring the contracts and off-chain components required for message relaying across the supported chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hashi Explorer Integration</strong>:<br>\nAs part of the deployment, messages relayed across chains will be integrated into the Hashi Explorer, providing developers with easy access to real-time message status. This step enhances the usability of Hashi for developers and improves transparency within the ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operations and Management</strong>:<br>\nOngoing operations costs include the management of off-chain infrastructure, ensuring that the relaying of messages and block headers remains secure, reliable, and consistent across all supported chains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given these costs and operational requirements, we have estimated a $60,000 budget allocation for this milestone, ensuring that Hashi is effectively deployed and maintained across multiple chains.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Milestone 2: $40,000 - Gas Cost Optimization (Target: Q1 2025)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expected Outcome</strong>:<br>\nThis milestone focuses on optimizing gas costs by off-loading certain operations from the mainnet to verifiable off-chain computing solutions such as zkVMs and teeVMs. These optimizations will help reduce the operational costs associated with cross-chain transactions, making Hashi more accessible and cost-effective for users while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<p><strong>R&amp;D Focus</strong>:<br>\nThis optimization task will require R&amp;D work, involving two FTEs. They will focus on designing, testing, and implementing these off-chain computing solutions to ensure that they effectively reduce gas costs without compromising security.<br>\nThe $40,000 budget is allocated to operational costs and funding associated with this R&amp;D effort. The outcome of this milestone is expected to significantly enhance the efficiency and scalability of Hashi, positioning it as a more sustainable solution for cross-chain transactions in the long term.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Funding Requested: $100,000</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Plans should you fall below, reach, or exceed funding goals</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Below Funding Goals</strong>: If the funding falls below the target, priority will be given to relaying block headers from chain to chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Meet Funding Goals</strong>: All planned milestones will proceed as outlined, ensuring the broad deployment, and cost optimizations of Hashi.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exceed Funding Goal</strong>s: Should the funding exceed the target, additional resources will be allocated towards expanding the scope of deployment to include more chains, improving the developer tools and community engagement, and increasing the frequency of block header relays. This would further improve the robustness and adoption of Hashi across the cross-chain ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\"></a><strong>Impact Measurement and Reporting</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Inputs &gt; Activities &gt; Outputs &gt; Outcomes &gt; Long Term Impact</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Short-term Outcomes (0-3 months):</strong></p>\n<p>Completion of Initial Milestones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial deployment across multiple Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains to begin, with block header relays initiated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mid-term Outcomes (3-6+ months):</strong></p>\n<p>Increased Adoption and Engagement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hashi will be operational across seven Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains, providing secure cross-chain communication.</li>\n<li>We anticipate a growing number of developers and projects integrating Hashi into their cross-chain protocols, driven by the additive security and flexibility offered.</li>\n<li>The implementation of gas cost optimization will further reduce the barriers to adoption, making Hashi more cost-effective and accessible, leading to higher user engagement and increased adoption rates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Long-term Impact (5+ years):</strong></p>\n<p>Establishment as a Cross-Chain Security Standard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We aim to make Hashi a widely recognized standard for secure cross-chain communication, with broad adoption across multiple blockchain ecosystems.</li>\n<li>Over the next five years, we expect Hashi to be integral to the security infrastructure of many leading blockchains, ensuring a more secure, future-proof and vendor-lock-in-free ecosystem.</li>\n<li>The long-term impact includes setting a new benchmark for cross-chain security, reducing the frequency and severity of cross-chain exploits, and fostering trust and reliability in multi-chain environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcomes Measurement:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quantitative Metrics</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Number of Chains Integrated: Tracking the number of chains where Hashi is deployed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cross-Chain Messages Relayed: Measuring the volume of cross-chain messages / block-header relays handled by Hashi, indicating its usage and reliability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User Engagement: Monitoring the number of developers and projects actively using Hashi.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Qualitative Metrics</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>User Feedback: Collect feedback from developers to assess satisfaction with Hashi’s integration and functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Community Growth: Evaluate the growth of the Hashi community, including participation in discussions, and contributions to the project’s development.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tools for Measurement</strong>:<br>\nHashi Explorer: We developed and launched the initial version of the Hashi Explorer, a tool designed to oversee and monitor the validation progress of cross-chain transactions. In time, the explorer will be used also to monitor the relay of block headers across chains, user interactions, and transaction volumes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach will allow us to track and report both the immediate and long-term impacts of Hashi, providing clear evidence of the project’s success and possible areas for future improvement.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-interim-reporting-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-interim-reporting-3\"></a><strong>Interim Reporting</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Regular Updates:</strong><br>\nWe will provide updates on our progress on a quarterly basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone Verification:</strong><br>\nEach milestone will be verified through progress reports. These reports will document the specific deliverables associated with each milestone, providing clear evidence of their completion, the status of ongoing activities, key achievements, challenges encountered, and steps taken to address them.<br>\nFor example, the deployment of Hashi on specific chains will be supported by technical documentation and records of successful relays, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the project.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-sustainability-plan-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-sustainability-plan-4\"></a><strong>Sustainability Plan</strong></h3>\n<p>Hashi is designed as a public good, with the core mission to enable cross-chain additive security. To maintain its accessibility and benefit to the broader community, we have chosen to operate Hashi through grant funding, ensuring that it remains free to use for developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Grants-Focused Approach</strong><br>\nAs of today, Hashi does not generate revenue through product sales, subscriptions, or fees. Instead, our financial sustainability relies on securing grants from key players in the cross-chain space. This strategy allows us to continue developing and enhancing Hashi without imposing costs on the community, ensuring that it remains a public good accessible to all.</p>\n<p>We will continue to pursue grant opportunities from organizations and initiatives that align with our vision of secure and decentralized cross-chain communication. These grants will be crucial in funding ongoing development, maintenance, and expansion efforts, allowing us to scale Hashi and integrate it across more chains.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic Partnerships</strong><br>\nWe have established significant collaborations with major industry players.<br>\nHashi is being integrated for its credibly neutral, secure interoperability across chains, within solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OWsJCyW2g4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Safe</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.key.space/syncing-other-l1#proof-of-concept\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">KeySpace</a> by Coinbase Wallet.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-case-studies-and-testimonials-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-case-studies-and-testimonials-5\"></a><strong>Case Studies and Testimonials</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Gathering Feedback:</strong></p>\n<p>We will collect feedback by creating dedicated Telegram groups, allowing us to engage directly with developers and users who are actively integrating or using Hashi. This approach has proven effective in the past, enabling us to gather real-time insights, address any concerns, and understand the needs of our community.</p>\n<p><strong>Showcasing Success:</strong></p>\n<p>The feedback and testimonials collected will be compiled and presented through our quarterly reports.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-advancing-values-of-freedom-and-privacy-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-advancing-values-of-freedom-and-privacy-6\"></a><strong>Advancing Values of Freedom and Privacy</strong></h3>\n<p>Hashi advances the value of freedom by empowering users and developers to conduct cross-chain operations securely and flexibly.<br>\nBy allowing the easy configuration of setups with multiple cross-chain solutions, Hashi gives developers the freedom to choose the security mechanisms that best suit their needs. Additionally, Hashi enables seamless switching between different cross-chain solutions, ensuring that developers are not locked into any single provider and can adapt their security setup as needed.</p>\n<p>While Hashi is not specifically a privacy-oriented solution, its focus on enhancing security and flexibility supports the broader value of freedom in the cross-chain ecosystem. Users can operate with greater confidence, knowing that their cross-chain transactions are protected by a robust, configurable framework that adapts to evolving security needs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-supporting-decentralization-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-supporting-decentralization-7\"></a><strong>Supporting Decentralization</strong></h3>\n<p>Hashi inherently supports decentralization by actively promoting the use of multiple cross-chain solutions and security systems, as opposed to trusting a single entity.<br>\nInstead of relying on a single provider, Hashi’s framework allows users to use simultaneously various cross-chain protocols, reducing the risks associated with vendor lock-in, potential vulnerabilities, and the inability to adapt to changing security needs.<br>\nThis approach prevents single points of control or failure from compromising the integrity of cross-chain operations.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-team-information-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-team-information-8\"></a><strong>Team Information</strong></h3>\n<p>Our team comprises six people, including two tech leads, one senior engineer, one full-stack engineer, one devops engineer and one project manager and has a proven track record in developing cross-chain solutions.</p>\n<p>It is led by Georgios Gontikas and Thomas Bertani.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/geogont\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Georgios</a> has been active in the industry since 2017. He led Hashi from its inception and worked on the zk Bridge for Gnosis Chain. He was previously Product Lead at Chainsafe, where he worked on the inception and launch of Sygma interoperability protocol.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThomasBertani\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Thomas</a> entered the blockchain space in 2012 and has pioneered oracles, bridges and coprocessors since 2014, founding Oraclize/Provable and pNetwork.</p>\n<p>Alessandro is our senior engineer. He has been working in the industry since 2016 and together with Thomas since 2017 in Oraclize/Provable, Eidoo, and pNetwork, gaining wide cross-chain experience, also covering the role of CTO for the Eidoo wallet.</p>\n<p>Ludovico is our project manager. Previously, he has been an innovation manager helping web2 firms adopt blockchain. He has worked in pNetwork with Thomas, Alessandro and Marco in 2023.</p>\n<p>Marco is our devops engineer. He has joined Thomas in 2017 as sysadmin and gradually worked more and more in devops roles on different projects, including Oraclize/Provable, Eidoo and pNetwork.</p>\n<p>Zeng is our full stack engineer. He has been collaborating with Georgios since 2023, and is specialized in cross-chain development. He has been contributing in the development of the Gnosis Bridges, Gnosis zkBridge integration and Hashi.</p>\n<p>Our team has a proven track record of executing on grants. For example, Hashi has been awarded a grant to secure Gnosis Chain canonical bridges, which oversee over $800M in TVL. This grant is currently in progress, and the team is delivering on time, as can be verified <a href=\"https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-93-should-gnosisdao-support-the-integration-of-hashi-within-gnosis-chains-canonical-bridges/8245\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-social-proof-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-social-proof-9\"></a><strong>Social Proof</strong></h3>\n<p>In time, Hashi has gained a significant reputation in the cross-chain space.<br>\nA few weeks after its inception, in 2023, Hashi was recognized by the Uniswap Independent Committee for having the <a href=\"https://uniswap.notion.site/Bridge-Assessment-Report-0c8477afadce425abac9c0bd175ca382#fd0823560a094a79b355cd5bc138224a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">best approach to cross-chain security</a> with its Multi-Message Aggregation approach.</p>\n<p>In 2024, Hashi was selected to secure Gnosis Chain’s canonical bridges (with their $800+ M in TVL), as well as Lukso Chain’s canonical bridges.<br>\nMoreover, we have implemented integrations and established new partnerships with several cross-chain projects, including LayerZero, Hyperlane, Succinct Labs, Axiom, Router Protocol and others.</p>\n<p>More recently, as mentioned above, both Safe and Coinbase are assessing the implementation of Hashi in some of their cross-chain solutions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-transparency-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-transparency-10\"></a><strong>Transparency</strong></h3>\n<p>Our budget is carefully allocated to ensure that all funds are used efficiently to support the continued development and operation of Hashi.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Team Funding for 3 Months</strong>: A significant portion of the budget will be dedicated to supporting our team over the next three months. This includes covering salaries and operational expenses to maintain our development pace and ensure we can meet our roadmap milestones. Specifically, these funds will be used to support the reliable relaying of block headers across multiple chains and to improve the Hashi Explorer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Project Operations</strong>: Another key area of our budget will be allocated to covering the operational costs of running the project. This includes expenses for hosting the off-chain relayer infrastructure, which is essential for the continuous and secure relay of block headers between different chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gas Costs</strong>: We will also allocate a portion of the budget to cover the gas costs associated with relaying messages and block headers across seven different chains.<br>\nThe gas costs vary depending on the number of oracles used in the setup, and are subject to change based on Ether prices and gas market conditions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should we receive funding from Octant, it will primarily go towards these outlined areas to ensure the project’s sustainability and success. We are committed to using the funds transparently and efficiently to achieve our goals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-999-other-funding-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-999-other-funding-11\"></a><strong>Other funding</strong></h3>\n<p>Hashi is and will remain a Public Good that operates on grants.</p>\n<p>Grants are needed and used exclusively to support the development of Hashi, benefitting the broader cross-chain community.</p>\n<p>As of today, the grants awarded to Hashi amount to a total of $200,000.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/hashi-bringing-additive-security-and-future-proofness-to-the-cross-chain-world/449\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/hashi-bringing-additive-security-and-future-proofness-to-the-cross-chain-world/449","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Aug 2024 16:35:40 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-449"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/hashi-bringing-additive-security-and-future-proofness-to-the-cross-chain-world/449.rss","#text":"Hashi - Bringing Additive Security and Future-proofness to the cross-chain world."},"filter":false},{"title":"Weekly Doots Podcast","dc:creator":"bbroad","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-994-markdoots-podcastmark-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-994-markdoots-podcastmark-1\"></a><mark>Doots Podcast:</mark></h1>\n<p><strong>Project Description:</strong> The weekly Doots Podcast is a recurring, community-driven livestream, hosted live on the EVMavericks Discord + YouTube and is also available on-demand.

It is entirely managed by a single person, and an additional developer is being added to assist. But as such, there is no accounting team or marketing team (and hence no marketing budget).</p>\n<p>Historically, all funding went into a central treasury, from which a salary of $24k/year was paid to RicMoo for the last few years (prior to that it was entirely pro bono in his spare time ;)). This year, the salary will be increased, likely to around $120k/year.</p>\n<p>Funding otherwise is spent on server resources, software licenses, corporate obligations, and necessary travel.</p>\n<p>Milestones are also fluid, as Ethers follows trends in the Ethereum ecosystem. For example, a month prior to BLOb support being added, there would have been no milestone for BLObs, since they were unknown at the time.</p>\n<p>General milestones however include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assistance; via Discord, GitHub and other channels, a significant amount of time is used helping individuals both with ethers and general blockchain concepts and development</li>\n<li>Improving Documentations</li>\n<li>Improving performance</li>\n<li>Creating applications on top of Ethers to ensure it still meets the needs of developers</li>\n<li>Responding to GitHub issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Funding Requested: $ / ETH</strong></p>\n<p>There is no set amount in mind, but $1k/mo towards server costs would be wonderful as well as anything to help offset salaries drawn from the treasury would be nice. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p><strong>Plans should you fall below, reach or exceed funding goals:</strong></p>\n<p>Ethers does receive funding from a variety of sources, so regardless of funding, Ethers will continue to best library it can be. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-989-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-989-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\"></a><strong>Impact Measurement and Reporting</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Short-term Outcomes (0-3 months):</strong></p>\n<p>The main short-term deliverables are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First-class Account Abstract support (using a smart-contract wallet should be no different than using an EOA or Ledger)</li>\n<li>Performance improvements</li>\n<li>Full ENSv2 support</li>\n<li>Automatic socket (WebSocket and IPC) re-subscription on disconnect</li>\n<li>Many smaller feature requests which exist on the GitHub repository</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mid-term Outcomes (3-6+ months):</strong></p>\n<p>While market-share has never been a goal of Ethers, a core advantage of Ethers has been its documentation, which will receive a significant increase in time and resources. A second developer has been tagged to help out expand the docs and add more examples. Excellent documentation helps engagement, adoption and growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Impact (5+ years):</strong></p>\n<p>Looking 5 years into the future is beyond difficult, but a lot of the historic funding Ethers has received has gone into a treasury to ensure Ethers can thrive and hire additional help as required, even during times where it is difficult to acquire additional funding.</p>\n<p>The goal of Ethers has always been just to provide the best possible library for its purpose. It was created by RicMoo, for RicMoo. So, it will continue being a tool maintained by someone who uses it extensively himself. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes Measurement:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics are hard for open-source software, but some (albeit fairly weak signal) metrics include monthly downloads (currently 5.4m/month) and GitHub stars (currently 7,900).

Owning such hardware is not feasible for everyone. So, if one is serious about verifiable computing, she has to either rely on centralized providers(e.g. AWS instances) or start her own prove-maxi network. Centralization has its own drawbacks, so better to focus on decentralized options instead. To meet the compute needs of clients and serve proving jobs, one would need a network of provider PCs whose hardware specs are maxed-out. Getting such a network of expensive gadgets up, however, requires a complex set of incentives to keep the nodes busy. This application entry deviates from the usual solutions and proposes a parallel proving scheme to execute zkVM programs on computationally weak nodes.<br>\nzkVM proving is only feasible on  strong hardware. With weak specced hardware as worker nodes, hopes for generating ZK proofs start to fade away quickly. But not completely! The solution turns out, is to divide the task and prove individual sub-tasks parallely. Risc0 allows for the programs building on top of its SDK, to customize the degree to which proving stresses the hardware. The customization follows the natural limitation set by the finite fields used for generating proofs. As you may already know, Risc0 uses STARKs for proof generation and it has to stay efficient while mathematically consistent for yielding provable programs. This forces Risc0 to choose fields whose ability to generate proofs is capped at a certain number of operations(16.78M as of today). But real world programs are larger and so Risc0 team had to find a way to make proving of infinitely size programs possible. This unfortunate(or fortunate in our case) limitation enables dividing a zkVM program into several items(called segments in Risc0 jargon) and proving them one by one. The final proof is then obtained by aggregating individual proofs. We have run experiments and have found out that by customizing the segment size to ranges that make proving possible on systems with 4-8GB of memory, we can capitalize on available stock hardware and prove zkVM programs in a parallel manner while keeping the overhead manageable. This gotcha seems to eliminate the need for forming a network off elite PCs.<br>\nzkVM proving finds and important application in scaling the Ethereum network. L2 zkRollups need to generate proofs that ensure their transactions are valid. Each proof is then posted to the Ethereum network(the L1) for verification. This scheme is a promising approach to scale Ethereum’s transaction throughput. The agent responsible for generating proofs in zkRollups is called the <em>sequencer</em>. Its main role is to batch L2 transactions and have them sent for L1 verification. Being a critical part of zkRollups, the sequencer routines require strong computers to run as expected. Right now, almost all of the mainstream L2 zkRollups use centralized infra(e.g. strong AWS instances) to generate proofs. We, however, would like to test a scenario where the proving is done on stock hardware(i.e. 8+ years old CPU, 8 GB RAM). Our goal is close on in/beat 5 minutes finality of Linea sequencer proving(as a L2 zkRollup example). If successful, we expect to secure big performance gains while enjoying decentralization guarantees obtained by proving jobs on a p2p network.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Repository:</strong> [<a href=\"https://github.com/WholesumNet\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">WholesumNet · GitHub</a>]</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-953-budget-breakdown-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-953-budget-breakdown-1\"></a><strong>Budget Breakdown</strong></h3>\n<p>We hope to raise at least <strong>4 * $5,000 = $20,000</strong>  that would support 1 full-time developer for the duration of the test(~4 months).</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1</strong>:<br>\nDuration: 45 days<br>\nBudget: $7,500<br>\nGoals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design a network protocol for proving zkVM programs</li>\n<li>Reach out to Golem, Swarm, … for node(worker) inclusion and partnering with them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deliverables:<br>\nThe action plan and protocol specifications ready for implementation</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2</strong>:<br>\nDuration: 45 days<br>\nBudget: $7,500<br>\nGoals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Come up with Risc0 transformers that emulate Linea/… sequencer proving</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deliverables:<br>\nA protocol implemented into client and server applications, written in Rust</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3</strong>:<br>\nDuration: 30 days<br>\nBudget: $5,000<br>\nGoals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To test the whole setup and see if it works</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deliverables:<br>\nResults and reports of how the test went</p>\n<p><strong>Funding Requested: $20,000</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Plans should you fall below, reach or exceed funding goals:</strong><br>\nFall below:<br>\nWe are grateful for any amount we raise here and won’t quit.</p>\n<p>Reach:<br>\nWe go as planned.</p>\n<p>Exceed:<br>\nWe would bring in additional brains.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-953-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-953-impact-measurement-and-reporting-2\"></a><strong>Impact Measurement and Reporting</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Inputs &gt; Activities &gt; Outputs &gt; Outcomes &gt; Long Term Impact</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Short-term Outcomes (0-3 months):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We expect to have transformed a typical Linea(or other L2 zkRollup) sequencer proving job to the format Risc0 zkVM accepts by the end of milestone 2.

Generally, I consider myself someone interested in computers. I have been active in computing industry since 2010. I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from computer vision to UX research. I got into crypto in 2020 when I found myself in need of raising funds for my EBook reading software called “readaratus”. Ran out of money and so decided to do freelance jobs and there I found out about Gitcoin grants and hackathoons. Jumped in and won some hackatoons(some Golem ones too) and got myself partially fed for a year or so. Meanwhile, I joined a Gitcoin workstream project called “dCompass” in late 2021 that aimed to revamp Gitcoin Quests. At dCompass, I did studies about user experience of Quests and wrote technical reports and laid out a vision for an interactive learning environment. dCompass failed to raise funding and was shut down in Q2 2022. It was then in summer 2022 that I was offered a grant from the Swarm team to join forces of dStorage(Swarm) and dCompute(Golem) networks in an interoperability attempt to create a world computer called “Sovr project”. Sovr was shut down later in Q2 2023 due to lack of interest from developers to use our tooling.

Lotteries are one of them, but the way they work right now make them easily manipulable, corruptible or inefficient when allocating resources. We are blending lotteries with Ethereum values to make them a great source of fairly and transparently distributed funding for public goods.</p>\n<p>To make lotteries fair, we’re researching and implementing onchain randomness technology. For our current version, we’re using new drand scheme that uses BLS on BN254 instead of BLS12-381 to make <a href=\"https://drand.love\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">drand</a> available <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@kevincharm/rJA4r_Iia\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">on any EVM</a> - a contribution done by our contributors. For the picking of winning numbers, we borrow some lesser-known algorithms from the latest in cryptography (e.g., stateless shuffles, grand product check) to achieve gas-efficient lotteries for both users and operators. More specifically, we’re using the Feistel Shuffle for this purpose.

These methods can (and will) be used at deeper levels of the tech stack (even the Ethereum Base Layer, read about Verfiable Delay Functions). We also believe that there’s a centralisation risk in relying on sponsors to fund public goods. They can indirectly define what are public goods and decide which ones are being funded.

If we exceed our funding goals we’ll just do more of the above mentioned milestones to get a little closer to financial sustainability.</p>\n<p>We have a long backlog of product ideas, so we will keep working on them.

But if we can implement an easy-to-use UI more publishers will compete for running ads which will increase prices.</li>\n<li><strong>Product growth</strong>: Driving product growth in the short term helps us justifying continuing to work on Kiwi News generally.</li>\n<li><strong>Protocol hardening</strong>: At the moment, the contributor that runs our Dune Dashboard cannot sync his node because of the bug. Once we fix it, he can work more independently again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Mid-term Outcomes (3-6+ months):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>[Describe the anticipated outcomes from the project, such as increased user engagement, adoption rates, or community growth.]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The onchain ads UI will validate whether there is actual demand for onchain ads and if it makes sense to spend more time on this.</p>\n<p>Generaly speaking, reaching more sustainable revenue model would let us focus more on product and community activation. That would lead to better user engagement, which - in our case - leads to more signal and better content and commments shared on our platform.</p>\n<p>That in turn leads to more growth, since for Kiwi, our content and the community is what makes people pay for the app.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Impact (5+ years):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>[Describe the long-term vision for your project, including how it will create lasting changes and benefits for the community or ecosystem.]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Kiwi reaches more adoption, it will serve as a forum for nuanced conversations about Ethereum. We believe that - just like Hacker News keeps web2 community in check - Kiwi could do the same for Ethereum.</p>\n<p>That would lead to less builders following hype, more scrutinity for bad actors and making it harder to run scams.</p>\n<p>Even if some users wouldn’t read Kiwi everyday, we can serve as a tool for double-checking current hypes, since users’ comments and different type of content shared on Kiwi can help to get out of the social bubbles.</p>\n<p>Plus Kiwi could keep serving as a repository of quality links and conversations. Since Google isn’t a good search engine for crypto, we could build one based on Kiwi’s content.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes Measurement:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>[Explain how you will measure the outcomes and impact of your project, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Include specific metrics or indicators you will use, such as user engagement, adoption rates, community impact, and user satisfaction. Also share the tools you’ll be using for this purpose.]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main goal for now is getting to financial sustainability for us two co-founders as this will guarantee us to run the project over the long term. So all outcome measures are ultimately just lagging indicators to increase our income to a point where it becomes sustainable.</p>\n<p>Yet, our main mission is improving the Ethereum community by delivering high-quality crypto content &amp; conversations to builders.</p>\n<p>Therefore, most of our metrics are based on that goal.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Number of users clicking the links per day</strong></p>\n<p>If many people click our crypto building-related links, it means that we surface content they think is valuable.</p>\n<p>We track link clicks by adding a “<a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/outbound?url=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://news.kiwistand.com/outbound?url=</a>” param to each outbound link, and then publish the results on our stats page in <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/users\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Daily Active Devices section</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Number of users submitting, upvoting, and commenting on links</strong></p>\n<p>Every action on the protocol level takes and EIP712 signature, which means that we can easily track each submission, comment and upvote from our users.</p>\n<p>We publish the results on our <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/users\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">User stats page</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Number of links stored on the protocol</strong></p>\n<p>If the links and comments are high-quality and follow our <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/guidelines\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">guidelines</a>, the more content, the better. Therefore we track this number on a <a href=\"https://news.kiwistand.com/basics\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cumulative Total Messages chart</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Number of people who paid to use the product</strong></p>\n<p>At this point people can use Kiwi for free by following our bots, RSS feeds or the alt client. But for us the best signal is when people decide to pay a few $ to use Kiwi.</p>\n<p>Therefore we track this number by following our <a href=\"https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x66747bdc903d17c586fa09ee5d6b54cc85bbea45\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kiwi Pass NFT contract</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Adoption rate</strong></p>\n<p>We track how many users who minted a Kiwi Pass are active.

We make around $500/month from Kiwi Pass Sales, and made $1,800 from organizing two writing contests. We are in talks with 5 different projects to organize more contests.</p>\n<p>To become sustainable, we need to increase our revenue by a lot. We are very lean and - apart from running servers - we just have to pay ourselves some basic salary.</p>\n<p>The basic salary has to cover expenses such as rent, food, and so on, which is around $5,000/month before taxes. Half of it goes to tax, social insurances, etc.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we need around $10,000/month to be able to keep on working full-time on Kiwi without having to take some extra gigs.</p>\n<p>We are exploring different models.</p>\n<p>We don’t want to take VC funding because we believe that projects such as Kiwi should stay credibly neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>So we are exploring ideas such as:</strong><br>\na) ads,<br>\nb) subscription model,<br>\nc) user donations,<br>\nd) job board,</p>\n<p>and a few others.</p>\n<p>We’re super serious about financial sustainability and talk about it a lot on our semi-public Telegram channel for Kiwi Pass holders.

Kiwi, contrarily to X or HN, will always remain vibrant and open to innovation because this is how it was architected. The operators of HN and X will always remain powerful because they monopolize the software that their community uses to communicate. We think this is unaceptable and so we want to demonstrate with Kiwi that an alternative model is possible.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-949-supporting-decentralization-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-949-supporting-decentralization-7\"></a><strong>Supporting Decentralization</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re supporting decentralization in a few ways:</p>\n<p><strong>P2P Protocol</strong>.

We’re also sharing our revenue with the top posting accounts. It’s contrary to the traditional web2 social model where users post content so that the platform can sell more ads.</p>\n<p><strong>Open-source</strong>. Kiwi’s entire codebase, including the front-end, back-end, and protocol, is open-source. This allows anyone in the community to fork the project, contribute to its development, or create their own versions of Kiwi. So even if we are not around, people can keep developing the project.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-949-team-information-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-949-team-information-8\"></a><strong>Team Information</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Tim Daubenschutz</strong><br>\n<em>(Tech &amp; Product)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worked on the precursor of NFTs @ <a href=\"https://github.com/ascribe/onion\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ascribe.io</a> in 2015,</li>\n<li>Co-created Soulbound tokens.

We emerged from conversations in the EthFinance and EthStaker communities, and aim to provide credibly neutral infrastructure for the Ethereum staking ecosystem. The relay has been in continuous operation for nearly 2 years and serves over 850,000 validators, including many solo stakers, Rocketpool users, and large professional staking operations. Between 1-5% of all Ethereum mainnet blocks pass through Aestus.</p>\n<p>MEV remains a valuable part of revenue for Ethereum PoS consensus participants, but it is critical to the long-term health of the network that we minimize centralization pressures and ensure MEV profits are equitably distributed amongst all validators. Aestus operates as a public good, free from commercial interests and adhering to principles of credible neutrality.</p>\n<p>Aestus was originally imagined to be a short-term enterprise destined only to fill a short-term gap between the Merge and the development of enshrined proposer-builder separation (“ePBS”). This pathway to an in-protocol solution has been significantly more challenging than initially anticipated and remains somewhat elusive. Aestus intends to remain in operation until we outlive our purpose.</p>\n<p>Recently, there has been considerable interest and extensive research towards improving Ethereum UI/UX by supporting cross-chain (L2) atomic synchronicity, including instantaneous inclusion and execution guarantees (preconfs), and using L1 validators to secure L2s.

Our flagship products include our production-capable beacon chain and validator client. Additionally, we maintain public repositories of useful tools for public use, such as BLS, SSZ, Discv5, Gossipsub, and Noise. Our work contributes to the backbone infrastructure required to keep the Ethereum blockchain progressing within the rules as defined by the specification. Lodestar’s niche is its implementation language, TypeScript. Our software and tooling are uniquely situated for researchers and developers for rapid prototyping, including our Prover, a verified web3 provider using light clients to increase decentralization and security of the JSON-RPC. Millions of developers around the world are familiar with TypeScript, and Lodestar’s high-quality codebases serve as excellent introductions to the Ethereum world, with the goal of increasing client diversity and attracting new talent. Our project does not generate any revenue and relies on funding from open-source donations and foundations to continue developing in the core Ethereum ecosystem. Our repository and supporting libraries are all open source and mostly licensed under Apache 2.0.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Repository:</strong></p><aside class=\"onebox githubrepo\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\" data-github-private-repo=\"false\">\n  <img width=\"690\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/3a4c3cccfa446d7968f7540221f2cef97d143348_2_690x344.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"F1F3F3\">\n\n  <h3><a href=\"https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - ChainSafe/lodestar: 🌟 TypeScript Implementation of Ethereum Consensus</a></h3>\n\n    <p><span class=\"github-repo-description\">🌟 TypeScript Implementation of Ethereum Consensus</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<h3><a name=\"p-919-budget-breakdown-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-919-budget-breakdown-1\"></a><strong>Budget Breakdown</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Funding Requested:</strong><br>\nThe operating costs to run this program are approximately USD $1.9m per year.

As we continue to evolve, it’s important for us to align Octant’s processes and mechanisms with our values and mission. We’ve recently taken a closer look at how we can improve the way we measure and present the success of the projects we support, and we want to share our intentions and upcoming changes with you.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-understanding-octants-impact-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-understanding-octants-impact-2\"></a>Understanding Octant’s Impact</h3>\n<p>One of our core goals is to ensure that Octant is not just a platform for funding public goods but also a space where the impact of these projects is clearly visible and easily understood. We want to make sure that the projects you choose to support when you donate your Octant rewards are making a tangible difference, and that this difference is communicated effectively. To do this, we’ve focused on two key areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clearer Reporting Requirements</strong>: Based on feedback conducted in a recent survey, we’re refining how projects report their progress and outcomes. This will help us, and participating projects, track the effectiveness and impact of their work more accurately.</li>\n<li><strong>Better User Support</strong>: We want to provide you with the tools and information you need to make informed decisions. By improving what’s displayed in the Octant app, we’re aiming to make your experience smoother and more transparent.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-changes-to-reporting-requirements-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-changes-to-reporting-requirements-3\"></a>Changes to Reporting Requirements</h3>\n<p>From our recent survey, we’ve gathered valuable insights into what you care most about when it comes to the projects on Octant. Here’s what we learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Highest Importance</strong>: Potential Impact and Previous Impact of projects are what you value the most. These metrics are critical in helping you decide where to allocate your support, so we’ll be making sure these are prominently displayed when you first look at projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium Importance</strong>: Details like the team’s background, how funds are being used, and development activity are also important. These will be available on each project’s page within Octant, giving you the context you need without overwhelming the initial decision-making process.</li>\n<li><strong>Lower Importance</strong>: Metrics like sustainability plans, community support, governance structures, and user testimonials were ranked lower. These will still be available but might be housed in more specialized sections, or through tools like KarmaGap for those who want to dive deeper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based upon these results, we will be looking to implement many of these these features into the Octant app over the coming epochs.</p>\n<p>We have already implemented some changes for projects that have received funding previously.  Please scroll down through this page and be sure to check the template that corresponds to your project here: <a href=\"https://docs.octant.app/reporting-templates.html#project-proposal-template\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Octant Docs</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-why-these-changes-matter-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-why-these-changes-matter-4\"></a>Why These Changes Matter</h3>\n<p>By focusing on what’s most important, we can ensure that the projects funded through Octant are impactful and aligned with the values of our community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For Recently Funded Projects</strong>: Reporting requirements will start light, focusing on early outputs. As projects progress, their reporting will shift to include more detailed outcomes and impact assessments.</li>\n<li><strong>For Long-Running Projects</strong>: Those that have received funding before the most recent round,  they will have stricter reporting requirements, focusing on not just outputs, but the outcomes of those outputs. This ensures that projects are not only delivering on their promises but are also growing and evolving in ways that benefit the broader community.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-894-your-opinion-matters-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-894-your-opinion-matters-5\"></a>Your Opinion Matters</h3>\n<p>We’re committed to making Octant a platform where your voice matters. We’re listening closely in how you think we can improve Octant.  Through surveys, direct 1 on 1’s, and consistent discussion on our governance board, we’re very confident that Octant has a bright future because of your feedback. These changes are just the beginning, and we’re really excited to continue building with you!</p>\n<p>Thank you for being an integral part of this journey.</p>\n<p>Warm regards,</p>\n<p>The Octant Team</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/improving-our-processes-for-octant-recipients/409\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/improving-our-processes-for-octant-recipients/409","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 22:50:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-409"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/improving-our-processes-for-octant-recipients/409.rss","#text":"Improving Our Processes For Octant Recipients"},"filter":false},{"title":"Mechanism Institute: Democratizing Cryptoeconomics","dc:creator":"sofiacos","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/original/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/utLfUYdkuqNuev7wxEdTeoXib3w.png?dl=1\" title=\"hero 2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_690x175.png\" alt=\"hero 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"utLfUYdkuqNuev7wxEdTeoXib3w\" width=\"690\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_690x175.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_1035x262.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/octant/optimized/1X/d59e7c84da60e3f75c304d7675367429faa54d26_2_1380x350.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"999894\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-847-project-description-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#p-847-project-description-1\"></a><strong>Project Description</strong></h2>\n<p>Mechanism Institute is a research initiative that shapes building blocks for digital-age institutions.

In due time, if a governance structure can be battle tested and the team is confident, we see the community taking more and more ownership over key aspects of Octant, maybe everything in total minus ownership of staking… But 1 step at a time <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>So we started out with that intention, to design a governance framework that would empower our community to initially govern the recent Community Fund.  What began as a simple experiment to give more power to our community has lead to a lot of learnings for the Octant core team in how we can improve the next version of this moving forward.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"chronology-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#chronology-2\"></a>Chronology</h3>\n<p>This first started with bringing together the contributors in January, where we had our first call mid February, &amp; with calls taking place every 2 weeks to 1 month.  Organization over the first rounds operation began to formalize in March, with key pieces coming together (roles, Charmverse setup etc) in April.  In May, we opened up applications to the public for 3 key directives (<a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/octant-community-fund/octant-community-fund-hq-8956739992421918\">Marketing, Tooling, &amp; Public Goods ecosystem collaboration</a>), and in early June the final votes were approved for 11 applicants.  47.99 ETH has been awarded, and all projects are moving forward with their work.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"group-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#group-3\"></a>Group</h3>\n<p>Before this process began, we had a tremendous amount of support from key allies in the space, and naturally, inviting many of them to join us in the development of this framework made sense.  Their expertise in different areas cannot be understated, which further cemented my feelings in what is the superpower of web3, <em><strong>‘diversity’</strong></em>. One of the problems from managing this, was that we didn’t have a clear idea in what the optimal group size would be.  So the group grew to almost 20 people!  Whenever you have a large group like this, coordination can be quite tricky, so participation within the monthly or bi monthly calls began to fluctuate.  But nevertheless, with a largely committed group. it ended up working out well.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"timing-scope-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#timing-scope-4\"></a>Timing &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>I as the core team member putting all of this together, was a bit naive in how long some of these processes can ultimately take.  Taking a step back, it was not the initial intention to have this group of individuals being the driving force behind decision-making over how the first round of funds would be distributed.  Instead, this group was brought together to design a broader community governance framework so that the Octant community (at least at a larger scale than this group) could participate in some capacity in the first round.</p>\n<p>This work takes a while, and definitely not something that you can whip up quickly, without potential problems rearing their faces.  So in March, with the realization that staking rewards coming in and ready to allocate May 1st, we pivoted from the longer term design, to this group being that decision-making body.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this went as well as it possibly could have.  But that isn’t to say there weren’t some drawbacks.  Naturally, when you bring a group in for a different intention, there are going to be issues with what some of the members had committed to, both in timing, and requirements.  With that in mind, I cannot express my gratitude enough for the flexibility, and the work, that each of these members had contributed.  They made for a very productive first round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"evolution-moving-forward-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#evolution-moving-forward-5\"></a>Evolution Moving Forward</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to understand where we are now is that Octant governance is moving on two separate tracks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We are going to continue running Octant Community Fund rounds, with the next taking place in October/November.  Changes with this upcoming round will include: holding an open process for community members to participate in being on the next council, while getting really clear on expectations for those who participate next round.  Additionally, we’ll be refining what will be the directives of intent for proposals.  Some of that will be based upon early learnings in what was effective from this first round.  Lastly it’s worth noting that the treasury for this next round will be ~2x what it was this first round.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Separately, <a href=\"https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/\">Hats Protocol</a> a recent grantee, will collaborate with key stakeholders and the core team to resume the initial efforts of designing a long-term governance structure for the Octant community. Their work will focus on supporting Octant’s journey towards progressive decentralization.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is much more I can share about this process, but this may be a good stopping point for now.  I want to emphasize that we are looking interested community members to consider applying to be a part of this upcoming round.  More details will be shared on this soon!</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/reflections-from-the-first-community-fund-round/381\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/reflections-from-the-first-community-fund-round/381","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jul 2024 23:48:57 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-381"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/reflections-from-the-first-community-fund-round/381.rss","#text":"Reflections From The First Community Fund Round"},"filter":false},{"title":"About the Governance category","dc:creator":"james","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Octant is steering this ship towards more community ownership.

Unlike many other projects, Octant has a reliable funding supply, but needs to have a larger public reach, with more engaged GLM holders in order to grow and scale its user base. Our marketing and growth campaign pulls inspiration from Octants self nomination system for projects looking to receive funding via their app, but instead looks to reward high quality individuals interested in supporting public goods.</p>\n<p>In a play on a retro citizens round, people will be able to nominate themselves or nominate others in a series of call to actions that require people to post and engage in the Octant farcaster channel.

I am however building a public goods project on Farcaster for the same reasons I’m outlining here - because I believe that the open social graph is a key component for creating an effective and self-sustainable public goods funding mechanism - more on that later).</p>\n<p><strong>What is Farcaster?</strong></p>\n<p>Farcaster (FC) is a “sufficiently decentralized” social media protocol (meaning that user posts are censorship resistant but display of the posts is client-dependent). FC currently has about 500,000 registered users (though I estimate the number of “real” accounts is probably around 100K)</p>\n<p><strong>Why Farcaster?</strong></p>\n<p>Octant’s main venue for community engagement right now is through Epochs (and to a lesser extent the nascent community fund). Epochs recur on a quarterly basis. For a short period, projects (and their respective communities) compete for a share of Octant’s ETH staking rewards. This brings some engagement and publicity to Octant but it’s not persistent.</p>\n<p>While Epochs are the core of Octant, I believe that to have sustained growth on all metrics we need to have persistent community engagement - and preferably it should be driven by the community itself rather than top-down - this is where Farcaster comes in.</p>\n<p>FC obviously has a tiny fraction of the users of a platform like Twitter. It does however have a large (and growing) base of the Ethereum community (Vitalik, for example, casts there much more often than on X), and it’s one of the most exciting ecosystems in crypto in my view. I also believe there is a much greater potential to build and grow an active and engaged Octant community there thanks to the open social graph and everything that can be built on it and integrated with Octant.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the Strategy?</strong></p>\n<p>What I’m proposing here is a very rough outline with a few suggestions just to get a sense of what’s possible. I’d love to have a lot more community/team input on this so we can make it into a more robust plan, and look into what resources Octant would consider dedicating to this (if that is indeed a path that Octant would want to pursue in the first place…) I’m putting it out here because I believe it’s worth pursuing and has a lot of potential. I don’t think it should necessarily be the sole focus of Octant, but I do think it should be a major element in Octant’s overall growth strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>The key elements of the strategy include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Growing awareness of Octant on FC through contests, games, and other forms of community engagement.</li>\n<li>Periodic partnerships with other communities on FC (eg Purple, Regen, Greenpill, Lotto, etc.) to both build the Octant brand and fund public goods.</li>\n<li>Harness FC’s tipping economy toward activities that align with Octant’s growth goals and funding public goods more generally</li>\n<li>Use the open social graph to get quantitative (eg. GLM locked by FC user, number of Octant-related casts etc.) and qualitative data (eg. quality of content posted or benefit to community provided) on users which can then be used for Octant’s effort to decentralize its governance (as well for sybil resistance in Epoch voting)</li>\n<li>Set up broad categories of how community members can contribute to Octant’s growth (eg. memes, tooling, data analysis, Frames, etc. etc.) on FC and then periodically reward community members (both through the community tipping those users and through Octant funds) for their contributions. We can then use (shameless plug:) Impact App’s (free) curation tools to get the community itself involved in estimating the effect of the contributions (this is especially useful at scale, when the team will not have the capacity to review many posts, and it’s also a way to promote bottom-up involvement/potential governance for the community). Then measure the efficacy of the campaign and adjust accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So these are just some ideas and of course we can brainstorm other ways to harness the open social graph for Octant’s growth (I think there is a lot of potential with Frames, for example).</p>\n<p>This strategy would obviously require both time and funding from Octant. But I think that it is flexible enough that it can be adjusted over time (based on KPIs) for both the time and resources invested in it.</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discuss.octant.app/t/octant-community-growth-strategy/366\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/octant-community-growth-strategy/366","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 14:48:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"discuss.octant.app-topic-366"},"source":{"@url":"https://discuss.octant.app/t/octant-community-growth-strategy/366.rss","#text":"Octant Community Growth Strategy"},"filter":false},{"title":"EcoSynthesisX: Impact in real life through Web3 for a Better Future","dc:creator":"paul_burg","category":"Public Good Projects Discussion","description":"<p>Empowering Change with Blockchain<br>\nEcoSynthesisX: Impact in real life through Web3 for a Better Future</p>\n<p>At EcoSynthesisX, we are leveraging the latest Web3 and blockchain technology to make a significant impact on public goods funding.

There are over 5000 Vyper contracts deployed across a dozen chains, securing over $2 billion of value. Vyper is free, open-source under a permissive license and usable on all EVM-compatible chains.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your main project funding sources?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grants funding and

will include modules, a new import system, a new IR and many other features to improve developer experience.</li>\n<li>Further develop the Vyper intermediary language (Venom) to give developers ever more optimized bytecode and reduce contracts’ gas usage.</li>\n<li>Continue to strengthen the security of the language through close collaboration with auditors, bug bounty programs, auditing competitions and providing better Vyper support to security tools such Slither or Echidna.</li>\n<li>Improve developer UX through tools such as titanoboa (<a

developers by participating in major blockchain conferences, organizing workshops, outreach programs and producing more educational resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What milestones have you achieved?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vyper is now the second most widely used smart contract programming language.</li>\n<li>The tooling developed by the team around Vyper has constantly improved, with projects like titanoboa now offering fuzzing, code coverage and gas profiling with faster execution speed than Foundry.</li>\n<li>Optimizations to the Vyper compiler consistently reduce gas costs and produce binaries that are on average 50% smaller compared to Solidity.</li>\n<li>Following the discovery of a vulnerability in 2023, the team organized bug bounty programs, security competitions and worked with auditors to thoroughly review the codebase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tell us more about milestones you’d like to achieve</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The official release of the 0.4.0 version of Vyper will be a major milestone for the language, offering more modularity, security and efficiency to users.</li>\n<li>We hope to significantly increase the number of developers and protocols

Everyone can make a dappnode app of any node without having to consult us!</li>\n<li>Access to the machine via VPN for remote access to the GUI</li>\n<li>Opt-in Auto-updates: hands-free node updates. Extremely useful for users but also networks as they get the subset of nodes running on dappnode automatically updated - simplifies potential fork situations.</li>\n<li>Stakers UI: A dedicated UI for EVM/Ethereum-like Proof-of-Stake validator setups (choosing EL, CL, Web3signer, MEV Boost) - intuitive and easy to choose! Allows for almost-instant consensus client switch without risking slashing to promote client diversity.</li>\n<li>Ethical Monitoring: Tor-based monitoring system to alert users when their Dappnodes are down but respecting the privacy of the user: we route liveness pings via Tor so we never get IPs! - Coordinated a standard API for the keymanager with Ethereum Core developers to facilitate validator key management between clients and other software.</li>\n<li>Developed a FOSS dashboard to manage keys irrespective of the underlying client software (using the Key Manager API)</li>\n<li>Created Smooth, a MEV Smoothing Pool to counterbalance the centralizing forces of the uneven distribution of MEV rewards that makes it that effectively pools with lots of validators end up with higher rewards than the median/expected solo staker. Smooth validators get 104% MORE execution layer rewards (DOUBLE!) than the expected non-smooth solo staker. This is absolutely necessary to make it economically fair for solo stakers and keep promoting decentralization.</li>\n<li>Operation Solo Staker with <a href=\"http://Ether.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ether.fi</a> provided dappnode machines to community members around the world to geographically decentralize the node set of Ethereum and allow them to run validators and get benefits without needing to put the ETH themselves.

This includes documentation, educational videos and a devrel program. Creating a healthy ecosystem around the dappstore will bring value to existing users and expand the reach of the software to other communities.<br>\n• Partnering with Gnosis Chain to bootstrap decentralized validators via a validator incentivization program. We are expected to make grow the number of nodes significantly.<br>\n• Smooth v2, improving on the first design of the MEV Smoothing pool considering the feedback of current users and expand the reach so solo stakers will get better rewards.</p>\n<p>Aside from specific milestones, we would like to keep working on 3 directions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>advocacy and practical solutions implementation to defend decentralization like the Keymanager API, Smooth.</li>\n<li>Technological accessibility - keep improving our software to fulfil our general mission to bring ease of use for the web3 decentralized stack and make it more accessible. Decentralization through good UX.</li>\n<li>Economic accessibility - keep forging partnerships within the ecosystem to bring the economic barriers of entry to Staking down (&lt;32 ETH) to gain users and stakers in regions of the world with less disposable income and increase decentralization.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Moonshot objective for this year are to explore AI integrations. Dappnode, as software that you install in a machine at home that is 24/7 online (needs to be to validate), is perfectly positioned to also be a private local server for personal AI assistants.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"funding-goal-and-budget-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#funding-goal-and-budget-10\"></a>Funding Goal and Budget:</h2>\n<p>Our burn rate is of around 650,000 yearly (yes, we try to keep costs low - missionaries not mercenaries!). Needless to say, if instead of maintaining our current team we could grow, we could advance much faster on the milestones and expand on other activities :).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tell-us-more-about-your-team-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#tell-us-more-about-your-team-11\"></a>Tell us more about your team:</h2>\n<p>Founders:</p>\n<p>Jordi Baylina - OGs know him as part of the WHG who participated in the recovery of funds in The DAO and the Parity multisig hacks.

You have a few nodes in different countries? Political interference resilience. You have nodes in different power grids? You have resilience to power grid failure. In different hardware?

On one side, some of them have bought the Dappnode Hardware, making a contribution with their payment to the team that also builds the software, but that unfortunately is not enough to maintain the project at the current rate of updates in the sector. Our intention is to become sustainable and not to rely on grants, and we believe we can find a non-extractive business model that will leverage web3 characteristics to create truly win-win-win situations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-can-the-octant-team-help-you-with-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#what-can-the-octant-team-help-you-with-20\"></a>What can the Octant team help you with?</h2>\n<p>There are many things we could do to collaborate and help Dappnode:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>With 100,000 ETH staked, it achieves enough smoothing effects to get Execution rewards a lot closer to the average than the median. By joining Smooth with even just a portion of such validators and thousands of Solo Stakers would benefit from exposure to the MEV of the blocks produced by such a big influx of validators, effectively smoothing their rewards to the same level as validator pools and centralized actors. Octant would be contributing to all solo stakers and also to Dappnode in a more long-term sustainable way with the 7% fee on Execution Layer rewards of the pool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Would love to hear more about how Octant is running these validators. At dappnode we can provide you with a turnkey solution to put all or some of these validators in more decentralized setups but without losing control - by distributing machines to team mebmers and using DVT to reduce impact of downtime of some of machines. This would put a substantial amount of ETH validating in completely decentralized setups, being completely ethereum aligned and actively pushing for decentralization while engaging the team to do it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another model is to allow for a contest where we distribute such machines and DVT setups to applicants in different places in the world to achieve maximal geographical decentralization and then move part of Octant’s ETH to validate in these machines. Would love to hop in a call to jam ideas on this!</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-do-you-define-impact-for-your-project-what-metrics-are-you-tracking-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#how-do-you-define-impact-for-your-project-what-metrics-are-you-tracking-21\"></a>How do you define impact for your project? What metrics are you tracking?</h2>\n<p>For Dappnode, impact is defined by how much we can contribute to the decentralization of the web3 infrastructure. Our primary measure of impact would be the number of nodes and validators running on Dappnode, as this directly reflects our mission to make web3 infrastructure accessible to all. We would also consider the geographic distribution of these nodes, as this is a key indicator of the networks that we serve’s resilience to various potential challenges. I say WOULD because since our design principles are decentralization, privacy and self-sovereignty, we actually do not track our users. Some metrics that we can track is how many users self-report as using Dappnode by putting Dappnode in their grafitti and we also track how many validators have decided to share this information with us. That makes around 7400+ validators on Ethereum and more than 20000 on Gnosis Chain. We can’t track the usage of our FOSS at a user level, but we do establish partnerships with companies and networks/foundations: <a href=\"https://dappnode.com/en-us/pages/partners\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dappnodes Partners - Building a Decentralized World</a> We believe that the widespread usage of our software is a testament to its utility and effectiveness. Finally, we monitor the growth and activity of our on-chain product, Smooth, and of the activity in our community. The first directly impacts the smoothing effects and the increase in rewards for Solo Stakers, and the second, the engagement of our community, is crucial to our mission and serves as a barometer for our impact.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"share-your-project-impact-metrics-and-results-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://discuss.octant.app#share-your-project-impact-metrics-and-results-22\"></a>Share your project impact metrics and results</h2>\n<p>Link 1: Graffiti word cloud where we can see the Default validator of Dappnode as one of the top 25 graffitis.

Here we can see that dappnode appears in different variations of the biggest graffitis. Link 3: 14 companies and their partnerships with Dappnode are described in our partners page.
