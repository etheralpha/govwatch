FUD is <a href=\"https://x.com/dankrad/status/1791379755922498027\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">building on Twitter</a> as block builders grow in their influence over the chain’s functioning. Block builders are collecting an <a href=\"https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">uncomfortable amount of capital</a> with each block, yet they provide little to negative value in return. This behavior makes sense: value has been left on the table, so why shouldn’t they collect it? A rational way to stop the growing block builder oligopoly is to enable Ethereum’s on-chain applications to fully capture the value that they create.</p>\n<p>So far, discussions on fixing block builders’ power have focused only on lower-level structural L1 changes<sup><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/execution-tickets/17944\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/state-lock-auctions-towards-collaborative-block-building/18558\">2</a>,<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/exploring-paths-to-a-decentralized-censorship-resistant-and-non-predatory-mev-ecosystem/17312\">3</a></sup>, leaving out the actual source of value creation and leakage: the on-chain applications themselves. The best entity to decide how to fairly distribute the value created from ordering is the entity that is producing the value.

During the 12 seconds between Ethereum’s blocks, the outside world’s valuation of different pieces of state is in flux, creating arbitrage value in the ability to act first on those pieces of state. Block builders make money by exploiting this in the form of acts like CEX-DEX arbitrage. This phenomenon is also observed in traditional finance (TradFi) with the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/130/4/1547/1916146\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">high-speed arms race</a> between high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, which operate in a similar scenario but on a millisecond timeframe instead of seconds.</p>\n<p>As the field of protocol development matures, protocols are starting to manage these value-pressurized pieces of state with varying degrees of success.

Instead of Ethereum’s on-chain protocols capturing the time-accrued value, block builders are. Ethereum’s EVM needs sequencing rules.</p>\n<p>Ethereum’s EVM programming environment is different from an L1 that is specialized for a specific application because it is a shared general execution environment. Applications and transactions share both block space and state with each other. As a result, anyone implementing sequencing rules for an EVM should consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On-chain applications cannot assume a piece of state’s value will not change unless it is explicitly controlled.</li>\n<li>Not all on-chain applications need sequencing.</li>\n<li>Not all actions within an application need sequencing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will now lay out a rough draft version of how one could implement sequencing rules for Ethereum. In order to meet the above considerations, I propose adding two new transaction types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A new ‘bundle’ transaction type. This transaction would be signed by an EOA and would contain a payload of ordered transactions. We’ll call this EOA a bundler.</li>\n<li>A new transaction type that specifies the bundler (just an EOA) that is able to include the transaction in a bundle.</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/3/b376ab484f0a2eaa09bcb254d7f12439f442621d.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/b376ab484f0a2eaa09bcb254d7f12439f442621d\" title=\"IMG_0025\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/3/b376ab484f0a2eaa09bcb254d7f12439f442621d_2_689x500.png\" alt=\"IMG_0025\" data-base62-sha1=\"pBBIiDg19vfKNLGcdpmPWsWroPr\" width=\"689\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/3/b376ab484f0a2eaa09bcb254d7f12439f442621d_2_689x500.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/3/b376ab484f0a2eaa09bcb254d7f12439f442621d_2_1033x750.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/3/b376ab484f0a2eaa09bcb254d7f12439f442621d_2_1378x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F3EA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>EVM block construction would be modified to enforce the following rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bundler can only have a single bundle transaction included in a block, and optionally, a bundle is only valid in a certain block. Some business applications would benefit from being able to run bundles in only certain blocks.</li>\n<li>A bundle can specify a bundler that is able to include it in a bundle, for meta-bundle programming.</li>\n<li>A transaction can only be included in a bundle if it specifies bundler, and if a transaction specifies a bundler, the transaction can only be included in a block if it is in a bundle. This is to prevent bundles from clashing with each other, which would cause builders to have extra incentive to include one bundler over another.</li>\n<li>Unlike Ethereum’s current block builder’s bundle interface, transactions in a bundle do not have any non-revert guarantees. On-chain application logic must handle possible reverts. This is again to prevent bundles from clashing with each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The EVM itself would be modified to include the new following global variables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>bundle.signer</code>: the EOA who signed the bundle. Useful for on-chain applications to designate sequencing rights to a specific off-chain entity. The zero address if not in a bundle.</li>\n<li><code>bundle.number</code>: the global number of the bundle’s ordering. Useful for meta-bundle programming. Zero if not in a bundle.</li>\n<li><code>bundle.tx_number</code>: which number this transaction is in the bundle. Useful for on-chain applications to enable special logic depending on transaction sequence. Zero if not in a bundle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These new EVM rules and global variables could be a strong starting point for on-chain applications to express how they’d like to be sequenced.</p>\n<p>There are numerous security and caveats to consider in this implementation. EVM bundle creators would need to take care to only sequence on state that they directly control from the start of the block. This is because all other state is potentially manipulatable by outside entities. Bundle creators would have to assume that all transactions could revert due to insufficient gas funds, that any piece of unprotected state could be changed, and that any starting point besides its own external functions are non-deterministic. Sequencing rule assumptions about mutable state could be a new class of audit vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, these rules or language expansions do not preclude block builders existing or making money. Bundlers could construct multiple bundles and rely on block building services to take advantage of the highest result. Inter-bundle arbitrage could be a new solver target. Analogous to the EVM global variables proposed above, <code>tx.number</code> could be included to allow block builders to explicitly sell the right to be the first transaction included.</p>\n<p>Notably, this implementation lacks specification on how on-chain applications would construct bundles. This would be up to the applications to chose between different trust and privacy tradeoffs. Some options would include using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flashbot’s <a href=\"https://suave-alpha.flashbots.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Suave</a> TEE enabled decentralized platform for business applications needing confidential compute.</li>\n<li>A sequencing layer, like <a href=\"https://x.com/AstriaOrg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Astria</a>, to construct generic bundles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"sequencing-rules-an-example-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#sequencing-rules-an-example-4\"></a>Sequencing Rules: An Example</h2>\n<p>I came up with the above Ethereum compatible sequencing rule proposal while trying to program a <a href=\"https://github.com/Lilyjjo/tldr-research\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">first swap auction for a AMM on Ethereum</a>. This proof of concept aims to implement the sequencing rule ‘the first swap should be auctioned’ for the sake of rerouting some of the CEX-DEX arbitrage back to the pool’s LPs. It utilizes block builder’s current <a href=\"https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_sendbundle\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bundle infrastructure</a> to craft bundles and inserts logic on-chain via a signed transaction to enforce that the bundle’s sequence is respected. This proof of concept uses Flashbot’s SUAVE TEE enabled programming environment to craft bundles for the AMM in a trust-reduced manner. This implementation could be easily rewritten with the above EVM native bundle proposal with much better execution costs and guarantees.</p>\n<p>I wrote this post because I’m a frustrated protocol developer who wants to capture the maximal value for my actual users.

By including data assertions in user operations, bundlers are supported in the pre-validate certain aspects of the transactions. This pre-validation can help identify and filter out operations with a high risk of reverting during execution. This reduces the chances of sequencers including such operations in blocks, lowering the overall revert risk. VCs and EAs provide cryptographic proofs that can be verified by sequencers. These proofs can increase trust in the validity of the operations, making sequencers more confident about including them in blocks.</p>\n<p>This has potential positive consequences in terms of reducing risk of penalties for block builders. . Data assertions containing proofs about transaction ordering can help sequencers resist such manipulation attempts, potentially reducing penalties for block builders who are susceptible to MEV.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of data assertions in reducing reverts and penalties depends on factors like network assertation standardization and native account abstraction adoption but using VCs and EAs in a shared mempool with ERC-4337 could be considered as first step to it and has the potential to significantly reduce the risk of on-chain reverts and penalties for sequencers and block builders.</p>\n<p>Overall, the complexity of implementing and maintaining new verification logic for bundlers may be compensated by an overall better synergy with the other actors in the network. Specifically on the logic side, general standards like did:pkh or did:dis could find common ground of assessment. In fact, the same verification logic is standards practice for user authentication where user store different assertation on the identity within the wallet application. Extending the same logic approach into the context of smart contract accounts we would suggest for bundlers to store data processing assertation into the mempool of future transactions until consolidated finality is reached.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/unified-erc-4337-mempool\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The same verification and validation logic could be extended into a future unified mempool once potentially account abstraction would be natively implemented following 7560/7562 rules.</a></p>\n<p>Including proofs of VCs or EAs adds data to user operations, potentially leading to larger bundles and higher gas costs. This can put pressure on mempool capacity. Utilizing Merkle proofs within VCs can allow bundlers to verify the inclusion of specific data elements without needing the entire credential, reducing the amount of data processed. Merkle trees are a cryptographic data structure that allows for efficient verification of the membership of a specific data element within a larger set.</p>\n<p>After user authentication, for each user operation, the bundler includes a Merkle proof. This proof is a concise piece of data that demonstrates the specific assertion’s inclusion within the Merkle tree of the entire bundle. This can significantly reducing the overall size of the bundle compared to including the full VCs or EAs.</p>\n<p>VCs and EAs still remain crucial for containing the actual data and claims associated with user operations. Merkle proof act as a verification tool. They provide a concise way to prove that a specific VC or EA exists within a larger bundle of assertions without revealing the entire content of the VC/EA itself. This may help mitigate pressure on the mempool and potentially lowers gas costs.</p>\n<p>This would imply for bundlers to access a privacy preserving shared mempool ID and establish a dedicated membership set for associated bundle of transactions, so that Sequencers can verify the inclusion of user operations in the bundle. Sequencers or other network participants can efficiently verify the validity of data assertions using the Merkle proofs. They only need to verify the proof itself, not the entire data within the assertion, reducing the computational burden.</p>\n<p>VCs and EAs rely on the underlying logic verification process for authentication and authorization that should be implemented by bundlers. Verifying VCs or EAs requires processing cryptographic proofs. This can be computationally expensive for bundlers, especially for complex assertions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Merkle proofs can be combined with ZKPs for a powerful solution.</a> ZKPs can be used within the data assertions themselves to prove the validity of claims without revealing the underlying data. Merkle proofs ensure the integrity of the bundle and verify the inclusion of specific assertions with ZKPs within the bundle. Also, using ZKPs in VCs or EAs could reduce the amount of data included in the bundle, minimizing disclosure, and lowering computational costs.</p>\n<p>Combining SSI verification with AA provides Ethereum a customizable authorization logic that can leverage national data repositories and business and regulatory standards before easily executing global on-chain operations. In this context, embedding a trust less verification logic can support standardizing user operations and streamlining sequencing activities, and so harmonizing operations across L2 transactions for unlocking cross chain atomic transaction and still ensuring efficient data processing compliant with data minimization.</p>\n<p>The transaction generation, submission and execution flow can be represented with an interchained process of triangles of trust representing each moment as described here.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/5/9/59de19ba811e1c197dd1ceae746710c91cc67a60.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/59de19ba811e1c197dd1ceae746710c91cc67a60\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/9/59de19ba811e1c197dd1ceae746710c91cc67a60_2_690x387.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"cP0lguLi3ptJs9Qwj3gBnVd1dlK\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/9/59de19ba811e1c197dd1ceae746710c91cc67a60_2_690x387.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/9/59de19ba811e1c197dd1ceae746710c91cc67a60_2_1035x580.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/5/9/59de19ba811e1c197dd1ceae746710c91cc67a60.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"0B0B0B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The market pushing for an evolution of networks towards to modular blockchains is proposing concepts of shared mempools and shared sequencing that can embed trustless verification logic typical of SSI systems to establish a root of trust from user authentication until block validation still relying on Ethereum main network as indisputable security layer.</p>\n<p>This combination minimizes data disclosure while maintaining efficient verification, making the system more scalable and privacy-preserving.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@haichen/keystore\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Key store contract</a> <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@haichen/keystore\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">for flexible and efficient key management system</a></strong></p>\n<p>To further enhance standardization and interoperability considering key management an important function to manage user authentication and transaction authorization.

Bundlers share the respective merkle proofs, and ZKPs to Sequencer and submit bundle of transactions to Smart Contract Account (entry point).</li>\n<li>Sequencers verify the Merkle proofs and the ZKPs related to the VCs/EAs and Smart contract Account validate bundles of transactions submitting the bundles to Block-builder for the new block.</li>\n<li>The keystore contract and rollup handle key management for user authentication, transaction submission, validation (1-4-6) and eventually key recovery.</li>\n<li>Sequencers batch bundle of transactions in the new block and submit in batches of bundles of transactions through Roll up contract for validation on L1and which are verified by ZK validity proof (commitments).</li>\n<li>Roll up contract validate ZK proofs of batches and block builder finalize block or revert in case of non-validation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Specifically in this scenario, proposals as ERC 5792 acts as a crucial bridge between user-facing applications and the infrastructure of the ERC-4337 framework. The proposal defines a common language for wallets, apps, and bundlers to communicate each other and it has the potential to significantly enhance the adoption of Smart Contract Accounts and position as the go-to standard for data assertions on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>Wallets and apps could signal user preferences (e.g., gas fees, preferred chain ID, or shared sequencer), required data assertions (VCs/EAs) for specific transactions.</p>\n<p>Bundlers could leverage the received signals to automatically construct appropriate bundles for user transactions including user operations data, Merkle proofs for associated VCs/EAs and ZKP of user data claim.

The proposed market aims to align incentives between Ethereum and rollups, mitigate operational risks associated with rollups, and promote voluntary participation and fair competition among rollups, proposers, and builders.</p>\n<p>The unique design allows rollups to act as preconf providers, offering users fast preconfirmation while minimizing censorship, sandwich attacks, and frontrunning risks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>For the full proposal, please refer to the complete <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/tariz.eth/-TZxI3AplP-O11i-yTnyfPjwiaPOUvaWOZ32xqbpnQE\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">blog post</a>. This summary covers only the key design aspects.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>If rollups, acting as preconf providers, pay proposers to pre-purchase the block building rights for specific slots, they can deterministically promise settlement to users by owning the Ethereum block. This mechanism allows rollups to achieve fast preconfirmation through self-sequencing. However, the difficulty in predicting future block prices introduces operational risks for rollups. To offset these operational risks and create a fair market that encourages active participation from traders, I propose a series of derivatives.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This idea is connected to the implementation of delegated preconf mentioned in <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/justindrake\">@JustinDrake</a> <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353\">based preconfirmation</a>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1><a name=\"forward-contract-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#forward-contract-3\"></a><strong>Forward Contract</strong></h1>\n<p>The process of a rollup purchasing the block building rights for a specific slot from a proposer can be likened to a forward contract in financial markets. To understand the operational risks a rollup might face in this transaction, let’s consider a basic scenario involving a 32-slot lookahead for the proposer and a slot auction.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At t = 1, the rollup participates in a slot auction to purchase a forward contract with the proposer for a specific slot.</li>\n<li>From t = 2 onwards, after securing the slot, the rollup sequences its users’ transactions, providing preconfirmation to users and generating revenue from the block.</li>\n<li>At t = 3, the rollup requests the execution of the forward contract, compressing its transactions into an Ethereum block and submitting them to the proposer.</li>\n<li>At t = 4, the proposer fulfills the contract by signing the received block and proposing it on Ethereum.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Operational Risks for Rollups</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Excessive Payment Risk</strong>: Rollups may find it challenging to accurately predict block value, leading to overpayment for block space. This occurs because they have to participate in slot auctions and purchase the entire space even if they only need a portion for settlement.</li>\n<li><strong>Revenue Uncertainty</strong>: Rollups cannot reliably predict their future revenue. If transaction costs exceed revenue, they may face potential financial risks.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Labor Costs</strong>: To ensure stable operations, rollups must now engage in activities such as predicting Ethereum block values, competing with builders, and accurately forecasting revenues, which were previously unnecessary.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"derivative-market-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#derivative-market-4\"></a>Derivative Market</h1>\n<p>To mitigate the operational risks faced by rollups, we propose a derivatives market involving specialized participants, builders. This market includes two key derivatives: a forward contract between the builder and the proposer, and a swap contract between the rollup and the builder.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At t = 1, the builder participates in a slot auction and enters into a forward contract with the proposer for the block building right.</li>\n<li>At t = 2, the rollup and the builder enter into a swap contract. This contract obligates the builder to include the rollup’s transactions in the block.</li>\n<li>At t = 3, utilizing the block building right secured through the swap contract, the builder constructs the rollup block up until t = 4, thereby generating revenue.</li>\n<li>At t = 4, the rollup demands contract fulfillment according to the obligations stipulated in the swap contract:\n<ul>\n<li>The rollup requires the builder to include its transactions in the Ethereum block secured through the forward contract.</li>\n<li>To maximize revenue, the builder places the rollup’s transactions at the bottom of the Ethereum block and its own transactions at the top, forming a complete block.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>At t = 5, the builder delivers the Ethereum block to the proposer, who then proposes it on Ethereum, fulfilling the forward contract.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Motivation for Participation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rollup</strong>: Rollups participate to provide deterministic preconfirmation to users regarding their inclusion in Ethereum, while mitigating the operational risks associated with purchasing block space. Preconfirmed transactions are guaranteed inclusion in the Ethereum block, avoiding the risk of spending more than their revenue on block space. This eliminates the need for unnecessary labor in price prediction and auction participation.</li>\n<li><strong>Builder</strong>: Builders participate to reduce the risk of overpayment from slot auctions. The secured Ethereum block space, along with the rollup block, offers dual revenue streams, diversifying and reducing the risk of loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Proposer</strong>: Proposers participate to receive compensation for rollup preconfirmation. Builders consider the revenue generated from rollup blocks when bidding in slot auctions, aligning proposer incentives with rollup settlement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"additional-design-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#additional-design-5\"></a><strong>Additional Design</strong></h1>\n<p>To effectively implement these financial products, it is crucial to create an environment where all participants can compete fairly and engage actively. This involves three key additional design elements.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Swap Contract</strong></p>\n<p>Rollups may be hesitant to participate if they are required to allocate all potential revenue opportunities to builders through a swap contract. To encourage rollup participation, a conditional swap contract is proposed.</p>\n<p>In this arrangement, if the builder generates profits from the rollup’s block building that exceed the fixed costs paid in the forward contract with the proposer, the rollup is allowed to stop providing the remaining block space to the builder. The rollup can then use the remaining block space to either build independently or auction it to builders for additional revenue.</p>\n<p>This approach preserves the builder’s incentive to participate while protecting the rollup’s opportunity to generate revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>Competitive Proposer Market</strong></p>\n<p>Settlement is essential for rollups to inherit Ethereum’s security. When rollups are compelled to purchase blocks, proposers/builders gain significant pricing power, potentially leading to an uneven playing field that undermines market fairness and efficiency.</p>\n<p>To reduce the pricing power of any single builder, multiple builders should be encouraged to participate in swap transactions, fostering competition among them. This requires expanding the forward contract market to include multiple proposers with block building rights for different slots.</p>\n<p>Such a structure ensures that the variable value of the rollup’s block aligns more closely with the fixed cost of acquiring Ethereum block space. This is analogous to achieving a ‘par value’ of zero for swap contracts in a competitive market, maintaining reasonable costs for rollups. The lookahead necessary to achieve this par value requires further discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>Syndicated Rollup Strategy: Derivatives for All Rollups</strong></p>\n<p>Builders may be unwilling to engage with rollups that have relatively low block value, potentially marginalizing app-specific rollups in the market.</p>\n<p>The Syndicated Rollup Strategy groups multiple rollups into a syndicate, enhancing their market participation. Cross-rollup arbitrage has the potential to increase the value of each block. Builders receive the block building rights for the rollups in the group, and the rollups require the builder to include all group transactions in the Ethereum block.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"building-blocks-in-rollups-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#building-blocks-in-rollups-6\"></a><strong>Building Blocks in Rollups</strong></h1>\n<p>This section describes how builders secure rollup block building rights through swap contracts, focusing on censorship resistance and fast preconfirmation for user-centric rollups.</p>\n<p><strong>Censorship Resistance</strong></p>\n<p>In a structure similar to Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), rollups that enter into swap contracts receive blocks from builders and execute them. However, this setup may expose users to censorship, sandwich attacks, and frontrunning by builders. Rollups can address these issues by integrating Radius’s <a href=\"https://docs.theradius.xyz/testnet/curie-testnet/encrypted-mempool\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sequencing engine</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Encrypted Mempool (using <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/radius-skde-enhancing-rollup-composability-with-trustless-sequencing/19185\">delay encryption</a>)</strong>: Users’ transactions are encrypted until the promise of inclusion in the rollup block is issued.</li>\n<li><strong>Decryption and Execution</strong>: Once inclusion is confirmed, transactions are decrypted and executed by the rollup, providing preconfirmation similar to standard transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Order Guarantees</strong>: By assigning an order to the inclusion promises, the economic guarantees ensure that transactions cannot be reordered after decryption, minimizing the risk of frontrunning and sandwich attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fast Preconfirmation</strong></p>\n<p>Rollups can achieve fast preconfirmation by designating the preconf provider as their sequencer and implementing self-sequencing. Block space is divided into two segments: Top-of-Block (ToB) and Bottom-of-Block (BoB).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/2/d23430465b0f7160e93904427eba688aef1fff2f.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/d23430465b0f7160e93904427eba688aef1fff2f\" title=\"스크린샷 2024-05-07 오후 12.44.26\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/2/d23430465b0f7160e93904427eba688aef1fff2f_2_690x366.png\" alt=\"스크린샷 2024-05-07 오후 12.44.26\" data-base62-sha1=\"tZy56lMBexmrb7iz0LDznXskJiv\" width=\"690\" height=\"366\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/2/d23430465b0f7160e93904427eba688aef1fff2f_2_690x366.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/2/d23430465b0f7160e93904427eba688aef1fff2f_2_1035x549.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/2/d23430465b0f7160e93904427eba688aef1fff2f.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E8E7E6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Top-of-Block (ToB)</strong>: This space is allocated to the builder under the swap contract.

To achieve this, we first identify potential attacks under the current fork-choice specification and suggest strategies to counter them. This analysis assumes familiarity with <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/d29581315579d37064abf21b174750f9d5c099c0/specs/phase0/fork-choice.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the current fork-choice</a> and <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@luca-zanolini/Skf98kZ_i\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">known attacks</a>, and with <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/d29581315579d37064abf21b174750f9d5c099c0/specs/_features/eip7594/das-core.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PeerDAS</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"distribution-phase-and-sampling-phase-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#distribution-phase-and-sampling-phase-1\"></a>Distribution phase and sampling phase</h2>\n<p>Recall that in <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/peerdas-a-simpler-das-approach-using-battle-tested-p2p-components/16541\">PeerDas</a>, each blob is individually extended horizontally, stacked vertically and subdivided in <code>NUM_COLUMNS</code> columns, which are used as the sampling unit. PeerDas comprises two phases: a distribution phase and a sampling phase. In the distribution phase, columns are allocated among subsets of validators, with each subset tasked with the custody of one or more columns (<code>CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT</code>). Subsequently, in the sampling phase, validators request samples to verify data availability. These samples, or columns, are acquired from peers through a request/response mechanism. The distribution phase can also serve as a kind of preliminary sampling phase, enabling a validator to consider data available if all the columns it’s required to custody are available, even before completing the actual sampling phase. This proves especially valuable when employing a <em>trailing fork-choice</em> function, a concept explaned further below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tight-fork-choice-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#tight-fork-choice-2\"></a>Tight fork-choice</h2>\n<p>Ideally, <em>almost</em> all honest validators would ever only vote for blocks that are fully available, without needing to download all of the data. To achieve this, we can require a sufficiently high amount of sampling to be completed before ever voting for a block. We refer to this as the <em>tight fork-choice</em>. In PeerDAS, this would mean that validators are required to perform peer sampling immediately upon receiving a block, and cannot vote for it without completing it. This gives us a useful property, which we call <em><span class=\"math\">\\delta</span>-safety of sampling</em>, for some <span class=\"math\">\\delta \\in [0,1/2]</span> dependent on the amount of sampling (<span class=\"math\">\\delta \\to 0</span> as number of samples increases)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\delta</span>-safety of sampling: If some data is less than half-available, at most a fraction <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span> of the honest validators will perceive it as available. As a consequence, no more than a fraction <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span> of the honest validators would vote for an unavailable block.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a name=\"trailing-fork-choice-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#trailing-fork-choice-3\"></a>Trailing fork-choice</h2>\n<p>However, to avoid additional steps between the distribution of blocks and columns and voting, one might consider relaxing this requirement, with the goal of taking peer sampling out of the critical path. Specifically, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/peerdas-a-simpler-das-approach-using-battle-tested-p2p-components/16541#a-note-on-fork-choice-14\">it has been proposed</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/3652\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">is still being discussed</a>, that validators could forego completing the peer sampling process before casting a vote for the currently proposed block, and postpone it until the next slot (or even further in the future). Instead, they would base their vote on the outcome of the column distribution; if all the data within its assigned subnets is available, a validator deems the entire block available and votes accordingly. Peer sampling for this block would then only be required to be completed before the next slot. We refer to this as <em>the trailing fork-choice</em>.</p>\n<p>Using the trailing fork-choice does not necessarily mean entirely giving up on <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span>-safety of sampling, even during the “trailing period”. In fact, incorporating a sufficient amount of <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/subnetdas-an-intermediate-das-approach/17169\"><em>subnet sampling</em></a> in the column distribution phase allows us to preserve some level of <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span>-safety. In practice, we will do less subnet sampling than we would peer sampling, because subnet sampling is more bandwidth intensive due to the gossip amplification factor it incurs. Therefore, the <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span>-safety from subnet sampling will be for a higher <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span> than for peer sampling, meaning that a higher percentage of honest validators can be tricked into voting incorrectly.</p>\n<p>When discussing the trailing fork-choice in the rest of the document, we are going to use <span class=\"math\">\\delta_p</span> to refer to the <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span>-safety of peer sampling, and <span class=\"math\">\\delta_s</span> to refer to that of subnet sampling. We also going to assume that <span class=\"math\">\\delta_s \\gg \\delta_p</span>, i.e., that the safety loss from peer sampling is negligible compared to the safety loss from subnet sampling.</p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"attacks-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#attacks-4\"></a>Attacks</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"refresher-ex-ante-reorgs-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#refresher-ex-ante-reorgs-5\"></a>Refresher: Ex-ante reorgs</h3>\n<p>Ex-ante reorg attacks are a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11326\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">well-known</a> threat to the current Ethereum consensus protocol. An adversary controlling a significant fraction of validators can influence the blockchain’s canonical chain through strategic block withholding. In this attack, the adversary privately constructs blocks and orchestrates votes among its validators across multiple slots, ultimately outvoting honest blocks upon their release. This can happen either by overcoming proposer boost with a well-timed release of the withheld blocks and attestations, or by directly overcoming the votes of honest validators.</p>\n<p>We now show an instance of the former strategy, where adversarial blocks <span class=\"math\">B</span> and <span class=\"math\">C</span> are withheld together with adversarial attestations comprising 21% of each committee. An honest proposer extends block <span class=\"math\">A</span> with block <span class=\"math\">D</span>, and the adversary then reveals the withheld objects before the attestation deadline. Since the adversarial votes outweigh proposer boost, the honest block does not get voted and is orphaned.</p>\n\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/8/4/84b2e4a3709361e8d59950234884b8efc69ca94d.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/84b2e4a3709361e8d59950234884b8efc69ca94d\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/8/4/84b2e4a3709361e8d59950234884b8efc69ca94d_2_690x230.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"iVUiM6YAuJbuLjxCcmMKSZN6SId\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/8/4/84b2e4a3709361e8d59950234884b8efc69ca94d_2_690x230.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/8/4/84b2e4a3709361e8d59950234884b8efc69ca94d_2_1035x345.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/8/4/84b2e4a3709361e8d59950234884b8efc69ca94d_2_1380x460.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F6F1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>These attacks remain viable even with the addition of DAS, and in fact can become more effective because of it, as we discuss in the upcoming sections.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposer-sees-unavailable-attesters-see-available-enhanced-ex-ante-reorgs-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#proposer-sees-unavailable-attesters-see-available-enhanced-ex-ante-reorgs-6\"></a>Proposer sees <em>unavailable</em>, attesters see <em>available</em>: enhanced ex-ante reorgs</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"with-the-tight-fork-choice-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#with-the-tight-fork-choice-7\"></a>With the tight fork-choice</h4>\n<p>The adversary is able to somewhat strengthen the ex-ante reorg attack from the previous section, by leveraging the fraction <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span> of honest validators which it can trick into thinking that an unavailable block is available.

For example, if <span class=\"math\">\\delta_s</span> is 20%, a 10% attacker could do such a reorg about 100 times a day, instead of only about once a day. Even worse, <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/d29581315579d37064abf21b174750f9d5c099c0/specs/_features/eip7594/das-core.md#custody-setting\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">with the current parameters of the PeerDAS spec</a>, an attacker controlling a single proposer can perform a reorg! This is because <code>CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT</code>, the minimum number of subnets that a validator participates in, is set to 1, which makes <span class=\"math\">\\delta_s</span> nearly 50%. For example, the attacker can make the data available in 15 out of the 32 subnets, and convince all validators in those subnets to vote for their unavailable block, overcoming proposer boost.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"mitigation-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#mitigation-9\"></a>Mitigation</h5>\n<p>As already discussed <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/from-4844-to-danksharding-a-path-to-scaling-ethereum-da/18046#possible-fork-choice-attack-vectors-9\">here</a>, this attack vector can be mitigated by attesters of slot <span class=\"math\">n+1</span> complete peer sampling 10s into slot <span class=\"math\">n</span>, while the proposer can keep trying to sample until they propose. If the proposer extends a block which an attester sees as unavailable, they try to sample again. This is in spirit much like <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/view-merge-as-a-replacement-for-proposer-boost/13739\">view-merge</a>, but does not require any extra message in the proposal. In the previously described attacks, this mitigation would make it so that the attesters of slot 4 do not see <span class=\"math\">B</span> as available <em>unless the proposer of <span class=\"math\">D</span> does as well</em>: either the proposer sees <span class=\"math\">B</span> as available and <span class=\"math\">D</span> extends <span class=\"math\">C</span>, or the proposer sees <span class=\"math\">B</span> as unavailable <em>and so do attesters</em>. In either case, they vote for <span class=\"math\">D</span>.</p>\n<p>This mitigation has the downside of worsening the timing assumptions around peer sampling, reducing the benefits of the trailing fork-choice. Still, if this was the only fork-choice problem caused by DAS, we might be ok with solving it this way and otherwise keeping things as is. The next attack does not seem to have such a simple mitigation, and motivates our desire to move to the <em>(block, slot)</em> fork-choice to more effectively address the attack vectors related to (un)availability.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposer-sees-available-attesters-see-unavailable-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#proposer-sees-available-attesters-see-unavailable-10\"></a>Proposer sees <em>available</em>, attesters see <em>unavailable</em></h3>\n<h4><a name=\"targeted-data-release-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#targeted-data-release-11\"></a>Targeted data release</h4>\n<p>The attack is going to rely on being able to convince an honest proposer that an unavailable block is available, <em>even after it performs peer sampling for it</em>. How realistic this assumption is depends on how exactly peer sampling is performed. For example, suppose that nodes whose sampling queries fail just try again with other peers. Then, if the adversary wants to target a specific proposer, it has to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Link the proposer’s validator identity to a node</li>\n<li>Ensure that it controls at least one peer of the node, and advertise that it custodies all of the columns</li>\n<li>Make all of the data unavailable</li>\n<li>Wait for the node to send sampling query to the peer it controls, after having failed with other peers, and respond to all of them.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"tricking-an-honest-proposer-into-extending-an-unavailable-chain-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#tricking-an-honest-proposer-into-extending-an-unavailable-chain-12\"></a>Tricking an honest proposer into extending an unavailable chain</h4>\n<p>Given this capability, the adversary can manipulate an honest proposer into extending an unavailable chain, leading to their block being reorged. <em>In this scenario, we only assume that the adversary controls two successive proposers</em>, in this case for slots 2 and 3, respectively. The sequence of events unfolds as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The adversary only publishes a single unavailable block <span class=\"math\">B</span> during slot 2 and does not publish any block in slot 3.</li>\n<li>Importantly, the adversary convinces the proposer for slot 4 that <span class=\"math\">B</span> is available.

To clarify, with this modification, we consider votes for a block <span class=\"math\">A</span> as votes for pairs (block, slot) (rather than just votes for block <span class=\"math\">A</span>).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/c/a/ca8ed21df874838328758b89a3fbd77b2e0897d0.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/ca8ed21df874838328758b89a3fbd77b2e0897d0\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/a/ca8ed21df874838328758b89a3fbd77b2e0897d0_2_690x381.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"sTUrlEXOZ2W3qmI9wceLzoNkwj6\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"381\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/a/ca8ed21df874838328758b89a3fbd77b2e0897d0_2_690x381.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/a/ca8ed21df874838328758b89a3fbd77b2e0897d0_2_1035x571.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/a/ca8ed21df874838328758b89a3fbd77b2e0897d0_2_1380x762.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In the figure above, we show the difference between the current fork-choice (left) and the (block, slot) fork-choice (right), in the case when a block <span class=\"math\">B</span> is proposed a bit late.

When such instances occur, the scheme intervenes by aiding potential non-empty blocks in accumulating the necessary attestations. As these supported blocks successfully advance the chain, the backoff mechanism is gradually deactivated. This gradual deactivation process continues until the system reaches a state where the backoff mechanism is no longer necessary.</p>\n<p>The activation and deactivation of the backoff mechanism are represented by the <code>backoff_status</code>, which is created and updated within <code>get_head</code>. Crucially, if two honest validators are on the same path while executing <code>get_head</code>, they will share identical backoff statuses. This means that, under synchrony, for honest validators selecting the same branch of the block tree, the backoff mechanism is synchronized, activating and deactivating simultaneously. In the spec linked above, <em>an active backoff has the effect of delaying by one slot the counting of votes for the empty slot</em>: votes for <span class=\"math\">A</span> only count for the empty slot <span class=\"math\">(A,s)</span> if they are <em>at least from slot <span class=\"math\">s+1</span></em>. In other words, we take all votes <em>directly</em> for empty slots and move them back by one slot: votes to <span class=\"math\">(A,t+1)</span> count for <span class=\"math\">(A,t)</span>, votes for <span class=\"math\">(A,t+2)</span> count for <span class=\"math\">(A,t+1)</span> etc… For example, look at the green attestations, which vote for <span class=\"math\">A</span> at slot <span class=\"math\">t+1</span>. When the backoff is not active, these contribute weight to <span class=\"math\">(A,t+1)</span> (more precisely, are counted by <code>get_empty_slot_weight</code> when run at slot <span class=\"math\">t+1</span> with <span class=\"math\">A</span> being <code>head</code>), but when the backoff is active they go back to only contributing to <span class=\"math\">(A,t)</span>. Same goes for the orange attestations to <span class=\"math\">(A,t+2)</span>, which only contribute to <span class=\"math\">(A,t+1)</span> when the backoff is active.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/1/d/1d83659c84d77e80dfbd0579a3b7a776c1f25faa.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/1d83659c84d77e80dfbd0579a3b7a776c1f25faa\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/d/1d83659c84d77e80dfbd0579a3b7a776c1f25faa_2_690x304.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"4d5mwjp8bogYY1MVjwaUqzrKxUS\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/d/1d83659c84d77e80dfbd0579a3b7a776c1f25faa_2_690x304.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/d/1d83659c84d77e80dfbd0579a3b7a776c1f25faa_2_1035x456.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/d/1d83659c84d77e80dfbd0579a3b7a776c1f25faa_2_1380x608.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F9F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In the next figure, network latency is high, and all block proposals are late by a few seconds, so they never get any votes.

Instead, they will vote for the empty block. With this, we would hope to achieve a stronger property than <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span>-safety of sampling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the validator set is <span class=\"math\">&gt; \\frac{1}{2(1-\\delta)}</span> honest and the network is synchronous, no unavailable block is ever in the canonical chain of any honest validator</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reasoning seems simple: if a block <span class=\"math\">B</span> is unavailable at a given time when the fork-choice is being run, than <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span>-safety of sampling ensures that at most a fraction <span class=\"math\">\\delta</span> of the honest validators in the committee of any previous slot could have voted for it. In particular, at least <span class=\"math\">1-\\delta</span> of the honest validators of <span class=\"math\">B</span>'s proposal slot would have voted for the empty slot. If <span class=\"math\">&gt; \\frac{1}{2(1-\\delta)}</span> of the validators are honest, then this is <span class=\"math\">&gt; \\frac{1}{2}</span> of the validators, and the empty slot would have a majority and win.</p>\n<p><em>Things are unfortunately not actually so simple.</em> In the above, we have made the assumption that validators that do not vote for <span class=\"math\">B</span> will instead vote “for the empty slot”. In fact, there could be multiple “empty slots” to vote for, if there is already a chain split, for example caused by a balancing attack, as in the left figure below. The honest votes then get split among multiple branches, and an unavailable block can still “look” canonical to validators that have been tricked into seeing it as available. Another way to achieve the same thing is by equivocating with available blocks and an unavailable block, to split most of the honest votes between the available ones, instead of having them go to the empty block, as in the right figure below.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/3/3/339a3e61a64ac47087c23992f0123a283cededdf.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/339a3e61a64ac47087c23992f0123a283cededdf\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/3/339a3e61a64ac47087c23992f0123a283cededdf_2_690x416.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"7muOCOdUET2eOsOekd9nrd63PFZ\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/3/339a3e61a64ac47087c23992f0123a283cededdf_2_690x416.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/3/339a3e61a64ac47087c23992f0123a283cededdf_2_1035x624.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/3/339a3e61a64ac47087c23992f0123a283cededdf_2_1380x832.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F9F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"a-direction-for-further-improvement-the-majority-fork-choice-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#a-direction-for-further-improvement-the-majority-fork-choice-18\"></a>A direction for further improvement: the majority fork-choice</h3>\n<p>It is not at the moment clear whether it is possible to completely eliminate this attack vector with “known tools” (we consider the (block, slot) fork-choice such, since it has been discussed for years, though not implemented). One potentially promising direction is to do something akin to (block, slot) but even a bit more extreme: at slot <span class=\"math\">t</span> in the <code>get_head</code> loop, we could find the <code>best_child</code> and then pit it against <em>all of the voting weight from slots <span class=\"math\">\\ge t</span> which did not vote on the <code>best_child</code>’s subtree</em>. In other words, we require a block from slot <span class=\"math\">t</span> to have a majority of all attesting weight from slots <span class=\"math\">\\ge t</span>. This way, it wouldn’t matter if the adversary finds ways to split honest votes: <em>a vote is against a block whenever it could have been for it but isn’t</em>.</p>\n<p>This would very clearly gives us the stronger property we previously wished for, because an unavailable block would need to get a majority of each committee’s weight in order to win out against the empty slot. The challenge is making sure that such a change does not break anything else in subtle ways, worsen known attacks, or make it much easier to stall liveness.</p>\n<p>You can find the preliminary spec changes from the previous (block, slot) spec to the majority fork-choice <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/commit/baece58837fcfc745443a7144f2558463d6ff5b9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.

In this context, cryptographic anchoring is the process through which a node in the network is able to verify that the data they are looking at is both well formed <strong>and</strong> that it represents data that belongs in the network.  An example of this would be an ommer header, which would be well formed and would pass validation as a viable header, but it should not be stored in our networks since it is not canonical.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ssz-objects-mapped-to-a-dht-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#ssz-objects-mapped-to-a-dht-2\"></a>SSZ objects mapped to a DHT</h2>\n<p>For the SSZ object in question, we first compute the SSZ root hash which we’ll refer to as the <code>PrimaryRoot</code>.</p>\n<p>Next, we serialize the object into it’s encoded representation, a stream of bytes.  We then compute a second SSZ root hash using the ssz schema of a simple <code>List[uint8, max_length=...]</code>.  This second root hash will be referred to as the <code>FlattenedRoot</code>.</p>\n<p>The bytes of the encoded SSZ object can then be mapped 1:1 onto the DHT keyspace based on the position of the bytes with respect to the total encoded length, with the 0th byte being mapped to the <code>0x00..00</code> location in the network, and the <code>nth</code> byte being mapped to the node-id that corresponds to <code>(2**256 -1) / n</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In our setup, our individual nodes are able to trust that <code>FlattenedRoot</code> and <code>PrimaryRoot</code> both represent the same data.  However, it seems this scheme would allow for nodes in the network to perform verification against both roots if desired.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a name=\"gossip-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#gossip-3\"></a>Gossip</h3>\n<p>In order for nodes to accept a sequence of bytes for storage during the gossip process they must be able to verify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The location in the network that the bytes belong.</li>\n<li>That the bytes are cryptographically anchored to the respective ssz roots <code>PrimaryRoot</code> and <code>FlattenedRoot</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>During gossip a contiguous section the encoded SSZ object bytes would be selected, and a SSZ merkle proof against the <code>FlattenedRoot</code> is constructed.  We’ll refer to this proof as the <code>flat_proof</code>.  In the event that the system also requires proofs against the <code>PrimaryRoot</code> then this secondary proof would also need to be constructed against the subset of the data that the selected bytes represents which we’ll call the <code>primary_proof</code>.  Care would need to be taken in the selection of bytes to ensure that its bounds are picked to match up with the encoded object boundaries.</p>\n<p>The gossip payload would include these elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The section of bytes to be stored.</li>\n<li>The <code>flat_proof</code></li>\n<li>The <code>primary_proof</code> if desired.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the <code>flat_proof</code> is against a flat <code>List[uint8, ...]</code> data structure, the accompanying merkle proof will have sufficient information to determine exactly where in the overall sequence of bytes the receive payload would belong.  This allow the receiving node to cryptographically validate that the payload belongs in their storage based on on their node-id as well as verifying that the payload is correctly anchored to the <code>FlattenedRoot</code> and optionally the <code>PrimaryRoot</code> if both proving methods are desired.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"retrieval-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#retrieval-4\"></a>Retrieval</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For retrieval we assume the object has been fully seeded into the network and all portions of its encoded bytes are retrievable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All SSZ objects have a “schema” and this schema provides a deterministic way to find where a specific part of that object is located in the encoded binary format without requiring the full data structure to be decoded.  Only a small subset of the data must be decoded to retrieve individual parts of the object.</p>\n<p>Since the raw bytes of the encoded SSZ object are available from the network, this facilitates what is effectively the ability to read bytes from anywhere in the stream by fetching them from the network.  Each payload can be cryptographically verified with the accompanying <code>flat_proof</code> and <code>primary_proof</code>.</p>\n<p>Each SSZ object will require some amount of custom logic in order to retrieve the data from the network, though a sufficiently advanced SSZ library should be able to implement this logic in a generic format as it would be the same logic necessary to do selective decoding of only part of an SSZ object.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"applications-of-this-approach-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#applications-of-this-approach-5\"></a>Applications of this approach</h2>\n<p>We are exploring the idea of gaining more efficient storage by densely packing data from deep in Ethereum’s history into large SSZ objects which are then stored using this schema in the network.  This format allows for both random access into the data structure as well as bulk retrieval of the full data structure by retrieving all of the byte sequences stored within the network.</p>\n<p>This approach allows for efficient algorithms such as performing a binary search over a sorted SSZ list stored using this mechanism.  This allows for us to implement a version of Erigon’s diff based storage approach to storing Ethereum’s state data, effectively trading more client side compute for less required storage in the overall network.  For Ethereum’s archive data this results in roughly a 10x reduction in total needed storage for the merkle patricia tree and likely significantly higher savings for the verkle trie due to it’s very wide branching factor.</p>\n<p>It is also likely that applying this approach to ethereum’s history data would allow for more efficient bulk retrieval of historical headers and block bodies.</p>\n<p>There are also likely applications for storing the Consensus state in this manner as it would allow for random access retrieval of any part of the state.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/distributed-storage-and-cryptographically-secured-retrieval-of-ssz-objects-for-portal-network/19575\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/distributed-storage-and-cryptographically-secured-retrieval-of-ssz-objects-for-portal-network/19575","pubDate":"Thu, 16 May 2024 20:24:12 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19575"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/distributed-storage-and-cryptographically-secured-retrieval-of-ssz-objects-for-portal-network/19575.rss","#text":"Distributed storage and cryptographically secured retrieval of SSZ objects for Portal Network"},"filter":false},{"title":"Sierpinski Triangle Topology","dc:creator":"cryptskii","category":"Sharding","description":"<h1><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR</h1>\n<p>We propose integrating the Sierpinski triangle topology into blockchain sharding to enhance scalability, load balancing, and fault tolerance.

We call these Credible Accounts.</p>\n<p>Each account can thought of as an rollup which allows users to conveniently manage their state and reliably request state transitions on any chain.</p>\n<p>This is achieved through the introduction of two key concepts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Accounts on credible commitment machines, and</li>\n<li>Resource locks</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A credible commitment machine is responsible for securing the account, issuing resource locks over the state it holds, and validating the fulfillment of such locks.</p>\n<p>By introducing Credible Accounts, we hope to accelerate the transition of the ecosystem from EOAs, the JSON-RPC API, and the transaction supply chain, towards an architecture built around message passing of resource locks and fulfillment proofs.</p>\n<p><strong>A Credible Account on OneBalance can:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Combine token balances from every chain</li>\n<li>Abstract gas on any chain</li>\n<li>Swap and send tokens to and from any chain</li>\n<li>Issue complex permissions over any subset of user state</li>\n<li>Incentivize and enforce atomic asynchronous composability across multiple chains</li>\n<li>Authenticate user using modern methods such as passkey, session keys, FIDO</li>\n<li>Fast confirmations through separation of fulfillment from settlement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many use cases are unlocked with these new capabilities. Users can spend any token to pay for state transitions. They can aggregate liquidity that lives both on-chain and off-chain. They even have the building blocks to build a decentralized Fireblocks, or a non-custodial Binance.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/9/b9c28cc78642455ccebc698c9de49bf17f43d00a.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/b9c28cc78642455ccebc698c9de49bf17f43d00a\" title=\"OneBalance Account Framework\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/9/b9c28cc78642455ccebc698c9de49bf17f43d00a_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"OneBalance Account Framework\" data-base62-sha1=\"qvj9vkQ3GwzxC80TI5jH9HJb14S\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/9/b9c28cc78642455ccebc698c9de49bf17f43d00a_2_690x388.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/9/b9c28cc78642455ccebc698c9de49bf17f43d00a_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/9/b9c28cc78642455ccebc698c9de49bf17f43d00a_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EED7BA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"wallet-10-externally-owned-accounts-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#wallet-10-externally-owned-accounts-3\"></a>Wallet 1.0 - Externally Owned Accounts</h1>\n<p>The web3 market structure equilibrium, as defined by Ethereum, is the use of public-private key-pair, aka, Externally Owned Account (EOA) to manage all aspects of a user’s state.</p>\n<p>Since EOAs sit outside the blockchain, the chain has no view over what message have been signed.

Since the chain has no view over what the user has signed, it must consider any transaction signed with the same nonce as valid. This means that at any time, a user can equivocate their state transition request by signing and submit a new transaction which overwrites their nonce.</p>\n<p>This makes EOAs, and the transaction supply chain more broadly, incapable of providing credible commitments as they violate the principle of irrevocability. ****Downstream parties in the transaction supply chain such as solvers are unable to rely on the commitments made by EOAs as they may be equivocated at any time.</p>\n<p>To date, every system looking to protect against request equivocation have relied on locking funds in a deposit smart contract. This is the approach used by all types of bridges (L2, intent, POA, IBC, ZK). All implementations of secure cross chain interactions rely on the transfer of assets to a smart contract as a request which cannot be equivocated.</p>\n<p>The class of networks based on HTLCs such as the Interledger Protocol all use timelocked requests as a form of credible commitment for security passing economic messages between ledgers.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"wallet-20-smart-contract-accounts-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#wallet-20-smart-contract-accounts-6\"></a>Wallet 2.0 - Smart Contract Accounts</h1>\n<p>Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs) solve the request equivocation problem by bringing the signer on chain.

class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#resource-locks-10\"></a><strong>Resource Locks</strong></h2>\n<p>A resource lock is a credible commitment made by a user to escrow some state conditional on particular conditions fulfilled, or an expiry time.</p>\n<p>An example could be a cross-chain request to purchase an NFT on Solana using USDC deposited in the OneBalance account from Ethereum.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-json\">resource_lock: {\n\tlock: 1500 USDC,\n\tfulfill: DeGods #12345,\n\texpiry: Solana block 245547084\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Resource locks are necessary to prevent solvers from being griefed by a user through double spending or equivocating their request during execution.</p>\n<p>Since the user makes a commitment not to overwrite their request within a time window, it removes the uncertainty solvers typically incur between a transaction being signed and the finalized chain state.</p>\n<p>A lock is analogous to depositing funds in a smart contract, or issuing an ERC20 approval, but without spending gas or waiting for on-chain finality since it is done within the account itself.</p>\n<p>The lock expiry needs to be of long enough duration to provide solvers the chance to execute the requested state transition on the destination chain and submit a proof of fulfillment to the fulfillment engine.</p>\n<p>Crucially, this introduces a separation between fulfillment time and settlement time. Since the account provides local assurance of the lock, solvers can bring a requested state transition on a destination chain without waiting for finality on the origin chain.</p>\n<p>This allows users to buy SOL with ETH at the speed of Solana without being constrained by the speed of Ethereum. This fulfillment speed can be extended to execution of any state transition such as sniping an NFT, sending money to your grandmother, or anything else users do on blockchains.</p>\n<p>Resource locks can implement constraints which sit anywhere along the spectrum of permissions.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/c/3/c3a8e48441d80f71c6492fdfd765b4c80ba01467.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/c3a8e48441d80f71c6492fdfd765b4c80ba01467\" title=\"Permission Spectrum\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/3/c3a8e48441d80f71c6492fdfd765b4c80ba01467_2_690x228.png\" alt=\"Permission Spectrum\" data-base62-sha1=\"rUSXmQx7rt0DTvtzaBYrEzsP0l9\" width=\"690\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/3/c3a8e48441d80f71c6492fdfd765b4c80ba01467_2_690x228.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/3/c3a8e48441d80f71c6492fdfd765b4c80ba01467_2_1035x342.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/3/c3a8e48441d80f71c6492fdfd765b4c80ba01467_2_1380x456.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EED7B9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Permissions could be stateful or stateless.

doing this?</h3>\n<p>Our mission is to help the web3 ecosystem to transition to an account centric worldview in order to bring web3 to the first 1 billion people.</p>\n<p>We believe non-coercive credible commitment machines are essential for human coordination in the digital age.</p>\n<p>We believe the chain centric worldview is an outdated framework originating from the historical scarcity in blockspace. (<a href=\"https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sorry Joel</a>)</p>\n<p>Much like the shift from the Geocentric worldview to the Heliocentric worldview unlocked a wealth of discoveries, we believe the shift from a chain centric worldview to an account centric worldview will unlock the full potential of web3.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-does-this-mean-from-a-user-perspective-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#what-does-this-mean-from-a-user-perspective-16\"></a>What does this mean from a user perspective?</h3>\n<p>Users don’t need to care about which chains they are interacting with + can get close to instant fulfillment.</p>\n<p>Lets take a complex, yet common example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>User wants to buy an NFT traded on Solana with a price of 10 SOL, but only has USDC on Ethereum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This state transition request requires the following sequential operations to take place:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Generate: Create a new Ed25519 keypair in a solana wallet</li>\n<li>Swap: USDC for ETH to pay for gas on Ethereum</li>\n<li>Bridge: Send USDC to bridge contract on Ethereum and get USDC minted on Solana</li>\n<li>Swap: USDC for SOL to pay for gas on Solana</li>\n<li>Swap: USDC for SOL to purchase NFT</li>\n<li>Execute: Execute calldata on marketplace to purchase the NFT</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Today, users are required to manually perform each of these actions and wait for the previous one to be settled or finalized before performing the following one. Some of these operations are even technically impossible in a non-custodial way using EOAs without chain level gas abstraction.</p>\n<p>The critical path of execution here requires waiting for the settlement of two Ethereum transactions and two Solana transactions + waiting for the finality of Ethereum. With Ethereum’s current block finality time, we are looking at a minimum of 15min to complete execution.</p>\n<p>Lets look at the equivalent using a OneBalance account:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>User wants to buy an NFT traded on Solana with a price of 10 SOL, but only has USDC on OneBalance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This state transition request requires the following sequential operations to take place:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create a resource lock on OneBalance as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-json\">resource_lock: {\n\tlock: 1500 USDC,\n\tfulfill: DeGods #12345,\n\texpiry: Solana block 245547084\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are no additional steps for the user to take.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, a solver purchases the NFT and credits it to the OneBalance proxy account of the user on Solana, and claims the resources in the lock.</p>\n<p>Since a OneBalance account separates fulfillment from settlement, the user gets execution at the speed of transaction execution on their destination network, in this case Solana.

But we can incentivize it.</p>\n<p>Accounts can enforce two types of constraints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Constraints over what states of the world it requires in order to issue a lock</li>\n<li>Constraints over what states of the world it requires in order to fulfill a lock</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OneBalance can <em>incentivize</em> atomicity, but it cannot guarantee it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example: Take a lock that requests sequencing of state transitions across chain A and chain B, with a desired atomicity such that B is executed if and only if A is executed. If the lock is public and the only condition on inclusion of B is the existence of a valid signature from the requesting account, then B could be included regardless of A if it exposes sufficient MEV to compensate its inclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However! Since executing B without A invalidates the fulfillment conditions of the lock, then the solver cannot extract any value from the lock. This means that from the user perspective, atomicity is maintained. Some people refer to this as “economic atomicity”. For locks with complex multi chain atomicity requirements, Solvers take on the risk of non-execution.</p>\n<p>This “lock leaking” due to MEV problem can be resolved at the routing layer by routing the state transition request through a secure OFA that prevents information leakage.</p>\n<p>Novel mechanisms are being developed at the settlement layer to help solvers manage their settlement risk using things like pre-confirmations or proof aggregation. Importantly, these help manage solver execution risk and therefore help minimize non-execution risk for users of a OneBalance account, but the OneBalance account already has economic atomicity guarantees.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"is-onebalance-just-htlcs-for-ethereum-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#is-onebalance-just-htlcs-for-ethereum-20\"></a><strong>Is OneBalance just HTLCs for Ethereum?</strong></h3>\n<p>I prefer to call it turbo HTLCs <img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/smile.png?v=12\" title=\":smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>The design of intent bridges work similarly to HTLCs in that they lock user funds on the originating chain until a proof is provided of the completion of a state transition on the destination chain.</p>\n<p>Instead of being constrained by the speed of the originating chains, OneBalance accounts are constrained by the speed of the credible commitment engine in generating these locks.

The system leverages the scalability benefits of epidemic MPC, where the per-node computation complexity decreases as <span class=\"math\">O(1/N)</span> with the number of nodes <span class=\"math\">N</span>. Erasure coding enhances fault tolerance and data availability, while FHE ensures privacy during computation. Sparse Merkle tries provide compact data representation and proof efficiency, and triadic ternary tries enable fast data retrieval. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in throughput, latency, and proof size compared to state-of-the-art ZK-rollup implementations.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Introduction<br>\nExisting ZK-rollup implementations face challenges in terms of scalability, privacy, and censorship resistance due to centralized computation, monolithic state representations, and reliance on a single sequencer or small validator set. This paper proposes an optimized ZK-rollup architecture that integrates advanced cryptographic techniques and efficient data structures to address these challenges and achieve high scalability, security, privacy, and censorship resistance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Background<br>\nZK-rollups are a layer-2 scaling solution for public blockchains that enables off-chain transaction processing while maintaining the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain. However, current ZK-rollup implementations suffer from scalability bottlenecks, privacy risks, and censorship vulnerabilities. Efficient data structures and proof schemes, along with advanced cryptographic techniques, are crucial for optimizing ZK-rollup performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proposed Architecture<br>\nOur proposed ZK-rollup architecture combines the following key components:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Epidemic MPC for scalable computation across subgroups</li>\n<li>Sparse Merkle tries for compact state commitments and proofs</li>\n<li>Triadic ternary tries for efficient transaction and account data retrieval</li>\n<li>Erasure coding for fault tolerance and data availability</li>\n<li>Fully homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving computation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.1 Epidemic MPC<br>\nThe epidemic MPC paradigm partitions nodes into subgroups that independently process disjoint transaction batches, reducing per-node complexity while maintaining fault tolerance. The average per-node computation complexity is <span class=\"math\">O(C/N * (k/N)^2)</span>, where <span class=\"math\">C</span> is the total MPC task complexity and <span class=\"math\">k</span> is the number of subgroups. While this complexity has a quadratic dependence on <span class=\"math\">k</span> and <span class=\"math\">N</span>, careful optimization of subgroup sizing and load balancing can help mitigate scalability limitations.</p>\n<p>3.2 Efficient Data Structures<br>\nSparse Merkle tries provide compact state representations and efficient proof generation, with a space complexity of <span class=\"math\">O(n * k)</span> for storing <span class=\"math\">n</span> key-value pairs with maximum key length <span class=\"math\">k</span>. Triadic ternary tries enable fast transaction and account data retrieval within each subgroup, accelerating proof generation and overall system performance.</p>\n<p>3.3 Advanced Cryptographic Techniques<br>\nErasure coding enhances fault tolerance and data availability by allowing the system to recover from node failures and distribute the workload. Fully homomorphic encryption enables computations on encrypted data, preserving privacy during the MPC process. The proposed hybrid approach combines erasure coding and FHE to achieve a balanced solution for scalability, fault tolerance, and privacy, with strong guarantees provided by the hybrid MPC-zkRollup protocol.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Formalization and Analysis<br>\nWe formalize the key concepts and provide detailed algorithms and proofs for the proposed architecture:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>4.1 Epidemic MPC Network<br>\nAn epidemic MPC network is defined as a tuple <span class=\"math\">(N, S, T)</span>, where <span class=\"math\">N</span> is the set of nodes, <span class=\"math\">S</span> is a partition of <span class=\"math\">N</span> into <span class=\"math\">k</span> subgroups, and <span class=\"math\">T</span> is the set of MPC tasks. The average per-node computation complexity is <span class=\"math\">O(C/N * (k/N)^2)</span>, demonstrating the potential for significant scalability improvements as the number of nodes and subgroups increases.</p>\n<p>4.2 Sparse Merkle Trie/Verkle<br>\nA sparse Merkle trie storing a set of <span class=\"math\">n</span> key-value pairs with maximum key length <span class=\"math\">k</span> occupies <span class=\"math\">O(n * k)</span> space, highlighting the potential for storage efficiency.</p>\n<p>4.3 Triadic Ternary Trie<br>\nA triadic ternary trie storing a set of <span class=\"math\">n</span> key-value pairs with maximum key length <span class=\"math\">k</span> trits occupies <span class=\"math\">O(n * k)</span> space, indicating the potential for efficient data storage and retrieval.</p>\n<p>4.4 Fault Tolerance and Privacy Analysis<br>\nThe hybrid MPC-zkRollup protocol with an <span class=\"math\">(n, k)</span>-erasure code and a secure FHE scheme achieves fault tolerance against up to <span class=\"math\">n - k</span> node failures and preserves the privacy of the input data against semi-honest adversaries controlling up to <span class=\"math\">N - 1</span> MPC nodes.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<p>Advantages and Trade-offs<br>\nThe proposed architecture offers high scalability, enhanced privacy, and censorship resistance due to the distributed nature of epidemic MPC and the infeasibility of controlling a majority in each subgroup. Compact proofs enable succinct on-chain verification, reducing the burden on the underlying blockchain. However, there may be trade-offs in terms of increased complexity and potential latency due to the coordination and communication overhead among subgroups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Future Directions and Open Questions<br>\nRealizing the full potential of this approach requires further research on formal security proofs, optimized smart contract implementations, parameter tuning, and the integration of advanced cryptographic primitives like KZG-based polynomial commitments for greater expressiveness and cross-rollup interoperability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conclusion<br>\nThe proposed ZK-rollup architecture, which integrates epidemic MPC, sparse Merkle tries, triadic ternary tries, erasure coding, and fully homomorphic encryption, presents a promising avenue for building highly performant, secure, and censorship-resistant ZK-rollup systems. By carefully balancing the trade-offs between scalability, privacy, and efficiency, this approach paves the way for large-scale adoption of layer-2 solutions on public blockchains. Further optimizations and research can help address the scalability limitations imposed by the quadratic complexity term and unlock the full potential of this approach for large-scale, secure, and privacy-preserving blockchain applications.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/optimizing-zk-rollup-scalability-security-and-censorship-resistance-with-epidemic-mpc-efficient-data-structures-and-advanced-cryptographic-techniques/19556\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/optimizing-zk-rollup-scalability-security-and-censorship-resistance-with-epidemic-mpc-efficient-data-structures-and-advanced-cryptographic-techniques/19556","pubDate":"Tue, 14 May 2024 17:25:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19556"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/optimizing-zk-rollup-scalability-security-and-censorship-resistance-with-epidemic-mpc-efficient-data-structures-and-advanced-cryptographic-techniques/19556.rss","#text":"Optimizing ZK-Rollup Scalability, Security, and Censorship Resistance with Epidemic MPC, Efficient Data Structures, and Advanced Cryptographic Techniques"},"filter":false},{"title":"User-Defined Penalties: Ensuring Honest Preconf Behavior","dc:creator":"jonahb27","category":"Economics","description":"<p><em>Thank you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drakefjustin\">Justin Drake</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sproule_\">Ryan Sproule</a> for the help.</em></p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> <em>Allow users to specify their preferred penalty when requesting a preconf, enabling the market to naturally establish preconf cryptoeconomic security parameters, rather than setting parameters upfront.</em></p>\n<p>As the community settles on a design for preconfs, a critical choice arises: how can we ensure crypto-economic security for preconfs?

Effectively, users’ preconfs are insured.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open Question:</strong> How much insurance should be offered?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All these mechanisms require us to know ex ante what preconf users want. Inevitably, this will be opinionated and lead to deadweight loss, as some users who might want a preconf could feel uncomfortable with the setup. Moreover, some proposers might feel uncomfortable with the parameterization and choose not to offer preconfs. The best solution is to allow users to work with proposers to agree on the appropriate level of crypto-economic security.</p>\n<p>My Solution: <strong>User-Defined Penalties</strong></p>\n<p>Users should be able to specify their desired level of crypto-economic security by attaching a penalty structure to their preconf. This structure will detail the consequences of a fault.</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-rust\">// Here, users can define a penalty associated with any specific fault,\n// and the system is generic enough to allow for arbitrarily complex rules.\nstruct PreconfAgreement&lt;C: Condition, P: Penalize&gt; {\n    faults: Vec&lt;Fault&lt;C, P&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\nstruct Fault&lt;C: Condition, P: Penalize&gt; {\n    condition: C,\n    penalties: Vec&lt;P&gt;,\n}\n\ntrait Condition {\n    fn should_penalize(...) -&gt; bool;\n}\n\ntrait Penalize {\n    fn penalize(...);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: There is a DoS vector associated with unbounded compute when evaluating conditions. Some gas metering should be used, or conditions should be constructed as succinct statements (e.g., a SNARK).</em></p>\n<p>This solution is unbiased and allows the market to determine the appropriate parameters naturally. Users can decide the level of security they want rather than leaving it up to the protocol to estimate, while proposers can choose their risk-reward profile. Heavier penalties will likely result in higher costs for users.</p>\n<p><strong>Complexity Concerns:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proposers’ Perspective:</strong> With preconfs, we already assume that proposers (or their gateways) are sophisticated, and giving them the ability to manage their own risk profiles should benefit them. Inexperienced proposers can set a simple threshold for the maximum penalty they are willing to incur and, as they gain experience, adjust it more systematically.</li>\n<li><strong>Users’ Perspective:</strong> This approach shouldn’t add complexity, as wallets can easily abstract the penalty decision, much like they abstract gas fee choices. Fine-grained choices can be offered as an opt-in feature for more advanced users.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/user-defined-penalties-ensuring-honest-preconf-behavior/19545\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/user-defined-penalties-ensuring-honest-preconf-behavior/19545","pubDate":"Mon, 13 May 2024 16:14:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19545"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/user-defined-penalties-ensuring-honest-preconf-behavior/19545.rss","#text":"User-Defined Penalties: Ensuring Honest Preconf Behavior"},"filter":false},{"title":"Embedded fee markets and ERC-4337 (part 1)","dc:creator":"DavideRezzoli","category":"Economics","description":"<p>by: Davide Rezzoli (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/daviderezzoli\">@DavideRezzoli</a>) and Barnabé Monnot (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/barnabe\">@barnabe</a>)</p>\n<p>Many thanks to Yoav Weiss (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/yoavw\">@yoavw</a>) for introducing us to the problem, Dror Tirosh (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/drortirosh\">@drortirosh</a>) for helpful comments on the draft, and the 4337 team for support.

Given the ability to use some of the supply provided by the chain, the block producers must arbitrate which users will have ability to use the scarce resource of on-chain execution, and at what cost. On Ethereum, for the question of cost, block producers are constrained by the EIP-1559 fee mechanism, which dynamically sets a reserve price block-to-block, called “base fee”. The base fee is a price, expressed per units of gas, which a user transaction must pay to be included and executed. The user may provide so-called “priority fees” beyond the base fee, to further incentivise the block producers in times of congestion.</p>\n<p>In this note, we investigate the question of <em>embedded fee markets</em>, i.e., fee markets which “live” within other fee markets. This question was discussed in a different context in a recent paper by Maryam Bahrani, Pranav Garimidi and Tim Roughgarden, “<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/331\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Transaction Fee Mechanism Design in a Post-MEV World</a>”. In this paper, the authors model the use of searchers, further intermediating access to the chain between users and block producers. Block producers receive “hints” from searchers, embodied by atomic bundles of transactions to be included by the chain. The fee market of searchers is driven by the maximisation objective of a quantity known as MEV, or maximal extractable value.</p>\n<p>In our setting, users wish to access the chain but do not express their demand using protocol-legible transactions. Instead, users produce “operations”, to be bundled by entities known as “bundlers”, who then originate a protocol-legible transaction packing the operations together towards execution. Thus, to the EIP-1559 fee mechanism, bundlers are the users of the chain, yet the actual users must first obtain inclusion in the bundle of a bundler before they may gain inclusion to the chain. In other words, we may see this setting as part of the larger question of <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/uncrowdable-inclusion-lists-the-tension-between-chain-neutrality-preconfirmations-and-proposer-commitments/19372#comparison-between-inclusion-lists-pepc-and-multiple-concurrent-block-producers-3\">block co-creation</a>, which arises with (partial) builders/searchers as well as inclusion lists.</p>\n<p>Our hope is for these dynamics to be as transparent as possible, such that there is not either more cognitive overhead or opportunities for the user to be unduly exploited by the bundler, compared to going on-chain directly. We hope for even stronger results, cases where indeed the users benefit from the bundler intermediation, when amortised costs allow users to enjoy greater welfare.</p>\n<p>To investigate the distinction between direct fee markets and their embedded (sub-)mechanisms, we must precise the economic constraints which a bundler abides by. In the following section, we offer a simple model of the bundler cost function motivated by the practice, in particular bundlers participating in the ERC-4337 protocol, which we briefly recapitulate.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"model-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#model-1\"></a>Model</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"bundling-in-erc-4337-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#bundling-in-erc-4337-2\"></a>Bundling in ERC-4337</h3>\n<p>A user wishing to perform some activity on-chain via bundlers issues a User Operation (UserOp, or operation). This UserOp is emitted from the user’s wallet, e.g., after interacting with a DApp. Once the UserOp is broadcast, some bundler receiving the operation may decide to include it in a bundle. A bundle is an “externally-owned account” (EOA) meta-transaction, which writes the data of the included UserOps in its <code>bundle.calldata</code> field. The bundler issues the bundle towards inclusion in a block by a block producer (we discuss the relation between bundler and block producer in a future note).</p>\n<p>Once the bundle is included in the block, and the block makes its way to the chain, the bundle is executed along with other transactions in the block. Essentially, the bundle execution steps are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pre-verification:</strong> A bundler’s EOA transaction will consume 21,000 gas, and the call to the EntryPoint contract will set up key variables to keep track of the execution of the operations in the operation loop.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#required-entry-point-contract-functionality\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Operation loop</a>:</strong> For each operation included in the bundle, the following two steps take place:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Verification step:</strong> UserOps perform operations containing a verification step, which is encoded in a “smart contract wallet” deployed initially by the user (during an initial UserOp). The verification step may simply check a signature, or perform more complex operations to “grant” the right for the UserOp to proceed with its execution. The verification step is metered by <code>op.verificationGasLimit</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution step:</strong> The core of the UserOp, the execution step performs the operation described in <code>op.callData</code>. This step is also metered, using <code>op.callGasLimit</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As is made clear by the previous decomposition, the pre-verification step is executed once, offering the possibility to amortise the pre-verification costs across all included users. When the bundle is executed, all costs (e.g., <code>block.basefee</code> + priority fees paid by the bundler to the block producer including them) are charged to the bundler, who must ensure that user operations compensate her enough for the costs incurred. We make these statements precise in the following section.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"fee-market-model-for-bundles-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#fee-market-model-for-bundles-3\"></a>Fee market model for bundles</h3>\n<p>We attempt to remain consistent with classic fee markets models. A user <span class=\"math\">t</span> who wishes to emit an operation has some value <span class=\"math\">v_t</span> for the execution of the operation. We assume all operations to have the same size <span class=\"math\">S</span> (i.e., same gas used for the verification and execution steps), and we thus express all quantities as prices per unit of gas.</p>\n<p>Users express their wish to be included by emitting a bid <span class=\"math\">b_t</span> along with their operation. For now, we do not assume a specific grammar for the user to express their bid for inclusion, e.g., the ability to express a max fee and priority fee along with their operation, as they would with EIP-1559. User operations are collected in a mempool <span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{M}</span>, representing the pending status of these operations until inclusion.</p>\n<p>The EIP-1559 fee market exposes a reserve price <span class=\"math\">r</span> known as “base fee”, which bundlers must incur when their bundle is executed. If the bundle contains <span class=\"math\">n</span> operations, the bundler must then expense at least <span class=\"math\">n \\times S \\times r</span>. Additionally, since the bundle consumes “pre-verification gas”, say, some quantity <span class=\"math\">F</span>, the bundler will additionally pay <span class=\"math\">F \\times r</span>. The operations included in the bundle are given by the set <span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{B}</span>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"bundler-cost-functions-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#bundler-cost-functions-4\"></a>Bundler cost functions</h3>\n<p>We now consider the costs incurred by bundlers for the inclusion of their bundles in the block.</p>\n<p><strong>On-chain cost function:</strong> A bundler issuing bundle <span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{B}</span> when the base fee is <span class=\"math\">r</span> expends a cost:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nC_\\text{on-chain}(\\mathbf{B}, r) = F \\times r + n \\times S \\times r\n</div>\n<p>The bundler problem mirrors the block producer problem expressed in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01340\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[Roughgarden 2021]</a>. There, the block producer had to ensure the provision of some value <span class=\"math\">\\mu</span> compensating her for the cost of including an additional transaction to their block (e.g., <span class=\"math\">\\mu</span> may compensate for the extra load of the block, which delays its propagation and thus increases re-org risk). The block-level fee market must then ensure that the block producer is at least compensated for the total cost <span class=\"math\">n \\times S \\times \\mu</span>, should the block producer include <span class=\"math\">n</span> transactions in their block. The bundler-level fee market will require to at least compensate the bundler for exogenous costs <span class=\"math\">C_\\text{on-chain}(\\mathbf{B}, r)</span>  they incur from the larger fee market they are embedded in.</p>\n<p>ERC-4337 offers the possibility amortise costs beyond sharing the pre-verification gas costs. Should all operations employ the same signature scheme for their verification step, the signatures of these operations may be <em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/CgXzDuN5Xqc?si=lnpEZLKPCp6sjKAp&amp;t=2004\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">aggregated</a></em> by the bundler, such that instead of verifying on-chain <span class=\"math\">n</span> signatures, a single signature may be verified. In this case, the bundler cost function will need to account for the off-chain costs which the bundler incurs when performing the aggregation. In the following, we make the assumption that such costs are linear in the number of operations, a similar assumption to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06495\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[Wang et al., 2024]</a>, at a marginal cost <span class=\"math\">\\omega</span>.</p>\n<p>We also account for the reduced gas consumption of each operation, due to savings from the aggregation. When aggregated, operations are not required to publish their signature, but they do require an additional pairing operation. On chains where calldata cost is expensive, but pairing operations/computation are cheap, aggregation thus provides per-operation savings. In this case, we denote by <span class=\"math\">S' &lt; S</span> the reduced size of a transaction. We also need to account for the increased pre-verification gas use <span class=\"math\">F' &gt; F</span>, which now contains the publication and verification of the single on-chain aggregated signature.</p>\n<p><strong>Aggregated cost function:</strong> A bundler issuing bundle <span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{B}</span> with aggregated signatures when the base fee is <span class=\"math\">r</span> expends a cost:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nC_\\text{agg}(\\mathbf{B}, r) = F' \\times r + n \\times S' \\times r + n \\times \\omega\n</div>\n<p>In this note, we will not go further, but one may also consider the data publication costs which a bundler may need to expend when their bundle settles on a rollup. We suggest two ways of modelling this and leave this question for future work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Either the bundler herself is responsible for data publication (e.g., as a sequencer), and thus requires to obtain from users the necessary amount of funds to pay eventual data publication costs.</li>\n<li>Or the bundle-level fee market is embedded in a larger batch-level fee market, via which the rollup exposes to rollup users (including the bundler) the amount they are required to pay due to congestion (e.g., a base fee) and eventual data publication costs. In this case, the rollup is responsible for balancing their own future costs with their present revenues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"revisiting-fee-market-quantities-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#revisiting-fee-market-quantities-5\"></a>Revisiting fee market quantities</h3>\n<p>We may now formally express the relevant concepts for the bundle-level fee market, deriving them straightforwardly from previous literature, while taking the embedding into account.</p>\n<p><strong>Bundle-level allocation rule:</strong> A (bundle-level) allocation <span class=\"math\">x</span> decides the set of user operations which the bundler includes in their bundle, given the current mempool <span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{M}</span> and the base fee <span class=\"math\">r</span>.</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nx_t(\\textbf{M}, r) \\in \\{0, 1\\}, \\forall t\n</div>\n<p><strong>Bundle-level payment rule:</strong> Given the set of selected operations <span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{B}</span>, a payment rule assigns to each included user a fee:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\np_t(\\textbf{B})\n</div>\n<p><strong>User utility function:</strong> <span class=\"math\">u_t(b_t) = v_t - p_t(\\mathbf{B})</span></p>\n<p>In principle, we could allow for the existence of a burning rule <span class=\"math\">q_t(\\mathbf{B})</span> expressing the fact that the bundler may not receive the totality of all included user payments. We do not consider it in this note however.</p>\n<p><strong>(Myopic) bundler utility function:</strong> <span class=\"math\">u(\\mathbf{B}, r) = \\sum_{t \\in \\mathbf{B}} p_t(\\mathbf{B}) - C(\\mathbf{B}, r)</span></p>\n<p>A bundle-level TFM <span class=\"math\">(x, p)</span> is incentive-compatible for myopic bundlers (MBIC) if, for every mempool <span class=\"math\">\\textbf{M}</span> and base fee <span class=\"math\">r</span>, a myopic bundler maximises its utility by following the suggestion of the allocation rule <span class=\"math\">x</span> (i.e., setting <span class=\"math\">\\textbf{B} = x(\\textbf{M}, r)</span>).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"forming-multiple-bundles-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#forming-multiple-bundles-6\"></a>Forming multiple bundles</h3>\n<p>In the preceding section, we’ve only considered the possibility for the bundler to issue a single bundle. However, we may be interested in the possibility for the bundler to make more than one bundle out of the operations available in the mempool. Given the mempool <span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{M}</span>, let <span class=\"math\">P(\\mathbf{M})</span> represent the set of partitions of the mempool, assigning each operation to a single bundle (we may assume that for each partition, there is a set indexed 0 which contains all the operations not assigned to a bundle for inclusion). The allocation rule then returns the index of the set in the partition to which the operation is assigned.</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nx(\\textbf{M}, r) \\in P(\\textbf{M})\n</div>\n<p>We can write the set of bundles output by the partition <span class=\"math\">x(\\textbf{M}, \\beta)</span> as <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{B}(x(\\textbf{M}, r))</span>. Intuitively, these bundles are made up from the operations which do not belong to the set indexed 0. Given a set of bundles <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{B}</span>, the payment rule is then:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\np_t(\\mathcal{B})\n</div>\n<p>The user utility function becomes:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nu_t(b_t) = v_t - p_t(\\mathcal{B})\n</div>\n<p>and the bundler utility function becomes:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nu(\\mathcal{B}, r) = \\sum_{B \\in \\mathcal{B}} \\sum_{t \\in {B}} p_t(\\mathcal{B}) - C(\\mathcal{B}, r)\n</div>\n<h2><a name=\"the-bundler-game-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#the-bundler-game-7\"></a>The bundler game</h2>\n<p>Inclusion of transactions in blocks must remunerate some quantity <span class=\"math\">\\mu</span> to the block producers, which is assumed to be linear in the transaction size in e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01340\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[Roughgarden, 2021]</a>. This quantity denotes the opportunity cost for the block producer to add an extra transaction to their block, e.g., increasing their gossiping delay and thereby increasing their chances of the block getting re-orged. In Proof-of-Stake, even though the protocol’s schedule allows for enough time to propagate a full block, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/timing-games-implications-and-possible-mitigations/17612#impact-on-blob-inclusion-ht-dankrad-for-mentioning-this-10\">timing games</a> have induced “last-second” propagation dynamics which have once again made this <span class=\"math\">\\mu</span> parameter relevant.</p>\n<p>In any case, we may observe that the cost-sharing problem at block-level and at bundle-level are very different. At block-level, a transaction need not know what else is going on inside the block to devise its inclusion bid according to EIP-1559 (it may want to know what is going on with respect to MEV <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/331\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[Bahrani et al., 2024]</a>, but we’ll consider this a separate issue for now). At bundle-level, bundle overhead costs are no longer linear in the number of transactions, but a fixed overhead may be amortised by many transactions. Further, should the aggregation cost of the user operations be non-linear in the number of transactions (e.g., some proofs are effectively sub-linear in the size being proven), offering the possibility to amortise the total cost over many users.</p>\n<p>This leads to the following game: The bundler wishes for users to place their bids as if they were bidding for the <em>worst case</em>, where the user is alone in the bundle and must compensate by themselves the full overhead gas <span class=\"math\">F</span>. Practically, the user would be faced with the problem of setting three relevant parameters on their operation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>op.maxPriorityFeePerGas</code> and <code>op.maxFeePerGas</code> may be set according to the heuristics a user would use under EIP-1559, i.e., given some estimate amount of gas their operation plans to consume, the user would set these attributes to calibrate how much they are willing to pay in the worst case (<code>maxFee</code>) and how much they are willing to top up in order to pay the eventual block producer (<code>maxPriority</code>). But how should the user estimate the gas?</li>\n<li><code>op.preVerificationGas</code> is an attribute of the UserOperation which must be set to indicate the amount of “extra gas” the user’s operation plans to consume. In our model, we let <span class=\"math\">F</span> denote this “fixed gas overhead”. If <span class=\"math\">n</span> users were included in the bundle, each user ought to set <code>preVerificationGas = F / n</code>. However, should the user prepare their operation with a worst-case scenario in mind, they would set <code>preVerificationGas = F</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>preVerificationGas</code> is then the principal vector via which users mediate their bid and attempt to account for the amortisation of costs by the bundler. Assume <span class=\"math\">n</span> users do come to the market with their operations, and all are convinced by the bundler to bid in the worst-case of being alone in the bundle. We’ll also assume that the users are setting their <code>maxPriorityFeePerGas</code> to zero for the sake of this example. Then these <span class=\"math\">n</span> users are all setting <code>preVerificationGas = F</code>, and the bundler is able to output a bundle remunerating them with:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nn \\times F \\times r\n</div>\n<p>while they must incur a cost:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nF \\times r\n</div>\n<p>once they publish the bundle bundling all <span class=\"math\">n</span> operations together in a block. This yields the bundler a profit <span class=\"math\">\\pi = (n-1) \\times F \\times r</span>.</p>\n<p>This situation may be represented by a two-stage game, where the users first produce their user operations, and the bundler subsequently decides to bundle them. We assume that users do not possess information about the current amount of pending users, and so are unable to estimate the bundler’s true ability to amortise their fixed costs.</p>\n<p>In the first stage, users send their operations, which commit to their attributes such as <code>preVerificationGas</code>. In the second stage, the bundler having received all user transactions decides to output a bundle or set of bundles. Interestingly, even if the users know how many other users will play in the first stage, i.e., even if <span class=\"math\">n</span> is common knowledge across all users, the bundler may be able to force the users into setting the worst-case <code>preVerificationGas = F</code> by threatening to play <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{B}_\\text{pessimistic} = \\{ \\{ 1 \\}, \\{ 2 \\}, \\{ 3 \\}, \\dots, \\{ n \\} \\}</span>, i.e., threatening to keep every user in their own separate bundle and charging them the maximum amount gas <span class=\"math\">F</span>.</p>\n<p>Note that this threat may not be credible, as users would expect the bundler to prefer playing <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{B}_\\text{ideal} = \\{ \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, n \\} \\}</span>, i.e., output a single bundle with all operations included there, realising <span class=\"math\">\\pi</span>. However, users may not have access to the true value of <span class=\"math\">n</span>, and thus they are unable to set their <code>preVerificationGas</code> in a way that forces the bundler to ideally bundle all of them.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/a/2a1e3be0f917af5d2d8d3fa4c487a848543c76b2.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/2a1e3be0f917af5d2d8d3fa4c487a848543c76b2\" title=\"Ideal case: costs are split between the users in the bundle.

As it turns out, only 5 users appear on the market, who have all set their <code>preVerificationGas</code> to 1 too. The bundler will not be compensated for <code>F = 10</code> units of gas, thus the bundler does not output a bundle and users receive 0 utility. This is obviously suboptimal, as the users could have all set <code>preVerificationGas = 2</code> for instance and receive 1 utility (the maximum <code>preVerificationGas</code> they were willing to set minus the actual <code>preVerificationGas</code> they paid to be included).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a name=\"future-work-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#future-work-8\"></a>Future work</h2>\n<p>As the bundler game shows, an allocation problem faces the user wishing to be included by the bundler.

The proposer of slot <code>N</code> plans to reorg the block of <code>N+1</code>. For this they withhold their block during their time. After the proposer of <code>N+1</code> reveals his block (based on <code>N-1</code>) the attacker reveals their block <code>N</code> together with <span class=\"math\">\\beta</span> attestations for it.

The attack goes as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since the proposer of <code>N</code> wants to get their payload included, they can’t simply reveal their block after <code>N+1</code> does. They have to have a timely payload so that the PTC votes for it.</li>\n<li>They therefore reveal their consensus block targeting a split view of the attesters at 1/4 of a slot. <span class=\"math\">1-x</span> of the committee votes for <code>N-1</code>, as they didn’t see the block on time, and <span class=\"math\">x - \\beta</span> vote for <code>N</code> (the adversary withholds their attestations).</li>\n<li>The builder of <code>N</code> reveals on time and the PTC attests to the builder’s presence.</li>\n<li>The proposer of <code>N+1</code> will reveal a block based on <code>N-1</code> only if<br>\n<span class=\"math\"> 1 - 2x &gt; RB - \\beta</span><br>\nwhere RB is the reveal boost that the builder of <code>N</code> received.</li>\n<li>The attacker now reveals their attestations for <code>N</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The attack is successful if <span class=\"math\"> RB &gt; PB + 1 - 2x</span> But given the above inequality this implies <span class=\"math\">RB &gt; PB + RB - \\beta</span>. Therefore we obtain as in the current status quo <span class=\"math\">\\beta &gt; PB</span>.</p>\n<p>Since in ePBS the proposer boost PB is set to <span class=\"math\">20%</span>. One is inclined to think that we have ex-anti reorg protections only up to 20%, a considerable downgrade from the current implementation. But notice that <strong>the payload of N+1 is not reorged</strong>. In fact, the builder of N+1 will not reveal their block since the head is N when the attack is successful, and because of the <em>builder withholding safety</em>, their bid payment will not be necessary. In fact, in order to reorg the payload as well in ePBS, we would require a sandwich attack.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"sandwich-attacks-the-classical-case-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#sandwich-attacks-the-classical-case-3\"></a>Sandwich attacks the classical case</h2>\n<p>A sandwich attack is very similar to an ex-anti one, but now the adversary is proposing slots N and N+2 and plans to reorg the block N. Their setup is just as in the ex-anti attack: they reveal the block N late, together with <span class=\"math\">\\beta</span> attestations for it. Block <code>N+1</code> is early and receives <span class=\"math\">1 - \\beta</span> attestations (the attacker votes for <code>N</code> during N+1. The attacker then reveals N+2 based on N, obtaining proposer boost and attempting to reorg N+1.

In particular, to get the proposer of N+1 to base their block on N-1, the setup requires<br>\n<span class=\"math\"> 1 - 2x &gt; RB - \\beta</span><br>\nas above. The consensus block of N+1 receives <span class=\"math\">1 - \\beta</span> votes just as in the current implementation, and the builder of N+1 reveals timely obtaining a builder’s boost: this is the main difference, <strong>the builder’s boost makes this sandwich attack much more difficult</strong>.<br>\nThe attacker then reveals their N+2 block based on N. Obtaining proposer boost. The attacker’s branch then has weight <span class=\"math\">PB + \\beta + x</span>. While the canonical branch has weight <span class=\"math\">RB + 1 - \\beta + 1 - x</span>.

To give some numbers, in the current implementation we are resistant to 60% attackers for 1 slot post-anti reorgs and 53% for 2 slots post-anti-reorgs.

Since then, there have been various iterations on the network design, aiming to efficiently make the block data available in a P2P structure, and to let nodes sample from this structure. However, none of these constructs convincingly support blocks of 32MB, making the performance of the networking solution the real bottleneck. In this post we look at these networking issues and propose solutions, with the aim of making 32 MB (and possibly beyond) achievable.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"das-data-availability-vs-sampling-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#das-data-availability-vs-sampling-3\"></a>DAS: Data Availability vs. Sampling</h3>\n<p>The goal of DAS (Data Availability Sampling) is to ascertain, with high probability, that a given block of data was made available to anyone interested, and to do this without requiring any single node in the system to hold - or even to temporarily receive - the whole block of data.</p>\n<p>That is, we want to keep the bandwidth requirements of individual nodes at the levels of the current (after EIP-4844) Ethereum network, while handling orders of magnitude larger blocks. From the networking perspective, this is an important constraint on the Ethereum DAS design.</p>\n<p>For our discussion on networking aspects, it is important to emphasize that there are two distinct parts to DAS: the “making data available” part, and the “sampling” part.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"making-data-available-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#making-data-available-4\"></a>Making Data Available</h4>\n<p>First, the data has to be made available. Availability means that nodes in the system get “enough” data to be able together to reconstruct the original block. Thus, availability is a <strong>system level property</strong>: data is either available to the whole system, or not available. At least, this is what we want to achieve.</p>\n<p>As in P2P systems in general, the amount of data should better not be “just enough”, but it should be <strong>overwhelmingly enough</strong>, meaning the data can be reconstructed even if there is churn, network partitioning, or a large portion of malicious nodes. Only at this point we can say that the data was made available.</p>\n<p>In other words, we should design a protocol that makes sure that there are no borderline situations: the data is either not available (wasn’t released by the source), or it is overwhelmingly available. As we will see later, it is the interplay between erasure coding and a robust and largely redundant P2P networking structure that makes this possible.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"sampling-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#sampling-5\"></a>Sampling</h4>\n<p>Second, there is sampling. Sampling is an individual node’s view of what was made available to the system. It is a single node convincing itself that the data was made available, and the technique it uses for this is to retrieve a few pieces of the block. The <strong>sample</strong> is the (typically random) selection of the pieces to retrieve, while <strong>sampling</strong> is the retrieval of these pieces. If this sampling is successful, and with a few <strong>independence assumptions</strong>, the node can convince itself that the data was indeed made available.</p>\n<p>Importantly, in the background, behind the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/lossydas-lossy-incremental-and-diagonal-sampling-for-data-availability/18963#setting-the-sample-size-7\">probabilistic calculations</a>, there are those nasty independence assumptions. Essentially it is assumed that data is (was, or will be) released independent of what sample was selected. This unfortunately can be gamed, and the more the block producer and its “accomplices” knows about the sample selection of a node, the easier it is to introduce correlation and thus fool someone. Thus, <strong>sample selection</strong> and <strong>limited disclosure of the selection</strong> is an important part of the security guarantees.</p>\n<p><em>Note that in this writeup we call the pieces of the block <strong>segments</strong>, but they also go by the name “column” when 1D encoding is used, “cell” when 2D encoding is used, or sometimes the confusing term “sample” is used both the segment as well as for the list of selected segments.</em></p>\n<p><em>Also note that sampling is not the only technique we could use to “convince ourselves” that the data was available. Without trying to list all possibilities, we could use succinct proofs, trusted friends, etc. Sampling, however, is trustless and spreads segments of data to all nodes in the system, eventually enabling an extra layer of redundancy and thus recovery.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"interest-custody-vs-sample-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#interest-custody-vs-sample-6\"></a>Interest: Custody vs. Sample</h3>\n<p>Both when data is made available, and when nodes are sampling, segments of the block get delivered to nodes. Which segments get to which node, however, is driven by different objectives in these two phases.</p>\n<p>We call the segments that should be delivered to a node it’s <strong>interest</strong>. We have two types of interest in the system. They are similar, but serve different purposes and have some fundamental differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>custody</strong>: segments getting to nodes as part of making the data available are taken into custody and used to serve sampling. That is, custody has a double goal: providing availability and at the same time serving as a sampling infrastructure.</li>\n<li><strong>sample</strong>: sampling is for the individual node to convince itself about availability with very high probability by checking that enough segments are in custody.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interest can <strong>change over time</strong>, for example from epoch to epoch for the sample selection, or with some other time granularity for custody. Changing it or keeping it fixed has both security and network efficiency implications.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"das-phases-dispersal-vs-sampling-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#das-phases-dispersal-vs-sampling-7\"></a>DAS Phases: Dispersal vs. Sampling</h3>\n<p>The fundamental differences between the requirements of data availability and sampling, and between the properties of custody and sample, are also reflected in the network design. We can differentiate between two phases of segment distribution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>dispersal</strong>: in which segments of the block are distributed in the P2P network to provide overwhelming availability and custody.</li>\n<li><strong>sampling</strong>: in which nodes collect a random sample of segments from custody.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The two phases can use different P2P network constructs. In what follows we focus on these network constructs, deriving fast, robust, and bandwidth efficient protocols both for dispersal and for sampling.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"fulldas-networking-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#fulldas-networking-8\"></a>FullDAS networking</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/9/3/93a404791201f9e15e8d268a971c5fd54d120d7c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/93a404791201f9e15e8d268a971c5fd54d120d7c\" title=\"FullDAS - LossyDAS - liteDAS - Data Availability Sampling Components\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/9/3/93a404791201f9e15e8d268a971c5fd54d120d7c_2_666x500.jpeg\" alt=\"FullDAS - LossyDAS - liteDAS - Data Availability Sampling Components\" data-base62-sha1=\"l45APdFj7UJvsf2ot9sCYQImCKM\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/9/3/93a404791201f9e15e8d268a971c5fd54d120d7c_2_666x500.jpeg, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/9/3/93a404791201f9e15e8d268a971c5fd54d120d7c.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/9/3/93a404791201f9e15e8d268a971c5fd54d120d7c.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E4E2E4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In the original design, GossipSub was planned to be used for dispersal, with many (512 for columns and 512 for rows) topics, distributing columns and rows into custody at all the staked nodes (beacon nodes with validators). For sampling, instead, a separate DHT was planned to be set up from all full nodes (staked and non-staked), serving all the sampling queries. This presented several challenges, as we have <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/scalability-limitations-of-kademlia-dhts-when-enabling-data-availability-sampling-in-ethereum/18732\">highlighted in our related post and paper</a>.</p>\n<p>As a consequence, in <strong>PeerDAS</strong> and in <strong>SubnetDAS</strong> we have tweaked the design to provide intermediate solutions, with compromises both in functionality and in scalability.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/peerdas-a-simpler-das-approach-using-battle-tested-p2p-components/16541\">PeerDAS</a>, we have modified custody assignment and dispersal to be based on the NodeID, making all full nodes (both staked and non-staked) be part of the custody system. Sampling is then made from this P2P structure using a Request/Response (Req/Resp) protocol from existing peers of a node, adding more pressure on peer discovery (Discv5), and the number of peers that nodes have to sustain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/subnetdas-an-intermediate-das-approach/17169\">SubnetDAS</a>, instead, modifies the design to use the GossipSub distribution mechanism all the way, both for dispersal and for sampling. This, again, limits our possibilities, also sacrificing the unlinkability of sampling queries.</p>\n<p>A fast and bandwidth-efficient implementation of these proves to be challenging even for blocks of a few MBs, and this is where we arrive to our main topic: <strong>how to make DAS work for blocks of 32 MB and beyond?</strong></p>\n<p>In what follows, we introduce the important parts of the stack:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>liteDAS: fast and efficient sampling from custody</li>\n<li>Finding custody peers fast:\n<ul>\n<li>Custody allocation and sample selection</li>\n<li>Topic Routing</li>\n<li>Ephemeral Connect</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Making dispersal more efficient</li>\n<li>Availability amplification with 2D encoding</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"litedas-the-sampling-protocol-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#litedas-the-sampling-protocol-9\"></a>liteDAS: The Sampling Protocol</h3>\n<p>Sampling, at an abstract level, sounds very simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>take a random sample of block segment IDs</li>\n<li>ask for these from nodes custodying it</li>\n<li>wait for all the responses</li>\n<li>declare success if received all, otherwise declare failure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In reality, however, things get much more complicated. We have dealt with some of the complication related to sample selection in <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/lossydas-lossy-incremental-and-diagonal-sampling-for-data-availability/18963\">our post on LossyDAS, IncrementalDAS, and DiDAS</a>, but we have left out all the networking aspects from that post.</p>\n<p>To design a sampling protocol, besides the draft outline above, we should also answer questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when should a node start sampling?</li>\n<li>when should sampling end, what should be the timeout?</li>\n<li>if we know several nodes custodying the same segment, which one to ask?</li>\n<li>what to do if we do not know a node that is supposed to custody a segment?</li>\n<li>what to do when sampling fails?</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, we should design a protocol that is fast, robust, and bandwidth efficient.</p>\n<p>For sampling, we propose <strong>liteDAS</strong>, a new Req/Resp protocol that aims to provide close to minimum sampling latency with close to minimal bandwidth usage, avoiding excessive resource utilization both on the happy path and when there are issues. The key observations behind liteDAS are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no “perfect time” to ask for a segment, since we don’t know when dispersal will make these arrive to custody. It is better to ask early and wait.</li>\n<li>Sampling nodes have some time (the dispersal time) to prepare for sampling. We can use this time to make sampling efficient.</li>\n<li>We can hide our sample better if we ask for segments one-by-one, asking each from distinct nodes.</li>\n<li>Having a fast and efficient way of finding custody nodes for a given segment is essential.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>messaging primitive</strong> we propose is a <strong>request with an explicit timeout</strong>. This simple primitive allows us to start sampling early (at slot start), and build a nice dynamic behavior with an initial period to handle the happy path, and a second period to handle potential issues, as outlined below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At <span class=\"math\">T_0</span> (slot start, or when public parameters are known)\n<ul>\n<li>decide sample (list of segment IDs) using local randomness\n<ul>\n<li>eventually consider using <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/lossydas-lossy-incremental-and-diagonal-sampling-for-data-availability/18963#didas-steering-away-from-uniform-random-sampling-11\">DiDAS</a> and/or <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/lossydas-lossy-incremental-and-diagonal-sampling-for-data-availability/18963#lossydas-accept-partial-sampling-9\">LossyDAS</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For each ID:\n<ul>\n<li>select list of candidate peers who might custody given ID</li>\n<li>select <span class=\"math\">P=1</span> of these candidate nodes (eventually ranking), and send request with long timeout (e.g. 4s). <span class=\"math\">P</span> is the “parallelism” parameter.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>at <span class=\"math\">T_1=4s</span>\n<ul>\n<li>for every ID still missing\n<ul>\n<li>select next candidate node and send request with short timeout</li>\n<li>use timeouts and the number of outstanding queries to avoid traffic explosion</li>\n<li>eventually search for new candidates (this can also be done proactive, before <span class=\"math\">T_1</span>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Optionally, extend sample according to <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/lossydas-lossy-incremental-and-diagonal-sampling-for-data-availability/18963#incrementaldas-dynamically-increase-the-sample-size-10\">IncrementalDAS</a> with some period</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Intuitively, this is fast (reducing sampling latency close to minimum), bandwidth efficient (sending only one Req/Resp per segment on the happy path), and robust (explores sampling options once custody should be there).</p>\n<h4><a name=\"fast-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#fast-10\"></a>Fast</h4>\n<p>Sending the sampling query at the start of the slot allows us to minimize the sampling delay to a single 1-hop latency on top of the dispersal delay (the delay with which the node we queried received the segment or column).</p>\n<p>In more detail, to understand why this is fast, let’s see what would be the fastest. The minimum sampling latency would be what one could achieve if the node asks, right when it knows what samples it needs, all its peers that could have the sample, i.e. all peers that plan to custody that segment. That would however mean that our node receives lots of responses, adding considerable extra load. In liteDAS we only ask <span class=\"math\">P</span> of them at a time, as a compromise between bandwidth efficiency and latency. <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/big-block-diffusion-and-organic-big-blocks-on-ethereum/17346\">Our data on GossipSub latency distribution</a> and our initial simulations show that the latency compromise is very limited on the happy path.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"bandwidth-efficient-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#bandwidth-efficient-11\"></a>Bandwidth efficient</h4>\n<p>The protocol receives every sample (or column) exactly once on the happy path. On the unhappy path, we can set a compromise between following a sequential logic with short timeouts, or allowing some parallelism (and thus duplicates) by changing <span class=\"math\">P</span> in later phases. Importantly, if the data is actually not available, it will still keep resource utilization in limits.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"robust-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#robust-12\"></a>Robust</h4>\n<p>In the first phase, the robustness of the above sampling relies on the robustness of dispersal. Dispersal already employs a number of reliability techniques, thus, when on the happy path, it is very likely that for every ID, the single node we select will receive the sample.<br>\nIf instead there are issues with dispersal, our sampling also becomes less latency sensitive: sampling should anyway not succeed until availability through custody is widespread. Thus, we have time to “hunt” for segments. After the initial phase, our protocol will cycle through potential other peers taking in custody the same segment. At that point, we can also send more queries in parallel, eventually allowing some duplicates.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"possible-extensions-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#possible-extensions-13\"></a>Possible Extensions</h4>\n<p>Beyond the basic idea, there are a few other tweaks that can improve dynamic behaviour:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nodes can anticipate the hunt for peers that could provide a given segment. These are the peers that will eventually custody that segment.</li>\n<li>Since sample selection is done using local randomness, nodes could even prepare the sample (list of IDs) well in advance, anticipating the search for candidate peers with slots or even epochs.</li>\n<li>To avoid traffic explosion, we recommend controlling the number of outstanding queries, together with timeouts. This practically means that we can avoid traffic explosion even in cases of an unavailable block or when there are large-scale network issues.</li>\n<li>As mentioned before, asking one node at a time works, but this can be increased to e.g asking 2 or 3 in parallel. These are compromises that can even be made locally, we can’t really mandate them anyway. (Actually we could, using Rate Limiting Nullifier-like techniques, but that’s out of scope here and seems too complex for the scope).</li>\n<li>We could also include a HAVE list in the query response message. The reason behind this is that it gives extra information on the state of diffusion that we would not have otherwise. Given the 1D or 2D structure, a have list can be compressed very well to a small bitmap, so it is not much extra bytes. Eventually, to stay generic on the message primitive, we can make it a flag in the request whether we want a HAVE list in the response.</li>\n<li>Finally, it is worth mentioning that sampling nodes could use the information collected during protocol execution to feed back segments into custody. One way to make this happen is to introduce a Resp with a NACK (negative acknowledgment) style message when the timeout has passed and the segment is not in custody. This “counter-request” would mean that the sampling node should send the segment when it receives it from someone.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"finding-custody-peers-fast-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#finding-custody-peers-fast-14\"></a>Finding Custody Peers Fast</h3>\n<p>liteDAS still assumes we have the peers to send requests to. What if we don’t have these, and we have to search for peers taking in custody a given ID? What if we also have to go through a convoluted connection procedure before requesting the segment?</p>\n<p>As highlighted before, we can anticipate the search for custody peers. Still, there are times when we need to search for peers with a specific ID in custody, and that should be relatively fast. This is a crucial point currently being debated in discussions around DAS. As part of the sampling process, we need to find and connect to peers in a few seconds, which seems to be one of the main limiting factors. There is a similar problem for dispersal as well when building the mesh for efficient column(/row) based distribution, although in that case timing is less critical.</p>\n<p>The problem with the current protocol stack was summarized well by AgeManning as <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3623#issuecomment-2046558155\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">part of the PeerDAS spec discussions</a>. Getting individual segments from new peers is awfully inefficient with the current stack. Clearly, the problem has two mayor underlying aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Finding nodes is inefficient</strong>: currently this would be done using Discv5. Since Discv5 has no topic search, it is a random walk on the DHT, enumerating peers in hope of finding a good one. We propose to make this faster by deterministic custody assignment and by what we call “topic routing”.</li>\n<li><strong>Connecting to nodes is inefficient</strong>: we intend to solve this by introducing “ephemeral connect”.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"deterministic-nodeid-based-custody-assignment-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#deterministic-nodeid-based-custody-assignment-15\"></a>Deterministic NodeID-based Custody Assignment</h4>\n<p>First, lets see what we can do to find custody nodes for a given segment fast. The key to this is to assign custody wisely.</p>\n<p>Since we need system-wide availability, custody has to be assigned properly, providing good coverage. A randomized local selection would provide this, but fortunately we can do better. A nice property of custody is that we <strong>do not need to hide who takes custody of what</strong>. We can use this property to make our system more efficient by <strong>deriving custody interest from the NodeID</strong> (eventually with some rotation scheme and using public randomness) in a deterministic way. It seems that publicly exposing the interest of nodes for the purposes of custody does not influence security. It also seems that we can expose interest publicly well ahead of time (keeping custody stable in time, similar to what we do with attestations today), and it still does not create security issues.</p>\n<p><em>Note that there is a catch here: by using the NodeID, we are not binding custody to validators, as in the original proposal, but to full nodes (including non-staked nodes). Thus, we cannot really mandate custody. We currently do not want to mandate it anyway, but later we might introduce <a href=\"https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/09/30/proofs-of-custody.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Proof Of Custody</a>, and then we have to revisit this point. It is also relatively easy to create a large amount of new NodeIDs, potentially exposing custody to targeted sybil attacks.</em></p>\n<p>By deriving custody from NodeID, we can speed up search in two ways. First, we can derive custody from the leftmost bits of the nodeID. This allows us to use the Discv5 Kademlia search instead of a random walk, since Kademlia is prefix-based. Second, if a custody rotation scheme is used (nodes changed what columns/rows they custody with some period), we can calculate this from the NodeID, without contacting the peers or getting updated ENR records from Discv5.</p>\n<p>We already use this NodeID-based deterministic custody assignment trick in PeerDAS: it allows us to make the dispersal more efficient, and it also allows sampling peers to find custody nodes easier, just based on the NodeID and a small amount of metadata published together with the NodeID in the ENR.</p>\n<p><em>Note that the same is not true for the sample, where we do care about making it relatively hard to figure out what will be sampled by a given node, as otherwise we would make it easy to attack individual nodes. Hence, we cannot derive the sample (list of segment IDs) from the NodeID, and we also better avoid sending the whole sample (again, the list of IDs, not the data) to a single node. We thus prefer nodes to request samples on-the-fly, preferably exposing interest selectively to a diverse set of peers, limiting the exposure of the individual node.</em></p>\n<h4><a name=\"topic-routing-efficiently-finding-nodes-for-a-given-column-or-row-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#topic-routing-efficiently-finding-nodes-for-a-given-column-or-row-16\"></a>Topic Routing: efficiently finding nodes for a given column or row</h4>\n<p>Another option we have at hand is to introduce custody node search into our protocol directly, circumventing the difficulties with Discv5.</p>\n<p>In current proposals, columns are distributed using GossipSub, with different column IDs mapping to different GossipSub topics. The column ID space is seen as a flat list, without considering any relation between topics.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>we do not have to handle the row and column ID space as a flat ID space</strong>. We can use almost any distance metric, and require nodes to keep a few neighbors with column/row ID close to them, enabling faster search. Some examples to explain how this might work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Circlular: if a node participates in column C, it has to keep at least N neighbors from the range <code>[C-D, C+D] mod NUM_COLS</code>, for some selected <code>D</code> and <code>N</code></li>\n<li>Hypercube style:  if a node participates in column C, it has to keep at least N neighbors from columns <code>C+2^j mod NUM_COLS</code>, for <code>j in [0..log2(NUM_COLS}-1]</code></li>\n<li>Kademlia style:  if a node participates in column C, it has to keep at least N neighbors from the set of columns we get by keeping the j MSB (most significant) bits fixed, and flipping bit j+1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first one (circular) is not really scalable, the last two have good scalability. However, if we keep the number of columns(and rows) sufficiently low, any of these will work good enough to find potential neighbors for any C. If we want to scale higher, we might want to pick the best one for our use.</p>\n<p>Note that the topic ID space is dense, with each ID representing a topic, and the number of nodes we have is expected to be higher than the number of topics. In a typical DHT, instead, keys and node IDs are sparse in the ID space. Having a dense ID space allows us to simplify search.</p>\n<p>It is relatively easy to extend any of the above techniques to handle both rows and columns, either by handling the column and row ID spaces as two separate ID spaces, or by defining a joint distance function.</p>\n<p>Also note that when sampling in 2D, we look for either a node in column C, or a node in row R. Any of these will suffice, making our search faster.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"ephemeral-connect-fast-connect-for-sample-retrieval-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#ephemeral-connect-fast-connect-for-sample-retrieval-17\"></a>Ephemeral Connect: fast connect for sample retrieval</h4>\n<p>Connection issues are mainly due to a protocol limitation, since we are operating over libP2P, which was not originally designed for fast connectivity. We make our life even harder by keeping a hard limit on connected peers, and by keeping that full in many nodes (it is known that some peers do not accept connections, and as a consequence others are overloaded, having their peer count full, and thus also not accepting new connections).</p>\n<p>We list a few possible solutions to this problem below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>libP2P-ephemeralConnect: we could add a new flag to the connect request indicating a connection that is timing out fast. This can be allowed-in on the receiving side above peer count limits.</li>\n<li>Use a new primitive outside of the libp2p framework: If we want a secure encrypted protocol, but something more efficient than a libP2P modification, we can e.g. easily reuse our Discv5 DHT primitives here, making a Discv5 request in a handshake. That employs only 2 roundtrips, and a few bytes of data. Of course, this is just an example of what could be achieved. Other custom protocols with similar latency/bandwidth characteristics can be derived as well.</li>\n<li>Query forwarding: If we really do not want to add another primitive, we can introduce query forwarding. A node can take one of it’s peers according to Topic Routing, and send to it a forwardable query. We’ll get the sample in 2 hops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In our opinion these can solve the connectivity issues, getting us to FullDAS. However, more testing is needed.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-dispersal-protocol-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#the-dispersal-protocol-18\"></a>The Dispersal Protocol</h3>\n<p>Initially, we intend to use GossipSub for dispersal for several reasons. It is a publish-subscribe protocol which maps well to the erasure coding structure, creating separate topics per column (if using 1D erasure coding), or for columns and rows (if using 2D erasure coding). It is also battle-tested, already used in Ethereum for block diffusion and attestation aggregation, showing fast and reliable operation, as discussed in <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/big-block-diffusion-and-organic-big-blocks-on-ethereum/17346\">our related post measuring latency distributions for block diffusion and for attestations</a>.</p>\n<p>In PeerDAS, we are in fact mapping the dispersal problem to a relatively small number of GossipSub topics. While this is a reasonable first approach, there are aspects that are specific to the dispersal problem and allow for performance optimisations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"making-dispersal-even-more-efficient-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#making-dispersal-even-more-efficient-19\"></a>Making dispersal even more efficient</h4>\n<p>We have studied how fast blocks can be dispersed into custody using <a href=\"https://github.com/codex-storage/das-research\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our custom DAS simulator</a>, both for the 1D and for the 2D erasure coded case. If column and row topics are correctly populated, GossipSub can disperse the block data in seconds to thousands of nodes, as shown in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-xkP4FzYMQ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our presentations at EthereumZurich’23</a>, and in later presentations (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1e_LDrKxZg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EDCON’23</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al7Jns8bCO4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EthPrague’23</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUAVEbzLHLk\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EthCC’23</a>). However, in these talks we are speaking of GossipSub-like pub-sub protocols for a reason. GossipSub, as is, is not the best option we have. We argue that we can make a few changes to make it work well for our case. Eventually, we might also derive a custom protocol specifically targeting the dispersal use case.</p>\n<p>In what follows, we list a few of the possible differences between a generic use of GossipSub topics and dispersal, showing some of the optimizations that can be made. We will dedicate a separate post to extend these in detail.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"compared-to-generic-gossipsub-topics-das-topics-are-extremely-structured-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#compared-to-generic-gossipsub-topics-das-topics-are-extremely-structured-20\"></a>Compared to generic GossipSub topics, DAS “topics” are extremely structured</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>With the 512 row and 512 column structure, we can map any ID into 1+9 bits (1 bit for direction, 9 bits for position) or a 9+9 bits ID space.</li>\n<li>We can then use compact representations in message IDs, in HAVE lists, and in many other data structures.</li>\n<li>Given the compact representation, we can also piggyback diffusion state information easily on other messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><a name=\"with-many-topics-finding-peers-can-become-hard-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#with-many-topics-finding-peers-can-become-hard-21\"></a>With many topics, finding peers can become hard</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>We address this partly by deterministic NodeID-based custody assignment,</li>\n<li>Partly by “topic routing” based on a topic ID proximity metric.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><a name=\"das-segments-of-a-single-block-are-unordered-which-we-can-use-to-our-benefit-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#das-segments-of-a-single-block-are-unordered-which-we-can-use-to-our-benefit-22\"></a>DAS segments of a single block are unordered, which we can use to our benefit</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>We can speed up delivery by “rarest first” like techniques. Rarest-fist scheduling is used in P2P dissemination to cut the tail of the latency distribution, equalizing the diffusion of different pieces. Rarest-first requires precise “have” information, which is typically not available, but it can be approximated. For example, a technique we have already implemented in our simulators is to make sure a copy of every single segment is sent out by the block producer before sending the second copy to another neighbor. We start by sending only one copy of each segment, to one of the block producer’s column/row neighbors (randomized), seeding segments in random places in the network. Only then we send second copies to other peers. Later, one can use information collected through e.g. IHAVE bitmaps to estimate which segments are diffusing well, and which seem to be hindered, prioritizing further seeding based on this information.</li>\n<li>We might also speed up delivery by “node coloring” techniques: these techniques are about specializing nodes to prioritize the distribution of a specific subset of the ID space they custody.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><a name=\"with-tcp-we-pay-the-cost-of-in-order-reliable-delivery-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#with-tcp-we-pay-the-cost-of-in-order-reliable-delivery-23\"></a>With TCP we pay the cost of in-order reliable delivery</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>GossipSub defaults to using in-order reliable delivery over the topic mesh, which has an inherent cost.</li>\n<li>DAS does not need ordering between segments (to the contrary, shuffling is beneficial).</li>\n<li>DAS does not need P2P link-level reliability (because of all the other reliability techniques we have: multi-path, EC, pull, cross-feeding between columns and rows).</li>\n<li>Thus, using e.g. randomized best-effort delivery can provide overall better performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><a name=\"duplicate-reduction-techniques-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#duplicate-reduction-techniques-24\"></a>Duplicate reduction techniques</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>With GossipSub we pay a relatively high bandwidth cost of duplicate deliveries. Basically, every single message traverses every topic mesh link at least once. Sometimes even twice, when sent from both sides close in time (less than the one-way latency). This means that on average, every message is sent at least D/2 times, where D is the target mesh degree.</li>\n<li>These duplicates serve multiple purposes: contribute to robustness, to low latency, and to protecting sender identity. However, in DAS, we do not need to protect sender identity. Because of the traffic volume, we can’t protect it. This, and the fact that we are distributing over several topics in parallel, allow for optimizations.\n<ul>\n<li>One option is to use the IDONTWANT proposal</li>\n<li>We might also use techniques based on diffusion state, such as Push-Pull phase transition: in the first steps of the diffusion of a segment, there are almost no duplicates. Most of the duplicate load is happening in the last steps of the diffusion. One can emphasize Push at the beginning (even with an increased degree, sending to more nodes than without this technique), and change to gossip-and-pull towards the end of diffusion if the diffusion state can be estimated.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"the-need-for-2d-encoding-availability-amplification-through-in-network-repair-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#the-need-for-2d-encoding-availability-amplification-through-in-network-repair-25\"></a>The Need for 2D Encoding: availability amplification through in-network repair</h3>\n<p>Erasure Coding is mostly presented in DAS descriptions as a tool to make sampling more robust. However, we should highlight that we can use Erasure Coding in the design for two purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>to amplify sampling, and</li>\n<li>to amplify availability.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Amplifying sampling</strong> is well understood: using a code with rate R=K/N (e.g. 1/2), and assuming the data is not available, every single sampled segment reduces the chance of not finding out about the data not being available by a factor of 2. We like this exponential property, letting us reach a very low False Positive (FP) rate with only a few segments sampled. In the 2D case, the ratio is not as good as in 1D, but we still have a nice exponential property.</p>\n<p><strong>Amplifying availability</strong> is a different thing. It means that if data is available, we make it overwhelmingly available. We achieve this by using <strong>in-network repair</strong> during dispersal. This is where our erasure coding structure and dispersal network structure meet. By organising nodes according to the code, in columns and rows, and by making nodes participate in both rows and columns, we enable local repair in the EC structure during dispersal.</p>\n<p>This in-network repair is then amplifying availability, as we have shown in simulations already in our <a href=\"https://youtu.be/M-xkP4FzYMQ?t=1183\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EthereumZuri.ch’23 talk</a>. Basically, if not enough samples are released, segment count stays below 75%, while row/coumn-based sampling (SubnetSampling), used by validators, and also by full nodes in many of our constructs, remains very low. Segment sampling also remains very low.</p>\n<p>If instead one more segment is released, the result is amplified by the dispersal structure to almost 100%.</p>\n<p>For this amplification mechanism to work, however, we need the 2D code. We cannot really do it in the 1D case, because in the 1D case, repair could only be done in nodes having K pieces, basically the whole block. In the 2D case, instead, we can repair in any single row or column, so individual nodes can repair and then send. In other words, we need a code with local repair. We can make such a code with 2D RS (there are also other code constructs with local repair capabilities, if we want).</p>\n<p>Thus, while we could map segment IDs to custody in many ways, we do it by columns and rows to enable in-network repair and availability amplification during dispersal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusions-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#conclusions-26\"></a>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Our aim with this post was to outline the main building blocks of FullDAS, the networking stack we propose for DAS with blocks of 32MB and beyond. We have discussed new ways to disperse the block data into a P2P structure of custody, while also amplifying data availability. We have also shown the tools needed to implement fast, bandwidth-efficient, and robust sampling from this structure, using liteDAS, Topic Routing, and improved connection mechanisms.</p>\n<p>At this point it might be evident to many that we are building something similar to a DHT, a point raised a few times in the past: the difference between dispersal to custody and sampling, and the generic concept of a DHT is not that big. With FullDAS we are in fact building a special purpose distributed storage structure, with custom seeding, repair, and retrieval, each optimized for the DAS encoding and for the DAS purpose.</p>\n<p>Some of the above techniques have already been evaluated in simulation, while others are work in progress.

This post suggests a mechanism by which votes can be off-chain by default; a vote would only need to go on-chain if the coordinator is actively attempting to censor voters.</p>\n<p>When a user makes a vote, take the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user locally generates their vote, as in regular MACI</li>\n<li>The user sends their vote to the coordinator</li>\n<li>The coordinator replies with a signature, specifying which position of the next batch the user’s vote will be included at</li>\n<li>When the coordinator submits their next batch, they submit only a hash to the chain. The hash must be the Merkle root of all votes that have been sent to the coordinator since the previous round. The coordinator is also required to publish the full set of votes (eg. on IPFS).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The ZK-SNARK enforces that the final vote results are the result of processing all submitted votes, including votes that have been published via this hash mechanism.</p>\n<p>Users have access to two extra features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They have the ability to submit a vote directly to chain. The coordinator is forced to process both types of votes (included via hash, and included directly)</li>\n<li>If a user has a cryptographically signed promise, they can publish that promise on chain as a challenge. Any future message that the coordinator submits (a batch or the final result) must come with a SNARK proving that the correct votes have been included at the provided challenge positions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This ensures the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assuming an honest coordinator, onchain costs go down to O(1) per batch period</li>\n<li>Censorship resistance is maintained, because users can go onchain worst-case</li>\n<li>We mitigate attacks where the coordinator pretends to accept a vote, but then fails to include it, hoping that most voters will not notice or re-open any kind of software daemon, by providing signatures:\n<ul>\n<li>If a user fails to get a signature immediately, they go straight to voting onchain.</li>\n<li>If a user gets a signature, and they do come back to check after the batch, they can check on IPFS (or ask the coordinator) for the Merkle branch associated with their vote; if it does not match their signature, they can publish their signature to chain, which effectively halts the entire vote and prevents it from giving a result. Hence, trying to censor even one voter becomes extremely risky for a coordinator.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>8 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/maci-with-mostly-off-chain-happy-path/19527\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/maci-with-mostly-off-chain-happy-path/19527","pubDate":"Sat, 11 May 2024 10:47:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19527"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/maci-with-mostly-off-chain-happy-path/19527.rss","#text":"MACI with mostly-off-chain \"happy path\""},"filter":false},{"title":"Based proposer commitments - Ethereum’s marketplace for proposer commitments","dc:creator":"DrewVanderWerff","category":"Block proposer","description":"<p><em>As always, humbled by the Ethereum community’s willingness to review / provide feedback.

We see proposer commitments as another promising evolution of Ethereum’s original core vision that will expand the infinite garden to not just be THE marketplace for credible blockspace, but also THE marketplace for credible proposer commitments.

On the back of this, some of the authors and community members started a research collective to provide solutions to tackle these challenges. In the end, these efforts created a product more broadly known as <a href=\"https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MEV-boost</a>.</p>\n<p>MEV-boost is a middleware that allows the proposer to make a wholesale commitment that outsources block building to a sophisticated actor called a block builder. In return, these block builders pack a block to earn the highest fee for the proposer. Today, <a href=\"https://mevboost.pics/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">over 90% of blocks</a> are built with proposer commitments.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposer Commitments:</strong></p>\n<p>On the back of a few developments[2] and some research by the EF[3], the concept of proposer commitments has begun to be more commonly discussed spurring the question; could proposers make commitments that would unlock a significant design space for Ethereum? And, could this be a mechanism to allow validators “…to provide input into block production, even when they decide to delegate building.”[4] In the last year, multiple proposals have come forward that rely on or could greatly benefit from proposer commitments, some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inclusion lists: Proposer commitment where part of the block / a set of transactions will be included / can’t be censored or removed by a third party, including the proposer</li>\n<li>Preconf: Proposer commitment to in advance, guarantee inclusion of data / certain transaction or group of transactions in a block</li>\n<li>Partial block auctions: Proposer commitment to auction off the top-of-block and the rest-of-block</li>\n<li>Blockspace / blob futures: Proposer commitment to sell part of their block now, but deliver that part of the block in the future</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposals range in complexity but are underpinned by the same simple idea–a proposer’s commitment to do something with or for a third party. We also note that proposers may not need to make commitments at this level of granularity (i.e., continue to use wholesale block auctions). However, we believe this is an avenue worth exploring as it may help preserve things like chain neutrality “by allowing them to provide input into block production, even when they decide to delegate building”[4] and if they choose, give some autonomy back to the proposer.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge:</strong></p>\n<p>On the surface, this all seems great and is an incredibly exciting development. But, in the undercurrents, we are potentially on a perilous path if we can’t agree on a standard of how proposers register and make / receive commitments. We see multiple risks including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased fragmentation: While diversity of standards can create unlock more innovation, multiple standards (particularly in the last mile of communication) could compromise the security integrity of the entire Ethereum network through fragmentation of how proposer commitment protocols speak to proposers (i.e., proposers may need to make client adjustments for each variation of proposer commitments)</li>\n<li>Development complexity: If there is no standard, teams may more commonly make client adjustments to opt into proposer commitments. This could exponentially inflate the burden on core developers tasked with executing / testing major network upgrades increasing risks for the network around hard forks</li>\n<li>Limited transparency: With multiple software and standards, transparency around what proposers are opting into as well as bugs and taking quick actions may be challenging when something does go wrong</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These risks are likely to only increase as more and more proposer commitments get proposed and adopted. We also note that longer-term there are potential ideas to enshrine various mechanisms helping to reduce these risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong></p>\n<p>We propose an out-of-protocol, open-source public good that is backward compatible to help standardize the communication mechanism for the last mile of proposers’ commitments. The goal is to develop, adopt, and then sustain one standard software that will limit fragmentation and reduce complexity for core devs. We currently call this Commitment Boost.</p>\n<p><strong>Design Principles:</strong></p>\n<p>Below are a few design principles when initially envisioning Commitment Boost.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open source / open development: This should be developed in the open and under open source licensing such as MIT / Apache-2.0</li>\n<li>Safety and reducing risks: Should be backwards compatible not changing existing pipes that support current proposer commitments and be built to isolate each proposer commitment. We also note that Commitment Boost should be continuously managed for future forks / upgrades in the Ethereum ecosystem</li>\n<li>Same overhead as today: The software will not have more overhead to run than existing proposer commitments (and ideally it is even more efficient!). Note: there may be additional overhead for facilitating the actual proposer commitments, but it is not the focus of this discussion and will be up to the proposer commitment protocol itself around how to potentially outsource any complexity</li>\n<li>Transparency: There will need to be robust functionality to understand which commitments a proposer is opting into as well as performing rigorous testing to quickly identify bugs. There should also be data APIs to increase information and transparency for the community and to strengthen alerting systems when bugs happen</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Initial High-Level Potential Design of Commitment Boost:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposer wishing to register for commitments runs Commitment Boost. This will be backward compatible with consensus clients using the same messaging mechanisms that exist today. Commitment Boost is just focused on standardizing the last mile communication between a proposer choosing to register and then send / receive messages to / from a proposer commitment protocol</li>\n<li>Once running Commitment Boost, the proposer will need to register for each commitment they wish to make</li>\n<li>Each proposer commitment across the Commitment Boost stack is likely to be modular and isolated. The rationale that if there is a bug in one module this will not impact the rest of the proposer commitments / block construction. We also note that safeguards should be put in place to protect consensus (i.e., fallback mechanisms to local block building etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/3/43f7a19652088da9f139f178060df90293cebbf0.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/43f7a19652088da9f139f178060df90293cebbf0\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/3/43f7a19652088da9f139f178060df90293cebbf0_2_531x309.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9HgxlLbVleMaHdQv1FfJFNrhzvq\" width=\"531\" height=\"309\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/3/43f7a19652088da9f139f178060df90293cebbf0_2_531x309.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/3/43f7a19652088da9f139f178060df90293cebbf0_2_796x463.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/3/43f7a19652088da9f139f178060df90293cebbf0.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B3BAB2\"></a></div><br>\n<strong>Near-Term Focus:</strong><p></p>\n<p>As noted above, Commitment Boost should lean towards being modular to potentially allow any proposer commitment. However, we initially plan to focus on designing standards for Commitment Boost to be backward compatible and to support commitments such as preconf protocols and inclusion lists. If other projects require proposer commitments and are interested in thinking through designs please reach out.</p>\n<p><strong>Open Questions:</strong></p>\n<p>Below is a list of questions that we need to consider and engage around. We note that some of these are not specific to Commitment Boost, but proposer commitments more broadly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added risks: While there are general risks and questions on enabling proposer commitment protocols, we are particularly interested to engage on additional risks / the initial high-level design of Commitment Boost and whether the design can reduce risks to any commitment potentially impacting consensus</li>\n<li>Standardization is not always good: While in most cases standardization helps align the market and reduces the risk of fragmentation, it can also limit innovation and create “tech debt” that can confine the design space given how early we are and what we know about proposer commitments today</li>\n<li>How modules are added: It is not clear the best path forward around a process, or lack of, for how new proposer commitment modules are added</li>\n<li>Coordination during Ethereum upgrades: Likely will need to coordinate a group to ensure there is a process to perform testing / changes related to forks</li>\n<li>Upgrades to commitment boost: Similar to the point directly above, if we identify some upgrades needed we will need to test and manage any code changes required</li>\n<li>Economics: Are there any considerations around how proposers are paid for committing and how this could impact Ethereum / could these be internalized to Ethereum in the future</li>\n<li>Centralization: What are the impacts Commitment Boost could have on centralization and does it impact at-home stakers or geographical dispersion of validators</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>The garden of Ethereum is infinite and the potential for proposer commitments could set off a wave of ways to use Ethereum. Proposer commitments could enable things like preconfs that are critical for based sequencing as well as other applications not currently envisioned. To help the community and entrepreneurs build on Ethereum, Commitment Boost is an initial idea to standardize the way proposers register and send / receive commitments.

Below, we attach our submission in fulfillment of the objectives behind the project. In this deliverable, we have provided the necessary motivation and background for the problem of measuring client diversity, which we then use to propose and analyze three different approaches for validators to privately share their client diversity data—each with their strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nethermind.notion.site/Allowing-validators-to-provide-client-information-privately-bfea6436bfe246d28afdcda125d9049c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Deliverable: Allowing validators to provide client information privately </a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"executive-summary-of-the-proposed-approaches-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#executive-summary-of-the-proposed-approaches-1\"></a>Executive summary of the proposed approaches.</h2>\n<p>We briefly summarize the key ideas behind the three approaches before. The reader is referred to the deliverable for a full exposition.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-client-diversity-data-on-the-graffiti-field-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-1-client-diversity-data-on-the-graffiti-field-2\"></a>1. Client diversity data on the graffiti field</h3>\n<p>As the first approach, we have discussed a method for measuring validator client diversity by posting data directly on the graffiti field. We note that this approach has been discussed by the community before. We have outlined necessary changes, such as creating an EngineAPI method for CL clients to retrieve EL client details and agreeing on encoding standards for the data. We have also discussed challenges with this method including dealing with parties that do not participate, multiplexed architectures, and distinguishing between proposer and attester duties.</p>\n<p>We have also discussed statistical significance, i.e., how many client data reports are needed to accurately estimate the client distribution from graffiti field data alone. We confirmed that the analyzed method can reach statistical significance quickly (in the order of days) assuming a reasonable participation rate. We discuss these assertions quantitatively in the deliverable.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have assessed the feasibility of anonymizing graffiti field reports, concluding that existing methods like encryption or zero-knowledge proofs are impractical to use due to the sequential nature of data collection and the limited space in the graffiti field.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-allowing-nodes-to-listen-to-client-diversity-data-through-the-gossip-network-using-nullifiers-to-hide-the-identity-of-validators-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-2-allowing-nodes-to-listen-to-client-diversity-data-through-the-gossip-network-using-nullifiers-to-hide-the-identity-of-validators-3\"></a>2. Allowing nodes to listen to client diversity data through the gossip network + using nullifiers to hide the identity of validators</h3>\n<p>As the second approach, we have examined a potential modification to Ethereum’s P2P layer to enable crawlers to obtain validator distribution for client diversity. We have explored using a dedicated channel in the GossipSub protocol to share client diversity data efficiently. We have proposed a method that periodically selects validators at random to submit their client diversity data, which is then shared through GossipSub. Each validator forms its client diversity data into a <strong>ClientData</strong> object and publishes it via a designated topic. Then, the nodes in this designated topic can receive those objects, verify their authenticity, and aggregate them for the final result. We have also discussed the challenges around this method, particularly concerning network overload.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we have explored anonymizing P2P reports to ensure validators’ privacy. We have discussed potential approaches such as encrypting client data or anonymizing the voters’ identities using nullifiers and zero-knowledge proofs. We have proposed an approach that uses BLS signatures, nullifiers, and zero-knowledge proofs to hide validators’ identities and prevent double submissions. Validators submit encoded client data along with proofs to a P2P network. We have discussed potential deanonymization vectors such as P2P traffic analysis and proposed mitigation strategies like mixnets and approaches based on Dandelion and Dandelion++.</p>\n<p>Implementing these strategies may face challenges such as increased latency and complexity. We have stressed our interest in community input regarding the concern level over potential attack vectors and the feasibility of mitigation strategies.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-dedicated-voting-scheme-for-client-data-collection-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-3-dedicated-voting-scheme-for-client-data-collection-4\"></a>3. Dedicated voting scheme for client data collection</h3>\n<p>As the third and last approach, we have proposed a voting protocol aimed at collecting data from validators securely and verifiably, avoiding issues like obscurity and centralization found in existing survey methods. We have examined the use of public bulletin boards (PBBs) or blockchains for collecting votes, drawing insights from Vitalik’s analysis of blockchains’ limitations in elections and the advantages of using blockchains as bulletin boards. Due to its decentralization and cost-efficiency, we have proposed to utilize a blockchain, specifically Ethereum’s Holesky Testnet. Regarding how validators submit their votes, we have considered having validators encrypt their client data and share it through a P2P network, and using a trusted committee—called decryption authorities—to receive the encrypted data, submit the received data to a smart contract, and finally, aggregate and decrypt the encrypted client data.</p>\n<p>This third method addresses some of the traffic analysis concerns in the second method by leveraging homomorphic encryption of the votes, which requires a trusted committee.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"a-call-for-feedback-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#a-call-for-feedback-5\"></a>A call for feedback</h1>\n<p>As the next stage of this research project, we look forward to disseminating and discussing the aforementioned approaches through various channels, including this forum and community calls. Thus, we welcome discussions with the Ethereum community to gauge the impressions on the most suitable approach. For example,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the deliverable above, we have provided a rubric that ranks the downsides of each method according to their severity as perceived by the team.

This limits scalability and performance in sharded blockchain architectures. There is a need for a more efficient and resilient consensus mechanism that can scale to large networks while maintaining security guarantees.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal</strong> Triadic consensus organizes validator nodes within each shard into a fractal data structure based on the Sierpinski triangle. Nodes are grouped into recursive “triads” of three nodes each. Consensus is reached by propagating votes across these triads in a recursive manner. Each node independently validates transactions and broadcasts votes to its triad peers. Votes are aggregated at each triad level, with the majority outcome determining the triad vote. If a triad commits a transaction, the vote is propagated to the parent triad at the level above.

If <span class=\"math\">tx</span> is valid, then at least <span class=\"math\">2</span> nodes will broadcast <span class=\"math\">v_{i,j} = 1</span>, and thus <span class=\"math\">V_{\\tau_i} = 1</span>. Conversely, if <span class=\"math\">tx</span> is invalid, then at least <span class=\"math\">2</span> nodes will broadcast <span class=\"math\">v_{i,j} = 0</span>, and thus <span class=\"math\">V_{\\tau_i} = 0</span>.</p>\n<p>Since at most <span class=\"math\">f</span> nodes are Byzantine, and each triad requires <span class=\"math\">\\geq 2</span> matching votes to commit, a Byzantine node can only stall consensus if paired with <span class=\"math\">\\geq 1</span> other Byzantine node in a triad. With <span class=\"math\">f &lt; n/3</span>, Byzantine nodes can comprise at most <span class=\"math\">1</span> node in each triad. Thus every honest supermajority triad will reach agreement, and every mixed triad (<span class=\"math\">1</span> Byzantine node) will either agree with the honest nodes or deadlock. Any deadlocked triads will be eventually resolved by honest majority triads in subsequent rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Applications</strong> Triadic consensus can be applied in sharded blockchain architectures to enable fast and secure consensus within each shard. It is particularly well-suited for high-throughput applications that require low latency and scalability, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. By organizing validators into a fractal topology and propagating votes efficiently, triadic consensus allows shards to process transactions in parallel while maintaining global consistency.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> The triadic consensus mechanism introduced represents a significant advancement in consensus protocols for sharded blockchains. By achieving <span class=\"math\">O(n \\log_3 n)</span> message complexity and <span class=\"math\">O(\\log_3 n)</span> time complexity, it enables fast and resilient agreement on transaction ordering and state updates within shards. This scalable and efficient consensus mechanism has the potential to unlock new possibilities for high-performance decentralized applications and pave the way for more robust and scalable blockchain networks.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/triadic-consensus-a-fast-and-resilient-consensus-mechanism-for-sharded-blockchains/19504\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/triadic-consensus-a-fast-and-resilient-consensus-mechanism-for-sharded-blockchains/19504","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 21:05:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19504"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/triadic-consensus-a-fast-and-resilient-consensus-mechanism-for-sharded-blockchains/19504.rss","#text":"Triadic Consensus: A Fast and Resilient Consensus Mechanism for Sharded Blockchains"},"filter":false},{"title":"Client-Side Ordinal Transaction Ordering (COTO)","dc:creator":"cryptskii","category":"Sharding","description":"<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> ProofChain introduces a novel transaction ordering mechanism called Client-Side Ordinal Transaction Ordering (COTO) that achieves deterministic and uniform ordering of transactions across shards without requiring shard synchronization, enhancing the scalability of the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong> Existing blockchain systems face scalability challenges due to limitations in their transaction ordering approaches.

This architecture allows for horizontal scaling while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong> Existing blockchain systems face significant challenges in terms of scalability and privacy. Sharding is a promising approach to improve transaction throughput by parallelizing computation across multiple chains. However, cross-shard communication remains a bottleneck, as verifying transactions across shards typically requires expensive cross-shard proofs.</p>\n<p>Zero-knowledge proofs, particularly zk-SNARKs, offer a powerful tool for enhancing privacy by allowing users to prove knowledge of secret information without revealing it. Unfortunately, generating and verifying zk-SNARK proofs incurs high computational overhead, limiting their practicality for large-scale applications.</p>\n<p>Prior solutions have attempted to combine zk-SNARKs with sharding, but fail to fully address the scalability challenges. For example, Zexe uses zk-SNARKs in a sharded setting but requires storing a linear-size “state proof” on-chain. Coda achieves constant-size proofs using recursive composition, but lacks the horizontal scaling benefits of sharding.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal</strong> We introduce a novel construction that synergistically combines sharding with recursive zk-SNARK proofs for unparalleled scalability and privacy.</p>\n<p>At the core of this DLT is a hierarchy of zk-SNARK proofs that recursively attest to the validity of state transitions within and across shards. Each shard generates succinct proofs, called Zero-Knowledge Balance &amp; Inclusion State Proofs (ZkBISPs), certifying the correctness of their local state updates. These ZkBISPs are then aggregated by a designated coordinator into a global proof, termed a Zero-Knowledge Succinct Nested Global-state Proof (ZkSNGP).</p>\n<p>Crucially, the ZkSNGP is a constant-size proof that recursively verifies the validity of all shard-level ZkBISPs, thereby providing a succinct and efficient means to prove the integrity of the entire cross-shard state transition. Verifying the ZkSNGP requires only logarithmic time in the number of shards, enabling exponential savings compared to naively checking each shard’s proofs individually.</p>\n<p>Formally, we define the intra-shard state transition language <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathsf{ST}}^{(t,i)}</span> for each shard <span class=\"math\">i</span> at epoch <span class=\"math\">t</span> as the set of tuples <span class=\"math\">(x, w)</span> where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The statement <span class=\"math\">x = (\\mathsf{shardID}_i, \\mathsf{root}_i^{(t-1)}, \\mathsf{root}_i^{(t)}, B_i^{(t)})</span> includes the shard ID, starting and ending state roots, and final account balances.</li>\n<li>The witness <span class=\"math\">w = (\\mathsf{txs}_i^{(t)}, \\mathcal{T}_i^{(t-1)}, \\mathcal{T}_i^{(t)})</span> contains the list of transactions, along with the initial and final account state trees.</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">(x, w) \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathsf{ST}}^{(t,i)} \\Leftrightarrow \\mathsf{root}_i^{(t-1)} = H(\\mathcal{T}_i^{(t-1)}) \\wedge \\mathsf{root}_i^{(t)} = H(\\mathcal{T}_i^{(t)}) \\wedge \\text{transition}(\\mathcal{T}_i^{(t-1)}, \\mathsf{txs}_i^{(t)}) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}_i^{(t)}</span>, i.e, the roots match the account trees and the final tree results from applying valid transactions to the initial tree.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Similarly, we define the cross-shard state transition language <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathsf{CST}}^{(t)}</span> for epoch <span class=\"math\">t</span> as the set of tuples <span class=\"math\">(x, w)</span> where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The statement <span class=\"math\">x = (\\mathsf{root}_G^{(t-1)}, \\mathsf{root}_G^{(t)})</span> consists of the starting and ending global state roots.</li>\n<li>The witness <span class=\"math\">w = \\left(\\left\\{\\left(\\mathsf{shardID}_i, \\pi_{\\mathsf{ST},i}^{(t)}, \\mathsf{root}_i^{(t-1)},\\mathsf{root}_i^{(t)}, B_i^{(t)}\\right)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{\\ell},\\mathcal{T}_G^{(t-1)},\\mathcal{T}_G^{(t)}\\right)</span> includes the shard IDs, ZkBISPs, local roots and balances, and global account trees.</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">(x, w) \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathsf{CST}}^{(t)} \\Leftrightarrow \\forall i: \\mathsf{Verify}_{\\mathsf{ST}}(\\mathsf{vk}_{\\mathsf{ST}}, x_i, \\pi_{\\mathsf{ST},i}^{(t)}) \\wedge \\mathsf{root}_G^{(t-1)} = H(\\mathcal{T}_G^{(t-1)}) \\wedge \\mathsf{root}_G^{(t)} = H(\\mathcal{T}_G^{(t)}) \\wedge \\text{merge}(\\mathcal{T}_G^{(t-1)}, \\{\\mathsf{root}_i^{(t)}, B_i^{(t)}\\}_{i=1}^{\\ell}) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}_G^{(t)}</span>, i.e., the ZkBISPs verify w.r.t. their shards, the Merkle roots match, and the final global tree is the result of correctly merging the shards’ final local trees and balances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A shard’s ZkBISP for epoch <span class=\"math\">t</span> is generated as <span class=\"math\">\\pi_{\\mathsf{ST},i}^{(t)} \\leftarrow \\mathsf{Prove}_{\\mathsf{ST}}(\\mathsf{pk}_{\\mathsf{ST}}, x_i, w_i)</span> for <span class=\"math\">(x_i, w_i) \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathsf{ST}}^{(t,i)}</span>, where <span class=\"math\">\\mathsf{pk}_{\\mathsf{ST}}</span> is the proving key for the corresponding zk-SNARK scheme. The coordinator’s ZkSNGP is computed analogously as <span class=\"math\">\\pi_{\\mathsf{CST}}^{(t)} \\leftarrow \\mathsf{Prove}_{\\mathsf{CST}}(\\mathsf{pk}_{\\mathsf{CST}}, x, w)</span> for <span class=\"math\">(x, w) \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathsf{CST}}^{(t)}</span></p>\n<p>The coordinator, randomly selected in each epoch, collects these ZkBISPs along with the shards’ final state roots <span class=\"math\">\\mathsf{root}_i^{(t)}</span> and account balances <span class=\"math\">B_i^{(t)}</span>. It then generates the ZkSNGP <span class=\"math\">\\pi_{\\mathsf{CST}}^{(t)}</span> (green proof) certifying the validity of the overall state transition, including the correct application of all shard-level updates to the global state.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages</strong> The network simultaneously achieves exceptional horizontal scalability and privacy without sacrificing security or decentralization.</p>\n<p>In terms of scalability, the concept supports an unprecedented number of shards and transactions per second while retaining a constant-size proof of the system’s entire state. Concretely, if there are <span class=\"math\">\\ell</span> shards each processing <span class=\"math\">N</span> transactions, the communication cost per epoch is only <span class=\"math\">O(\\ell)</span> for the coordinator to collect the ZkBISPs, and the ZkSNGP proof adds just <span class=\"math\">O(1)</span> to the blockchain size. Crucially, verifying the ZkSNGP requires <span class=\"math\">O(\\log \\ell)</span> time, an exponential speedup compared to naively verifying all <span class=\"math\">\\ell</span> shards.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose the network is instantiated with <span class=\"math\">\\ell = 2^{10}</span> shards, each processing <span class=\"math\">N = 2^{20}</span> transactions in 2-minute epochs. This configuration could support a peak throughput of roughly 1 billion transactions per epoch, or 500,000 transactions per second, with a ZkSNGP verification time of only <span class=\"math\">10\\log \\ell \\approx 100</span> ms on ordinary hardware. The recursive proof would contribute a mere 1 KB to the blockchain per epoch, maintaining years of history in a highly compact format.</p>\n<p>In terms of privacy, the ZkSNGPs inherit the zero-knowledge property of the underlying zk-SNARK scheme, revealing nothing about the shards’ local transactions beyond the final state roots and balances. An adversary that compromises the coordinator cannot glean any additional information, as the shards’ ZkBISPs are similarly zero-knowledge. Transactional privacy thus holds as long as at least one shard remains honest.</p>\n<p>Compared to prior sharded blockchain designs, the network is the first to achieve sublinear proof sizes and verification times by recursively composing zk-SNARKs. Relative to Zexe, the network attains a qualitative improvement in scalability by eliminating the linear-size “state proof” in favor of constant-size ZkSNGPs. Compared to Coda, the network offers strictly stronger performance due to its sharded architecture, while still leveraging Coda’s core technique of recursive proof composition.</p>\n<p><strong>Applications</strong> the network’s dual emphasis on scalability and privacy renders it a natural foundation for a variety of high-throughput, privacy-centric blockchain applications.</p>\n<p>On the payments front, the network could serve as a backend for a globally-scalable digital currency with strong confidentiality guarantees, concealing both transaction amounts and participants. The subtransactions within each shard could clear near-instantaneously, while cross-shard payments would incur a maximum delay of one epoch (e.g., 2 minutes) before the ZkSNGP confirms finality. This would support a substantially higher payment volume than existing solutions like Zcash without leaking metadata.</p>\n<p>More broadly, the network could function as a privacy-preserving platform for general smart contract execution. Shards would not only process token transfers but also arbitrary state transitions, with the ZkBISPs and ZkSNGP verifying the correctness of all contract logic and dependencies. This would enable complex applications such as private decentralized exchanges, automated market makers, and lending protocols to run at scale, without disclosing individual users’ balances or positions.</p>\n<p>The network’s sharded architecture could also be adapted to specific domains to meet their unique performance requirements. For instance, a decentralized adtech ecosystem that handles billions of micropayments per day could utilize more granular sharding (e.g., <span class=\"math\">\\ell = 2^{20}</span> shards), with each shard perhaps corresponding to a particular geographic region or publisher. A secure messaging app that routes payments alongside packets could likewise tune its cross-shard spanning tree structure based on network topology.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> the network introduces a powerful new paradigm for designing scalable and private blockchain protocols through recursive zk-SNARK proof composition. By strategically combining recursive proofs with sharding, the network enables a significant breakthrough in blockchain performance, supporting over a million transactions per second with sublinear proof sizes and verification times.</p>\n            <p><small>15 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/sharded-recursive-zk-snark-proofs/19480\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/sharded-recursive-zk-snark-proofs/19480","pubDate":"Mon, 06 May 2024 19:04:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19480"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/sharded-recursive-zk-snark-proofs/19480.rss","#text":"Sharded Recursive zk-SNARK Proofs"},"filter":false},{"title":"Coded ZKP/FHE, a decentralized, collaborative, robust ZKP/FHE System","dc:creator":"0x1cc","category":"zk-s[nt]arks","description":"<h2><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For a ZKP/FHE task, we can decompose it into several subtasks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We introduce redundancy into subtasks such that the original task’s result can be decoded from a subset of the subtask results, treating uncompleted subtasks as erasures.

Notably, the master node can reconstruct the product <span class=\"math\">AX</span> upon receiving any two products, thus obviating the need to await the slowest response. For instance, consider a scenario where the master node receives <span class=\"math\">A_1X</span> and <span class=\"math\">(A_1 + A_2)X</span>. Through subtracting <span class=\"math\">A_1X</span> from <span class=\"math\">(A_1 + A_2)X</span>, the master node can deduce <span class=\"math\">A_2X</span> and consequently reconstruct <span class=\"math\">AX</span>.</p>\n<p>We can further adopt an <span class=\"math\">(n,k)</span> MDS code in this matrix multiplication example for generalization.

In zkML, we can decompose the task into <span class=\"math\">n</span> subtasks, with the results and zkp of <span class=\"math\">k</span> subtasks, we can aggravate the zkp of these subtasks with the decoded process. In fheML, we can decompose the task into <span class=\"math\">n</span> subtasks, with the results of <span class=\"math\">k</span> subtasks, we can apply the fhe computation on the decoded process.</p>\n<p>The preceding discussion has focused on a particular use case, namely zkML/fheML.

For instance, the R1CS instance in ZKP involves numerous multi-scalar multiplications, which can seamlessly integrate with the coded design.

However, existing blockchain-based architectures face significant challenges in terms of scalability, efficiency, and adaptability, limiting their widespread adoption and practical utility.</p>\n<p>Biological neural networks, on the other hand, exhibit remarkable capabilities in processing vast amounts of complex, unstructured information with exceptional scalability, efficiency, and robustness. The human brain, consisting of approximately 86 billion neurons connected by 150 trillion synapses, can perform highly sophisticated cognitive tasks while consuming only around 20 watts of power [8].</p>\n<p>Inspired by the computational principles of biological neural networks, we propose a novel distributed ledger architecture that leverages key neurological mechanisms to address the limitations of traditional blockchain systems. By bridging the gap between biological and artificial information processing, this neurologically-inspired architecture aims to create a highly scalable, adaptive, and computationally powerful decentralized system for secure data storage and computation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2-background-and-related-work-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-2-background-and-related-work-4\"></a>2 Background and Related Work</h2>\n<p>The field of distributed ledger technologies has seen significant advancements in recent years, with the emergence of various blockchain platforms such as Bitcoin [20], Ethereum [25], and Hyperledger Fabric [1]. These systems have demonstrated the potential of decentralized, trustless networks for secure and transparent recording of transactions and execution of smart contracts.</p>\n<p>However, existing blockchain architectures suffer from several limitations. The Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism used in Bitcoin and Ethereum requires significant computational resources and energy consumption, leading to limited transaction throughput and scalability issues [24]. Alternative consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) have been proposed to address these challenges, but they still face trade-offs between security, decentralization, and efficiency [26].</p>\n<p>Recent advancements in neuromorphic computing and brain-inspired architectures have shown promising results in achieving highly efficient and scalable information processing. Neuromorphic chips such as IBM’s TrueNorth [18] and Intel’s Loihi [7] have demonstrated the ability to perform complex cognitive tasks with ultra-low power consumption and high parallelism. These architectures leverage key principles of biological neural networks, such as event-driven computation, distributed memory, and adaptive learning, to achieve remarkable efficiency and robustness.</p>\n<p>Several studies have explored the intersection of neuromorphic computing and blockchain technologies. Baza et al. [2] proposed a blockchain-based framework for secure and efficient data sharing in Internet of Things (IoT) networks using neuromorphic hardware. Calzavara et al. [6] developed a privacy-preserving smart contract execution platform using trusted execution environments and neural networks. However, these approaches focus on integrating neuromorphic components into existing blockchain architectures rather than fundamentally redesigning the distributed ledger system based on neurological principles.</p>\n<p>Our work takes a different approach by proposing a novel distributed ledger architecture that is intrinsically inspired by the computational mechanisms of biological neural networks. By leveraging the inherent scalability, adaptivity, and efficiency of neurological information processing, we aim to create a fundamentally new paradigm for decentralized systems that can overcome the limitations of traditional blockchain approaches.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-3-neuron-like-node-architecture-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-3-neuron-like-node-architecture-5\"></a>3 Neuron-like Node Architecture</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"h-31-node-dynamics-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-31-node-dynamics-6\"></a>3.1 Node Dynamics</h3>\n<p>The fundamental processing units in the proposed architecture are modeled after the functional properties of biological neurons. Each node <span class=\"math\">i</span> maintains an internal state vector <span class=\"math\">s_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^n</span> analogous to the membrane potential of a neuron, encoding its current activation level. The temporal evolution of a node’s state is governed by the dynamical system:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\frac{ds_i}{dt} = f\\left( \\sum_{j \\in N_i} w_{ij} s_j(t) \\right)</span></p>\n<p>The temporal evolution of a node’s state <span class=\"math\">s_i</span> is governed by this differential equation, where <span class=\"math\">N_i</span> denotes the set of nodes with incoming synaptic connections to node <span class=\"math\">i</span>, <span class=\"math\">w_{ij}</span> is the synaptic weight of the connection from node <span class=\"math\">j</span> to node <span class=\"math\">i</span>, and <span class=\"math\">f(\\cdot)</span> is a non-linear activation function applied element-wise to the weighted sum of inputs. This equation captures the dynamics of how each node’s state changes over time based on the input it receives from its neighbors.</p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">N_i</span> denotes the set of nodes with incoming synaptic connections to node <span class=\"math\">i</span>, <span class=\"math\">w_{ij}</span> is the synaptic weight of the connection from node <span class=\"math\">j</span> to node <span class=\"math\">i</span>, and <span class=\"math\">f(\\cdot)</span> is a non-linear activation function applied element-wise to the weighted sum of inputs. Suitable choices for the activation function include the logistic sigmoid <span class=\"math\">f(x) = (1 + \\exp(-x))^{-1}</span> or the rectified linear unit (ReLU) <span class=\"math\">f(x) = \\max(0, x)</span> commonly employed in artificial neural networks.</p>\n<p>When a node’s internal state crosses a firing threshold <span class=\"math\">\\theta_i</span>, it generates an output spike that is transmitted to its downstream neighbors. This thresholding mechanism can be expressed as:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\textrm{output}_i(t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n1, &amp; \\text{if } s_i(t) \\geq \\theta_i \\\\\n0, &amp; \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}</span></p>\n<p>The firing threshold <span class=\"math\">\\theta_i</span> is dynamically modulated as a function of the node’s recent firing history to implement adaptive homeostatic regulation of its excitability and maintain a target average firing rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Definition 1 (Node State Update).</strong> The internal state of a node <span class=\"math\">i</span> is updated according to the following discrete-time equation:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">s_i[t+1] = f\\left( \\sum_{j \\in N_i} w_{ij} s_j[t] \\right)</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">t</span> denotes the discrete time step.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1 (Sigmoid Activation).</strong> For a node with a logistic sigmoid activation function, the state update equation becomes:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">s_i[t+1] = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{j \\in N_i} w_{ij} s_j[t]\\right)}</span></p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-32-synaptic-plasticity-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-32-synaptic-plasticity-7\"></a>3.2 Synaptic Plasticity</h3>\n<p>Synaptic plasticity refers to the dynamic modification of synaptic strengths based on the correlated activity patterns of pre- and post-synaptic nodes. A well-established synaptic learning rule is spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) [4], which updates the synaptic weight <span class=\"math\">w_{ij}</span> based on the relative timing of spikes between nodes <span class=\"math\">i</span> and <span class=\"math\">j</span>:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\frac{dw_{ij}}{dt} = \n\\begin{cases}\nA_+ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|\\Delta t|}{\\tau_+}\\right), &amp; \\text{if } \\Delta t &gt; 0 \\\\\n-A_- \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|\\Delta t|}{\\tau_-}\\right), &amp; \\text{if } \\Delta t &lt; 0\n\\end{cases}</span></p>\n<p>The synaptic weight <span class=\"math\">w_{ij}</span> between nodes <span class=\"math\">i</span> and <span class=\"math\">j</span> is updated according to this spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule. Here, <span class=\"math\">\\Delta t = t_j - t_i</span> represents the time difference between the spikes of nodes <span class=\"math\">i</span> and <span class=\"math\">j</span>. The parameters <span class=\"math\">\\tau_+</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\tau_-</span> set the time scales for potentiation and depression, respectively, while <span class=\"math\">A_+</span> and <span class=\"math\">A_-</span> control the maximum weight changes. This rule captures the idea that synaptic weights are strengthened when the pre-synaptic neuron fires before the post-synaptic neuron (causality), and weakened when the order is reversed (acausality).</p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">\\Delta t = t_j - t_i</span> is the time difference between spikes of nodes <span class=\"math\">i</span> and <span class=\"math\">j</span>, <span class=\"math\">\\tau_+</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\tau_-</span> set the time scales for potentiation and depression, and <span class=\"math\">A_+</span> and <span class=\"math\">A_-</span> control the maximum weight changes. This STDP rule implements a form of Hebbian learning, allowing the network to discover and amplify causal associations between neural activities. Over time, this leads to the self-organized emergence of meaningful connectivity patterns optimized for the particular data streams and computational tasks, without requiring centralized control or explicit programming.</p>\n<p><strong>Definition 2 (STDP Update).</strong> The synaptic weight <span class=\"math\">w_{ij}</span> between nodes <span class=\"math\">i</span> and <span class=\"math\">j</span> is updated according to the STDP rule:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">w_{ij} \\leftarrow w_{ij} + \\eta \\Delta w_{ij}</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">\\eta</span> is the learning rate and <span class=\"math\">\\Delta w_{ij}</span> is the weight change computed using Equation (??).</p>\n<p><strong>Theorem 1 (Convergence of STDP).</strong> Under suitable conditions on the learning rate <span class=\"math\">\\eta</span> and the STDP time constants <span class=\"math\">\\tau_+</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\tau_-</span>, the synaptic weights converge to a stable equilibrium that maximizes the mutual information between the pre- and post-synaptic activities.</p>\n<p><em>Proof.</em> The proof follows from the analysis of the STDP learning rule as a stochastic gradient descent algorithm on the mutual information objective. See [3] for a detailed derivation.</p>\n<p>In addition to modifying synaptic weights, the network topology itself can adapt by periodically adding or pruning connections based on their long-term statistics and utility for the network’s overall information processing. This dynamic rewiring enables the system to flexibly reconfigure its architecture in response to changing demands and environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm 1 Adaptive Network Rewiring</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">1: procedure RewireNetwork(G, λ, γ)\n2:   Initialize connectivity graph G = (V, E)\n3:   for each time step t do\n4:     for each node i ∈ V do\n5:       Sample candidate connections (i, j) with probability exp(c_ij/λ)\n6:       Prune connections (i, j) with probability exp(-|w_ij|/γ)\n7:     end for\n8:     Update connectivity graph G with new connections  \n9:   end for\n10: end procedure\n</code></pre>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\lambda</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\gamma</span> are temperature parameters controlling the exploration-exploitation trade-off in adding and pruning connections, respectively.

Each data item <span class=\"math\">x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d</span> is assigned a random binary key <span class=\"math\">k \\in \\{0,1\\}^m</span> that serves as a unique identifier. The data item is then encoded by activating the internal state vectors <span class=\"math\">s_i</span> of the nodes whose feature vectors <span class=\"math\">f_i \\in \\{0,1\\}^m</span> have the highest dot product similarity with the key:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">S_x = \\{i \\in V \\mid k \\cdot f_i \\text{ is among the top } K \\text{ values}\\}</span></p>\n<p>Here, <span class=\"math\">V</span> denotes the set of all nodes in the network, and <span class=\"math\">K</span> is a sparsity parameter controlling the number of nodes selected for encoding each data item. The feature vectors <span class=\"math\">f_i</span> are fixed random projections that map the high-dimensional keys to a lower-dimensional space, effectively implementing a form of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) [13].</p>\n<p>To retrieve a data item given its key <span class=\"math\">k'</span>, the nodes with the highest feature similarity to the query key are activated, and the network dynamics are allowed to evolve according to Equation (??). The internal states of the activated nodes will converge to an attractor pattern representing the stored memory associated with the key. The retrieved data item can then be reconstructed from the stable node activations.</p>\n<p>This distributed associative memory scheme provides several advantages in terms of scalability, robustness, and efficiency:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalability: The memory capacity of the network grows linearly with the number of nodes, allowing for massively parallel storage and retrieval of large-scale datasets.</li>\n<li>Robustness: The distributed encoding ensures graceful degradation in the presence of node failures or data corruptions. Partial or noisy keys can still retrieve the correct data item through the network’s pattern completion capabilities.</li>\n<li>Efficiency: The content-addressable nature of the memory enables fast and efficient retrieval of data items without requiring explicit search or indexing structures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Definition 3 (Associative Memory Encoding).</strong> A data item <span class=\"math\">x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d</span> with key <span class=\"math\">k \\in \\{0,1\\}^m</span> is encoded in the network by activating the internal states of the nodes in the set <span class=\"math\">S_x</span> defined by:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">S_x = \\{i \\in V \\mid k \\cdot f_i \\geq \\theta\\}</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">\\theta</span> is a similarity threshold.</p>\n<p><strong>Theorem 2 (Memory Capacity).</strong> For a network with <span class=\"math\">N</span> nodes and an average node degree <span class=\"math\">\\bar{d}</span>, the memory capacity <span class=\"math\">C</span> scales as:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">C = O\\left(\\frac{N}{\\bar{d}\\log N}\\right)</span></p>\n<p>assuming a sparse connectivity pattern and independent random feature vectors.</p>\n<p><em>Proof.</em> The proof follows from analyzing the associative memory as a random graph with a constraint on the average degree. The memory capacity is derived using information-theoretic arguments based on the entropy of the stored patterns. See [21] for a detailed analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm 2 Associative Memory Retrieval</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\"> 1: procedure RetrieveData(k')\n 2:   Initialize query key k'\n 3:   Compute similarity scores k' · f_i for all nodes i ∈ V\n 4:   Select top K nodes with highest similarity scores as the activated set S_k'\n 5:   for each node i ∈ S_k' do\n 6:     Set initial state s_i[0] based on similarity score\n 7:   end for\n 8:   for t = 1 to T do\n 9:     for each node i ∈ S_k' do\n10:       Update state s_i[t] according to Equation (??)\n11:     end for\n12:   end for\n13:   Reconstruct retrieved data item xˆ from stable node states\n14:   return xˆ \n15: end procedure\n</code></pre>\n<p>The retrieval algorithm first computes the similarity scores between the query key <span class=\"math\">k'</span> and the feature vectors <span class=\"math\">f_i</span> of all nodes in the network. The top <span class=\"math\">K</span> nodes with the highest similarity scores are selected as the activated set <span class=\"math\">S_{k'}</span>. The initial states of these nodes are set based on their respective similarity scores, providing a starting point for the network dynamics.</p>\n<p>The algorithm then iteratively updates the states of the activated nodes for a fixed number of time steps <span class=\"math\">T</span> according to the node dynamics equation (??). During this process, the network settles into a stable attractor state that represents the retrieved memory associated with the query key.</p>\n<p>Finally, the retrieved data item <span class=\"math\">\\hat{x}</span> is reconstructed from the stable node states. This reconstruction can be performed using various methods, such as taking the average or weighted sum of the node states, depending on the specific encoding scheme used.</p>\n<p>The properties of the associative memory retrieval process can be formally analyzed using dynamical systems theory and attractor network models [10]. The convergence and stability of the retrieval dynamics depend on factors such as the network connectivity, the choice of activation function, and the noise level in the query key.</p>\n<p><strong>Theorem 3 (Retrieval Convergence).</strong> Under suitable conditions on the network connectivity and the activation function, the associative memory retrieval algorithm converges to a stable attractor state within a finite number of iterations.</p>\n<p><em>Proof.</em> The proof relies on analyzing the retrieval dynamics as a discrete-time dynamical system and showing that the energy function of the network decreases monotonically over time. The convergence to a stable attractor state follows from the existence of a Lyapunov function for the system. See [5] for a detailed analysis.</p>\n<p>The distributed associative memory scheme provides a powerful and efficient mechanism for storing and retrieving large-scale datasets in a decentralized manner. The content-addressable nature of the memory, combined with the robustness and scalability of the distributed encoding, enables fast and reliable access to stored information even in the presence of node failures or partial keyinformation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-5-decentralized-consensus-protocol-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-5-decentralized-consensus-protocol-9\"></a>5 Decentralized Consensus Protocol</h2>\n<p>To achieve global consistency and coordination in a fully decentralized setting, the proposed architecture employs a consensus mechanism inspired by the synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators in biological neural networks [19]. Each node maintains an internal clock variable <span class=\"math\">\\phi_i \\in [0, 2\\pi)</span> that evolves autonomously according to the phase response curve (PRC) model:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\frac{d\\phi_i}{dt} = \\omega_i + \\sum_{j \\in N_i} K(\\phi_j - \\phi_i)</span></p>\n<p>Here, <span class=\"math\">\\omega_i</span> is the natural frequency of the oscillator, <span class=\"math\">N_i</span> denotes the set of neighboring nodes connected to node <span class=\"math\">i</span>, and <span class=\"math\">K(\\cdot)</span> is the phase response function that determines how the phase of node <span class=\"math\">i</span> is adjusted based on the relative phases of its neighbors.</p>\n<p>When a node’s internal clock reaches a threshold value <span class=\"math\">\\phi^*_i \\in (0, 2\\pi)</span>, typically close to the end of the oscillation cycle, it emits a pulse that is transmitted to its neighbors. Upon receiving a pulse, each neighboring node <span class=\"math\">j</span> updates its own phase according to the PRC:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\phi_j(t^+) = \\phi_j(t^-) + K(\\phi_j(t^-))</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">t^-</span> and <span class=\"math\">t^+</span> denote the times immediately before and after the pulse reception, respectively. The PRC is designed to promote synchronization among the oscillators by pulling the phases of the lagging nodes forward and slowing down the advancing nodes. A common choice for the PRC is the sinusoidal function <span class=\"math\">K(\\phi) = \\varepsilon \\sin(\\phi)</span>, where <span class=\"math\">\\varepsilon</span> is a coupling strength parameter.</p>\n<p>Under suitable conditions on the coupling strength and the natural frequencies, the pulse-coupled oscillator network will self-organize and achieve global synchronization, with all the nodes firing in unison [23]. This emergent consensus enables the decentralized coordination and agreement among the nodes without requiring explicit global communication or centralized control.</p>\n<p><strong>Definition 4 (Pulse-Coupled Oscillator Network).</strong> A pulse-coupled oscillator network is a dynamical system consisting of <span class=\"math\">N</span> oscillators, each characterized by a phase variable <span class=\"math\">\\phi_i \\in [0, 2\\pi)</span> and a natural frequency <span class=\"math\">\\omega_i</span>.

The condition on the coupling strength ensures that the synchronized state is stable, while the assumption on the natural frequencies guarantees that the oscillators can be pulled into synchronization.

At the beginning of each round, the nodes update their phases based on the oscillator dynamics and check if their phases have reached the firing threshold. If a node’s phase reaches the threshold, it emits a pulse to its neighbors.</p>\n<p>Upon receiving pulses from neighbors, nodes update their phases according to the phase response function. This process continues until the network achieves global synchronization, indicated by all the nodes firing in unison.</p>\n<p>Once synchronization is achieved, the nodes perform the consensus actions associated with the specific firing events, such as validating transactions or committing checkpoints. The synchronized firing ensures that all the nodes agree on the timing and order of these actions, maintaining consistency across the network.</p>\n<p>The pulse-coupled oscillator synchronization mechanism offers several advantages over traditional consensus algorithms, such as Byzantine fault tolerance [15] or Proof-of-Work [20]:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalability: The consensus protocol scales efficiently with the size of the network, as the synchronization is achieved through local interactions among neighboring nodes, without requiring global communication or coordination.</li>\n<li>Robustness: The decentralized nature of the synchronization process makes it resilient to node failures and network disruptions.

The self-organized synchronization process allows the network to coordinate and maintain consistent state in a fully decentralized manner, enabling secure and efficient operation of the distributed ledger.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-6-decentralized-consensus-protocol-with-token-transactions-and-verifications-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-6-decentralized-consensus-protocol-with-token-transactions-and-verifications-10\"></a>6 Decentralized Consensus Protocol with Token Transactions and Verifications</h2>\n<p>The proposed neurologically-inspired distributed ledger architecture employs a decentralized consensus protocol based on the synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators to achieve global consistency and coordination among nodes. This protocol can be extended to facilitate token transactions and verifications, ensuring the integrity and security of the ledger state.</p>\n<p>Each node <span class=\"math\">i</span> in the network maintains an internal clock variable <span class=\"math\">\\phi_i \\in [0, 2\\pi)</span> that evolves autonomously according to the phase response curve (PRC) model:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\frac{d\\phi_i}{dt} = \\omega_i + \\sum_{j \\in N_i} K(\\phi_j - \\phi_i)</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">\\omega_i</span> is the natural frequency of the oscillator, <span class=\"math\">N_i</span> denotes the set of neighboring nodes connected to node <span class=\"math\">i</span>, and <span class=\"math\">K(\\cdot)</span> is the phase response function that determines the phase adjustment based on the relative phases of the neighbors.</p>\n<p>When a node’s internal clock reaches a threshold value <span class=\"math\">\\phi^*_i \\in (0, 2\\pi)</span>, typically close to the end of the oscillation cycle, it emits a pulse that is transmitted to its neighbors. Upon receiving a pulse, each neighboring node <span class=\"math\">j</span> updates its own phase according to the PRC:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\phi_j(t^+) = \\phi_j(t^-) + K(\\phi_j(t^-))</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">t^-</span> and <span class=\"math\">t^+</span> denote the times immediately before and after the pulse reception, respectively.</p>\n<p>To incorporate token transactions and verifications into the consensus protocol, we associate specific firing events with different stages of the transaction processing pipeline. For instance, when a node’s internal clock reaches a designated phase <span class=\"math\">\\phi^{tx}_i \\in (0, \\phi^*_i)</span>, it initiates a token transaction by broadcasting a transaction proposal to its neighbors. The transaction proposal includes the relevant details, such as the sender, recipient, token amount, and a unique transaction identifier.</p>\n<p>Upon receiving a transaction proposal, each node verifies the validity of the transaction by checking the sender’s account balance, the authenticity of the digital signature, and the absence of double-spending attempts. If the transaction is deemed valid, the node incorporates it into its local transaction pool and emits a pulse to signal its approval.</p>\n<p>As the nodes continue to update their phases and emit pulses, the transaction proposals propagate through the network. When a node’s internal clock reaches the firing threshold <span class=\"math\">\\phi^*_i</span>, it collects all the approved transaction proposals received from its neighbors and bundles them into a candidate block. The node then broadcasts the candidate block to the network for further validation.</p>\n<p>During the validation phase, nodes verify the integrity and consistency of the candidate blocks by checking for conflicting transactions, double-spending attempts, and adherence to the consensus rules. If a candidate block receives a sufficient number of approval pulses from the network, it is considered validated and ready for commitment.</p>\n<p>Finally, when the nodes’ internal clocks synchronize and reach a designated commitment phase <span class=\"math\">\\phi^{commit}_i \\in (\\phi^*_i, 2\\pi)</span>, they collectively commit the validated blocks to their local ledgers, updating the token balances and transaction history accordingly. The synchronized firing event ensures that all nodes agree on the order and contents of the committed blocks, maintaining a consistent and tamper-proof ledger state.</p>\n<p>To prevent malicious behavior and ensure the security of the consensus protocol, nodes are incentivized to participate honestly through a combination of token rewards and penalties. Nodes that contribute to the successful validation and commitment of blocks are rewarded with newly minted tokens, while nodes that engage in malicious activities, such as proposing invalid transactions or propagating conflicting information, are penalized by having their token stakes slashed or their reputation scores reduced.</p>\n<p>The pulse-coupled oscillator synchronization mechanism provides a robust and scalable foundation for achieving decentralized consensus with token transactions and verifications. The self-organizing nature of the synchronization process allows the network to reach agreement on the order and validity of transactions without relying on a centralized authority or complex message passing protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm 4 Decentralized Consensus Protocol with Token Transactions and Verifications</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">1: procedure RunConsensusWithTransactions\n2:   Initialize oscillator phases ϕ_i and frequencies ω_i for all nodes i ∈ V\n3:   while not synchronized do\n4:     for each node i ∈ V do\n5:       Update phase ϕ_i according to the oscillator dynamics\n6:       if ϕ_i reaches the transaction proposal phase ϕ^{tx}_i then\n7:         Broadcast transaction proposal to neighbors j ∈ N_i\n8:       end if\n9:       if received transaction proposal from neighbor j then\n10:        Verify transaction validity\n11:        if transaction is valid then\n12:          Add transaction to local pool and emit approval pulse\n13:        end if\n14:      end if\n15:      if ϕ_i reaches the firing threshold ϕ^*_i then\n16:        Bundle approved transactions into a candidate block\n17:        Broadcast candidate block to neighbors j ∈ N_i\n18:      end if\n19:      if received candidate block from neighbor j then\n20:        Validate block and emit approval pulse if valid\n21:      end if\n22:      if ϕ_i reaches the commitment phase ϕ^{commit}_i then\n23:        Commit validated blocks to local ledger\n24:      end if\n25:    end for\n26:  end while\n27: end procedure\n</code></pre>\n<p>The extended consensus protocol incorporates token transactions and verifications by associating specific firing events with different stages of the transaction processing pipeline.

These capabilities make the architecture a versatile framework for distributed information processing and complex problem-solving.</p>\n<p>One key computational primitive is the ability to perform inference and belief revision in probabilistic graphical models. The network can be viewed as a Markov random field (MRF) [14], where each node represents a random variable and the synaptic connections encode the probabilistic dependencies among variables. Given a set of observed evidence, the inference task involves estimating the posterior probabilities of the hidden variables.</p>\n<p>In the proposed architecture, the posterior probabilities can be approximated by the stable fixed points of the network dynamics. The internal state <span class=\"math\">s_i</span> of each node <span class=\"math\">i</span> represents the marginal probability of the corresponding variable, and the synaptic weights <span class=\"math\">w_{ij}</span> encode the log-likelihood ratios of the pairwise dependencies:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">w_{ij} \\propto \\log \\frac{P(x_i=1 \\mid x_j=1)}{P(x_i=1 \\mid x_j=0)}</span></p>\n<p>The inference process in the proposed architecture can be formulated as an energy minimization problem, where the goal is to find the configuration of binary variables <span class=\"math\">x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_N)</span> that minimizes this energy function. The first term represents the unary potentials, with <span class=\"math\">\\theta_i</span> denoting the prior log-odds of variable <span class=\"math\">i</span> being active. The second term captures the pairwise interactions between variables, with <span class=\"math\">w_{ij}</span> representing the synaptic weight between nodes <span class=\"math\">i</span> and <span class=\"math\">j</span>. Minimizing this energy function corresponds to finding the most probable configuration of the variables given the observed evidence and the learned synaptic weights.</p>\n<p>The inference process can be implemented as a minimization of the following energy function:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">E(x) = -\\sum_i \\theta_i x_i - \\sum_{i \\neq j} w_{ij} x_i x_j</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_N)</span> is a configuration of the binary variables, <span class=\"math\">\\theta_i</span> represents the prior log-odds of variable <span class=\"math\">i</span>, and <span class=\"math\">w_{ij}</span> are the pairwise interaction weights.</p>\n<p>The network dynamics, governed by Equation (??), can be interpreted as performing a stochastic gradient descent on the energy function, with the stable fixed points corresponding to the local minima of the energy landscape. This allows the network to find the most probable configurations of the variables given the observed evidence, without explicitly computing the partition function or normalizing the probabilities.</p>\n<p>The sparse connectivity and event-driven nature of the network enable efficient and scalable inference, as the computations are performed locally and asynchronously based on the activity of the nodes. The recurrent connections and feedback loops in the network facilitate rapid information propagation and integration, allowing for fast convergence to the posterior estimates.</p>\n<p><strong>Theorem 5 (Inference Convergence).</strong> For a network with symmetric weights (<span class=\"math\">w_{ij} = w_{ji}</span>) and a concave activation function, the inference dynamics converge to a stable fixed point that corresponds to a local minimum of the energy function.</p>\n<p><em>Proof.</em> The proof relies on showing that the energy function decreases monotonically over time under the network dynamics. The symmetry of the weights and the concavity of the activation function ensure that the fixed points of the dynamics coincide with the local minima of the energy function. The detailed proof can be found in [11].</p>\n<p>Another important computational capability of the architecture is the ability to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) [22]. A CSP is defined by a set of variables <span class=\"math\">X = \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_N\\}</span>, eachassociated with a domain <span class=\"math\">D_i</span> of possible values, and a set of constraints <span class=\"math\">C = \\{C_1, \\ldots, C_M\\}</span> that specify the allowed combinations of variable assignments.</p>\n<p>To map a CSP onto the network, each variable <span class=\"math\">x_i</span> is represented by a group of nodes, with each node corresponding to a possible value assignment. The synaptic weights are set to encode the constraints, such that incompatible assignments result in high energy configurations. The network dynamics then search for the lowest energy state that satisfies all the constraints.</p>\n<p>The constrained optimization problem can be formulated as minimizing the following energy function:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">E(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{k \\in D_i} x_{ik} + \\sum_{C \\in C} \\sum_{x_C \\notin S_C} \\prod_{i \\in V_C} x_{ix_C(i)}</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">x_{ik} \\in \\{0,1\\}</span> indicates whether variable <span class=\"math\">i</span> is assigned value <span class=\"math\">k</span>, <span class=\"math\">S_C</span> denotes the set of allowed assignments for constraint <span class=\"math\">C</span>, <span class=\"math\">V_C</span> is the subset of variables involved in constraint <span class=\"math\">C</span>, and <span class=\"math\">x_C</span> represents the partial assignment of these variables.</p>\n<p>The network dynamics minimize the energy function by iteratively updating the node states based on the local constraints and the activities of the neighboring nodes. The sparse connectivity and asynchronous updates enable efficient exploration of the solution space, while the recurrent dynamics and feedback mechanisms facilitate rapid propagation of constraint violations and conflict resolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Theorem 6 (CSP Convergence).</strong> For a network encoding a satisfiable CSP with binary constraints, the network dynamics converge to a stable state representing a valid solution, provided that the weights are set appropriately and the activation function is chosen to be a step function.</p>\n<p><em>Proof.</em> The proof involves showing that the network energy decreases monotonically under the dynamics and that any valid solution corresponds to a global minimum of the energy function. The convergence to a valid solution follows from the fact that the energy cannot decrease indefinitely. The detailed proof can be found in [12].</p>\n<p>The computational capabilities of the neurologically-inspired architecture extend beyond inference and constraint satisfaction. The rich dynamics and adaptive properties of the network enable it to perform various tasks such as pattern recognition, associative memory, and optimization. The specific computations that can be carried out depend on the particular choice of node dynamics, synaptic plasticity rules, and network topology.</p>\n<p>For instance, by incorporating temporal integration and adaptive thresholds into the node dynamics, the network can be trained to recognize and generate complex spatiotemporal patterns [17]. This enables applications in sequence learning, time series prediction, and anomaly detection. The sparse encoding and distributed representation of patterns in the network provide robustness to noise and fault tolerance.</p>\n<p>Similarly, by defining appropriate objective functions and learning rules, the network can be optimized for tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction [9]. The unsupervised learning capabilities of the network, based on local Hebbian plasticity and competitive dynamics, allow it to discover meaningful structures and representations in the input data without explicit supervision.</p>\n<p>The neuromorphic nature of the architecture offers several advantages over traditional approaches to distributed computing and information processing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalability: The sparse connectivity and local update rules enable the network to scale gracefully to large sizes without incurring prohibitive communication or computational overhead. The computations are performed in a highly parallel and distributed manner, leveraging the massive parallelism of neuromorphic substrates.</li>\n<li>Adaptability: The adaptive learning and self-organization capabilities of the network allow it to continuously tune its parameters and structure in response to changing environments or task demands. This adaptability enables the network to handle non-stationary data distributions and evolving problem domains.</li>\n<li>Efficiency: The event-driven and asynchronous nature of the computations, based on sparse spiking activity and adaptive update frequencies, can lead to significant energy savings compared to synchronous and clock-driven approaches. The localized processing and communication also reduce the energy costs associated with data movement and global synchronization.</li>\n<li>Robustness: The distributed encoding and storage of information, combined with the fault-tolerant dynamics and redundant connectivity, make the network resilient to node failures and data corruption. The network can gracefully degrade and maintain its functionality even in the presence of localized damage or adversarial attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example 2 (Distributed Pattern Recognition).</strong> Consider a network tasked with recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset [16]. Each input image is encoded as a binary vector <span class=\"math\">x \\in \\{0,1\\}^d</span>, where <span class=\"math\">d</span> is the number of pixels. The network consists of <span class=\"math\">N</span> nodes, each representing a learned prototype or a feature detector. The synaptic weights are trained using a competitive learning rule, such as the winner-takes-all (WTA) Hebbian rule:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\Delta w_{ij} = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\eta(x_j - w_{ij}) &amp; \\text{if } i = \\arg\\max_k w_k \\cdot x \\\\\n0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">\\eta</span> is the learning rate and <span class=\"math\">w_i</span> is the weight vector of node <span class=\"math\">i</span>.</p>\n<p>During inference, an input image is presented to the network, and the nodes compete to match their prototypes with the input pattern. The node with the highest activation (i.e., the closest match) is selected as the winner, and its associated class label is assigned to the input. The sparse encoding and WTA dynamics enable fast and efficient recognition, while the distributed representation provides robustness to noise and occlusions.</p>\n<p>The example above showcases how the neurologically-inspired architecture can be applied to solve real-world problems in a distributed and efficient manner. The competitive learning and winner-takes-all dynamics enable the network to learn discriminative features and prototypes from the input data, while the sparse encoding and event-driven processing allow for fast and energy-efficient inference.</p>\n<p>The computational capabilities of the proposed architecture are not limited to the examples discussed here but encompass a wide range of information processing tasks across various domains. The versatility and adaptability of the neuromorphic approach make it a promising framework for developing intelligent and scalable distributed systems that can handle the complexity and dynamics of real-world data and applications.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-8-failure-modes-attack-vectors-and-defense-mechanisms-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-8-failure-modes-attack-vectors-and-defense-mechanisms-12\"></a>8 Failure Modes, Attack Vectors, and Defense Mechanisms</h2>\n<p>To ensure the practical viability and security of the proposed neurologically-inspired distributed ledger architecture, it is crucial to consider potential failure modes, attack vectors, and corresponding defense mechanisms. This section explores some of the key challenges and strategies for maintaining the resilience and integrity of the system.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-81-failure-modes-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-81-failure-modes-13\"></a>8.1 Failure Modes</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"h-811-node-failures-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-811-node-failures-14\"></a>8.1.1 Node Failures</h4>\n<p>One potential failure mode is the malfunction or unavailability of individual nodes in the network. Given the distributed nature of the architecture, the system should be designed to tolerate a certain level of node failures without compromising the overall functionality and performance. This can be achieved through redundancy, fault-tolerant consensus protocols, and self-healing mechanisms that enable the network to detect and recover from node failures.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-812-network-partitioning-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-812-network-partitioning-15\"></a>8.1.2 Network Partitioning</h4>\n<p>Another failure mode is network partitioning, where the network is split into isolated subgroups due to communication disruptions or connectivity issues. This can lead to inconsistencies and divergence in the ledger state across different partitions. To mitigate this risk, the architecture should incorporate partition-tolerant consensus algorithms, such as the pulse-coupled oscillator synchronization, which can maintain consistency and eventual synchronization even in the presence of network partitions.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-813-consensus-failures-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-813-consensus-failures-16\"></a>8.1.3 Consensus Failures</h4>\n<p>Consensus failures can occur when the nodes in the network fail to reach agreement on the ledger state or the validity of transactions. This can happen due to malicious behavior, network delays, or other factors that disrupt the consensus process. To prevent consensus failures, the architecture should employ robust and fault-tolerant consensus mechanisms, such as Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols, which can tolerate a certain number of malicious or faulty nodes while still reaching consensus.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-82-attack-vectors-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-82-attack-vectors-17\"></a>8.2 Attack Vectors</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"h-821-sybil-attacks-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-821-sybil-attacks-18\"></a>8.2.1 Sybil Attacks</h4>\n<p>Sybil attacks involve an attacker creating multiple fake identities or nodes to gain disproportionate influence over the network. This can be used to manipulate the consensus process, censor transactions, or perform double-spending attacks. To defend against Sybil attacks, the architecture can employ identity verification mechanisms, such as proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS), which make it computationally expensive or economically infeasible for an attacker to create and maintain a large number of fake identities.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-822-eclipse-attacks-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-822-eclipse-attacks-19\"></a>8.2.2 Eclipse Attacks</h4>\n<p>Eclipse attacks aim to isolate a targeted node or a group of nodes from the rest of the network by controlling their peer connections. This allows the attacker to filter or manipulate the information received by the targeted nodes, potentially leading to consensus failures or double-spending attacks. Defense mechanisms against eclipse attacks include diverse peer selection strategies, regular reshuffling of peer connections, and multi-path data propagation to ensure that nodes receive information from multiple sources.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-823-51-attacks-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-823-51-attacks-20\"></a>8.2.3 51% Attacks</h4>\n<p>In a 51% attack, an attacker gains control over a majority of the network’s computing power or stake, enabling them to dictate the consensus process and perform malicious activities such as double-spending or transaction censorship. To mitigate the risk of 51% attacks, the architecture can employ a combination of consensus mechanisms, such as PoW and PoS, that make it economically costly for an attacker to acquire a majority stake. Additionally, implementing a multi-layered security approach, with different consensus algorithms operating at different scales and levels of the network, can further enhance the resilience against 51% attacks.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-83-defense-mechanisms-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-83-defense-mechanisms-21\"></a>8.3 Defense Mechanisms</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"h-831-cryptographic-primitives-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-831-cryptographic-primitives-22\"></a>8.3.1 Cryptographic Primitives</h4>\n<p>The architecture should leverage secure cryptographic primitives, such as hash functions, digital signatures, and encryption algorithms, to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of data and transactions. These primitives form the foundation of the security mechanisms employed in the distributed ledger, preventing unauthorized modifications, forged transactions, and privacy breaches.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-832-secure-consensus-protocols-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-832-secure-consensus-protocols-23\"></a>8.3.2 Secure Consensus Protocols</h4>\n<p>Employing secure and fault-tolerant consensus protocols is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the ledger state. The proposed pulse-coupled oscillator synchronization mechanism provides a decentralized and resilient approach to achieving consensus. However, it can be further enhanced with additional security measures, such as verifiable random functions (VRFs) for leader selection, threshold signatures for collective signing, and multi-party computation (MPC) for secure computation and privacy preservation.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-833-incentive-mechanisms-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-833-incentive-mechanisms-24\"></a>8.3.3 Incentive Mechanisms</h4>\n<p>Designing appropriate incentive mechanisms is essential to encourage honest participation and discourage malicious behavior in the network. This can include block rewards, transaction fees, and stake-based incentives that align the economic interests of the nodes with the overall security and performance of the system. Penalty mechanisms, such as slashing or reputation scores, can be implemented to punish and deter malicious actors.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-834-monitoring-and-detection-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-834-monitoring-and-detection-25\"></a>8.3.4 Monitoring and Detection</h4>\n<p>Implementing robust monitoring and detection systems is crucial for identifying and responding to potential failures, attacks, and anomalies in the network. This can involve distributed intrusion detection systems (DIDS), machine learning-based anomaly detection, and real-time network analysis tools. By continuously monitoring the network activity and employing advanced detection techniques, the architecture can proactively identify and mitigate threats before they cause significant damage.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-835-formal-verification-and-testing-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-835-formal-verification-and-testing-26\"></a>8.3.5 Formal Verification and Testing</h4>\n<p>Rigorous formal verification and testing methodologies should be applied to validate the correctness, security, and performance of the proposed architecture. Formal verification techniques, such as model checking and theorem proving, can be used to mathematically prove the properties and guarantees of the consensus protocols, smart contracts, and cryptographic primitives. Comprehensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests, should be conducted to ensure the robustness and reliability of the implementation.</p>\n<p>By carefully considering and addressing these potential failure modes, attack vectors, and defense mechanisms, the practical viability and security of the neurologically-inspired distributed ledger architecture can be significantly strengthened. The combination of fault-tolerant design, secure consensus protocols, cryptographic primitives, incentive mechanisms, monitoring and detection systems, and formal verification and testing approaches provides a multi-layered defense strategy to ensure the resilience and integrity of the system in the face of various challenges and threats.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-9-comparison-with-state-of-the-art-blockchain-platforms-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-9-comparison-with-state-of-the-art-blockchain-platforms-27\"></a>9 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Blockchain Platforms</h2>\n<p>To highlight the advantages of the proposed neurologically-inspired distributed ledger architecture, it is informative to compare its performance and features with existing state-of-the-art blockchain platforms. This section provides a comparative analysis of the proposed architecture with two prominent blockchain platforms: Solana and Holochain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-91-solana-28\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-91-solana-28\"></a>9.1 Solana</h3>\n<p>Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that aims to achieve scalability without compromising security or decentralization. It employs a novel consensus mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH) along with a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol to enable fast and efficient transaction processing.</p>\n<p>Key features of Solana include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High throughput: Solana claims to support up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), making it one of the fastest blockchain platforms currently available.</li>\n<li>Low latency: Solana achieves sub-second transaction confirmation times, providing near-instant finality for users.</li>\n<li>Scalability: Solana’s architecture is designed to scale horizontally across a large number of nodes, enabling it to handle increasing transaction loads as the network grows.</li>\n<li>Developer-friendly: Solana supports smart contracts and provides a suite of tools and frameworks for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, Solana’s approach to scalability relies heavily on its PoH consensus mechanism, which requires a high degree of time synchronization across nodes. This can potentially introduce vulnerabilities and challenges in maintaining long-term security and decentralization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-92-holochain-29\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-92-holochain-29\"></a>9.2 Holochain</h3>\n<p>Holochain is a framework for building decentralized applications that aims to provide scalability, adaptability, and agent-centric control. Unlike traditional blockchain platforms, Holochain does not rely on a global consensus mechanism. Instead, it allows each agent to maintain their own local chain and participate in distributed hash tables (DHTs) for data storage and retrieval.</p>\n<p>Key features of Holochain include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agent-centric: Holochain puts the control and ownership of data in the hands of individual agents, allowing them to manage their own identities, keys, and data.</li>\n<li>Scalability: Holochain’s architecture enables linear scalability, as the capacity of the network grows with the number of participating agents.</li>\n<li>Adaptability: Holochain allows for flexible and adaptable dApp designs, as each app can define its own governance rules, validation logic, and data structures.</li>\n<li>Efficiency: Holochain’s DHT-based storage and retrieval mechanism is more efficient compared to traditional blockchain’s global replication of data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, Holochain’s approach to decentralization and scalability comes with its own challenges. The lack of a global consensus mechanism can make it difficult to ensure consistency and integrity across the network, especially in the presence of malicious agents.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-93-comparison-table-30\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-93-comparison-table-30\"></a>9.3 Comparison Table</h3>\n<p>The following table summarizes the key features and performance metrics of the neurologically-inspired distributed ledger architecture in comparison to Solana and Holochain:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>Neurologically-Inspired</th>\n<th>Solana</th>\n<th>Holochain</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Consensus Mechanism</td>\n<td>Pulse-Coupled Oscillators</td>\n<td>PoH + PoS</td>\n<td>DHT-based</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scalability</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Linear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transaction Throughput (TPS)</td>\n<td>100,000+</td>\n<td>65,000</td>\n<td>Application-dependent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transaction Confirmation Time</td>\n<td>Sub-second</td>\n<td>Sub-second</td>\n<td>Near-instant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smart Contract Support</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes (Zomes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decentralization</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fault Tolerance</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adaptability</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Energy Efficiency</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>From the comparison table, it is evident that the neurologically-inspired distributed ledger architecture offers several advantages over Solana and Holochain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalability: The proposed architecture achieves high scalability through its neuromorphic design and pulse-coupled oscillator consensus mechanism, enabling efficient parallel processing and fast convergence.</li>\n<li>Transaction Throughput: With a potential transaction throughput of over 100,000 TPS, the neurologically-inspired architecture surpasses the performance of both Solana and Holochain.</li>\n<li>Decentralization: The architecture maintains a high degree of decentralization through its distributed ledger design and self-organizing consensus mechanism, ensuring resilience against centralized control.</li>\n<li>Fault Tolerance: The neuromorphic nature of the architecture, combined with robust consensus protocols and error correction mechanisms, provides a high level of fault tolerance against node failures and network disruptions.</li>\n<li>Adaptability: The architecture’s adaptability stems from its ability to dynamically reconfigure its synaptic connections and learning mechanisms based on the changing network conditions and computational requirements.</li>\n<li>Energy Efficiency: The event-driven and asynchronous processing model of the neurologically-inspired architecture enables energy-efficient computation, as resources are utilized only when necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While Solana and Holochain offer their own unique advantages, such as Solana’s high throughput and Holochain’s agent-centric approach, the neurologically-inspired distributed ledger architecture stands out in terms of its scalability, decentralization, fault tolerance, and adaptability.

The proposed architecture aims to address the scalability, efficiency, and robustness challenges faced by traditional blockchain-based systems by leveraging key neurological mechanisms such as adaptive synaptic plasticity, associative memory, and self-organized consensus.</p>\n<p>The neuromorphic design, based on densely interconnected nodes communicating through synaptic connections, enables efficient and parallel processing of large-scale data and complex computations. The distributed associative memory scheme provides a scalable and content-addressable storage mechanism for securely encoding and retrieving data items. The decentralized consensus protocol, based on the synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators, allows for fast and robust coordination among nodes without relying on global communication or centralized control.</p>\n<p>The computational capabilities of the architecture, arising from its rich dynamics and adaptive learning properties, make it a versatile framework for solving a wide range of information processing tasks, including inference, constraint satisfaction, pattern recognition, and optimization. The sparse encoding, event-driven processing, and fault-tolerant dynamics offer significant advantages in terms of scalability, efficiency, and robustness compared to traditional distributed computing approaches.</p>\n<p>The proposed architecture opens up new possibilities for building intelligent and sustainable distributed systems that can handle the growing complexity and scale of modern data and applications. The neurologically-inspired design principles can be applied across various domains, such as decentralized finance, supply chain management, Internet of Things, and edge computing, to develop secure, efficient, and adaptable solutions.</p>\n<p>However, realizing the full potential of this architecture requires further research and development efforts. Some key challenges and future directions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing efficient and scalable hardware implementations of neuromorphic substrates that can support the massive parallelism and connectivity required by the architecture.</li>\n<li>Designing novel learning algorithms and synaptic plasticity rules that can effectively capture the complex patterns and dependencies in real-world data while being computationally tractable and biologically plausible.</li>\n<li>Integrating advanced cryptographic primitives and privacy-preserving mechanisms into the architecture to ensure the security and confidentiality of data and computations.</li>\n<li>Conducting extensive empirical evaluations and benchmarking studies to assess the performance and robustness of the architecture on real-world datasets and application scenarios.</li>\n<li>Establishing formal theoretical foundations for analyzing the convergence, stability, and computational complexity of the proposed algorithms and protocols.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In conclusion, the neurologically-inspired distributed ledger architecture presents a promising approach to designing scalable, efficient, and robust decentralized systems that can tackle the challenges of the rapidly evolving data-driven world. By bridging the gap between biological and artificial information processing, this architecture paves the way for the development of a new generation of intelligent and sustainable distributed systems.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"references-32\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#references-32\"></a>References</h2>\n<p>[1] Androulaki, E., Barger, A., Bortnikov, V., Cachin, C., Christidis, K., De Caro, A., … &amp; Yellick, J.

The <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/lvr-quantifying-the-cost-of-providing-liquidity-to-automated-market-makers/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Loss Versus Rebalancing</a> (LVR) model stands out as a key tool for quantifying and modeling this arbitrage volume from a theoretical perspective. However, the research focusing on LVR  so far has mostly ignored transaction cost as a parameter in CEX/DEX arbitrage.</p>\n<p>This post aims to extend the LVR model to blockchains such as Ethereum’s mainnet, where CEX/DEX arbitrage transactions are expected to have a significant fixed cost term. It conceptualizes LVR as a quantity that is distributed between three primary actors: (1) the LPs of the AMM, (2) the searcher-builder-proposer (SBP) as an aggregate entity, and (3) ETH holders, due to the block basefee that is burned by each transaction. Some implications are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As the block time is decreased, an increased share of the nominal LVR is spent on transaction fees.</li>\n<li>Liquidity provider (LP) losses from arbitrage trades do not have the same magnitude as the profits of the arbitrager (searcher-builder-proposer), and as such, are not accurately predicted by a model that approximates them with the square root of the block time.</li>\n<li>Changes in Ethereum’s block time (either increase or decrease) are expected to affect the profitability of AMM LPs, but in many situations, other factors are more important, including the transaction fees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>A more explanatory and less formal version of this post is available on <a href=\"https://atise.medium.com/anatomy-of-cex-dex-arbitrage-481936c83831\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Medium</a>.</em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"background-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#background-1\"></a>Background</h1>\n<p>According to (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06046\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Millionis 2022</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14604\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Millionis 2023</a>) the expected instantaneous LVR is :</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\n\\overline{\\mathrm{LVR}} \\triangleq \\lim _{T \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\mathrm{E}\\left[\\mathrm{LVR}_T\\right]}{T}=\\frac{\\sigma^2 P}{2} \\times y^{* \\prime}(P) </span> .</p>\n<p>This quantity depends only on the volatility, price, and marginal liquidity of the pool. By integrating the expected instantaneous LVR over time, we can obtain the expected LVR for a time period <span class=\"math\">t</span>. Once again, it is not dependent on external factors such as swap fees, block times, transaction costs, etc., and can serve as a nominal baseline metric for any further investigations in this area.</p>\n<p>In (Millionis 2023) the authors push their LVR model further, and consider a situation when the AMM has a trading fee <span class=\"math\">γ ≥ 0</span>, and that arbitrageurs arrive to trade on the AMM at discrete times according to the arrivals of a Poisson process with rate <span class=\"math\">λ &gt; 0</span>. They extend the asymptotic analysis of arbitrage profit in a fast block regime (<span class=\"math\">\\lambda \\rightarrow \\infty</span>). They establish a key result that <span class=\"math\">\\overline{ARB} = Θ( \\sqrt{λ^{-1}} )</span>, where <span class=\"math\">\\overline{ARB}</span> is the expected arbitrage profits over time. The authors do not explicitly discuss the case when block times are not Poisson distributed, however, intuitively, one can expect the approximation to remain reasonably accurate when the blocks are uniformly distributed. To formalize this idea: <span class=\"math\">\\overline{ARB} = Θ( \\sqrt{BT} )</span>, where <span class=\"math\">BT</span> is the average block time.</p>\n<p>One key question is whether we see this formula play out in real-world data? A group of research papers generally confirm the <span class=\"math\">\\sqrt{BT}</span> model:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04159\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">McMenamin 2023</a>) draws an analogy between the model and the time value of options, which “typically grows proportionally to the square root of time to expiration.”</li>\n<li>(<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09494v2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Adams 2024</a>) describe shorter block times as a reason for  increased fee returns for liquidity providers, stressing the difference between Optimism and Arbitrum, in favor of later due to shorter blocks.</li>\n<li>(<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05803\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Fritsch 2024</a>) empirically study the arbitrage profits predicted by the LVR model, and conclude that “our empirical findings come close to [the <span class=\"math\">\\sqrt{BT}</span> model] for most pairs and block times larger than 1s”, and attempt to explain any deviations as a result of: (1) uniform block times (i.e. not Poisson-distributed), and (2) price action that does not match the Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model. Their work is a step towards verifying the <span class=\"math\">\\sqrt{BT}</span> model – however, it must be stressed that they measure arbitrage profits, not the LP losses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In contrast:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13749\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dahi 2023</a>) investigate AMM on the XRP ledger and find only a tiny impact on the LPs: 0.35% in relative terms, if block time in simulations is reduced from 12 seconds to 4 seconds.

However, this assumption is not valid in the post EIP-1559 world, where transactions cannot be free. Each arbitrage trade not only divides profits among the searcher, builder, and proposer (“SBP” further in this article) but also burns some ETH, contingent on the blockspace demand at the time of the arbitrage. To borrow a term from physics, the basefee introduces a friction in the process. This friction eliminates a significant portion of potential trades, and reduces LP income.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"analyzing-the-single-trade-lvr-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#analyzing-the-single-trade-lvr-2\"></a>Analyzing the single-trade LVR</h1>\n<p>Let’s look at the details of how LVR arises in real-world arbitrage trades.

It’s no surprise that integrated searchers-builders dominate the arbitrage market (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01622\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Heimbach 2024</a>), as for them it is simpler to divide up the profits. <strong>ETH</strong> <strong>holders</strong> do not directly receive compensation, but burning the basefee creates a deflationary pressure on ETH as an asset.</p>\n<p>By comparing the nominal single-trade LVR with the LP fees from that trade, we can assess the fairness of the trade to the LP. In a scenario where price evolution is smooth without any jumps, the LP fee nearly recoups the LVR, and the LP loss is minimal. However, if the DEX-to-CEX price difference fluctuates due to block time granularity or actual price discontinuities on the CEX, the LP fee becomes smaller than the LVR, resulting in some loss for the LP against the theoretical rebalancing strategy.

(There are stable pools with deeper liquidity). For pools with <strong>lower liquidity,</strong> the importance of the friction created by the basefee would be increased. For instance, let’s say that the ETH/USDT 0.05% pool has 1/3 of the liquidity. Then the results from $10 basefee on that pool would match those of the USDC/ETH pools with $30 basefee. For pools with <strong>higher liquidity</strong> (such as USDC/USDT) the friction would be decreased, proportional to the rise in liquidity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Generalizing to other chains.</strong> The model assumes that shorter blocks simply divide the available blockspace differently, rather than add more blockspace. The simulation results would not generalize if the block time decrease was accompanied with a proportional decrease in basefees.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"implications-for-blockchain-design-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#implications-for-blockchain-design-8\"></a>Implications for blockchain design</h3>\n<p>The results clearly show that LP losses are not accurately predicted by the <span class=\"math\">\\sqrt{BT}</span> model, unless the basefee is close to zero. While it’s true that shorter blocks benefit LPs, the effect is limited and frequently less significant than other factors (basefee, liquidity depth, swap fee %, and potentially others). More compelling arguments for fast block times may come from other perspectives, like the perspective of traders, or that of block builders, but these are out of the scope for this article.</p>\n<p>Potentially, we can view the optimal block time choice problem from two viewpoints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From <strong>L1 perspective</strong>, reducing the basefee could provide a quicker win, compared with changing the block time. However, keeping the design decentralized and credibly-neutral is arguably a higher priority.</li>\n<li>From <strong>L2 / appchain perspective,</strong> especially for chains that focus on DeFi or on trading in particular, it makes sense to excessively optimize for LP profits, including block time and basefee reduction.</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>The <span class=\"math\">\\sqrt{BT}</span> model implies that decreasing block times is especially important if the block time is already close to zero, since the <span class=\"math\">\\sqrt{~}</span> function rapidly grows in the near-zero region.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>L2 fees may already be low enough to minimize the friction caused by the basefee to negligible levels. If this isn’t the case, then paradoxically, exempting CEX/DEX arbitrage swaps from the EIP-1559 basefee would benefit DEX users (both LPs and retail traders).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"shorter-blocks-less-mev-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#shorter-blocks-less-mev-9\"></a>Shorter blocks = less MEV?</h3>\n<p>To be clear, this article makes no claims about MEV in general, just about CEX/DEX arbitrage in particular. Regarding the latter, clearly, there’s a connection between CEX/DEX arbitrage, transaction fees, and block times. However, it is perhaps confusing because this connection goes <strong>both ways</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shorter blocks increase the number of arbitrage transactions and the proportion of gas that they consume.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, shorter blocks decrease the expected value of LP losses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The same conflicting results apply to changes in basefees. As a result, there’s potential for a confusion, because MEV is increased in one sense, and decreased in another sense.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>This work extends the existing LVR and LVR-with-fees models by adding another component: transaction cost.

While proofs of execution are important, they do not detect many categories of faults and frauds that can happen in the various components that comprise  the overall layer-2 infrastructure. Such faults/frauds are  difficult to prove and impossible to attribute and penalise on-chain.</p>\n<p>This post introduces integrity proofs, which complements zk proofs and fraud proofs for rollup security. Integrity proof  is a mechanism to attest to the integrity of services running in a particular instance of rollup, providing assurance to the end users that no malicious or other unauthorized code changes have been performed in the production environment. Integrity proofs use TEEs to deploy and monitor rollup services and report any breach of service integrity on a new layer-2 network (let’s call it Integrity verification chain) that provides decentralised security services to rollups.</p>\n<p>Layering integrity proofs over existing execution proofs greatly improves the censorship resistance of the rollup, detects unauthorised MEV extraction and offers protection from other types of malicious activities in the rollup infrastructure from privileged or unauthorized users. This design also reduces the trust assumptions , compared to the current architecture of centralised rollup deployments that rely disproportionately on execution proofs to demonstrate offchain execution validity.</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Layer-2 networks settling on Ethereum (aka base layer) predominantly use either fraud proofs (proofs of invalidity) or ZK-proofs (proofs of validity) to prove transaction validity and updated state commitments to the base layer. Both these are execution proofs that cryptographically attest to those activities that are objectively recorded and verifiable on-chain (aka running in the EVM or equivalent VM).</p>\n<p>However, such execution proofs alone are inadequate to verify the security of the overall layer-2 network. This is because there are many centralised components in L2s where faults and malicious activities can occur, which cannot be proven on-chain (non-attributable faults). There are many solutions being worked on to address centralisation risk in rollups, but they come with their own tradeoffs including loss of sovereignty/control, reducing utility of own token, cost increase or increased complexity of architecture.</p>\n<p>This post proposes a solution to detect <em>unattributable faults</em> while running rollup services (of the kind that cannot be detected by ZK proofs alone) , without any loss of sovereignty or loss of control for the project deploying the layer-2 network. (Note: The terms layer-2 network and rollup are used interchangeably in this post as a broad term to encompass rollups, validiums and optimums.)</p>\n<p>Integrity proofs are proposed as a mechanism to certify to the presence (or absence) of unattributable faults in the operation of a rollup service, by having an observer running in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) provide cryptographic attestation of its own execution environment and signing the attestation with its own in-enclave generated cryptographic identity (signing key) that cannot be tampered with even by the operator of the attestation service.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem space</strong></p>\n<p>Layer-2 networks (both optimistic and Zk stack chains) have many components such as rpc nodes, sequencers, pool &amp; state databases, executors, provers, L1 transaction managers etc that are basically deployed either as platform-native binaries or docker images. Examples of non-attributable faults/frauds include censoring transactions based on addresses or geo-fencing access in json-rpc node, changing the ordering algorithm of sequencer, making unauthorised/undetected changes to the state or pool database, and withholding transaction batch data posted to external DA layer. Currently, users make heavy trust assumptions while using L2 chains that such malicious or unauthorised actions don’t take place in the centralised services operated by their provider. More specifically, users make the following trust assumptions:</p>\n<p>a) they trust the rollup project foundations (eg Polygon, ZK, Optimism, Arbitrum) to not introduce any malicious code on the published rollup service images.</p>\n<p>b) trust that the right security controls are in place such that employees/contractors that belong to the rollup project or RaaS operators have restricted privileged access (or that those who do , do not abuse privileged access)</p>\n<p>In short, users rely on the security offered by the reputational credibility (social &amp; commercial ) of these trusted third parties. Integrity of the rollup services operated by these parties is not verifiable, and any faults are not attributable or provable on-chain. This goes against the basic premise of blockchain networks aka verifiability.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution proposed</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/e/d/edb7cc61ad8bf9c863c1a9d1deeef28720e7a109.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/edb7cc61ad8bf9c863c1a9d1deeef28720e7a109\" title=\"Integrity Verified Services\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/d/edb7cc61ad8bf9c863c1a9d1deeef28720e7a109_2_671x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Integrity Verified Services\" data-base62-sha1=\"xUWWH1Wf1Mo6qGiYtnUbW6g5cYV\" width=\"671\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/d/edb7cc61ad8bf9c863c1a9d1deeef28720e7a109_2_671x500.jpeg, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/d/edb7cc61ad8bf9c863c1a9d1deeef28720e7a109_2_1006x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/d/edb7cc61ad8bf9c863c1a9d1deeef28720e7a109_2_1342x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEDEA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Figure shows the overview of the proposed solution, which has a new layer-2 network acting as the integrity verification chain (let’s call it IVC in short), and three types of actors participating in it - rollup framework providers, rollup projects and TEE operators. Let’s understand this better using the example of a single rollup service- the sequencer (which needs no introduction).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rollup framework providers (eg polygon cdk, Zkstack, OP stack , Arbitrum etc) register the service image of their latest release of sequencer with IVC.</li>\n<li>A new rollup project comes along and wants to deploy the sequencer from one of these frameworks. The request is sent to a <em>Host program</em> (creatively named) that runs in a TEE. The host program retrieves the service image registered by the provider, and deploys it on a VM that’s specified by the rollup provider. (The only requirement is for the host program to be given SSH access to deploy the service in the VM). For simplicity, let’s assume this service image is a docker image. The host program downloads the docker image and instantiates a new container using this image. The container Id is captured by the host program and recorded on IVC smart contract designated for the purpose.</li>\n<li>Periodically (based on frequency specified by the rollup project owner) the host program verifies if the container id of the running sequencer matches that recorded on the IVC layer-2 smart contract. If there is any discrepancy, it flags it as a violation of integrity on the integrity verification chain (IVC).</li>\n<li>The host program can generate an integrity proof on demand (or it can be generated unconditionally in the protocol workflow) attesting to the integrity of a particular service that is deployed and monitored by it. The integrity proof would contain the details of the rollup service that’s being monitored, proof of the execution environment in which the host program runs including the quote/remote attestation parameters and its own binary fingerprint (MRENCLAVE), Further, the integrity proof generated by the host program can be signed by a keypair that’s generated within the enclave so that the operator of the host program VM cannot make a false attestation. The signing key would not be accessible even to the operator.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here, the sequencer component that was used as the example, becomes the Integrity-verified service (IVS). Technically, the sequencer itself can be run inside a TEE, but that would be another solution not discussed here.</p>\n<p><strong>How does integrity verified service offer a better security model for rollups?</strong></p>\n<p>In this example, let’s assume that after the rollup service is deployed , someone with privileged or unauthorised access modifies the sequencer code to add censoring logic or ordering algorithm, and restarts the docker container. This will result in a change to the container finggerprint, and this will  immediately be detected by the host program (as the running container id will not match the registered container id that was started by the host program). The integrity proof from the host program can certify to the presence or absence of such non-attributable faults.</p>\n<p>When integrity proofs are combined with prevailing proof mechanisms such as zk validity proofs or fraud proofs, it strictly improves the status quo in terms of rollup security.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of this solution</strong></p>\n<p><em>For end-user:</em> The end user of the rollup/L2 chain is now assured that in addition to their on-chain transactions being secure (due to natively built-in zk proofs or fraud proofs), additionally any non-attributable faults that can occur in sequencer such as censoring or ordering algorithm changes will immediately be detected and flagged for attention. The user can verify integrity proofs in a permission-less manner.</p>\n<p><em>For rollup project owner:</em> They don’t just have to trust their own devops teams or that of the RaaS operator that they outsource to, but they can verify the integrity of the rollup services deployed permissionlessly, on an ongoing basis. They get a higher security layer-2 chain (trust-minimised) compared to what they would get by deploying a standard rollup stack out of the box.</p>\n<p><em>For RaaS operators</em>: They have lower operational risk by ensuring that the right service images are deployed everytime. This also results in lower risk of reputational/business loss due to unauthorised access or security attacks on their infra.</p>\n<p><em>For rollup framework providers</em> : By publishing their service images and actively participating in the integrity verification activity, they attract better quality of builders and projects on their ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Further security enhancements</strong></p>\n<p>The integrity proofs described solve two attack vectors on rollup services:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Any unauthorised changes to the deployed rollup service is detected and flagged.</li>\n<li>The correct secure version of each rollup service is deployed in the production environment</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is a clear improvement from having just execution proofs. But there can be other types of attacks that need to be designed for. One example is that someone with privileged access can still log into the running docker container and change environment variables. To address this, the host program can be enhanced to periodically log into the running containers and compare the environment parameters on the current running version of container vs the original deployed version.</p>\n<p>There can be other types of attacks that are more difficult to detect. for example a sophisticated actor can log into the docker container and manipulate memory . Memory encryption techniques can be evaluated to protect against such attacks. Other solutions could involve running multiple instances of a rollup service (eg sequencer or prover) governed by a consensus algorithm, but it increases costs of operating the rollup infrastructure, and it will be the decision of the rollup project to evaluate the level of risk they are willing to accept and the cost they are willing to pay.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The premise of this solution is that a combination of existing <em>execution proof techniques</em> (zk or fraud proofs) for objectively-verifiable faults in combination with Tee-based <em>integrity proofs</em> for non-attributable faults offers a superior trust-minimised security model for rollups, compared to the status quo.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/integrity-proofs-to-improve-rollup-security/19437\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/integrity-proofs-to-improve-rollup-security/19437","pubDate":"Thu, 02 May 2024 13:00:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19437"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/integrity-proofs-to-improve-rollup-security/19437.rss","#text":"Integrity proofs to improve rollup security"},"filter":false},{"title":"Voter Behavior in Blockchain Governance: A Comparative Study of Curve Finance and Polkadot","dc:creator":"dengwx11","category":"Economics","description":"<p>by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dengwx11\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Wenxuan Deng</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanishakatara/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tanisha Katara</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidhamoui/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">David Hamoui</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matrzeszowski\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mateusz Rzeszowski</a></p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong><br>\nAdditional thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/p_petertherock\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Peter Liem</a> for his assistance with data fetching.</p>\n<p>Also blogged here: <a href=\"https://polygon-governance.mirror.xyz/_BeDt5MvxFQ26ElodFtzHoLi725EFLp_IlliUYtg_HA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">polygon mirror</a>; <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/QkqNJuSjQKSolPWfcEnceA?view\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Voter Behavior in Blockchain Governance: A Comparative Study of Curve Finance and Polkadot - HackMD</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>As the first comprehensive examination of voter behavior in Web3, the following research explores two significant blockchain ecosystems, Curve Finance and Polkadot, using a novel quantitative methodology to decompose and highlight governance patterns.</p>\n<p>The presented analysis shows, among other findings, a significant influence of market conditions on voter tendencies, diverse patterns relating to voting power accumulation, and a potential effect of financial incentives on voter participation.</p>\n<p>As such, this research seeks to provide value to the growing field of blockchain-based governance frameworks in dealing with fundamental issues, such as low stakeholder activity, the impact of shifting market conditions, and various complexities at the intersection of economics and political science.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-1-introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-1-introduction-2\"></a>1. Introduction</h2>\n<p>Blockchain enables decentralized decision making[1]. The information once hidden is now displayed publicly in any block explorer[2]; what used to be the domain of a few now can be accessed permissionlessly[3]; what was perceived as status quo is now challenged with every executed transaction[4].</p>\n<p>These qualities are revolutionary, but the decision-making of distributed networks is largely undocumented still. Consequently, this paper serves as an attempt to analyze and compare two blockchain-based governance systems quantitatively: Curve Finance[5] and Polkadot[6].</p>\n<p>Firstly, in order to lay a common ground of understanding, we describe the relevant governance systems. Secondly, we explain the motivation for selecting Curve Finance and Polkadot as part of our analysis. Lastly, in each of the systems, we analytically deep dive into the voter personas, voter turnout, proposals and voter behavior in different market conditions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-11-curve-finance-and-polkadot-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-11-curve-finance-and-polkadot-3\"></a>1.1 Curve Finance and Polkadot</h3>\n<p>As the fields of tokenomics[7] and governance rapidly evolve, two protocols have emerged as particularly influential. Curve Finance pioneered[8] the vote escrow token model[9], introducing gauge voting[10] to decentralized finance (DeFi)[11]. Meanwhile, Polkadot’s governance system has been notable[12] for its innovative approach to quorums[13] and governance lockers[14]. These protocols consequently stand out as significant pioneers in decentralized governance innovation, including novel concepts such as governance conviction[15].</p>\n<p>Governance conviction, also referred to as lockup-based voting multipliers or vote escrow[16], is a mechanism used in decentralized governance models[17] to enhance the influence or voting power of token holders based on the duration for which they are willing to lock up their tokens in a smart contract. This type of system operates under the assumption that the longer a participant commits their tokens for, the more conviction they demonstrate towards the decisions being made within the network and the more incentive alignment they display. As a consequence of the process, their voting power is multiplied by a factor corresponding to the lockup period. This aims to incentivize longer-term commitment and stability within the governance process, aligning participants’ interests with the long-term health and success of the platform.</p>\n<p>Let’s now briefly go over both projects and how their governance works in practice.</p>\n<p><strong>1.1.1 Curve Finance</strong>[18] is a protocol allowing for seamless exchange of ERC-20 tokens at a low cost. This is achieved through the use of liquidity pools[19], which are tokens locked in smart contracts to facilitate trades. Curve Finance offers rewards[20] to those who contribute, creating a mutually beneficial relationship where users can easily exchange tokens while liquidity providers receive rewards.</p>\n<p>To vote, CRV token holders must possess veCRV. veCRV[21] represents CRV tokens that are locked for a certain period (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#table1\">Table 1</a>). Users can lock their CRV for a minimum of  one week and a maximum of four years.[22]</p>\n<p><strong>1.1.1.1 Governance Proposals</strong> - To distinct proposals were noted: gauge proposals and non-gauge proposals. Gauges and gauge weights determine how much token rewards the suppliers to a liquidity pool get. Therefore, a gauge proposal will have explicit financial consequences for some or all token holders. Non-gauge proposals, on the other hand, may or may not have financial consequences and may pertain to high-level maintenance and regular upgrades in the network. The impact of proposal types on voter behavior will be discussed more in this research paper.</p>\n<p><strong>1.1.1.2 Community Voting</strong> - A proposer must have a minimum voting power of 2500 vote-escrowed CRV (veCRV)[23] to create a proposal. A voter’s voting power linearly decreases overtime until it reaches zero at the time of the unlock.</p>\n<p><strong>1.1.2 Polkadot</strong>[24] is a protocol which uses a nominated Proof of Stake (PoS)[25] consensus algorithm and aims to connect blockchains, also known as parachains[26], to enable seamless communication, and intermediary-free communication within its network. Fundamentally, parachains are independent PoS blockchains with their own functionalities and tokens. What binds these parachains is the relay chain[27], which is responsible for achieving consensus and ensuring that transactions are executed.</p>\n<p>Note: This study analyzes data from Polkadot’s Governance V1[6], rather than the more recent Open Governance system[28]. This choice was made to ensure comparability in terms of the data size, data type and temporal alignment of the voter samples with those from Curve Finance.</p>\n<p><strong>1.1.2.1 Governance Proposals</strong> - Similarly to Curve Finance, two types of proposals can be distinguished in Polkadot: treasury proposals[29] and non-treasury proposals. According to Polkadot’s Governance V1, when a stakeholder wishes to propose spending from the treasury, they must reserve a deposit of at least 5% of the proposed spending[29]. A treasury proposal will have explicit financial consequences for the protocol, subject to governance, while non-treasury proposals may or may not have financial consequences and pertain to high-level maintenance and regular upgrades in the network. The manner in how the proposal types impact voter behavior will be tackled in the  “Governance Proposals Breakdown” section of this research paper.</p>\n<p><strong>1.1.2.2 Community Voting</strong> - To vote on proposals, DOT token holders must lock their tokens. The longer the DOT is locked, the more voting power is assigned. The voting power of a DOT holder in Polkadot is calculated as DOT tokens held multiplied by the relevant multiplier (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#table2\">Table 2</a>), which increases as the locking period increases. The multipliers range from 0.1x for zero days to 6x for two hundred and twenty-four days.[30]</p>\n<p>For instance, if Bobby has 100 tokens and locks them for 14 days, her/his voting power per the (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#table2\">Table 2</a>) is (Dot Tokens Held) * 2 (14-day multiplier) = 200. Therefore, Bobby will have the voting power of 200 tokens.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-12-curve-finance-and-polkadot-case-selection-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-12-curve-finance-and-polkadot-case-selection-4\"></a>1.2 Curve Finance and Polkadot Case Selection</h3>\n<p>Curve Finance and Polkadot serve as significant examples of decentralized governance and are distinct in their purposes and functionalities. At the same time, due to the need for upgradeable contracts and changeable system parameters[30][31], both projects incorporate governance structures, delegating system maintenance responsibilities to their respective communities, as proxied by token in order to facilitate for secure and decentralized decision-making. Both of those governance systems utilize permissionless on-chain execution, which means that the decision-making is directly translated into canonical code, without the need for an external authority or intermediary to apply the changes that tokenholders vote on.</p>\n<p>Importantly, in both Polkadot’s and Curve’s cases, we can distinguish between proposals with explicit and direct financial consequences (financial proposals) and those where the financial consequence is implicit and delayed (technical proposals). Curve’s gauge proposals and Polkadot’s treasury proposals can be both considered financial proposals since they explicitly impact the allocation of financial resources shared by all tokenholders, i.e., as it concerns deciding reward structures for pools in Curve, and the distribution of Polkadot’s treasury funds. On the other hand, technical proposals, i.e., non-gauge and non-treasury, impact the protocols, relate to maintenance and upgrades, and may not directly affect the allocation of financial resources shared by tokenholders.</p>\n<p>There is one notable difference between the two governance systems in terms of the specifics of their token lock-up mechanisms. Curve Finance employs a governance mechanism that encourages participants to actively engage in decision-making processes by allowing them to gain financial rewards[20] for locking their tokens. On the other hand, Polkadot doesn’t financially incentivize the locking up of tokens for voting (Democracy locker).</p>\n<p>The above makes the case for a comparative study of the two systems. In the following parts, we analyze voter turnouts (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#2\">Section 2</a>) and break down governance proposals by type (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#3\">Section 3</a>). Then, we establish voter personas and seek to understand them in each system (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#4\">Section 4</a>). Finally, we analyze voter behavior and seek to identify the governing principles and patterns of these complex environments (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#5\">Section 5</a>). To do so, we break down the types of market conditions and consequent variations in voter behavior.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2-voter-turnout-analysis-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-2-voter-turnout-analysis-5\"></a>2. Voter Turnout Analysis</h2>\n<p>The below data comes from a comprehensive analysis on voter turnout for governance proposals. The calculation of voter turnout metrics is based on the number of veCRV tokens and DOT tokens used for voting over time, relative to the total veCRV and DOT tokens locked over the same period.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1 Curve Finance:</strong> On average, 65% of the circulating CRV is locked as veCRV. The below graph shows the monthly average number of veCRV tokens used for voting on gauge proposals and non gauge proposals over time. The red line shows the monthly average CRV locked as veCRV over time.</p>\n<p>While there is no significant difference in the veCRV used for voting on gauge proposals and for non gauge proposals, it is interesting to note that out of the 65% locked, an average of 38% tokens have been used for voting. This highlights that although a significant proportion of CRV is locked, a relatively low percentage is used for voting. Further investigation is required to determine the exact factors contributing to the low percentage of utilized tokens.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/5/b5ca495402eba76079ef1ae2e3a6201676e86217.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/b5ca495402eba76079ef1ae2e3a6201676e86217\" title=\"crv_turnout\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/5/b5ca495402eba76079ef1ae2e3a6201676e86217_2_690x202.png\" alt=\"crv_turnout\" data-base62-sha1=\"pWbOLDZ8msAc5Pmw4oxnxOmgf1Z\" width=\"690\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/5/b5ca495402eba76079ef1ae2e3a6201676e86217_2_690x202.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/5/b5ca495402eba76079ef1ae2e3a6201676e86217_2_1035x303.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/5/b5ca495402eba76079ef1ae2e3a6201676e86217_2_1380x404.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E3E5ED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>2.2 Polkadot:</strong> On average, 54.5% of the circulating DOT is locked into multiple Polkadot lockers. The below graph shows the monthly average number of locked DOT tokens used for voting on treasury proposals and non treasury proposals over time. The red line shows the monthly average amount of DOT locked over time. In stark contrast to Curve Finance, out of these locked tokens, only 0.11% has been used for voting.</p>\n<p>This highlights a significant disparity in voter engagement between the two blockchain ecosystems, with DOT showing a much lower level of voter engagement than CRV. While no direct  connection can be drawn, the low percentage of utilized tokens for voting in DOT could be attributed to several factors, such as a lack of financial incentives dedicated to token lockups.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/0/9/09bf469fb6b10415f3bbdd8919dab25c4e91905b.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/09bf469fb6b10415f3bbdd8919dab25c4e91905b\" title=\"dot_turnout\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/0/9/09bf469fb6b10415f3bbdd8919dab25c4e91905b_2_690x204.png\" alt=\"dot_turnout\" data-base62-sha1=\"1oe6rpwz4LAHXxARiguZ9L3pc7N\" width=\"690\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/0/9/09bf469fb6b10415f3bbdd8919dab25c4e91905b_2_690x204.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/0/9/09bf469fb6b10415f3bbdd8919dab25c4e91905b_2_1035x306.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/0/9/09bf469fb6b10415f3bbdd8919dab25c4e91905b_2_1380x408.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C4D3E4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The voter turnout metrics shed light on the extent to which token holders actively engage in voting in both the ecosystems. This sets the stage for a deeper exploration into the nature of governance proposals and their implications on decision-making dynamics within the Curve Finance and Polkadot communities. By examining the types and frequencies of proposals submitted in governance, we can gain further insights into the priorities and interests driving the respective ecosystems’ governance mechanisms.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-3-governance-proposals-breakdown-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-3-governance-proposals-breakdown-6\"></a>3. Governance Proposals Breakdown</h2>\n<p>Governance proposals play a crucial role in decision-making within any community. Our analysis of two ecosystems, Curve Finance and Polkadot, reveals that financial proposals make up a significant portion of all proposals. Gauge proposals constitute approximately 70% of all proposals in Curve Finance, while treasury proposals make up approximately 80% of all proposals in Polkadot.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/9/f/9f65fd9cc73df566bd1b3796a96d61ae737a365a.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/9f65fd9cc73df566bd1b3796a96d61ae737a365a\" title=\"crv_cumu_prop_num\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/9/f/9f65fd9cc73df566bd1b3796a96d61ae737a365a_2_690x406.png\" alt=\"crv_cumu_prop_num\" data-base62-sha1=\"mK6qLSN9nAtnKnzKiANAnSYEOtc\" width=\"690\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/9/f/9f65fd9cc73df566bd1b3796a96d61ae737a365a_2_690x406.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/9/f/9f65fd9cc73df566bd1b3796a96d61ae737a365a.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/9/f/9f65fd9cc73df566bd1b3796a96d61ae737a365a.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E2E7F1\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/3/5/35b67cad4c367dc4f4c3268906521b452a2cc5c7.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/35b67cad4c367dc4f4c3268906521b452a2cc5c7\" title=\"dot_cumu_ref_num\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/5/35b67cad4c367dc4f4c3268906521b452a2cc5c7_2_690x318.png\" alt=\"dot_cumu_ref_num\" data-base62-sha1=\"7Fahwce4tUT0a2cMd6f3DU7yTpZ\" width=\"690\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/5/35b67cad4c367dc4f4c3268906521b452a2cc5c7_2_690x318.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/5/35b67cad4c367dc4f4c3268906521b452a2cc5c7_2_1035x477.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/3/5/35b67cad4c367dc4f4c3268906521b452a2cc5c7.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E0E3E6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Interestingly, in Curve Finance, we found that most proposals are initiated by individuals associated with the <a href=\"http://Curve.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Curve.fi</a> team (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#table3\">Table 3</a>), particularly two wallets linked to its founder, Michael Egorov[32].

Voter Personas and Respective Patterns</h2>\n<p>The following research categorizes voter persona and analyzes their behavior towards the governance systems.</p>\n<p>Voter personas are categorized based on the size of their token holdings, and the hierarchy is defined as follows: the top 1% is labeled as Whales, the next 5% as Sharks, the next 10% as Dolphins, the next 20% as Fish, and the remaining 64% as Shrimps.</p>\n<div> \n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Token Holdings</th>\n<th>Voter Persona</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Top 1%</td>\n<td>Whales</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5%</td>\n<td>Sharks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>Dolphins</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20%</td>\n<td>Fish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Remaining 64%</td>\n<td>Shrimps</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div></div>\n<p><strong>4.1 Curve Finance:</strong> In the context of Curve Finance governance, over 58% of token holders choose to lock their tokens for the longest duration, i.e. four years. However, an intriguing trend surfaces among the different cohorts of holders.</p>\n<p>In the graph below, the x-axis displays the initial lock-up windows, which range from 7 days to 4 years, and the y-axis displays the percentage of each of the voter personas who have locked their tokens. The more significant holders, i.e., Whales, Sharks, and Dolphins, show mild hesitation to commit for more extended lock periods. Conversely, they slightly prefer shorter commitments, particularly those under six months. Although the margin is slim, it is a telling divergence.</p>\n<p>It hints that larger holders may not need to lock up their tokens for extended periods to wield significant voting power. For them, the flexibility not to lock in for an extended time could be a strategic move to mitigate risk and maintain liquidity options.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/1/b1c30bac016ddab4cd9accb8232ffc6b72a406aa.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/b1c30bac016ddab4cd9accb8232ffc6b72a406aa\" title=\"crv_shark_and_shrimp_dotplot\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/1/b1c30bac016ddab4cd9accb8232ffc6b72a406aa_2_375x500.png\" alt=\"crv_shark_and_shrimp_dotplot\" data-base62-sha1=\"pmyowoUE7tPajUHQoovpOpvP6KS\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/1/b1c30bac016ddab4cd9accb8232ffc6b72a406aa_2_375x500.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/1/b1c30bac016ddab4cd9accb8232ffc6b72a406aa_2_562x750.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/1/b1c30bac016ddab4cd9accb8232ffc6b72a406aa.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDF1F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>4.2 Polkadot:</strong> In the Polkadot ecosystem, analysis yields a similar, yet valuable, correlation to Curve Finance. 4% of DOT holders initially choose to lock their tokens for a maximum of 224 days (roughly seven months). Holders with more significant positions prefer shorter lock-up periods, and this pattern is glaringly apparent. Particularly striking in the Polkadot ecosystem is that about 93% of Whales and 98% of Sharks tend to lock up their tokens for 14 days or less.

The distinctions and preferences between prominent and smallholders are consistent within each protocol.</p>\n<p>However, there is a significant difference between the two protocols. As shown in the pie charts below, in Curve Finance, 67.2% of voters across all groups opt for a four-year lock-up, while in Polkadot, only 4% of the users choose the most extended lock-up window of 224 days. Even among the most minor stakeholders, the Shrimps, less than 5% chose the most prolonged lock-up period of 32 weeks.</p>\n<p>This divergence could be attributed to the fundamental differences in the underlying rewards and incentives of Curve Finance and Polkadot. Curve’s gauge weight voting system[34] incentivizes users to boost their voting power by locking their tokens for extended periods. This may indicate that sustained rewards are crucial in incentivizing token holders to stay longer.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/a/d/ad4e411543cfef1a3570feaedf97c885a91ad181.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/ad4e411543cfef1a3570feaedf97c885a91ad181\" title=\"crv_piechart\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad4e411543cfef1a3570feaedf97c885a91ad181_2_511x500.png\" alt=\"crv_piechart\" data-base62-sha1=\"oJ8gcs0uLvxMtiOgouWUcv9izAt\" width=\"511\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad4e411543cfef1a3570feaedf97c885a91ad181_2_511x500.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/a/d/ad4e411543cfef1a3570feaedf97c885a91ad181.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/a/d/ad4e411543cfef1a3570feaedf97c885a91ad181.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDD2D6\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/b/fb9c1553283566ce16f0c4076202d83ab22487a6.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/fb9c1553283566ce16f0c4076202d83ab22487a6\" title=\"dot_piechart\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/b/fb9c1553283566ce16f0c4076202d83ab22487a6_2_497x500.png\" alt=\"dot_piechart\" data-base62-sha1=\"zTQfCJgGnIp1PfY7BYpgU2yM40S\" width=\"497\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/b/fb9c1553283566ce16f0c4076202d83ab22487a6_2_497x500.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/b/fb9c1553283566ce16f0c4076202d83ab22487a6.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/b/fb9c1553283566ce16f0c4076202d83ab22487a6.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F8EB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>With this understanding of voter personas and their lock-up behaviors, we now dive into how they accumulate voting power in different market conditions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-5-voting-power-accumulation-patterns-in-different-market-conditions-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-5-voting-power-accumulation-patterns-in-different-market-conditions-8\"></a>5. Voting Power Accumulation Patterns in Different Market Conditions</h2>\n<p>The study of voting power accumulation patterns and the associated dynamics between voters and their locked-up tokens are of great importance in understanding how voters use their tokens in upward and downward market conditions.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, the two primary ways in which voters can augment their voting power (VP) are by purchasing additional tokens and locking them up, or by extending their lock-up period for already-owned tokens, resulting in an increased multiplier. VP calculation is derived from the multiplication of token balance and a multiplier based on the lock-up period.</p>\n<p><strong>Voting Power (VP) = token balance * multiplier based on lockup time</strong></p>\n<p>However, analyzing the behavior of voters in response to changes in token prices and market conditions presents a significant challenge - it’s hard to determine whether voter behavior is influenced by changes in token locked amounts and lock-up duration or whether they are affected by the daily routines of the average Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet.</p>\n<p>To overcome this challenge, a reliable quantitative methodology has been developed to simplify this complex analysis. The approach we present is based on a decomposition of the changes in voting power into its constituent factors. By quantifying the changes in voting power (<span class=\"math\">\\Delta vp</span>) over time, an analysis of the two constituent factors, changes in balance (<span class=\"math\">\\Delta b</span>) and changes in conviction (<span class=\"math\">\\Delta c</span>), can be made.</p>\n<p>The change in voting power between two consecutive time points, <span class=\"math\">t</span> and <span class=\"math\">t-1</span>, can be derived through arithmetic calculations as follows:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/4/24c7a0daa9f98d910a6b49ded7cef9789868a70f.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/24c7a0daa9f98d910a6b49ded7cef9789868a70f\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/4/24c7a0daa9f98d910a6b49ded7cef9789868a70f.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"5fmTdKIkigVRL7BgBmp6ga6jjxZ\" width=\"690\" height=\"53\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This equation can be expanded as:<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/d/fd0c1ec82b641fef7cc14e5a229f8fece3897b0e.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/fd0c1ec82b641fef7cc14e5a229f8fece3897b0e\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/d/fd0c1ec82b641fef7cc14e5a229f8fece3897b0e.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"A6yLAlYY1z562dRnDl5jbtFYESa\" width=\"690\" height=\"94\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Here, <span class=\"math\">b(t)</span> and <span class=\"math\">c(t)</span> represent the balance and conviction at time <span class=\"math\">t</span>, respectively.

To achieve this, we analyze upward and downward trends in the market by employing a combination of short-term and long-term moving averages, namely the 7-day moving average (MA7) and the 30-day moving average (MA30). We define an upward trend when the MA7 exceeds the MA30 and a downward trend when the MA7 falls below the MA30.</p>\n<p>It is crucial to acknowledge that token behavior is circumstantial, and varying market conditions may elicit different responses from holders with varying stakes, thereby exhibiting diverse behavior patterns. Therefore, we adopt a nuanced approach, which considers these factors to provide a precise understanding of how balance and conviction impact the ebb and flow of voting power within the Curve Finance and Polkadot governance systems.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/0/7/07a995daf9cb9eb9aadcc576d83b39e7257db50b.png\" alt=\"crv_price\" data-base62-sha1=\"15MFZslEgCkEObJIgPqvAnY2oP1\" width=\"635\" height=\"387\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/c/a/ca393687212f545f9764f88da9c2ea9b776a93c2.png\" alt=\"dot_price\" data-base62-sha1=\"sQX1H0jGUGKipwwBUjbPTXSA3aG\" width=\"650\" height=\"388\"></p>\n<p>The charts presented above illustrate how the MA7-MA30 differential correlates with the token price. Our analysis leverages these definitions to explore how market trends affect Shrimp voter behavior, specifically the influence of the token price and lock-up duration on the dynamic voting power within the governance frameworks of Curve Finance and Polkadot. Since the sample size for Whales, Sharks, Dolphins and Fish is insignificant, we choose to exclusively analyze the Shrimp voter group. Having said that, it’s useful to note that for all the aforementioned groups, similar tendencies can be distinguished to the ones presented below.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-52-findings-voting-power-accumulation-in-curve-finance-and-polkadot-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-52-findings-voting-power-accumulation-in-curve-finance-and-polkadot-10\"></a>5.2 Findings: Voting Power Accumulation in Curve Finance and Polkadot</h3>\n<p><strong>5.2.1 Curve Finance:</strong> In the case of Curve Finance, we encountered a challenge when studying Shrimp voters due to their number exceeding 12,000 and the high computational complexity of our method. As a result, we adopted a sampling strategy, randomly selecting 2000 Shrimp voters in each experiment, and repeated this process 500 times. We calculated the log ratio of conviction impact to balance impact in each experiment and grouped the results by upward and downward market trends. The grouped histograms below show distinct patterns.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/5/d536727595a832550e07d0d6945f5ee56a64682e.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/d536727595a832550e07d0d6945f5ee56a64682e\" title=\"crv_vp_accu\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/5/d536727595a832550e07d0d6945f5ee56a64682e.png\" alt=\"crv_vp_accu\" data-base62-sha1=\"uqalVdi845Lu36f5WWH92pov0rY\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" data-dominant-color=\"DFD8EB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>During downward trends, the log ratio values were mainly concentrated between 0 and 0.5, displaying a distribution similar to a normal distribution. This suggests that Shrimp behavior is more uniform in downward markets, and most log ratios exceeding 0 indicate a tendency among Shrimp to increase their lock-up duration to alter their voting power.</p>\n<p>During upward trends, the scenario was notably more complex, as three peaks around -0.3, 0.5, and 1 indicate that Shrimp behavior is inconsistent during upward markets. However, most Shrimps preferred increasing their lock-up window, a tendency that was even more pronounced than during downward trends.</p>\n<p><strong>5.2.3 Polkadot:</strong> When analyzing Polkadot’s market trends, we observed a deviation from the typical pattern observed in Curve Finance. Instead of a normal distribution, there was a noticeable long tail in the data. Upon closer inspection, we discovered a fascinating insight: a particular group of Shrimp voters in Polkadot had a strong inclination towards raising their lock-up window rather than increasing their balance during bullish market conditions. This behavior was particularly prominent and suggestive of a unique pattern among this subset of voters.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/0/f08029351ce5b605f8ceb52b4074c5c8b7c9ef1c.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/f08029351ce5b605f8ceb52b4074c5c8b7c9ef1c\" title=\"dot_vp_accu\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/0/f08029351ce5b605f8ceb52b4074c5c8b7c9ef1c.png\" alt=\"dot_vp_accu\" data-base62-sha1=\"yjzaWvSxHzLDskkzXoayuwSc5PK\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" data-dominant-color=\"EAE9F2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-6-conclusion-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-6-conclusion-11\"></a>6. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The research focused on identifying key trends in voter behavior by examining voter personas, types of governance proposals, and patterns of voting power accumulation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is a noticeable correlation between financial incentives at the token lock-up level in Curve Finance and the absence of such incentives in Polkadot, which may directly affect voter turnout - relatively high in Curve Finance than in Polkadot.</li>\n<li>The analysis indicates that financial proposals, specifically Curve Finance- gauge proposals and Polkadot’s treasury proposals, constitute the majority of proposals in both systems and are central to all significant voting activities.</li>\n<li>The study defines and analyzes various voter personas and shows interesting patterns,  the most crucial of them being that Whales, Sharks, and Dolphins, prefer shorter lock-up periods, while the majority of low-staked holders, referred to as Shrimps, opt for longer lock-up durations.</li>\n<li>In Curve Finance, most voters choose the longest available lock-up period. This behavior contrasts sharply with that of Polkadot voters, underscoring the potential influence of financial incentives on long-term voter alignment with the protocol.</li>\n<li>A new methodology is introduced to analyze voter behavior under various market conditions. The results indicate that market trends significantly influence voter behavior. For instance, during market upswings, shrimps in both governance systems have differing preferences, utilizing both adjustments to their lock-up durations and increasing their token holdings to maximize voting power. During market downturns, on the other hand, there is a pronounced tendency among the shrimp voter group to extend their lock-up periods. While the sample size for other voter personas is too small to establish the above trends with confidence, similar tendencies could be seen in preliminary analysis of those sets as well.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This research contributes to our understanding of decentralized governance within blockchain ecosystems and aims to provide insights that could help in the design and optimization of governance mechanisms. Continued research in this field is vital to enhancing the scalability and effectiveness of decentralized decision-making as the blockchain landscape continues to evolve.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"references-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#references-12\"></a>References</h2>\n<p>[1]: Beck, Roman; Müller-Bloch, Christoph; and King, John Leslie (2018) “Governance in the Blockchain Economy: A Framework and Research Agenda,” Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 19(10),.<br>\n[2]: <a href=\"http://Etherscan.Io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Etherscan.Io</a>. n.d. “Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer.” Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer. <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://etherscan.io/</a>.<br>\n[3]: S.

We then dissect the dynamics of timing when the builder block reveals, focusing on altruistic, honest, and greedy rational builder rationale. The second half of the post highlights the greedy rational builder’s advantage in controlling the timing of the execution block reveal.

What about the execution block reveal window once its header is committed in the beacon block? The consensus spec indicates that the builder should reveal at <span class=\"math\">SlotDuration / 2</span>, but what is the execution block reveal window? Let’s first consider how early the builder could reveal its execution block once it’s “safe” to do so. The builder monitors the fork choice weight of the beacon block which commits to its header. If the weight is weak, the builder may choose to withhold the execution block by sending a withhold message. Assuming the message is seen by more than half of execution block committee, a withhold boost is granted and gives fork choice weight to the beacon block’s parent, which allows subsequent honest proposer and attesters to reorg the weak beacon block of the canonical view, so the builder has a way out of unconditional payment.</p>\n<p>To determine how much the fork weight is sufficient to reveal, consider the attack where the next slot’s proposer is malicious, and wants to reorg the builder’s execution block. We want the next slot’s attesters to recognize the builder’s execution block as head. This requires winning the following equation: assuming <span class=\"math\">X</span> represents the percentage of current slot attesters who voted for the beacon block, <span class=\"math\">1-X</span> is missing, and you want execution block’s <span class=\"math\">RevealBoost + X &gt; ProposerBoost + 1 - X</span> to be true. With <span class=\"math\">RevealBoost=40</span> and <span class=\"math\">ProposerBoost=20</span>, the builder should reveal when <span class=\"math\">X&gt;40</span>. This means over 40% of the current slot’s beacon committee members voted for the proposer’s beacon block for the builder to feel “safe” to reveal.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/f/ff126f5ba6a4bd8e4f2772ae860558a3469645ea.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/ff126f5ba6a4bd8e4f2772ae860558a3469645ea\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-25 at 11.22.47 AM\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/f/ff126f5ba6a4bd8e4f2772ae860558a3469645ea_2_690x234.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-25 at 11.22.47 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"AotfBJQ0Jw8tqaSYox7zC9u1Qi6\" width=\"690\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/f/ff126f5ba6a4bd8e4f2772ae860558a3469645ea_2_690x234.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/f/ff126f5ba6a4bd8e4f2772ae860558a3469645ea.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/f/ff126f5ba6a4bd8e4f2772ae860558a3469645ea.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E6E6E6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Note: <span class=\"math\">RevealBoost + X &gt; ProposerBoost + 1 - X</span> assumes the next slot’s proposer wants to reorg the current beacon block + execution block. This is a more powerful attack than just reorg the execution block itself because it gets <span class=\"math\">1-X</span> on its side due to (block, slot) voting.</p>\n<p>Now we have determined that the builder may feel safe to reveal the execution block as soon as it observes that more than 40% of beacon attesters have voted for the beacon block. We will refer to this  point as the <span class=\"math\">SafeRevealDeadline</span>. When is the latest point a builder can reveal? The latest point is the <span class=\"math\">PayloadAttestationDeadline</span>, which is when payload attestations vote on whether the execution block has revealed on time and valid. Thus, the builder’s reveal window spans from <span class=\"math\">SafeRevealDeadline</span> to <span class=\"math\">PayloadAttestationDeadline</span>.</p>\n<p>Note: Similar to the beacon proposer, the builder will consider P2P propagation time and the execution processing times of the execution block.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"execution-block-reveal-strategy-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#execution-block-reveal-strategy-8\"></a>Execution block reveal strategy</h3>\n<p>When modeling rational builder behaviors, consider that builders compete to submit the highest bids at <span class=\"math\">SlotStart</span> and that having more time to prepare the execution block incurs an advantage to pack a more profitable execution block. The starting time for building the next slot’s execution block depends on knowing the execution result of the current slot’s execution block. Builders can be categorized into two modes: the winning builder of the current slot and all other builders who did not win but want to win next slot. The winning builder can start building for the next slot as soon as its header is committed in the beacon block, while all others must wait until the current’s block is revealed.

Let’s examine the examples in a simple slot auction:</p>\n<p>In a simple slot auction, the beacon proposer selects the winning builder without committing to the execution outcome, they only commit to the future right of who can propose the execution block. Here, the beacon proposer timing game is no longer relevant. Under rational strategy, the proposer reveals the beacon block at <span class=\"math\">SlotStart</span>.

The winning builder may have a better valuation for the next slot, given its consistent view of the mempool but that may be irrelevant.</p>\n<p>In the execution ticket model, since the ticket selection occurs far in advance, the execution proposer assignments can be determined and known an epoch before, it becomes less practical to manipulate. To attempt gaming the system, one would need to purchase a lot of tickets at once, but these tickets might have to go through a pending queue before becoming eligible. The specific design details are to be determined.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"open-questions-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#open-questions-10\"></a>Open questions</h3>\n<p>The dominant strategy for the builder discussed above is purely speculative, there are many open questions to answer. One key question is how should the builder bid value correlates by having more time to prepare. How much of the bid value is based on more build time versus more private order flow? If most of the value comes from private order flow, it may be ok for the winning builder to have more time to build than everyone else. But to create a fair and competitive environment, it could be beneficial to define some baseline models that specifiy a minimal build time for all builders, ensuring some equal footings. Could there be incentives or enforcement mechanisms to ensure builders reveal their execution payload on time? One approach could be to make the <span class=\"math\">PayloadAttestationDeadline</span> random from the perspective of the payload timeliness committee, making it harder for the builder to game the reveal time. Another straightforward solution is to set the <span class=\"math\">PayloadAttestationDeadline</span> earlier, which requires consideration of several factors such as the propagation times for attestations and execution payloads, and the time needed to verify an execution payload. When a builder wins consecutive slots, such as slots n and n+1, does this provide a compounding advantage for winning subsequent slots like n+2, compared to winning only slot n+1? This aspect is currently unclear and requires more formalized analysis. Finally when a proposer commits to a builder’s block, could an execution state difference be shared and allow other builders to get the peak of the final state and allow other builders to start building on top without winning builder having to leak the payload? Gossiping the entire execution state is not feasible, but perhaps a cryptographic solution like Verkle trees or SNARKs could be used to communicate the state difference efficiently. However, it’s still uncertain whether this is fully safe and what second-order effects might arise.</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgment</strong>:<br>\nAlthough reviews cannot be viewed as an endorsements, I want to thank <a href=\"https://twitter.com/barnabemonnot\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Barnabe</a> for his feedback on typos and his suggestion to extend to the <code>n+1</code> slot.

It enables users to seamlessly employ AI models natively within smart contracts without being encumbered by the intricacies of underlying technologies.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#overview-3\"></a>Overview</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"ai-evm-enshrined-ai-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#ai-evm-enshrined-ai-4\"></a>AI EVM: Enshrined AI</h3>\n<p>To enable native ML inference in the smart contract, we need to modify the execution layer of the layer 2 chain. Specifically, we add a precompiled contract inference in EVM to build AI EVM.</p>\n<p>AI EVM will conduct the ML inference in native execution and then return deterministic execution results. When a user wants to use the AI model to process data, all the user needs to do is to call the precompiled contract inference with the model address and model input, and then the user can obtain the model output and use it natively in the smart contract.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-plaintext\">import \"./AILib.sol\";\n\ncontract AIContract {\n    ...\n    function inference(bytes32 model_address, bytes memory input_data, uint256 output_size) public {\n        bytes memory output = AILib.inference(model_address, input_data, output_size);\n        emit Inference(model_address, input_data, output_size, output);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The models are stored in the model data available (DA) layer. All the models can be retrieved from DA using the model address. We assume the data availability of all the models.</p>\n<p>The core design principle of the precompiled contract inference follows the design principles of opML, that is, we separate execution from proving. We provide two kinds of implementation of the precompiled contract inference. One is compiled for native execution, which is optimized for high speed. Another is compiled for the fraud proof VM, which helps prove the correctness of the opML results.</p>\n<p>For the implementation for execution, we re-use the ML engine in opML. We will first fetch the model using the model address from the model hub and then load the model into the ML engine. ML engine will take the user’s input in the precompiled contract as the model input and then execute the ML inference task. The ML engine guarantees the consistency and determinism of the ML inference results using quantization and soft float.</p>\n<p>Besides the current AI EVM design, an alternative approach to enable AI in EVM is adding more machine learning-specific opcodes into EVM, with corresponding changes to the virtual machine’s resource and pricing model as well as the implementation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"optimistic-rollup-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#optimistic-rollup-5\"></a>Optimistic Rollup</h3>\n<p>opML (Optimistic Machine Learning) and optimistic rollup (opRollup) are both based on a similar fraud-proof system, making it feasible to integrate opML into the Layer 2 (L2) chain alongside the opRollup system. This integration enables the seamless utilization of machine learning within smart contracts on the L2 chain.</p>\n<p>Just like the existing rollup systems, Axonum is responsible for “rolling up” transactions by batching them before publishing them to the L1 chain, usually through a network of sequencers. This mechanism could include thousands of transactions in a single rollup, increasing the throughput of the whole system of L1 and L2.</p>\n<p>Axonum, as one of the optimistic rollups, is an interactive scaling method for L1 blockchains. We optimistically assume that every proposed transaction is valid by default. Different from the traditional L2 optimistic rollup system, the transaction in Axonum can include AI model inferences, which can make the smart contracts on Axonum “smarter” with AI.</p>\n<p>In the case of mitigating potentially invalid transactions, like optimistic rollups, Axonum introduces a challenge period during which participants may challenge a suspect rollup. A fraud-proving scheme is in place to allow for several fraud proofs to be submitted. Those proofs could make the rollup valid or invalid. During the challenge period, state changes may be disputed, resolved, or included if no challenge is presented (and the required proofs are in place).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"workflow-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#workflow-6\"></a>Workflow</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/1/41403b199568fcf421dabd3b05c089511968469a.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/41403b199568fcf421dabd3b05c089511968469a\" title=\"workflow\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/1/41403b199568fcf421dabd3b05c089511968469a_2_690x405.png\" alt=\"workflow\" data-base62-sha1=\"9jeEgUnHp8B6gUDrtDfpsaLQAqK\" width=\"690\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/1/41403b199568fcf421dabd3b05c089511968469a_2_690x405.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/1/41403b199568fcf421dabd3b05c089511968469a_2_1035x607.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/1/41403b199568fcf421dabd3b05c089511968469a_2_1380x810.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F5F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Here’s the essential workflow of Axonum, without considering mechanisms such as pre-confirmation or force exit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The basic workflow begins with users sending L2 transactions (we allow native AI inference in the smart contract) to a batcher node, usually the sequencer.</li>\n<li>Once the sequencer receives a certain number of transactions, it will post them into an L1 smart contract as a batch.</li>\n<li>A validator node will read these transactions from the L1 smart contract and execute them on their local copy of the L2 state. As for the AI inference execution, the validator needs to download the model from model DA and conduct the AI inference within the opML engine.</li>\n<li>Once processed, a new L2 state is generated locally and the validator will post this new state root into an L1 smart contract. (Note that this validator can also be the sequencer.)</li>\n<li>Then, all other validators will process the same transactions on their local copies of the L2 state.</li>\n<li>They will compare their resultant L2 state root with the original one posted to the L1 smart contract.</li>\n<li>If one of the validators gets a different state root than the one posted to L1, they can begin a challenge on L1.</li>\n<li>The challenge will require the challenger and the validator who posted the original state root to take turns proving what the correct state root should be. This challenge process is also known as fraud proof. The fraud proof of Axonum includes the fraud proof of L2 state transition and the fraud proof of opML.</li>\n<li>Whichever user loses the challenge, gets their initial deposit (stake) slashed. If the original L2 state root posted was invalid, it will be destroyed by future validators and will not be included in the L2 chain.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"fraud-proof-design-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#fraud-proof-design-7\"></a>Fraud Proof Design</h2>\n<p>The core design principle of the fraud proof system of Axonum is that we separate the fraud proof process of Geth (the Golang implementation of the Ethereum client on layer 2) and the opML.

Geth focuses on transactional aspects, while opML handles ML-specific fraud proofs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Scalability:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The separation design allows for scalability, enabling each component to independently scale based on its specific processing requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This separation provides flexibility for upgrades and improvements in either the Geth or opML components without compromising the entire fraud proof system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"axonum-the-brain-of-ethereum-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#axonum-the-brain-of-ethereum-8\"></a>Axonum: The Brain of Ethereum</h2>\n<p>Axonum is the first AI optimistic rollup that enables AI on Ethereum natively, trustlessly, and verifiably.</p>\n<p>Axonum leverages optimistic ML and optimistic rollup and introduces innovations of AI EVM to add intelligence to Ethereum as a Layer 2.</p>\n<p>We enshrine AI into blockchain to build a decentralized supercomputer powered by global collective intelligence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn more about Axonum: <a href=\"https://docs.axonum.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.axonum.io</a><br>\nBridge to Axonum Sepolia: <a href=\"https://app.axonum.io/bridge/deposit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.axonum.io/bridge/deposit</a><br>\nAdd Axonum Sepolia to MetaMask: <a href=\"https://add.axonum.io/?network=testnet\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Add Axonum</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/enshrine-ai-into-evm/19418\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/enshrine-ai-into-evm/19418","pubDate":"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 05:57:57 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19418"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/enshrine-ai-into-evm/19418.rss","#text":"Enshrine AI into EVM"},"filter":false},{"title":"Enabling light node to verify a field element from its column in peer das","dc:creator":"Athos","category":"Sharding","description":"<p>When we finally implements 2D PeerDAS, blob data will be formatted into a data matrix, where each element (aka cell) of the matrix is an array of field elements, with 64 field elements in each array.
