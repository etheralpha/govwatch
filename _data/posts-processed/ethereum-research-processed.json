Our idea is pretty simple: Partition the block in such a way to keep a top-of-the-block (ToB)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#footnote-48655-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-48655-1\">[1]</a></sup>, high-priority section, in which traditional builders do their usual thing and is allocated through a traditional mev-boost auction or whatever the relay running it prefers; and a reserved bottom-of-the-block (BoB) section, which will serve as allocation space for preconfirmations. In this design, preconfirmation bundles will be allocated via a separate auction in the form of <strong><em>forward contracts</em></strong>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"a-two-auction-format-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#a-two-auction-format-4\"></a><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/busts_in_silhouette.png?v=12\" title=\":busts_in_silhouette:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":busts_in_silhouette:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> A Two-Auction Format</h3>\n<p>As briefly mentioned above, in the XGA-style split-block design, preconfirmations are allocated in a completely separate way from the traditional mev-boost auction, allowing them to coexist without excessively disrupting the ecosystem. Traditional builders will be able to do their own thing with minimal adjustments, while everyone else can still enjoy the benefits of preconfirmations.</p>\n<p>In simple terms: An XGA-style BoB auction is a multi-unit auction selling gas tokens for a specific block <span class=\"math\">B</span> in fixed-size units (e.g. <span class=\"math\">100</span> K gas).

For example, most of the preconf mechanisms currently being discussed are pretty unfriendly towards what has been one of the main APY-cows for validators since the dawn of mev-boost: competitive builder/searchers.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"why-are-we-betting-on-xga-style-preconfs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#why-are-we-betting-on-xga-style-preconfs-7\"></a><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/game_die.png?v=12\" title=\":game_die:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":game_die:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Why Are We Betting on XGA-Style Preconfs?</h4>\n<p>It seems clear to us that reserving a spot for non-priority-sensitive transactions can offer several benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users and platforms (e.g. rollups) that are not involved in competitive building/searching just doesn’t care about running HFT operations on L1 can greatly benefit from separating their concerns from those of competitive builder/searchers.</li>\n<li>On the other end, it eases some of the pressure on the competitive builder/searcher side by removing some of the burden of having to include <em>“filler transactions”</em> to keep their blocks competitive. E.g. freeing them from needing to include blob-bearing transactions that could negatively impact latency.</li>\n<li>It makes actually pricing inclusion preconfirmations simpler, since it is still regulated by the usual gas pricing model, and at the same time the preconf inclusion market is kept separate from the traditional priority market for position-sensitive transactions.</li>\n<li>Moreover, we believe in gradual change, allowing time for everyone to adapt to and observe the effects of new, potentially disruptive features in a controlled manner. A split-block design compatible with traditional mev-boost block building offers a less intrusive path to adoption.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"rethinking-relays-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#rethinking-relays-8\"></a><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/bulb.png?v=12\" title=\":bulb:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":bulb:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Rethinking Relays</h2>\n<p>At the moment running a relay naively is mostly a non remunerative gig. Under XGA-style preconfirmations, the relay does significantly more work and takes on more risk than before, e.g. if a block is missed and/or already sold preconfirmation tokens end up not getting included due to the relay malfunctioning, whoever bought them incurs an active loss of assets. While this sounds scary, it is also a good opportunity to rethink the role of relays in the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"insurance-and-reward-mechanisms-for-relays-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#insurance-and-reward-mechanisms-for-relays-9\"></a><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/shield.png?v=12\" title=\":shield:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":shield:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Insurance and Reward Mechanisms for Relays</h3>\n<p>What we are proposing is that a relay can subscribe to an XGA-style preconf platform by staking a collateral that could be used to offer the damaged parties a refund in case of the relay malfunctioning, while sharing a percentage of the platform revenue each time it submits a successful block that includes XGA-enabled preconfirmations<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#footnote-48655-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-48655-3\">[3]</a></sup>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"introducing-xga-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#introducing-xga-10\"></a><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/mega.png?v=12\" title=\":mega:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":mega:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Introducing XGA</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/4/448bd42d21b7642cd38d003f7cec9cb82adfc3b6.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/448bd42d21b7642cd38d003f7cec9cb82adfc3b6\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/4/448bd42d21b7642cd38d003f7cec9cb82adfc3b6_2_690x99.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"9Mo35AM8nSixIAAxYZf9Vtws6Tc\" width=\"690\" height=\"99\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/4/448bd42d21b7642cd38d003f7cec9cb82adfc3b6_2_690x99.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/4/448bd42d21b7642cd38d003f7cec9cb82adfc3b6_2_1035x148.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/4/448bd42d21b7642cd38d003f7cec9cb82adfc3b6_2_1380x198.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F8F7\"></a></div><br>\nXGA – eXtensible Gas Auctions – is the first L2 platform for XGA-style preconfirmations (lol), designed and built by the combined efforts of <a href=\"https://www.manifoldfinance.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Manifold Finance</a> and <a href=\"https://20squares.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">20Squares</a>.

In blockchain, Chain IDs are unique identifiers for different networks (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet has Chain ID 1, while various testnets have different IDs).

Given the current 6 blob per block capacity and 6 blobs per block, there are 11 possible combinations.</p>\n<p><strong>Occurrences of each number:</strong><br>\n1: 19<br>\n2: 8<br>\n3: 4<br>\n4: 2<br>\n5: 1<br>\n6: 1</p>\n<p>A trivial observation is that there is only one combination in which a block can fit 5 or 6 blobs. Since 4 out of 10 rollups submit these 5 and 6 blob transactions, there will only be one winner. Additionally, a single 1-blob transaction can “censor” a 6-blob transaction for an entire slot by being accepted first.</p>\n<p>The combinatorics of the current blob market size suggest that the small size itself is causing higher slot inclusion problems, rather than blob censorship latency. This indicates that censorship is not from builders but from competition among blob users.</p>\n<p>This raises an important question: what is the optimal maximum number of blobs allowed in a block relative to the maximum number that can fit in a block? Would the combinatorics be more favorable if the maximum blob size were 3 instead of 6? Would it be better to allow 9 blobs per block instead of 8? There is an economic incentive to group blobs as large as possible to save on costs, which disproportionately favors larger rollups over smaller ones until blob sharing becomes feasible.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"bidding-strategies-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#bidding-strategies-6\"></a>Bidding Strategies</h2>\n<p>Currently, blobs use static bidding strategies, generally resubmitting their blobs if their bids sit in the mempool for too long. This shows a certain level of insensitivity to slot inclusion for each rollup. If a blob is delayed for 100 slots, there seem to be no consequences or incentives to increase slot inclusion rates at this time.</p>\n<p>The two charts below show sample bidding strategies used by Base and Taiko, just two examples of the rollup strategies available on the dashboard. Base averages a priority fee of 4.5 gwei, while Taiko averages 2.9 gwei. There is no correlation between priority bids and base fee fluctuations.</p>\n<p><strong>base:</strong><br>\n<img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/8/7/8785ccb0b147a318d6426a694bf7697d3f1a5383.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"jkT7BVrCBp1A1a796bRfQpIBCcb\" width=\"501\" height=\"336\"></p>\n<p><strong>taiko:</strong><br>\n<img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/9/1/91bab571ac6836399edf78b7c7ce757ad62cf2ed.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"kNbfNQ1fogFklcVZEFN0u6slojr\" width=\"501\" height=\"336\"></p>\n<p>Resubmitting blobs through the mempool is expensive and generally not recommended as a good practice. This creates the problem of how blob producers can become more competitive in their bidding strategies if they need to make their slot inclusion rates more efficient.</p>\n<p>One solution is to use preconfirmations. For example, using a protocol such as mev-commit to attach preconf bids to blob transactions would allow rollups to dynamically adjust their bids without having to resubmit blobs into the mempool. A stronger solution would be <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/blob-preconfirmations-with-inclusion-lists-to-mitigate-blob-contention-and-censorship/19150\">to receive preconfirmations from proposers</a> to guarantee that builders wouldn’t be able to censor blobs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#conclusion-7\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Analysis of slot inclusion rates and blob market combinatorics reveals a complex interplay between efficient slot inclusion, competition, and potential censorship. While current data suggests that high slot inclusion rates are primarily driven by competition among blob users, there remain several unanswered questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the optimal maximum number of blobs per block to balance efficiency and fairness?</li>\n<li>How can blob producers develop more competitive bidding strategies?</li>\n<li>Could the implementation of dynamic bidding strategies or preconfirmations significantly reduce slot inclusion times?</li>\n<li>What long-term effects might increased competition and potential latency censorship have on the blob market?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The combinatorics of the blob market are a fundamental factor affecting slot inclusion efficiency and cost. By understanding and optimizing these combinatorial constraints, it is possible to enhance market dynamics, reduce costs, and improve transaction efficiency for all participants. Further research and experimentation are needed to address these questions and optimize the blob market for all participants.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/slot-inclusion-rates-and-blob-market-combinatorics/19817\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/slot-inclusion-rates-and-blob-market-combinatorics/19817","pubDate":"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 16:47:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19817"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/slot-inclusion-rates-and-blob-market-combinatorics/19817.rss","#text":"Slot Inclusion Rates and Blob Market Combinatorics"},"filter":false},{"title":"A simple, small, mev-boost compatible preconfirmation idea","dc:creator":"FabrizioRomanoGenove","category":"Layer 2","description":"<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This post will not contain any nice images, because I am artistically inept.</p>\n<p>The reasons why I’m writing this are the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Preconfs are a very hot topic right now and many people are working on them;</li>\n<li>As usual, some of the proposed solutions advocate for punching changes all the way into the main Ethereum protocol. I’m personally not a fan of this, since life is already full of <em>oh my God, what have I done?™</em> moments and <em>more drama™</em> is the least thing everyone probably needs.</li>\n<li>MEV-boost is probably the <em>only</em> thing this community has really almost universally agreed upon since MEV has been a thing. So I’d very much try to preserve backwards-compatibility with MEV-boost and generalize on this than coming up with more innovative ways to balkanize our ecosystem even further.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"a-primer-on-mev-boost-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#a-primer-on-mev-boost-1\"></a>A primer on MEV-boost</h2>\n<p>This section exists just so that everyone is on the same page. Feel free to skip it or to insult me if you think I summarised things stupidly.</p>\n<p>In layman terms, MEV-boost works like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Proposer polls the relayer(s) for their best blocks;</li>\n<li>Relayer(s) send their best block headers to proposer;</li>\n<li>Proposer picks the best block by comparing the block headers received and the block built in-house.</li>\n<li>For an in-house block, proposer just signs and broadcasts. For a mev-boost block, proposer signs the header. Relay will broadcast the complete block revealing the payload.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This mechanism is nice because the only party that builders have to trust is relayer: Proposer cannot unbundle blocks and scam builders.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-actual-idea-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#the-actual-idea-2\"></a>The actual idea</h2>\n<p>The idea I have in mind works towards extending mev-boost by allowing for preconfs (and most likely for a lot of other stuff if one wants to). Notably, it does not change points 2,3,4 in the previous section, but only point 1.</p>\n<p>Suppose proposer has a stash of preconfed txs on the side. The only thing the idea assumes is the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the time Proposer starts polling, it needs to have a finalized lists of preconfed txs to include.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reason for this will become clear shortly. Having this list at hand, proposer sends a signed JSON object to the relayer when it polls, containing the preconfed txs. This object could look, for instance, like this:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"JSON\"><code class=\"lang-JSON\">{\n    proposer: address,\n    slotNumber: int,\n    gasUsed: int,\n    blobsUsed: int.\n    mergingPolicy: int,\n    mustBeginWith: txBundle,\n    mustContain: txBundle,\n    mustOmit: txBundle,\n    mustEndWith: txBundle,\n    otherStuff: JSON,\n    signature : signature\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>This design is just an idea. It is by no means fixed yet and most likely can be improved upon both in conceptual and performance terms, so take it with a grain of salt.</strong><br>\nThe fields <code>proposer</code> and <code>slotNumber</code> are obvious. The fields <code>mergingPolicy</code>, <code>mustBeginWith</code>, <code>mustContain</code>, <code>mustOmit</code>, <code>mustEndWith</code> can all be empty: They contain bundles of transactions that must (or must not) be included in the block. These fields are, effectively, the ones that proposer can use to signal relayer that 'hey, I need the block to respect these requirements, because of previous agreement I made with other parties.\"</p>\n<p>How the proposer comes to define this json object is not our concern, and is outside of the scope of this idea. Just for the sake of clarity though, let’s consider some examples: For instance, <a href=\"https://docs.xga.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">XGA</a>, one of the projects <code>20[ ]</code> is contributing to, provides preconfs as tokenized bottom-of-block space. As such, XGA-style preconfs will produce objects where only <code>mustEndWith</code> is not empty.</p>\n<p>The fields <code>gasUsed</code> and <code>blobsUsed</code> tell the relay how much gas and blobs the ‘preconf space’ already claimed. <code>otherStuff</code> exists to be able to extend this standard in the future without <em>more drama™</em>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"merging-policies-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#merging-policies-3\"></a>Merging policies</h3>\n<p>The <code>mergingPolicy</code> fields instructs the relay about how to deal with all this information. This is fundamental because, in the end, the relay will still run a traditional mev-boost auction for the remaining blockspace. As soon as a block is built by more than one party there’s a risk that different parties may step up on each other’s toes. As such, <code>mergingPolicy</code> serves as a well-defined conflict resolution policy. If you need a mental reference, think about git conflicts and automated ways to solve them if you so like.</p>\n<p>How to define merging policies is up for debate. The community could agree on a common repository where merging policies are defined, voted and agreed upon, and where merging algos are explicitly provided. So, for instance, one merging policy could be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the payload coming from the builder contains a transaction that also appears in the preconf bundle, deal with it in the following way:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As said above, XGA sells BOB as preconfs, and leaves TOB open for traditional mev-boost auctions. As such, it has already defined and implemented a merging policy for its bottom of the block case, which will hopefully be open sourced soon.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-does-the-relay-do-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#what-does-the-relay-do-4\"></a>What does the relay do?</h3>\n<p>This is probably already kinda clear at this point, but to make it explicit: The relay receives this signed JSON object when the proposer polls. What should it do with it? First of all, it should make some of these fields public to the builders, such as <code>mergingPolicy</code>, <code>gasUsed</code>, <code>blobsUsed</code> and <code>mustOmit</code>. This way builders will know what they can build.</p>\n<p>When a block from a builder is received, the relayer will <strong>unbundle</strong> the block and apply the merging policy to merge it with the preconfed txs. The <strong>relay</strong> will sign the block header, and send it to the proposer.</p>\n<p>From the POV of a builder, everything is kinda the same. They create their block using the info provided by the relay (in the simplest case this just means using slightly less gas than limit), and submit it as their bid.</p>\n<p>From this point on, everything works as in traditional MEV-boost.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"analysis-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#analysis-5\"></a>Analysis</h2>\n<p>Ok, so let’s run a rapid analysis of this thing.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pros-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#pros-6\"></a>Pros</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Changes to MEV-boost proper are really minimal. We just need to define an API that MEV-boost must listen to to build the polling payload, and redefine the polling logic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Very little work from Proposer’s side. More work may be needed depending on the preconf system a given proposer wants to use, but then again this is out of the scope of this idea.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Very little work from builder’s side unless people go overly crazy with merging policies. I do not think this is necessarily a problem tho as an overly deranged merging policy would result in builders not submitting anything, and most likely in relayers not taking bets in the first place. So I’d bet that this could pretty much evolve as a ‘let the markets decide’ thing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This idea is straightforwardly backwads-compatible with traditional MEV-boost: If the polling payload is empty, we collapse to a traditional MEV-boost auction with no other requisites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This idea allows for gradual phasing out of MEV-boost if the community so decides. For instance, proposers may agree to produce bundles where <code>usedGas</code> is a very low parameter in the beginning (it won’t exceed 5M for XGA, for instance), meaning that the majority of blockspace would come from traditional building, with only a tiny part being preconfs or more generally ‘other stuff’. This parameter may then be increasingly crancked up or varied with time if the community so decides, effectively phasing out traditional block building in favor of ‘something else’. In this respect yes, I know I’m being vague here but when it comes to how this thing could be adopted I can only speculate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This system can be extended in many ways, and it is flexible. Merging policies could be defined democratically, and the polling info could be extended effectively implementing something akin to PEPSI, for instance. Another possible extension/evolution can be using <code>otherStuff</code> to define Jito-style auctions. I mean, there’s really a plethora of ways to go from here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The polling payload is signed by the proposer, and the block header is signed by the relayer. This keeps both parties in check as we accumulate evidence for slashing both. For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine I get some preconf guarantee from proposer and that I have evidence of this. Again how this happens is outside of the scope of this post, as this mechanism is agnostic wrt how preconfs are negotiated.</li>\n<li>Now suppose furthermore than my preconfed tx does <strong>not</strong> land in the block.</li>\n<li>I can use the chain of signed objects to challenge both relayer and proposer. If my tx wasn’t in the polling info signed by proposer, that’s proposer’s fault. On the other hand, if it was, but it wasn’t in the block, then it’s relayer’s fault. I think this is enough to build a slashing mechanism of sorts, which could for instance leverage some already available restaking solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there’s enough interest in this idea, we as 20[  ] can throw some open games at it and simulate the various scenarios. Let me know!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ethereum protocol doesn’t see any of this.</strong> So if it fucks up, we just call it a day and retire in good order without having caused the apocalypse: Relays will only accept empty payloads, proposers will only send empty payloads, and we’ll essentially revert to mev-boost without anyone having to downgrade their infra. I think this is the main selling point of this idea: The amount of ways to make stuff explode in mev-related infraland are countless, so this whole idea was built with a ‘it has to be failsafe’ idea in mind.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"cons-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#cons-7\"></a>Cons</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Relayer must unbundle builder blocks to do the merging. I do not think this creates a huge trust issue as relayer can already do this as of now: In general, a relayer that scams builders is a relayer that won’t be used again, and will go out of business quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Relayer must do computational work. This is probably the major pain point. This idea entails slightly more latency, as an incoming bid cannot be relayed instantly because <code>mergingPolicy</code> has to be applied. The computational penalty is furthermore heavily dependent on how deranged the merging policy is. As a silver lining, this computational work is <em>provable</em> as both the merging info and the resulting block are signed. The result is that we have <strong>provable evidence to remunerate a relay for its work if we want to</strong>, possibly solving a major pain point for relayers in traditional mev-boost.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Relayer is slashable if it screws up. Again, how this should be implemented is outside of the scope of this idea as this mechanism only accounts for the needed trail of evidence to implement slashing, but does not deal with the slashing per sé. Anyway, it is still worth reasoning on the possible consequences of this: If slashing policies are implemented, Relayers will most likely need to provide some collateral or implement some form of captive insurance. Again, this may signify more complexity on one hand but also opportunity on the other, as relayers may for instance decide to tokenize said collateral and develop mechanisms to make money out of these newly created financial instruments. As relayers are private enterprises I’ll leave these considerations to the interested parties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Polling info must stay fixed</strong>. This is related to point 3 above and point 6 of the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#pros\">Pros</a> subsection: If the polling info changes all the time, this means huge computational stress for the relayer, and it furthermore allows for malicious behavior from the proposer: For instance, a proposer could send two different polling payloads, and include a given preconfed tx only in one of them. How to resolve these inconsistencies is an open question. In my opinion, the wisest and simplest thing to do would be requiring the polling info to be fixed, meaning that if proposer signs conflicting payloads for the same slot this should be considered akin to equivocation, and thus a slashable offence.</p>\n<p>By the way, the consequence of this is that the idea proposed here necessarily excludes some preconf use cases. This is related to my comment <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/strawmanning-based-preconfirmations/19695/2\">here</a> and I think it is unavoidable if we want to keep MEV-boost around. As the majority  of revenue from MEV comes precisely from the bids of very refined, high-time frame searchers, and as I am quite sure that validators don’t want to give this money up at least for now, ‘leaving these players be’ by ruling out such preconf use-cases is in my opinion the most practical option, and exactly the rationale motivating this idea.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"closing-remarks-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#closing-remarks-8\"></a>Closing remarks</h2>\n<p>That’s it.

Currently, the best idea for them is to have an actor that is from a set that is likely to be highly decentralized (eg. consensus block proposers) generate the list. This authority is decoupled from the right to <em>order</em> (or <em>prepend</em>) transactions, which is an inherently economies-of-scale-demanding and so likely to be highly concentrated in practice.</p>\n<p>But what if we could avoid putting the responsibility onto a <em>single</em> actor, and instead put it on a <em>large set of actors</em>? In fact, we can even do it in such a way that it’s semi-deniable: from each attester’s contribution, there is no clear evidence of which transaction they included, because one individual piece of provided data could come from multiple possible transactions.</p>\n<p>This post proposes a possible way to do this.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"mechanism-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#mechanism-1\"></a>Mechanism</h3>\n<p>When the block for slot N is published, let <code>seed</code> be the RANDAO_REVEAL of the block. Suppose for convenience that each transaction is under <code>T</code> bytes (eg. <code>T = 500</code>); we can say in this initial proposal that larger transactions are not supported. We put all attesters for that slot into groups of size <code>2 * T</code>, with <code>k = attesters_per_slot / (2 * T)</code> groups.</p>\n<p>Each attester is chosen to be the j’th attester of the i’th group. They identify the highest-priority-fee-paying valid transaction which was published before the slot N block, and where <code>hash(seed + tx)</code> is between <code>2**256 / k * i</code> and <code>2**256 / k * (i+1)</code>. They erasure-code that transaction to <code>2T</code> bits, and publish the j’th bit of the erasure encoding as part of their attestation.</p>\n<p>When those attestations are included in the next block, an algorithm such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlekamp%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm\">Berlekamp-Welch</a> is used to try to extract the transaction from the provided attester bits.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/e/deedccb04e5bb133ccacdbe2c2c17d1e5abdc3ce.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/deedccb04e5bb133ccacdbe2c2c17d1e5abdc3ce\" title=\"attester_inclusion_list.drawio\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/e/deedccb04e5bb133ccacdbe2c2c17d1e5abdc3ce_2_690x271.png\" alt=\"attester_inclusion_list.drawio\" data-base62-sha1=\"vO7tRuHbTGDsKip5ajhg58TZP9c\" width=\"690\" height=\"271\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/e/deedccb04e5bb133ccacdbe2c2c17d1e5abdc3ce_2_690x271.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/e/deedccb04e5bb133ccacdbe2c2c17d1e5abdc3ce.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/e/deedccb04e5bb133ccacdbe2c2c17d1e5abdc3ce.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F2F4F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Reed-Solomon decoding will fail in two cases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If too many attesters are dishonest</li>\n<li>If attesters have different views about whether a particular transaction was published before or after the block, and so they are split between providing bits for two or more different transactions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that in case (2), if the transactions are sufficiently small, advanced <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~venkatg/teaching/codingtheory/notes/notes10.pdf\">list decoding algorithms</a> may nevertheless be able to recover several or all of the transactions!</p>\n<p>The next block proposer will be able to see which transactions the attestations imply, and so they will be able to block transactions from the list by selectively failing to include attestations. This is an unavoidable limitation of the scheme, though it can be mitigated by having a fork choice rule discount blocks that fail to include enough attestations.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the mechanism can be modified so that if a transaction has not been included for 2+ slots, <em>all</em> attesters (or a large fraction thereof) attempt to include it, and so any block that fails to include the transaction would lose the fork choice. One simple way to do this is to score transactions not by <code>priority_fee</code>, but by <code>priority_fee * time_seen</code>, and at the same time have a rule that a transaction that has been seen for <code>k</code> slots is a candidate not just for attester group <code>i</code>, but also for attester group <code>i...i+k-1</code> (wrapping around if needed).</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/one-bit-per-attester-inclusion-lists/19797\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/one-bit-per-attester-inclusion-lists/19797","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Jun 2024 09:33:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19797"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/one-bit-per-attester-inclusion-lists/19797.rss","#text":"One-bit-per-attester inclusion lists"},"filter":false},{"title":"Torrents and EIP-4444","dc:creator":"parithosh","category":"Execution Layer Research","description":"<h1><a name=\"torrents-and-eip-4444-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#torrents-and-eip-4444-1\"></a>Torrents and EIP-4444</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h3>\n<p>EIP-4444 aims to limit the historical data that Ethereum nodes need to store. This EIP has two main problems that require solutions: Format for history archival and Methods to reliably retrieve history. The client teams have agreed on a common <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/era-archival-files-for-block-and-consensus-data/13526\">era files</a> format, solving one half of the problem. The second half of the problem, i.e Method to reliably retrieve history will likely not rely on a single solution. Some client teams may rely on the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networking-layer/portal-network/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Portal network</a>, some rely on torrents, others might rely on some form of snapshot storage.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"torrents-for-eip-4444-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#torrents-for-eip-4444-3\"></a>Torrents for EIP-4444</h3>\n<p>Torrents offer us a unique way to distribute this history, torrents as a technology have existed since 2001 and have withstood the test of time. Some client teams, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Erigon</a> already include a method to sync via torrents that has run in production systems.</p>\n<p>In order to make some progress on the Torrent approach of history retrieval, the files would first be required. So an era file export was made on a <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">geth</a> running version <code>v1.14.3</code> . To explore the initial idea, the torrent approach chose pre-merge data as a target. The merge occurred at block height <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/15537393\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">15537393</a>, meaning all pre-merge data could be archived by choosing a range of 0 to block 15537393. The era files were then created using the command <code> geth --datadir=/data export-history /data/erafiles 0 15537393</code>.</p>\n<p>Once the era files were created, they were verified using the command <code>era verify roots.txt</code>, with the source of the <code>roots.txt</code> file being <a href=\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lightclient/528b95ffe434ac7dcbca57bff6dd5bd1/raw/fd660cfedb65cd8f133b510c442287dc8a71660f/roots.txt\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this</a>. The entire process has been outlined in <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26621#issuecomment-1434023464\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this PR comment</a>. The verification output was found to be this log message: <code>Verifying Era1 files             verified=1896,  elapsed=5h21m49.184s</code></p>\n<p>The output era files were then uploaded onto a server and a torrent was created using the software <code>mktorrent</code>. An updated list of trackers was found using the github repo <a href=\"https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">trackerslist</a>. The trackers chosen were a mix of http/https/udp in order to allow for maximal compatibility. The chunk size of the torrent was chosen to be 64MB, which was the max allowed and recommended value for a torrent of this size.</p>\n<p>The result of this process is now a torrent of size 427GB. This torrent can be imported with <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch\">this magnet link</a>  and a torrent client would be able to pull the entire pre-merge history as era files.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"tradeoffs-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#tradeoffs-4\"></a>Tradeoffs</h4>\n<p>There are of course some tradeoffs with torrents, as with many of the other EIP-4444 approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Torrents rely on a robust set of peers to share the data, there is however no way to incentivise or ensure that this data is served by peers</li>\n<li>A torrent client would need to be included in the client releases and some client languages might not have a torrent library</li>\n<li>Torrents would de-facto expect the nodes to also seed the content they leech, this would increase node network requirements if they choose to store history</li>\n<li>The JSON-RPC response needs to take into account that it may not have the data to return a response in case the user decides to not download pre-merge data</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>A client could potentially include this torrent into their releases and avoid syncing pre-merge data by default, which could then be fetched via torrent if a user requests it (perhaps with a flag similar to <code>--preMergeData=True</code>). The client could also hardcode the hash of the expected data, ensuring that the data retrieved matches what they expect.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"instructions-for-re-creating-torrent-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#instructions-for-re-creating-torrent-6\"></a>Instructions for re-creating torrent:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sync a geth node using the latest release</li>\n<li>Stop the geth node and run <code>geth --datadir=/data export-history /data/erafiles 0 15537393</code> to export the data in a folder called <code>data/erafiles</code>(Warning, this will use ~427GB of additional space)</li>\n<li>Use the <code>mktorrent</code> tool or the <code>rutorrent</code> GUI to create a torrent.

Due to the practice of writing an FHE application, the key is globally used by all users to encrypt the data they send to the FHE server, which will execute under an encryption state. Thus, the whole security of the system relies on the security of the MPC network, and as we all know the truths of the MPC network are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The more nodes you have, the more latency you get</li>\n<li>The fewer nodes you have, the more trust assumptions you need</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"tee-as-a-2fa-to-mpc-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#tee-as-a-2fa-to-mpc-2\"></a>TEE as a 2FA to MPC</h2>\n<p>We don’t want to give full trust to MPC nodes because of the possibility of collusion if it is run by humans.

One can invalidate a PER by sending it to a preconfer with higher priority.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"fair-exchange-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#fair-exchange-2\"></a>Fair Exchange?</h1>\n<p>The fair exchange problem can be summarized as two untrusted players blindly giving up something in hopes that the other party will do the same. The goal is to try to find a method to ensure that both will cooperate. In the context of preconfirmations, the requesting party (gateway) has no guarantee that their preconfirmation enforcement request (PER) will receive a signed commitment. The preconfer has every right to not return a commitment, hold onto the PER until the last second, and include it if profitable (pocketing the tip for free).</p>\n<h1><a name=\"solution-1-reputation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#solution-1-reputation-3\"></a>Solution 1: Reputation</h1>\n<p>One solution to this is by tracking reputation. More specifically, leveraging the promise of future PERs to incentivize preconfers to respond promptly via either commitments or non-commitments (slash-able promises to NOT include). The gateway can throttle or simply ignore preconfers if they misbehave.</p>\n<p>Reputation is a tried method and exists today in mev-boost relays (see <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-preconfirmation-sauna/19762\">Switchboard’s Sauna Appendix</a>). While this might work, it still requires certain economic conditions for security. If for whatever reason it becomes really profitable to behave dishonestly, the guarantees fall apart.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"can-we-do-better-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#can-we-do-better-4\"></a>Can we do better?</h1>\n<p>In an ideal scenario, without any limitations of technology, one would simply invalidate the PER if the preconfer takes too long to respond. With blockchains, this is complicated, and time-based approaches require some sort of additional consensus, breaking the based paradigm. However, we can indirectly access “time” by using order. Blocks are ordered, so preconfers can be as well. If we take advantage of this, we arrive at a new solution that avoids the Fair Exchange problem altogether.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"solution-2-last-right-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#solution-2-last-right-5\"></a>Solution 2: Last Right</h1>\n<p>Determine an order for preconfers. This can be done per block (or even intra-block). Send the PER optimistically to the first preconfer. If they commit, then great. If they return a non-commitment, or do not respond, then send the PER to the next preconfer.</p>\n<p>But wait, they can still include my PER and pocket my tip! Yes, they can but they won’t be able to keep the tip. This is due to the central idea of this solution: <strong>the last preconfer to include the PER has the right to the tips</strong>. If two preconfers attempt to include the PER, the second preconfer has the right to the preconf tip. For example, the last preconfer submits a proof and transfers the PER tip to their balance. Other mechanisms are also possible and should be explored.</p>\n<p>One consideration here is the cost. If claiming the tip is more expensive than the tip itself, then the model falls apart. The good news is this cost is directly tied to the technology and should decrease exponentially (e.g. zk proof). Preconfirmation tips on the other hand are tied to the value of the transaction itself, which is not as dependent on the tech. So perhaps this mechanism will become more and more economically favorable.</p>\n<p>One great side effect of this method is that it preserves the possibility of execution promises. If the first preconfer acts honestly, then it can guarantee the execution state for the PER. Execution guarantees fall apart if there’s any dishonesty (same as Solution 1).</p>\n<h1><a name=\"solution-3-first-right-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#solution-3-first-right-6\"></a>Solution 3: First Right</h1>\n<p>If we are willing to forgo execution promises, then the gateway can instead request commitments from preconfers in reverse order. Forward the PER to a preconfer down the list, and then move up until one commits. <strong>The first preconfer to include the PER gets the tip.</strong> In the case where L1 proposers are preconfers, this is enforced by the L1 replay protection. This is a much simpler version of Solution 2.</p>\n<p>One downside is the “real” latency before the transaction is actually included since the default preconfer is not the current one. But one could argue that for important transactions where L1 settlement is important (e.g. buying a house), preconfirmations in general are probably not a priority.</p>\n<p>Note that execution promises are technically still possible if all the state transitions up to the point of inclusion has already been determined. (e.g. All block space has already been filled by PERs or similar.)</p>\n<h1><a name=\"final-thoughts-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#final-thoughts-7\"></a>Final Thoughts</h1>\n<p>We can even perhaps use these Solutions in tandem. For smaller preconf tips, we can rely on Solution 1, let the first preconfer pocket it and “slash” their reputation. For larger preconf tips, we can fallback to Solution 2 and let the next preconfer steal it back. Or just use them at the same time.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <span class=\"mention\">@mteam</span> for getting me up to speed and providing feedback.

This work is accepted at DSN2024.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The inactivity leak is intrinsically problematic for the safety of the protocol. It favors the constant finalization of blocks (<em>liveness</em>) at the expense of having conflicting finalized blocks (<em>safety</em>).</li>\n<li>The presence of Byzantine validators -validators that deviate from the protocol- can accelerate the loss of safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>The Ethereum PoS blockchain strives for the continuous growth of the finalized chain. In consequence, the protocol incentivizes validators to finalize blocks actively. The inactivity leak is the mechanism used to regain finality. Specifically, the inactivity leak is initiated if a chain has not undergone finalization for four consecutive epochs. The inactivity leak happened for the first time on the mainnet in May 2023.</p>\n<p>A good introduction to the inactivity leak is available thanks to the excellent work of Ben Eddington <a href=\"https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/inactivity/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a> (which motivated this work). We formalize the inactivity leak starting by the inactivity score.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"inactivity-score-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#inactivity-score-2\"></a>Inactivity Score</h2>\n<p>During an inactivity leak, at epoch <span class=\"math\">t</span>, the inactivity score, <span class=\"math\">I_i(t)</span>, of validator <span class=\"math\">i</span> is:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\n\\begin{cases}\n        I_i(t) = I_i(t-1)+4, \\text{if $i$ is inactive at epoch $t$} \\\\\n        I_i(t) = \\max(I_i(t-1)-1, 0), \\text{ otherwise.}\n    \\end{cases}\n</div>\n<p>Thus, a validator’s inactivity score increases by <span class=\"math\">4</span> if it is inactive and decreases by <span class=\"math\">1</span> if it is active. The inactivity score is always positive and will be used to penalize validators during the inactivity leak.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"inactivity-penalties-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#inactivity-penalties-3\"></a>Inactivity Penalties</h2>\n<p>Let <span class=\"math\">s_i(t)</span> represent the stake of validator <span class=\"math\">i</span> at epoch <span class=\"math\">t</span>, and let <span class=\"math\">I_i(t)</span> denote its inactivity score. The penalty at each epoch <span class=\"math\">t</span> is <span class=\"math\">I_i(t-1)\\cdot s_i(t-1)/2^{26}</span>. Therefore, the evolution of the stake is expressed by:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\ns_i(t)=s_i(t-1)-\\frac{I_i(t-1)\\cdot s_i(t-1)}{2^{26}}. \n</div>\n<h2><a name=\"stake-during-the-inactivity-leak-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#stake-during-the-inactivity-leak-4\"></a>Stake during the Inactivity Leak</h2>\n<p>In this work, we model the stake function <span class=\"math\">s</span> as a continuous and differentiable function, yielding the following differential equation:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\ns'(t)=-I(t)\\cdot s(t)/2^{26}.\n</div>\n<p>With this equation, we can determine a validator’s stake according to the time by fixing the evolution of its inactivity score. And that is exactly what we do. We define two types of behavior: Active and Inactive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Active validators: they are always active.</li>\n<li>Inactive validators: they are always inactive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Validators with these behaviors experience different evolutions in their inactivity scores: (a) Active validators have a constant inactivity score <span class=\"math\">I(t)=0</span>; (b) Inactive validators’ inactivity score increases by 4 every epoch, <span class=\"math\">I(t)=4t</span>. The stake of each type of validator during an inactivity leak:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Active validator’s stake: <span class=\"math\"> s(t) = s_0 = 32. </span></li>\n<li>Inactive validator’s stake: <span class=\"math\"> s(t) = s_0e^{-t^2/2^{25}}. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/9/496a7e5de461559b800a4d612eacb356a5f3cc84.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/496a7e5de461559b800a4d612eacb356a5f3cc84\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/9/496a7e5de461559b800a4d612eacb356a5f3cc84_2_685x500.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"att12R0B103OUE04m41aU0G5dVa\" width=\"685\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/9/496a7e5de461559b800a4d612eacb356a5f3cc84_2_685x500.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/9/496a7e5de461559b800a4d612eacb356a5f3cc84_2_1027x750.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/9/496a7e5de461559b800a4d612eacb356a5f3cc84_2_1370x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFAF9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The graph shows the evolution of the stake of validators depending on their activity during the inactivity leak.

This is an upper bound for Safety on the duration of the inactivity leak with only honest validators.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a name=\"detailed-analysis-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#detailed-analysis-8\"></a>Detailed Analysis</h3>\n<p>Let us analyze the scenario in which the validators (which are all honest) are partitioned in two. (We are in the asynchronous state according to our model).<br>\nThe partition will necessarily create a fork, each partition building on the only chain they see. The chains will finalize once the proportion of active validators returns to 2/3rd.</p>\n<p>In this case, by understanding the distribution of the validators across the partitions, we can compute the time it takes for the proportion of active validators’ stake to return to 2/3 of the stake on each branch, thus finalizing and breaking safety.</p>\n<p>For the analysis, we make the following notations. At the beginning of the inactivity leak:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"math\">n</span> is the total number of validators</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">n_B</span> is the total number of Byzantine validators</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">n_H</span> is the total number of honest validators</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">n_{H_1}</span> is the number of honest validators on branch 1</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">n_{H_2}</span> is the number of honest validators on branch 2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are no Byzantine validators for the first part of our analysis, which implies that <span class=\"math\">n=n_H</span>.

An extrapolation of this idea led, in one of the original designs for ILs, to propose that inclusion lists may essentially include a complete list of transactions the proposer has in its current mempool. One of the problems with these ideas is that the full list of transactions would need to be broadcast over the P2P network twice: once when the inclusion list is broadcast, and the second time within the payload itself. In all known designs for inclusion lists, validators attest for the existence of the full executable transaction list. This implies in particular that</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The list must be available at the beacon block validation time.</li>\n<li>The list must be executed at the beacon block validation time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This section is not meant to be read as <em>inclusion lists aren’t compatible with ePBS</em> but rather any preconfirmation system (and next block forced inclusion lists by definition are such a system) that relies on the execution and distribution of the transactions at the consensus block validation time, necessarily clashes with the main optimization from ePBS.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"epbs-validation-optimization-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#epbs-validation-optimization-2\"></a>ePBS validation optimization</h2>\n<p>The above two points are in direct opposition with the main optimization that ePBS brings to block processing, that is that the only hot path to validation is that of the consensus block that has to be fully verified before the attestation deadline. All other validations, like transaction execution, data availability, etc. are deferred to the remainder of the slot and into the next slot.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/8/f/8f3daa474ae131dfbee7c96cfd9f2a7e4035c06a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/8f3daa474ae131dfbee7c96cfd9f2a7e4035c06a\" title=\"ePBS slot\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/8/f/8f3daa474ae131dfbee7c96cfd9f2a7e4035c06a_2_690x364.jpeg\" alt=\"ePBS slot\" data-base62-sha1=\"kraovl1lfJNBvSrOxQ6y37JNNuW\" width=\"690\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/8/f/8f3daa474ae131dfbee7c96cfd9f2a7e4035c06a_2_690x364.jpeg, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/8/f/8f3daa474ae131dfbee7c96cfd9f2a7e4035c06a_2_1035x546.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/8/f/8f3daa474ae131dfbee7c96cfd9f2a7e4035c06a_2_1380x728.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF5F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>While ePBS is compatible with inclusion lists, their addition inherently stresses this optimization. Broadcasting a small list of 16 transactions that can be immediately executed in microseconds is not the same as broadcasting a full block, and presumably, even blob transactions as some based rollups would require.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-centralized-nature-of-preconfs-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#the-centralized-nature-of-preconfs-3\"></a>The centralized nature of preconfs</h2>\n<p>There is no current design (that I am aware of) of preconfirmations, that does not rely on a centralized entity. This is natural to expect in the absence of an encrypted public mempool, users can’t send their transactions in the open to the next proposer (although they could <em>encrypt the transactions to the public BLS address of the next proposer</em>), and we can’t enshrine an RPC provider, all systems thus make use on existing centralized entities (for example relays) to act as a preconfer. Decentralization comes in that it is ultimately the proposer who enforces these preconfirmations, by forcing the builder to fullfil them.</p>\n<p>Thus, in all proposed systems for preconfirmations, either of L1 transactions or for based rollups, there exist a centralized entity that at the very least is responsible for gathering the transactions and giving out the preconfirmations. Systems differ on how is that these preconfirmations are enforced, they range from new L1 slashing proposals, to restaking proposals (moving the slashing to a separate layer), etc. The point is that preconfirmations can be enforced by the protocol itself, or by a somewhat decentralized party like the subset of validators participating in the preconfirmation scheme. In summary, there is a plethora of options for enforcing the (or penalizing the lack of) inclusion of preconfirmations, in decreasing level of trustlessness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The L1 protocol itself enforces inclusion. For example, forced ILs, with proposer level slashings on missed slots, preconf equivocations, etc.</li>\n<li>Some separate committee enforces them. For example a subset of the L1 validators also participate in a sidechain by restaking, and the enforcement/punishment is carried in that sidechain.</li>\n<li>A centralized entity enforces them. For example the relay itself only sends bids from builders that have satisfied the required preconfs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"a-viable-way-compatible-with-epbs-staked-builders-as-preconfirmers-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#a-viable-way-compatible-with-epbs-staked-builders-as-preconfirmers-4\"></a>A viable way compatible with ePBS: staked builders as preconfirmers.</h2>\n<p>Any approach with a full payload being broadcast with the consensus block for preconfirmation enforcement clashes directly with the main scaling optimization of ePBS with regard to block validation. As thus, it seems difficult to expect a working design in which the proposers are in charge of sending and enforcing preconfirmations. The second and third approaches above are fully compatible with ePBS.</p>\n<p>One of the features that preconfirmation systems can leverage when ePBS is in place, is that builders themselves are staked validators, thus they can be subject to the same rules that these systems currently require from proposers. For example, those systems that rely on slashings on a restaking scheme could simply add conditions on participating builders. That is, the proposer set participating in the scheme only take bids from builders that are participants of the scheme. The builders and proposers are required to be restaked. There are new penalty conditions for</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A proposer that does not include a block.</li>\n<li>A proposer that includes a block with a commitment to a non-participating builder.</li>\n<li>A builder that does not include the payload</li>\n<li>A builder that includes a payload does not satisfies the preconf list.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"a-separate-note-on-restaking-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#a-separate-note-on-restaking-5\"></a>A separate note on restaking</h2>\n<p>ePBS also presents a challenge on any restaking scheme: builders can transfer funds in the same payload that they commit a slashable offense. L1 protocol can deal with this by immediately deducting the bid from the builder’s balance at the time of CL block processing, but delaying the credit to the proposer. In case the builder commits a slashable offense, the buffer allows the L1 protocol to implement penalization procedures that can impact those delayed funds accordingly. If the builder is restaked however, the restaking chain does not have access to these funds.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-contention-between-preconfs-and-epbs/19770\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-contention-between-preconfs-and-epbs/19770","pubDate":"Sun, 09 Jun 2024 07:59:33 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19770"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-contention-between-preconfs-and-epbs/19770.rss","#text":"The contention between preconfs and ePBS"},"filter":false},{"title":"On block-space distribution mechanisms","dc:creator":"mikeneuder","category":"Block proposer","description":"<h1><a name=\"on-block-space-distribution-mechanisms-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#on-block-space-distribution-mechanisms-1\"></a>On block-space distribution mechanisms</h1>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/c/3/c3fa4239ef0f468256ba44d0e860fb3d7edaedcf.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/c3fa4239ef0f468256ba44d0e860fb3d7edaedcf\" title=\"upload_3067440b5b4f752379ddba32df7ecf8b\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/3/c3fa4239ef0f468256ba44d0e860fb3d7edaedcf_2_499x500.jpeg\" alt=\"upload_3067440b5b4f752379ddba32df7ecf8b\" data-base62-sha1=\"rXHhzRegZZYL0qvOGMxv8ppT3v9\" width=\"499\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/3/c3fa4239ef0f468256ba44d0e860fb3d7edaedcf_2_499x500.jpeg, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/3/c3fa4239ef0f468256ba44d0e860fb3d7edaedcf_2_748x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/3/c3fa4239ef0f468256ba44d0e860fb3d7edaedcf_2_998x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"94AFB8\"></a></div><br>\n<sub><strong>^p.s. yes, we anthropomorphize the protocol as a ghost because <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Casper</a>.</strong></sub><br>\n<sub><strong>^^p.p.s. not sure why the auctioneer ghost looks like he is conducting an orchestra, but here we are ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.</strong></sub><br>\n<sub><strong>^^^ p.p.p.s. by the way, if you haven’t seen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maestro_(2023_film)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Maestro</a>, it’s great.</strong></sub><p></p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\cdot</span><br>\n<em>by <a href=\"https://x.com/mikeneuder\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mike</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/PGarimidi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pranav</a>, &amp; <a href=\"https://x.com/Tim_Roughgarden\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dr. Tim Roughgarden</a> – June 8, 2024.</em><br>\n<span class=\"math\">\\cdot</span><br>\n<strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br>\n<em>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://x.com/barnabemonnot\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Barnabé</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/_julianma\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Julian</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/_JonahB_\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Jonah</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/DavideCrapis\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Davide</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/soispoke\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Thomas</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/terencechain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Terence</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/potuz_eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Potuz</a>, &amp; <a href=\"https://www.nano210.blog/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Nate</a> for comments and discussions.</em><br>\n<span class=\"math\">\\cdot</span><br>\n<strong>tl;dr;</strong> <em>Block space, the capacity for transaction inclusion, is the principal resource exported by blockchains.

Proof-of-Stake protocols typically use some version of the following rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>block-space (proposing) rights</strong> – A random validator is elected as the leader and permitted to create the next block.</li>\n<li><strong>voting (attesting) rights</strong> – All validators vote during some time window for the block they see as the canonical head.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Validators perform these tasks because they receive rewards for doing so. We categorize the rewards according to their origin in either the consensus layer (the issuance from the protocol – e.g., newly minted <code>ETH</code>) or the execution layer (transaction fees and MEV):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Consensus layer</strong><br>\na. <em>Attestation rewards</em> – see <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/160764ac180eca2cea3581f731ee96ac7098f9f7/phase0/beacon-chain.md#components-of-attestation-deltas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">attestation deltas</a>.<br>\nb. <em>Block rewards</em> – see <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/160764ac180eca2cea3581f731ee96ac7098f9f7/phase0/beacon-chain.md#rewards-and-penalties-1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>get_proposer_reward</code></a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution layer</strong><br>\na. <em>Transaction fees</em> – see <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/gastracker\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gas tracker</a>.<br>\nb. <em>MEV (transaction ordering)</em> – see <a href=\"https://mevboost.pics/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">mevboost.pics</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rewards <code>1a</code>, <code>1b</code>, &amp; <code>2a</code> are well understood and “<a href=\"https://barnabe.substack.com/p/seeing-like-a-protocol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">in the view</a>” of the protocol. MEV rewards present a more serious challenge because fully capturing the value realized by transaction ordering is difficult. Unlike the other rewards, even the amount of MEV in a block is unknowable for all intents and purposes (as a permissionless and pseudonymous system, it’s impossible to trace who controls each account and any corresponding offchain activity that may be profitable in tandem). MEV also changes dramatically over time (e.g., as a function of price volatility), resulting in execution layer rewards having a much higher variance than the consensus layer rewards. Further, the Ethereum protocol, as implemented, has no insight into the MEV being produced and extracted by its transactions. To improve protocol visibility into MEV, many mechanisms try to approximate the MEV in a given block; we refer to these as <em>MEV oracles</em>. Block-space distribution mechanisms generally have the potential to produce such an oracle, making the protocol “MEV-aware.”</p>\n<p>This suggests the question, <em>why does the protocol care about being MEV-aware?</em> One answer: <strong>MEV awareness may increase the protocol’s ability to preserve the homogeneity of validator rewards, even if validators have varying degrees of sophistication.</strong> For example, if the protocol could accurately burn all MEV, then the validator incentives would be fully in the protocol’s view (just like <code>1a</code>, <code>1b</code>, &amp; <code>2a</code> above). Alternatively, a mechanism that shares all MEV among validators regardless of their sophistication (e.g., <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/committee-driven-mev-smoothing/10408\">mev-smoothing</a>) would seem to promote a larger, more diverse and decentralized validator set, while keeping the MEV rewards as an extra incentivization to stake. Without MEV awareness, the validators best equipped to extract or smooth MEV (e.g., due to relationships with block builders, proprietary algorithms/software, access to exclusive order flow, &amp; economies of scale) may earn disproportionately high rewards and exert significant centralization pressures on the protocol.</p>\n<p>Ethereum protocol design strives to keep a decentralized validator set at all costs. It probably goes without saying, but for completeness: <strong>the protocol’s credible neutrality, censorship resistance, and permissionlessness are directly downstream of a decentralized validator set.</strong></p>\n<h4><a name=\"block-space-distribution-today-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#block-space-distribution-today-5\"></a>Block-space distribution today</h4>\n<p>In Ethereum today, <a href=\"https://mevboost.pics/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>mev-boost</code></a> accounts for <span class=\"math\">\\approx 90\\%</span> of all blocks.

The figure below demonstrates this flow (we exclude the <a href=\"https://www.relayscan.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">relays</a> because they functionally serve as an extension of the builders).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/7/b70bdfef2fd8dc26a478c2b870495ea39ebd07bc.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/b70bdfef2fd8dc26a478c2b870495ea39ebd07bc\" title=\"upload_5f698b1a28978bd8f9779e596c471d9a\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/7/b70bdfef2fd8dc26a478c2b870495ea39ebd07bc_2_252x499.png\" alt=\"upload_5f698b1a28978bd8f9779e596c471d9a\" data-base62-sha1=\"q7iOKKk8JeMriCTq5Tc7z3t7NqQ\" width=\"252\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/7/b70bdfef2fd8dc26a478c2b870495ea39ebd07bc_2_252x499.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/7/b70bdfef2fd8dc26a478c2b870495ea39ebd07bc_2_378x748.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/7/b70bdfef2fd8dc26a478c2b870495ea39ebd07bc_2_504x998.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F2F4\"></a></div><br>\n.<br>\nProposers are incentivized to outsource their block building because builders (the canonical name for MEV-extracting agents specializing in sequencing transactions) pay them more than they would have earned had they built the block themselves. Circling back to our goal of “<strong>preserving the homogeneity of validator rewards in the presence of MEV</strong>,” we see that <code>mev-boost</code> allows access to the builder market for <em>all validators</em>, effectively preserving near-equivalent MEV rewards among solo stakers and professional staking service providers – great! But…<p></p>\n<p>Of course, there is a but… <code>mev-boost</code> has issues that continue to rankle some of the Ethereum community. Without being exhaustive, a few of the negative side-effects of taking the <code>mev-boost</code> medicine are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relays</strong> – These <a href=\"https://www.relayscan.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">trusted-third parties</a> broker the sale of blocks between proposers and builders. The immense reliance on relays increases the fragility of the protocol as a whole, as demonstrated through <a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/disclosure-mitigation-of-block-equivocation-strategy-with-early-getpayload-calls-for-proposers/1705\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">repeated</a>, <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/bloxroute-feb-6th-post-mortem/6586\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">incidents</a>, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/benhenryhunter/5c397db3985a59d14a52816305a6c1b8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">involving</a>, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/benhenryhunter/7b7d9c9e3218aad52f75e3647b83a6cc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">relays</a>. Further, since relays have no inherent revenue stream, more exotic (and closed-source) methods of capturing margins (e.g., <a href=\"https://bloxroute.com/pulse/introducing-the-validator-gateway-boost-your-ethereum-validator-rewards/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">timing games as a service</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sui414/status/1778708084510302445\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bid adjustments</a>) are being implemented.</li>\n<li><strong>Out-of-protocol software is brittle</strong> – Beyond the relays, participation in the <code>mev-boost</code> market requires validators to run additional software. The standard suite for solo staking now involves running four binaries: (i) the consensus beacon node, (ii) the consensus validator client, (iii) the execution client, and (iv) mev-boost. Beyond the significant overhead for solo stakers, reliance on this software also provides another potential point of failure during hard forks.

Without <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/no-free-lunch-a-new-inclusion-list-design/16389\">inclusion lists</a> or another censorship-resistance gadget, builders have extreme influence over transaction inclusion and exclusion – see <a href=\"https://censorship.pics/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">censorship.pics</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Timing games</strong> – While <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09032\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">timing games</a> are known to be a fundamental issue in Proof-of-Stake protocols, <code>mev-boost</code> pushes staking service providers to compete on thin margins. Additionally, relays (who conduct <code>mev-boost</code> auctions on the proposer’s behalf) serve as sophisticated middlemen facilitating timing games. Thus, we have seen <a href=\"https://p2p.org/economy/unlock-p2p-orgs-mev-enhancement-feature/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">marketing</a> endorsing playing timing games to boost the yield from staking with a specific provider.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>“OK, OK … blah blah … we have heard this story before … <a href=\"https://youtu.be/q8wJqMbr6eY?si=LVryerWbrw3_ge-I\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">tell me something I don’t know</a>.” (<span class=\"math\">\\leftarrow</span> h/t Barnabé for the aptly-named, 14k-views on youtube, musical reference.)</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-enumeration-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-2-enumeration-6\"></a>(2) – Enumeration</h3>\n<p>Obligatory ‘stage-setting’ out of the way, let’s look a little more carefully at the ~essence~ of a block-space distribution mechanism.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/5/5/55cc9892e24d897856dff5e70b48fe8682903b6e.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/55cc9892e24d897856dff5e70b48fe8682903b6e\" title=\"upload_cdbf47258422c2a96ea2903ce113a113\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/5/55cc9892e24d897856dff5e70b48fe8682903b6e_2_552x367.jpeg\" alt=\"upload_cdbf47258422c2a96ea2903ce113a113\" data-base62-sha1=\"cf0VErVtcwbNNGlnvZ7LASL7nYi\" width=\"552\" height=\"367\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/5/55cc9892e24d897856dff5e70b48fe8682903b6e_2_552x367.jpeg, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/5/55cc9892e24d897856dff5e70b48fe8682903b6e_2_828x550.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/5/5/55cc9892e24d897856dff5e70b48fe8682903b6e.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"57362A\"></a></div><br>\n<sub><strong>^ “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/mvy4YH9--Vw?t=108\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>Is that what I think it is?</em></a>”</strong></sub><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"the-elementshttpsenwikipediaorgwikieuclid27s_elements-of-block-space-distribution-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#the-elementshttpsenwikipediaorgwikieuclid27s_elements-of-block-space-distribution-7\"></a>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">elements</a> of block-space distribution</h4>\n<p>Consider the game of acquiring block space; MEV incentivizes agents to participate, while the combination of in-protocol and out-of-protocol software defines the rules.

Note that this is only a subset of the rather substantial literature around these designs – cf. <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@mikeneuder/infinite-buffet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">infinite buffet</a>. For each of the following, we summarize only the key ideas (see <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#related-work-2\">related work</a> for more).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Execution tickets\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key ideas</strong> – Block building and proposing rights are sold directly through “tickets” issued by the protocol. Ticket holders are randomly sampled to become block builders with a fixed lookahead. The ticket holder has the authority to produce a block at the assigned slot.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Block-auction PBS\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key ideas</strong> – The protocol bestows block production rights through a random leader-election process. The selected validator can sell their block outright to the builder market or build it locally. The builder must ~commit to a specific block~ when bidding in the auction. <code>mev-boost</code> is an out-of-protocol instantiation of block-auction PBS; enshrined PBS (ePBS), as <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980\">originally presented</a>, is the in-protocol equivalent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>MEV-burn/mev-smoothing\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key ideas</strong> – A committee is tasked with enforcing a minimum value over the bid the proposer selects in an auction. By requiring the proposer to choose a “large enough” bid, an MEV oracle is created. The MEV is either <em>smoothed</em> between committee members or <em>burned</em> (smoothed over all <code>ETH</code> holders).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Slot-auction PBS\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key ideas</strong> – Similar to block-auction PBS but instead sells the <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0x03c29504CEcCa30B93FF5774183a1358D41fbeB1/CPYI91s98cp9zKFkanKs_qotYzw09kWvouaAa9GXBrQ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">slot</a> to the builder market ~without~ requiring a commitment to a specific block – sometimes referred to as block space futures. By not requiring the builders to commit to a particular block, future slots may be auctioned off ahead of time rather than waiting until the slot itself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Partial-block auction\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key ideas</strong> – Allows a more flexible unit for selling block-space. Instead of selling the full block or slot, allow proposers to sell <em>some</em> of their block, e.g., the top-of-block (which is the most valuable for arbitrageurs), while retaining the rest-of-block construction.

The slot is sold ex-ante (a fixed amount of time in advance) without requiring a commitment to a specific block; a committee (à la mev-burn/smoothing) enforces the winning bid is sufficiently large.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We know, we know – it’s a lot to keep track of; it’s nearly a full-time job just to stay abreast of all these acronyms. But by comparing these proposals along the axes laid out by the <code>W^4H questions</code>, we can see how they all fit together as different parts of the same design space.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"applying-w4h-a-comparative-analysis-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#applying-w4h-a-comparative-analysis-9\"></a>Applying W^4H: a comparative analysis</h4>\n<p>For each of the five <code>W^4H questions</code>, we describe different trade-offs made by the aforementioned proposals. For brevity, we don’t analyze each question for each proposal; we instead focus on highlighting key differences arising from each line of questioning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Who</strong> controls the outcome of the game?</em>\n<ul>\n<li>With execution tickets, the protocol dictates the winner of the game by randomly choosing from the set of ticket holders.</li>\n<li>With block-auction PBS, the proposer (protocol-elected leader) unilaterally chooses the winner of the game.</li>\n<li>With mev-burn, the proposer still chooses the winner, but the winning bid is constrained by the committee, reducing the proposer’s agency.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em><strong>What</strong> is the good that players are competing for?</em>\n<ul>\n<li>With block-auction PBS, the entire block is sold, but bids must commit to the block contents.</li>\n<li>With slot-auction PBS, the entire block is sold, but without any specific block commitment.</li>\n<li>With partial-block PBS, a portion of the block is sold.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em><strong>When</strong> does the game take place?</em>\n<ul>\n<li>With block-auction PBS, the auction takes place during the slot.</li>\n<li>With slot-auction PBS, the auction may take place many slots (e.g., 32) ahead of time because there is no block-content commitment.</li>\n<li>With execution tickets, the tickets are assigned to slots at a fixed lookahead after being sold ex-ante by the protocol (more on the ticket-selling model we use below).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em><strong>Where</strong> does the MEV oracle come from?</em>\n<ul>\n<li>With mev-burn/smoothing, a committee enforces that a sufficiently large bid is selected as the winner; this bid size is the oracle.</li>\n<li>With execution tickets, the total money spent on tickets serves as the oracle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em><strong>How</strong> is the block builder chosen?</em>\n<ul>\n<li>In block-auction PBS, any outsourced block production has a winner-take-all allocation, with the highest bidder granted the block-building rights.</li>\n<li>Within execution tickets, many different allocation mechanisms can be implemented. In the original proposal, for example, where a random ticket is selected, the mechanism is ‘proportional-to-ticket-count’; in this case, the highest paying bidder (whoever holds the most tickets) merely has the highest probability of being selected, meaning they are not guaranteed the block building rights.</li>\n<li>If that (^) seems opaque, don’t worry. The entire following section is a deep dive into these different allocations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"motivational-interlude-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#motivational-interlude-10\"></a>Motivational interlude</h4>\n<p>Before continuing, let’s review our original motivation for block-space distribution mechanisms:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Block-space distribution mechanisms aim to preserve the homogeneity of validator rewards in the presence of MEV.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a great grounding, but if that is our only goal, why not just continue using <code>mev-boost</code>? Well, remember that <code>mev-boost</code> has some negative side effects that we probably want the endgame protocol to be resilient against. We highlight four other potential design goals of a block-space distribution mechanism:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Encouraging a wider set of builders to be competitive.</em></li>\n<li><em>Allow validators and builders to interact trustlessly.</em></li>\n<li><em>Incorporating MEV-awareness into the base layer protocol.</em></li>\n<li><em>Removing MEV from validator rewards altogether.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that while (1, 2, &amp; 3) appear relatively uncontroversial (*knock on wood*), (4) is more opinionated (and requires (3) as a pre-condition). The protocol may hope to eliminate MEV rewards from validator rewards as a means to ensure that the consensus layer rewards (what the protocol controls) more accurately reflect the full incentives of the system. This also ties into questions around staking macro-economics and the idea of <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751\">protocol</a>, <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@mikeneuder/iiii\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">issuance</a> – a much more politically-charged discussion. On the other hand, MEV rewards are a byproduct of network usage; MEV could instead be seen as a <a href=\"https://www.nano210.blog/infinite-blockspace-equilibrium/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">value capture</a> mechanism for the native token. We aren’t trying to address these questions here but rather explore how different answers to them would shape the design of the mechanism.</p>\n<p>What can we do at the protocol-design level to align with these desiderata? As laid out above, there are many trade-offs to consider, but in the following section, we examine “<em>How is the block builder chosen?</em>” to improve on some of these dimensions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-interrogation-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-3-interrogation-11\"></a>(3) – Interrogation</h3>\n<p><strong>Editorial note:</strong> As mentioned earlier, this section is longer and more technical than the others – feel free to skip to <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-4-extrapolation-18\">Section 4</a> if you are time (or interest) constrained!</p>\n<p><strong>Section goal:</strong> <em>To demonstrate the quantitative trade-off between MEV-oracle quality and the “fairness” of the two most familiar approaches to allocating block proposer rights, which we call <code>Proportional-all-pay</code> and <code>Winner-take-all</code>.</em></p>\n<p>We aim to accomplish this with the following subsections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#preliminaries-12\"><em>Preliminaries</em></a> – Motivate the fixed-price, unlimited-quantity execution ticket sale mechanism we use.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#model-13\"><em>Model</em></a> - Introduce the notation needed to analyze the model.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#familiar-allocation-mechanisms-14\"><em>Familiar allocation mechanisms</em></a> - Describe the <code>Proportional-all-pay</code> and <code>Winner-take-all</code> mechanisms using the established framework.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#comparing-the-outcomes-15\"><em>Comparing the outcomes</em></a> - Calculate the resulting equilibria in a two-player example.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#aside-1-calculating-equilibrium-bids-16\"><em>Aside #1: Calculating equilibrium bids</em></a> - Derive the equilibria in the general case.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#aside-2-tullock-contests-17\"><em>Aside #2: Tullock Contests</em></a> - Contextualize the model as a Tullock Contest and draw connections to the existing literature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GLsCR2RMBak?t=119\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dig</a> in.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"preliminaries-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#preliminaries-12\"></a>Preliminaries</h4>\n<p>Before diving into the space of allocation mechanisms made possible with execution tickets, we must first set up the model. Consider a protocol that sells execution tickets with the following rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the price is fixed at <code>1 WEI</code>, and</li>\n<li>unlimited tickets can be bought and sold from the protocol.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>this version of execution tickets is effectively equivalent to creating two disjoint staking mechanisms – one each for attesting and proposing. Small changes in the design, e.g., not allowing tickets to be resold to the protocol, may have massive implications for how the market plays out, but that isn’t the focus of this article. Instead, we narrowly explore the question of block-space allocation, given an existing ticket holder set.</em></p>\n<p>Notably, the set of block producers is disjoint (from the protocol’s perspective) from the set of attesters – individuals must select which part of the protocol they participate in by deciding whether to stake or buy tickets. The secondary ticket market may evolve as a venue for selling the building rights just in time to the builder market (as is done in <code>mev-boost</code> today).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/e/4/e4f36ef0b6e6e5d80c4a923d9465bf74212af039.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/e4f36ef0b6e6e5d80c4a923d9465bf74212af039\" title=\"upload_45a1fa23182dd6a28c2c07dc2479f150\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/4/e4f36ef0b6e6e5d80c4a923d9465bf74212af039_2_486x499.png\" alt=\"upload_45a1fa23182dd6a28c2c07dc2479f150\" data-base62-sha1=\"wFopQiId1m57tNMc332Tz7uwpvj\" width=\"486\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/4/e4f36ef0b6e6e5d80c4a923d9465bf74212af039_2_486x499.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/4/e4f36ef0b6e6e5d80c4a923d9465bf74212af039_2_729x748.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/4/e4f36ef0b6e6e5d80c4a923d9465bf74212af039_2_972x998.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F7F9\"></a></div><br>\n<span class=\"math\">\\cdot</span><br>\nSeparately, builders may choose to interact directly with the protocol by buying execution tickets themselves, but their capital may be better utilized as active liquidity, capturing arbitrage across trading venues. Thus, they may prefer buying block space on the secondary market during the just-in-time auction instead.<p></p>\n<p>Why restrict ourselves to this posted-price-unlimited-supply mechanism? Two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>It’s not clear that a sophisticated market could even be implemented in the consensus layer.</em> The clients are optimized to allow any validator with consumer-grade hardware to participate in the network. This desideratum may be incompatible with fast auctions, bonding curves, or other possible ticket-selling mechanisms. Questions around how many tickets are sold, the MEV around onchain ticket-sale inclusion (meta-MEV?!), and the timing (and timing games) of ticket sales seem closer to execution layer concerns than something that could reasonably be implemented by Ethereum consensus while keeping hardware requirements limited.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<em>One may imagine the inclusion of ET market-related transactions to possibly induce MEV, whether these transactions are included in the beacon block or the execution payload.</em>” – <strong>Barnabé in</strong> “<a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/barnabe.eth/QJ6W0mmyOwjec-2zuH6lZb0iEI2aYFB9gE-LHWIMzjQ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>More pictures about proposers and builders</em></a>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><em>Even if (a big if) the protocol ~could~ implement a more rigid ticket-selling market, the design space for such a mechanism is immense.</em> Many potential pricing mechanisms have been discussed, e.g., bonding curves, 1559-style dynamic pricing, auctions, etc.; making general claims about these remains outside the scope of this post.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore, we focus on the “unlimited, 1 <code>WEI</code> posted-price” version of execution tickets, where the protocol internalizes minimal complexity. With this framing, we can ask the question that is probably <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5KNEZJ6KkLI?t=53\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">burning</a> you up inside, “<em>given a set of execution ticket holders, how should the winner be selected?</em>” … sounds easy enough, right? Turns out there is a good deal we can say, even with such a seemingly simple question; let’s explore a few different options.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"model-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#model-13\"></a>Model</h4>\n<p>Consider the repeated game of buying execution tickets to earn MEV rewards for your investment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During each period, each player effectively submits a bid, which is the number of tickets they buy. Denote the vector of bids by <span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{b}</span>, where <span class=\"math\">b_i</span> is the bid of the <span class=\"math\">i^{th}</span> player.</li>\n<li>Each player has a valuation for winning the block production rights. Denote the vector of valuations by <span class=\"math\">\\mathbf{v}</span>, where <span class=\"math\">v_i</span> is the value of the <span class=\"math\">i^{th}</span> player.</li>\n<li>At each time step, an allocation mechanism determines each player’s allocation based on the vector of bids. Assuming bidders are risk-neutral (i.e., don’t care between winning 2 <code>ETH</code> with probability <span class=\"math\">0.5</span> vs. 1 <code>ETH</code> with probability <span class=\"math\">1</span>), we can equivalently say that they are each allocated “some portion” of the block, which can be alternatively be interpreted as “the probability that they win a given block.” In an <span class=\"math\">n</span> player game, let <span class=\"math\">x: \\mathbf{b} \\rightarrow [0,1]^n</span> denote the map implementing an allocation mechanism, where <span class=\"math\">x_i(\\mathbf{b})</span> is the allocation of the <span class=\"math\">i^{th}</span> player, under the constraint that <span class=\"math\">\\sum_i x_i(\\mathbf{b}) =1</span> (i.e., the mechanism fully allocates).</li>\n<li>Each player’s payment is collected at each round.

Intuitively, by allocating block-production rights to players with lower values (as <code>Proportional-all-pay</code> does), we forgo revenue we would have received had we simply allocated the entire rights to the player with the highest value. We point the interested reader to <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#aside-1-calculating-equilibrium-bids-16\">Aside 1</a> for a more complete treatment.</p>\n<p>Another factor to consider is the “fairness” or “distribution” of the allocation mechanism. For example, suppose we agree on the metric: <span class=\"math\">\\text{fairness} = \\sqrt{x_1 \\cdot x_2}</span> (we use the geometric mean because if <span class=\"math\">x_1 + x_2</span> has a fixed sum, the geometric mean is maximized at <span class=\"math\">x_1 = x_2</span> and zero if either <span class=\"math\">x_1,x_2</span> is zero). Now, let’s look at the fairness outcomes of the two candidate mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>Proportional-all-pay</code> fairness:</strong> <span class=\"math\">\\sqrt{1/3 \\cdot 2/3} \\approx 0.471</span></li>\n<li><strong><code>Winner-take-all</code> fairness:</strong> <span class=\"math\">\\qquad\\qquad\\;\\,\\;\\sqrt{1 \\cdot 0} = 0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here, the “performance” of the two mechanisms flips – the <code>Winner-take-all</code> is <em>less fair</em> because <code>Player 2</code> has no chance of winning the game with a lower value. In the <code>Proportional-all-pay</code>, <code>Player 2</code> can hope to win some blocks despite bidding a lower value. As another example, consider the case where <span class=\"math\">v_1=v_2+\\epsilon</span>. The <code>Winner-take-all</code> mechanism allocates all the rights to <code>Player 1</code>, while the <code>Proportional-all-pay</code> splits the rights approximately in half.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brief note: why might the protocol care about fairness? In a decentralized protocol, a single actor having too much power undermines the credible neutrality of the system. As such, the protocol may be willing to “pay” (in the form of reduced revenue) to ensure that a resource is more evenly distributed among players. Alternatively, we could consider this a measure of “entropy” or even simply randomness being injected into the outcome of the game to try to reduce the influence the most dominant player can have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leads to the punchline from this small example: <strong>a fundamental trade-off exists between MEV-oracle quality and fairness.</strong> The <code>Proportional-all-pay</code> mechanism (and hence the original execution tickets proposal) is fairer because both players win the game with some probability, incentivizing them each (but more importantly, the higher value player) to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_shading\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">shade</a> their bid accordingly, lowering the revenue, and thus the MEV-oracle accuracy, of the mechanism. The first price mechanism elicits higher bids since bidders only pay if they win the entire block production rights, increasing the revenue, but this <code>Winner-take-all</code> dynamic makes the allocation less fair.</p>\n<p><em>Open question: is <code>Proportional-all-pay</code> an “optimal” Sybil-proof mechanism?</em> In the permissionless setting, we only consider Sybil-proof mechanisms, where a player doesn’t benefit from splitting their bid into multiple identities. We posit that the <code>Proportional-all-pay</code> mechanism sits in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Goldilock’s Zone</a> of a Sybil-proof mechanism that gets both good revenue/MEV-oracle accuracy and fairness. We leave as an interesting open problem to determine the extent to which the <code>Proportional-all-pay</code> mechanism’s “optimality” (e.g., we were unable to find another Sybil-proof mechanism that dominates it in both revenue and fairness).</p>\n<h4><a name=\"aside-1-calculating-equilibrium-bids-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#aside-1-calculating-equilibrium-bids-16\"></a>Aside <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> – Calculating equilibrium bids</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-4-extrapolation-18\">Convenience link</a> to skip to the conclusion for the less-keen reader <img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>In the numerical example above, we provide the equilibrium bids for the <code>Winner-take-all</code> and <code>Proportional-all-pay</code> mechanisms without proof.

We cannot simply transfer our collection of contacts, influences, past bribes, and so forth to the steel manufacturers’ lobby. In general, our investments are too specialized, and, in many cases, they are matters of very particular and detailed goodwill to a specific organization. It is true that we could sell the steel lobby our lobbyists with their connections and perhaps our mailing list. But presumably, all these things have been bought by us at their proper cost.

The sauna needs preconfirmation protocols just like the preconfirmation protocols need the sauna. Until these protocols emerge, the sauna remains a vision.

What makes a preconfirmer “good” or “bad” will depend on many factors including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Latency</li>\n<li>Throughput</li>\n<li>(Trusted) execution guarantees</li>\n<li>Privacy</li>\n<li>Cost</li>\n<li>Interoperability with other protocols</li>\n<li>Decentralization</li>\n<li>General trust</li>\n<li>Liveness/censorship resistance</li>\n<li>Ability to express intents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of these factors have trade-offs, so deciding on a single preconfirmation protocol which somewhat specializes in a subset of these criteria would be a mistake at this early stage of preconfirmation development.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"encouraging-competition-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#encouraging-competition-3\"></a>Encouraging Competition</h3>\n<p>Beyond the warm fuzzy feelings we get from many permissionless preconfirmers, we need competing preconfirmers to incentivize competition and keep preconfirmation strategies honest and transparent. Although some preconfirmation guarantees require tradeoffs, e.g. cost vs latency, the benefits of repeated honest behaviour and its long-term access to the preconfirmation market/revenue has almost no trade-off considerations that come into play. Even in the fringe cases where malicious behaviour may have significant immediate profits for a preconfirmer, proposers can always opt-in to choosing entities whose reputational value dominates any such profits, e.g. Flashbots, Vitalik, etc. (even within this set of “trusted” entities, there will be other tradeoffs that must be considered).</p>\n<p>This out-of-the-sauna trust will be necessary as the demand for high-throughput, low-latency preconfirmations likely means we need to delegate preconfirmations temporarily to high-resource and/or centralized entities/committees. In the sauna, misbehaving preconfirmers can be reported and deprioritized by users and proposers, creating a significant disincentive for preconfirmers to act maliciously. As such, users and proposers can immediately begin to depend on the subjective parts of the preconfirmation supply chain such as pricing policies and expected response times that are necessary for preconfirmations to become a reality now.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-flaw-in-existing-approaches-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#the-flaw-in-existing-approaches-4\"></a>The flaw in existing approaches</h2>\n<p>The community has been semi-publicly focused on the infrastructure that enables a proposer to offer preconfirmations. There are 2 broad solutions in this regard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The based proposer commits to a specific preconfirmation protocol ahead of time. Most projects are looking at this. On its current trajectory, this is probably a “winner-takes-most” approach with each project trying to establish itself as the only game in town.</li>\n<li>The based rollup commits to a specific preconfirmation protocol ahead of time and this preconfirmation protocol is trusted to enable preconfirmations. If the preconfirmation protocol fails, liveness breaks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The endgame for both of these approaches requires the user and the proposer to trust a single preconfirmation protocol indefinitely. We see it as unacceptable to depend on the honest behaviour of a single preconfirmation protocol preconfirming all transactions for Ethereum.</p>\n<p>If all of the preconfirmation flow is coming through one specific preconfirmation protocol, this removes competition and places an entity that can rent-capture between Ethereum and its users. More than this, it is unlikely that an emergent preconfirmation protocol could/should be trusted without strong technical guarantees, or viable alternatives for users and validators to switch to. In this sense, trust is a powerful property for emerging technologies that can bridge technological barriers to key problems.</p>\n<p>With respect to preconfirmations, one such problem that trust can address is the fair exchange of preconfirmation requests and responses. In the Appendix, we discuss how the trust generated through the preconfirmation sauna offers a viable solution to the fair exchange problem.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/a/4a85e73316a1e964f707ca071b550976707e83f2.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/4a85e73316a1e964f707ca071b550976707e83f2\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/a/4a85e73316a1e964f707ca071b550976707e83f2_2_517x346.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"aDgdzzzGuiRNNdWF6dVuKkWO8Iq\" width=\"517\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/a/4a85e73316a1e964f707ca071b550976707e83f2_2_517x346.jpeg, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/a/4a85e73316a1e964f707ca071b550976707e83f2_2_775x519.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/a/4a85e73316a1e964f707ca071b550976707e83f2_2_1034x692.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F8\"></a></div><br>\nThe current path to preconfirmations involves many protocols building by themselves, competing for a critical mass of validator adoption. Until that point, preconfirmation infrastructure will fragment until one emerges as dominant. This game ends with the best-backed/-connected protocol winning. This leads to an indefinite monopoly on the preconfirmation supply chain, which harms both competition and trust.<p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"enter-the-sauna-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#enter-the-sauna-5\"></a>Enter the Sauna.</h1>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_sauna\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Wikipedia</a>: “Saunas are strictly egalitarian places: no titles or hierarchies are used in the sauna.” Business is often done in saunas. If someone is ever caught misbehaving, people can choose not to sauna with them again.</p>\n<p>The preconfirmation sauna is completely agnostic to the preconfirmation protocols that exist within the sauna framework. To enter the preconfirmation sauna, preconfirmers and their respective protocols register as prospective preconfirmers in the system. Proposers then choose whichever preconfirmer(s) they like to delegate preconfirmation rights to.</p>\n<p>Although the intuition is that proposers would choose the preconfirmer paying the most for the opportunity, there are other factors at play. Proposers must trust the preconfirmer to broadcast all of the preconfirmations to the network ahead of/at block building time, depending on whether or not the preconfirmer is also the one building the final block. This is because preconfirmations almost certainly need proposer slashing conditions to prevent <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353\">safety or liveness faults.</a> As such, a proposer risks being slashed by choosing an untrusted preconfirmer.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/6/5/65a590148c5dbc6e81dc2013a87d91f7d21ce4e0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/65a590148c5dbc6e81dc2013a87d91f7d21ce4e0\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/5/65a590148c5dbc6e81dc2013a87d91f7d21ce4e0_2_517x286.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"evcWm05gUbqjWUZMRvyEV4OE1Gg\" width=\"517\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/5/65a590148c5dbc6e81dc2013a87d91f7d21ce4e0_2_517x286.jpeg, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/5/65a590148c5dbc6e81dc2013a87d91f7d21ce4e0_2_775x429.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/5/65a590148c5dbc6e81dc2013a87d91f7d21ce4e0_2_1034x572.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D4CEBF\"></a></div><br>\nTo enable preconfirmations we need healthy competition among protocols. Importantly, this competition should not be over fragmenting users and validators, but over the quality of preconfirmations being offered. Competition over improved preconfirmation guarantees not only creates an incentive to act honestly, but also an incentive to innovate. The vision of the sauna is to ensure permissionless access to the preconfirmation game, and to leverage the competition and trust that this permissionlessness brings. For this to happen, switching between protocols needs to be seamless for everyone in the supply chain. Although this probably requires some standards, standards aren’t a necessity.<p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"everyone-to-the-sauna-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#everyone-to-the-sauna-6\"></a>Everyone to the Sauna.</h2>\n<p>If we want proposers and users to engage in specific preconfirmation protocols, we need trust. More than trust, there needs to be clear incentives for everyone to engage with one another.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Proposers want to use the preconfirmer.</strong> Proposers need to know that committing to a preconfirmation protocol will generate higher revenue than simply outsourcing building through something like mev-boost. This requires the preconfirmation protocols to be paying competitively for the right to preconfirm. Almost by definition, this can only be achieved through competition among independent protocols. Proposers also need to know with a high degree of confidence that a preconfirmer will maintain liveness and forward all preconfirmations to the network, and avoid any proposer slashing conditions. With a sauna full of preconfirmers, proposers can choose more robust preconfirmers with less failure and slashing risk at the expense of lost revenue. Proposers can also opt for riskier preconfirmers offering higher revenue. The choice is theirs!</li>\n<li><strong>Users want to use the preconfirmer.</strong> Fundamentally, preconfirmation revenue can only be generated through user submission of preconfirmation requests. This requires user to trust in the preconfirmation protocol. With only a single preconfirmation protocol, this likely leads to preconfirmation policies that favour the relayer and not the user or proposer. User adoption of minimally trusted preconfirmations (no/limited guarantees of inclusion, selection biases on inclusion, etc.) will likely be limited.  In that sense, we need competing preconfirmation protocols to incentivize trust in the preconfirmer and policies that favour the users.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Trust breeds trust. With a sauna full of competing preconfirmation protocols, there are clear incentives to optimize preconfirmation policies and guarantees, including trust (recall the Repeated Preconfirmation Sauna Game), to secure selection from the proposer and the users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"life-after-sauna-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#life-after-sauna-7\"></a>Life after Sauna</h2>\n<p>Importantly, the use of the sauna isn’t necessary. Proposers can communicate directly with, and commit to, their preferred preconfirmer outside of the sauna. We still imagine an endgame where there is some preconfirmer that trustlessly provides “perfect” preconfirmations.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Until the perfect preconfirmation protocol emerges, protocols need to compete, experiment and innovate while still enabling preconfirmations. More than this, the ability to delegate, send, and receive preconfirmations should be as simple and standardized as possible. To do this, a credibly neutral platform is essential. This is what we envision for the sauna. We look forward to seeing you in there.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"call-to-action-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#call-to-action-9\"></a>Call to Action</h3>\n<p>At Switchboard, we aren’t just building therapeutic wooden structures. We’re also working on improving the preconfirmation protocols themselves. Although we believe preconfirmations could probably be offered along Justin’s timeline of this year, with help from the sauna, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-preconfirmation-sauna/19762#the-multi-headed-hydra-of-preconfirmations-2\">the multi-headed hydra of preconfirmations</a> must be tackled. Preconfirmation RnD, to which Switchboard is committed, will be vital in this regard.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"appendix-the-fair-exchange-problem-a-sauna-case-study-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#appendix-the-fair-exchange-problem-a-sauna-case-study-10\"></a>Appendix. The Fair Exchange Problem: A Sauna Case Study</h2>\n<p>There are many issues that a preconfirmation protocol must address to be considered viable, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/strawmanning-based-preconfirmations/19695\">some of which are outlined here through a strawman framing of a preconfirmation protocol.</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/_julianma/status/1796552412687155320\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">One of the key components needed for preconfirmations is the fair exchange of preconfirmation requests</a> from users and responses, the preconfirmations, from the preconfirmers.</p>\n<p>Fair exchange is a hard problem. Users want to get the strongest possible guarantees of inclusion/execution when they submit a request, while preconfirmers want to give the weakest guarantees of inclusion/execution, retaining as much optionality as they can until the block must be built. The most well-known solution we have for fair exchange, albeit for block building, is <a href=\"https://boost.flashbots.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">mev-boost</a>. This solution hinges on trust in the relayers that execute the fair exchange of blocks between block builders and block proposers. This game started out with a single trusted Flashbots relayer, but now many trusted relayers exist. Some builders even run their own relayer, most notably <a href=\"https://docs.titanrelay.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Titan</a>. Doesn’t this break the fair exchange guarantees of a trust intermediary? No!</p>\n<p>Titan relay have a significant incentive to never betray the trust of L1 proposers, and indirectly, builders using the Titan relay. With the Titan relay, Titan builder has a clear advantage compared to submitting blocks to any other relay, as Titan builder bids can be updated much quicker at the Titan relay than if the bids needed to first be relayed to an external relay. Furthermore, if any Titan misbehaviour is ever detected (or even reasonably suspected), proposers will stop trusting, listening to, and selecting the Titan relayer. Consequently, Titan would probably lose the edge they get from relaying their own blocks forever if a single misbehaviour is ever detected. This is incredibly powerful. This is the <em>Repeated Sauna Game.</em></p>\n<p>The Repeated Sauna Game can also be played between preconfirmers. Some protocols may pride themselves on trustless approaches to the fair exchange problem: something like a censorship-resistant input tape with strong data-availability guarantees. Unfortunately, this will come at latency, throughput, and cost tradeoffs. In that sense, users and proposers are probably happy to accept guarantees from the Titan of preconfirmations, even if that currently means a centralized entity with no formal guarantees of fair exchange. Thanks to the Repeated Preconfirmation Sauna Game, Titan preconfirmer has just as much to lose, if not more, from misbehaving when offering preconfirmations. With preconfirmations, the preconfirmer will be able to capture revenue from preconfirming, albeit within the bounds of the ordering and execution policies that they commit to offering users and proposers. Thus, the Repeated Preconfirmation Sauna Game has tangible incentives to keep preconfirmers behaving honestly, enabling fair exchange, among many other services where some amount of trust can bridge current technological barriers.</p>\n<p>To summarize, the Repeated Preconfirmation Sauna Game establishes dependable economic trust among rational preconfirmers through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The existence of alternative rational and competitive preconfirmers.</li>\n<li>The monitoring of preconfirmer behaviour by many independent observers; users, wallets, proposers, other preconfirmers, etc.</li>\n<li>Reputation and eligibility for future, likely increasing, revenue outweighing short-term incentives to deviate.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-preconfirmation-sauna/19762\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-preconfirmation-sauna/19762","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Jun 2024 17:15:40 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19762"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/the-preconfirmation-sauna/19762.rss","#text":"The Preconfirmation Sauna"},"filter":false},{"title":"Censorship Resistance Through Game Theory","dc:creator":"antonydenyer","category":"Block proposer","description":"<blockquote>\n<p>tldr; relays should divulge more metadata about the block so that validators can make more informed decisions that align with their preferences</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/simbro\">@simbro</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/mmp\">@mmp</a> for early feedback</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Censorship resistance is a fundamental property that underpins the decentralised nature of blockchain networks and ensures the integrity and accessibility of transactions within the system.

One reason PBS was introduced was the idea that block builders would be better at building blocks than validators, especially solo validators. They would be better connected and have access to private order flow. The problem is that better was assumed to mean more profitable. The current optimum strategy is to be a vertically integrated searcher builder that can pay the most for a block. Anything that gets included in that block is secondary and only there to reduce the cost burden on the purchase of the block.</p>\n<p>We need to change the game, so the optimum strategy is to fill the block with as many transactions and blobs as possible within the protocol’s constraints and pay the validator for the privilege. Put another way, block builders should be better at building blocks than validators.

The players in this game are the block proposer and the block builder, and their strategies involve deciding which transactions to include or censor.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"game-setup-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#game-setup-5\"></a>Game Setup</h2>\n<p>Players: Block Proposer (P) and Block Builder (B).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"strategies-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#strategies-6\"></a>Strategies:</h2>\n<p>For Block Proposer <code>(P)</code>: Accept <code>(A)</code> or Censor <code>(C)</code> transactions.</p>\n<p>For Block Builder <code>(B)</code>: Accept <code>(A)</code> or Censor <code>(C)</code> transactions.</p>\n<p>Payoffs: Defined in terms of gwei received from tips and MEV.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"transactions-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#transactions-7\"></a>Transactions</h2>\n<p><code>t1</code>: A censored public mempool transaction paying <code>1</code> gwei in tips.</p>\n<p><code>t2</code>: A private transaction paying <code>2</code> gwei in tips and <code>2</code> gwei in MEV.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"payoff-matrix-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#payoff-matrix-8\"></a>Payoff Matrix</h2>\n<p>The outcomes of the game can be represented in a payoff matrix where the rows represent the Block Builder’s strategies, and the columns represent the Block Proposer’s strategies.

However, existing solutions often face challenges related to high transaction costs, scalability limitations, and privacy concerns. This research introduces a novel decentralized payment network that leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and unilateral payment channels to address these issues.</p>\n<p>The proposed network architecture is designed to address specific challenges faced by existing decentralized payment systems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The absence of mining and associated costs solves the issue of high transaction fees and energy consumption in traditional proof-of-work-based systems.</li>\n<li>The elimination of validators and consensus mechanisms tackles the scalability limitations and potential centralization risks in proof-of-stake and delegated systems.</li>\n<li>The use of storage partitioning and off-chain payment channels addresses the scalability and privacy concerns associated with storing all transactions on-chain.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By distributing a fixed token supply to participants at the network’s inception, the system eliminates the need for mining and its associated costs. The network focuses on enabling direct mutual verification of transactions between senders and receivers, ensuring the validity of transactions and the consistency of account balances without relying on validators or consensus mechanisms. By leveraging zk-SNARKs, the network allows for direct proof of validity between sender and receiver, as the succinct zero-knowledge proofs inherently prove the correctness of transactions.</p>\n<p>To enhance efficiency and scalability, the network uses a multi-tier Merkle tree system with Merkle proofs, ensuring that only a constant succinct size <span class=\"math\">(O(1))</span> of data is submitted to the blockchain. This design minimizes on-chain storage requirements and ensures data availability.</p>\n<p>At the core of this novel payment network lies a comprehensive mathematical framework that leverages zero-knowledge proofs, particularly zk-SNARKs, to validate transactions and generate wallet state proofs. These proofs enable efficient verification of transaction validity and balance updates while preserving user privacy.</p>\n<p>The network’s architecture is composed of several key components, including unilateral payment channels, hierarchical smart contracts, and partitioned storage nodes. These components work together to enable scalable, secure, and privacy-preserving transactions, while minimizing on-chain storage requirements and ensuring data availability.</p>\n<p>To ensure the robustness and correctness of the proposed model, the paper presents formal algorithms, theorems, and proofs for crucial aspects of the system, such as the Balance Consistency Theorem and the dispute resolution mechanism. These mathematical formalisms provide a solid foundation for the security and reliability of the payment network.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the paper includes an in-depth analysis of the network’s security, privacy, and scalability properties, highlighting its advantages over alternative approaches, such as traditional blockchain-based payment systems and centralized payment networks. The analysis also acknowledges potential limitations and challenges, such as the complexity of zk-SNARK implementations and the need for ongoing optimizations.</p>\n<p>The main contributions of this research can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A comprehensive mathematical framework for ensuring transaction validity and balance consistency using zero-knowledge proofs, particularly zk-SNARKs.</li>\n<li>A detailed description of the network’s architecture, including unilateral payment channels, hierarchical smart contracts, and partitioned storage nodes.</li>\n<li>Formal algorithms, theorems, and proofs for key components of the system, such as the Balance Consistency Theorem, zk-SNARK proof generation, smart contract verification, and dispute resolution.</li>\n<li>An in-depth analysis of the network’s security, privacy, and scalability properties, along with detailed comparisons to alternative approaches.</li>\n<li>An exploration of promising use cases that leverage the enhanced privacy features of the proposed system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The proposed decentralized payment network presents a promising approach to enabling secure, private, and scalable transactions in a decentralized setting, paving the way for more efficient and accessible financial services on the blockchain. The extensive mathematical formalism and rigorous analysis provided in this paper contribute to the growing body of research on decentralized payment systems and demonstrate the potential of zero-knowledge proofs in enhancing the security, privacy, and scalability of blockchain-based financial applications.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/6/d6d467a101f5b9aae81288f1c0d30234082f2bcd.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/d6d467a101f5b9aae81288f1c0d30234082f2bcd\" title=\"DALL·E_2024-06-05_20.49.33_-_A_high-level_overview_of_a_decentralized_payment_network_architecture._The_diagram_includes_Off-Cha\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/6/d6d467a101f5b9aae81288f1c0d30234082f2bcd_2_575x499.jpeg\" alt=\"DALL·E_2024-06-05_20.49.33_-_A_high-level_overview_of_a_decentralized_payment_network_architecture._The_diagram_includes_Off-Cha\" data-base62-sha1=\"uEtfJQwTCmabOiEAZSjJdDoxXeB\" width=\"575\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/6/d6d467a101f5b9aae81288f1c0d30234082f2bcd_2_575x499.jpeg, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/6/d6d467a101f5b9aae81288f1c0d30234082f2bcd_2_862x748.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/6/d6d467a101f5b9aae81288f1c0d30234082f2bcd.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D4D5CF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"background-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#background-4\"></a>Background</h1>\n<p>This section introduces the key concepts and technologies used in the proposed decentralized payment network, providing a solid foundation for understanding the system’s design and functionality.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"zero-knowledge-proofs-zkps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#zero-knowledge-proofs-zkps-5\"></a>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</h2>\n<p>Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic protocols that enable one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

This section provides a detailed description of each component and their interactions within the overall system.<br>\nCertainly! Here is the document reformatted in Markdown with low-level LaTeX math included:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"unilateral-payment-channels-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#unilateral-payment-channels-7\"></a>Unilateral Payment Channels</h3>\n<p>Payment channels are a key component of scalable blockchain solutions, enabling off-chain transactions between parties without the need to record every transaction on the main blockchain. In the proposed network, each user has a unilateral payment channel associated with their wallet contract, which holds their tokens off-chain. This design choice simplifies channel management and enables cross-partition transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A unilateral payment channel between a user <span class=\"math\">U</span> and their wallet contract <span class=\"math\">W</span> is a tuple <span class=\"math\">(B, T_1, T_2, \\ldots, T_n)</span>, where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"math\">B</span> is the initial balance of <span class=\"math\">U</span> in the payment channel.</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">T_1, T_2, \\ldots, T_n</span> are the transactions executed within the payment channel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final state of the payment channel is determined by the cumulative effect of all transactions <span class=\"math\">T_1, T_2, \\ldots, T_n</span> on the initial balance <span class=\"math\">B</span>.</p>\n<p>To set up a unilateral payment channel, a user creates a wallet contract on the blockchain and transfers the desired amount of tokens to the contract. The wallet contract manages the user’s off-chain balance and state updates through zk-SNARK proofs. When a user wants to transfer tokens to another user, they generate a zk-SNARK proof that verifies the validity of the transaction and includes the necessary metadata for the recipient to generate the next transaction proof. This design enables instant transaction finality and eliminates the need for on-chain confirmation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"example-1-unilateral-payment-channel-setup-and-transactions-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#example-1-unilateral-payment-channel-setup-and-transactions-8\"></a>Example 1: Unilateral Payment Channel Setup and Transactions</h3>\n<p>Suppose Alice wants to set up a unilateral payment channel with an initial balance of 100 tokens. She creates a wallet contract <span class=\"math\">W_A</span> on the blockchain and transfers 100 tokens to it. The wallet contract initializes Alice’s off-chain balance to 100 tokens.</p>\n<p>Later, Alice decides to send 30 tokens to Bob. She generates a zk-SNARK proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_1</span> that verifies the validity of the transaction, including the availability of sufficient funds and the correctness of the updated balances. Upon generating the proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_1</span>, the wallet contract immediately locks 30 tokens, reducing Alice’s available balance to 70 tokens. Alice sends the transaction details and the proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_1</span> to Bob.</p>\n<p>Bob verifies the proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_1</span> to ensure the transaction’s validity. If the proof is valid, Alice and Bob update their local off-chain balances accordingly. Alice’s balance remains 70 tokens, while Bob’s balance increases by 30 tokens. Both parties sign the proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_1</span> to authorize the future rebalancing of their respective payment channels.</p>\n<p>If Bob does not accept the proof within a specified timeout period, the smart contract automatically releases the locked funds back to Alice’s available balance, ensuring no funds are indefinitely locked.</p>\n<p>This example demonstrates how unilateral payment channels enable secure, off-chain transactions between users while preserving privacy and scalability.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"off-chain-payment-channel-operations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#off-chain-payment-channel-operations-9\"></a>Off-Chain Payment Channel Operations</h3>\n<p>As introduced in Section 2, off-chain payment channels form the foundation of the proposed network’s scalability. Each user has a unilateral payment channel associated with their wallet contract, which holds their tokens off-chain. The channel setup and transaction process can be formally described as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Channel Setup</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">\\begin{algorithm}[H]\n\\caption{Unilateral Payment Channel Setup}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\\Procedure{SetupChannel}{$U, W, B$}\n\\State $U$ creates a wallet contract $W$ on the blockchain\n\\State $U$ transfers $B$ tokens to $W$\n\\State $W$ initializes the off-chain balance of $U$ to $B$\n\\State \\textbf{return} $W$\n\\EndProcedure\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, <span class=\"math\">U</span> represents the user, <span class=\"math\">W</span> is the wallet contract, and <span class=\"math\">B</span> is the initial balance in the payment channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Off-Chain Transactions</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">\\begin{algorithm}[H]\n\\caption{Off-Chain Transaction}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\\Procedure{OffchainTransaction}{$S, R, T$}\n\\State $S$ generates a zk-SNARK proof $\\pi$ for the transaction $T$\n\\State $S$'s wallet contract locks the transaction amount\n\\State $S$ sends $(T, \\pi)$ to $R$\n\\State $R$ verifies $\\pi$ to ensure the validity of $T$\n\\If{$\\pi$ is valid}\n\\State $S$ updates their local off-chain balance\n\\State $R$ updates their local off-chain balance\n\\State $S$ and $R$ sign $\\pi$ to authorize rebalancing\n\\Else\n\\State $S$'s wallet contract releases the locked amount after timeout\n\\EndIf\n\\State \\textbf{return} $(T, \\pi)$\n\\EndProcedure\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, <span class=\"math\">S</span> represents the sender, <span class=\"math\">R</span> is the receiver, and <span class=\"math\">T</span> is the transaction. The zk-SNARK proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi</span> verifies the validity of the transaction, including the availability of sufficient funds and the correctness of the updated balances. If the proof is valid, both parties update their local off-chain balances and sign the proof to authorize the future rebalancing of their payment channels. If the proof is not accepted within a specified timeout period, the smart contract automatically releases the locked funds back to the sender’s available balance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"hierarchical-smart-contracts-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#hierarchical-smart-contracts-10\"></a>Hierarchical Smart Contracts</h3>\n<p>The hierarchical smart contract structure is a key component of the proposed network, enabling efficient rebalancing of payment channels and management of cross-partition transactions. The structure consists of three layers: root contracts, intermediate contracts, and wallet contracts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Root Contracts:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Serve as the entry point for users and maintain a mapping of intermediate contracts.</li>\n<li>Aggregate Merkle roots from intermediate contracts and submit a single, final aggregated Merkle root.</li>\n<li>Submit the final Merkle root to the blockchain at regular intervals, ensuring the global state is verifiable on-chain with minimal frequency and cost being a constant size <span class=\"math\">O(1)</span>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Intermediate Contracts:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage liquidity pools for specific transaction types or user groups.</li>\n<li>Maintain a mapping of wallet contracts and are responsible for rebalancing payment channels based on the transaction proofs submitted by users.</li>\n<li>Collect Merkle roots from wallet contracts and aggregate them into a single Merkle tree within their partition.</li>\n<li>Periodically submit the aggregated Merkle root to the root contract.</li>\n<li>Ensure the state within their partition is verifiable on-chain with minimal frequency and cost.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wallet Contracts:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Represent individual user payment channels and hold the users’ off-chain balances.</li>\n<li>Generate zk-SNARK proofs for their state and submit these proofs to the storage nodes.</li>\n<li>Store proofs to the storage nodes for data availability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The hierarchical structure allows for efficient liquidity management and reduced on-chain transaction costs, as rebalancing operations are performed at the intermediate level, and the root contracts only need to process periodic updates.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"example-3-hierarchical-smart-contract-interaction-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#example-3-hierarchical-smart-contract-interaction-11\"></a>Example 3: Hierarchical Smart Contract Interaction</h3>\n<p>Continuing with the previous examples, suppose Alice, Bob, Carol, and David belong to the same user group managed by an intermediate contract <span class=\"math\">IC_1</span>. The intermediate contract <span class=\"math\">IC_1</span> is mapped to a root contract <span class=\"math\">RC</span>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When Alice sends 30 tokens to Bob (transaction <span class=\"math\">T_1</span>), she generates a zk-SNARK proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_1</span>. Upon generating the proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_1</span>, Alice’s wallet contract immediately locks 30 tokens, reducing her available balance accordingly. The transaction proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_1</span> is then submitted to the intermediate contract <span class=\"math\">IC_1</span>. The intermediate contract verifies the proof and updates the balances of Alice’s and Bob’s wallet contracts accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Similarly, when Alice receives 50 tokens from Carol (transaction <span class=\"math\">T_2</span>), Carol generates a zk-SNARK proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_2</span>. Upon generating the proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_2</span>, Carol’s wallet contract immediately locks 50 tokens, reducing her available balance. The transaction proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_2</span> is then submitted to <span class=\"math\">IC_1</span>, which verifies the proof and updates the balances of Alice’s and Carol’s wallet contracts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Periodically, the intermediate contract <span class=\"math\">IC_1</span> submits a summary of the balance updates to the root contract <span class=\"math\">RC</span>, which maintains a global view of the network’s state by submitting a single aggregated Merkle root to the blockchain.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This hierarchical structure, with the immediate balance locking mechanism, ensures that all transactions are secure and funds are not double spent, even if there are delays in transaction acceptance or verification.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"storage-nodes-and-blockchain-interaction-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#storage-nodes-and-blockchain-interaction-12\"></a>Storage Nodes and Blockchain Interaction</h3>\n<p>To ensure data availability and scalability, the proposed network employs storage nodes that store the off-chain transaction history and wallet state proofs. Each storage node maintains a copy of the entire off-chain data, ensuring redundancy and decentralization.</p>\n<p><strong>Storage Node Operations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Storing Proofs:</strong> Storage nodes store zk-SNARK proofs for individual wallet states. Each wallet maintains its own Merkle tree that includes these proofs.</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregating Data:</strong> At regular intervals, storage nodes aggregate the off-chain data into a single Merkle root, representing the state of all payment channels they manage. This Merkle root is then submitted to the intermediate contracts.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-python\">def store_proof(proof, user, wallet):\n    # Store the proof for user and wallet contract\n    # Update the local Merkle tree with the proof\n\ndef submit_merkle_root():\n    # Generate the Merkle root for all stored proofs\n    # Submit the Merkle root to the intermediate contract\n</code></pre>\n<p>The blockchain acts as a secure and immutable ledger, storing the Merkle roots submitted by the root contract. This allows for efficient</p>\n<p>verification of the network’s global state, as any discrepancies between the off-chain data and the on-chain Merkle roots can be easily detected and resolved.</p>\n<p>This hierarchical structure enables efficient verification of individual payment channels and the entire network state without storing the full transaction history on-chain. By leveraging the security and immutability of the blockchain while keeping the majority of the data off-chain, the proposed network achieves a balance between scalability, data availability, and security.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"example-4-storage-node-operation-and-blockchain-interaction-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#example-4-storage-node-operation-and-blockchain-interaction-13\"></a>Example 4: Storage Node Operation and Blockchain Interaction</h3>\n<p>Following the previous examples, suppose storage node <span class=\"math\">SN_1</span> is responsible for storing the transaction proofs and wallet state proofs for Alice, Bob, Carol, and David.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When Alice generates a wallet state proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_s</span> after transactions <span class=\"math\">T_1, T_2,</span> and <span class=\"math\">T_3</span>, she submits the proof to the storage node <span class=\"math\">SN_1</span>.

These measures ensure the integrity and consistency of transaction states, inherently preventing the submission of outdated or fraudulent states. This section outlines how these mechanisms work in detail.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"zk-snark-proofs-and-state-updates-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#zk-snark-proofs-and-state-updates-18\"></a>ZK-SNARK Proofs and State Updates</h3>\n<p>The network leverages zk-SNARKs to validate each transaction. The key elements include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proof of Validity</strong>: Each transaction within the network must be accompanied by a zk-SNARK proof. This proof verifies several critical aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The sender has sufficient balance to cover the transaction.</li>\n<li>The sender’s updated balance after the transaction is correctly computed.</li>\n<li>The receiver’s updated balance after the transaction is correctly computed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consistent State Management</strong>: Each user’s wallet contract maintains a Merkle tree of state proofs. Each state update (i.e., each transaction) is validated through zk-SNARKs, ensuring it is consistent with the previously recorded state. This cryptographic validation prevents unauthorized or incorrect state changes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"prevention-of-old-state-submission-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#prevention-of-old-state-submission-19\"></a>Prevention of Old State Submission</h3>\n<p>The design of the proposed network inherently prevents the submission of outdated or fraudulent states through the following mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proof Consistency</strong>: Each zk-SNARK proof submitted for a state update must be consistent with the latest recorded state. Intermediate contracts aggregate data from wallet contracts, and root contracts submit these aggregated roots to the blockchain. Any attempt to submit an old state would be detected as it would not match the current aggregated Merkle root.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>On-Chain Verification</strong>: The final aggregated Merkle root submitted by the root contract is stored on the blockchain, providing a tamper-evident record of the global state. During dispute resolution, the submitted state proofs are verified against this on-chain Merkle root to ensure only the most recent valid state is considered.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"mitigated-need-for-watchtowers-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#mitigated-need-for-watchtowers-20\"></a>Mitigated Need for Watchtowers</h3>\n<p>Due to the robust fraud prevention mechanisms built into the proposed system, the traditional need for watchtowers entities that monitor the blockchain for malicious activities and act on behalf of users is significantly reduced. The hierarchical structure and the use of zk-SNARKs ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each state update is cryptographically verified, preventing unauthorized changes.</li>\n<li>The aggregated Merkle roots provide a consistent and tamper-evident record of the network’s state.</li>\n<li>Dispute resolution is handled efficiently and fairly based on the most recent valid state proofs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The comprehensive fraud prevention mechanisms of the proposed decentralized payment network ensure high levels of security and integrity without the need for external monitoring entities like watchtowers. The hierarchical smart contract system and zk-SNARKs work together to maintain consistent and verifiable transaction states, providing a secure and efficient framework for decentralized financial transactions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"role-of-the-dao-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#role-of-the-dao-21\"></a>Role of the DAO</h3>\n<p>While the built-in mechanisms provide robust security and minimize the need for watchtowers, there are scenarios where manual involvement might be necessary. To address these situations, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) can be implemented to manage and oversee the network’s operations. The DAO would play a crucial role in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handling Exceptional Cases</strong>: Situations that require manual intervention beyond the automated fraud prevention and dispute resolution mechanisms.</li>\n<li><strong>Balancing Automation and Trust</strong>: Ensuring the right mix of automated processes, cryptographic proofs, and trust mechanisms to maintain network integrity.</li>\n<li><strong>Democratic Decision-Making</strong>: Leveraging community governance to make decisions on critical issues, such as protocol upgrades, handling disputes that the automated system cannot resolve, and other governance matters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"dao-functions-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#dao-functions-22\"></a>DAO Functions</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Manual Dispute Resolution</strong>: For disputes that cannot be resolved through automated proofs, the DAO can step in to review and make a final decision based on community consensus.</li>\n<li><strong>Protocol Upgrades</strong>: The DAO can propose and vote on protocol upgrades to enhance the system’s functionality and security.</li>\n<li><strong>Network Oversight</strong>: Providing ongoing oversight and making strategic decisions to ensure the network remains secure and efficient.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The combination of zk-SNARKs, hierarchical smart contracts, and the DAO creates a robust framework for fraud prevention and network governance. The minimized need for watchtowers is achieved through advanced cryptographic verification and efficient dispute resolution mechanisms. However, the DAO ensures that any issues requiring manual involvement are handled with a balance of automation, trust, rigorous mathematical verification, and democratic decision-making. This comprehensive approach provides a secure, scalable, and trustworthy decentralized payment network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"dispute-resolution-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#dispute-resolution-23\"></a>Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>In the event of a dispute between parties, the proposed network employs a dispute resolution mechanism based on the submitted zk-SNARK proofs and Merkle roots. The dispute resolution process can be formally described as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">\\begin{algorithm}[H]\n\\caption{Dispute Resolution}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\\Procedure{ResolveDispute}{$S, R, \\pi_S, \\pi_R$}\n\\State $S$ submits their final state proof $\\pi_S$\n\\State $R$ submits their final state proof $\\pi_R$\n\\State Verify $\\pi_S$ and $\\pi_R$ against the submitted Merkle roots\n\\If{$\\pi_S$ is valid and $\\pi_R$ is invalid}\n\\State Resolve the dispute in favor of $S$\n\\ElsIf{$\\pi_R$ is valid and $\\pi_S$ is invalid}\n\\State Resolve the dispute in favor of $R$\n\\Else\n\\State Resolve the dispute based on the most recent valid state proof\n\\EndIf\n\\EndProcedure\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, <span class=\"math\">S</span> and <span class=\"math\">R</span> represent the disputing parties, and <span class=\"math\">\\pi_S</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\pi_R</span> are their respective final state proofs. The dispute resolution mechanism verifies the submitted proofs against the Merkle roots stored on-chain and resolves the dispute based on the validity of the proofs. This ensures that the resolution is based on the most recent valid state of the payment channel, preventing fraud and maintaining the integrity of the system.</p>\n<p>The dispute resolution process follows these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Dispute Initiation:</strong> Either party can initiate a dispute by submitting a dispute request to the relevant smart contract (e.g., the intermediate contract managing their user group).</li>\n<li><strong>Evidence Submission:</strong> Both parties are required to submit their final state proofs <span class=\"math\">(\\pi_S \\text{ and } \\pi_R)</span> within a predefined timeframe (e.g., 24 hours). These proofs represent the latest state of their respective payment channels and include the relevant transaction history.</li>\n<li><strong>Proof Verification:</strong> The dispute resolution mechanism verifies the submitted proofs against the Merkle roots stored on-chain. This verification process ensures that the proofs are valid and consistent with the global state of the network.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The dispute is resolved based on the validity of the submitted proofs:\n<ul>\n<li>If <span class=\"math\">\\pi_S</span> is valid and <span class=\"math\">\\pi_R</span> is invalid, the dispute is resolved in favor of party <span class=\"math\">S</span>.</li>\n<li>If <span class=\"math\">\\pi_R</span> is valid and <span class=\"math\">\\pi_S</span> is invalid, the dispute is resolved in favor of party <span class=\"math\">R</span>.</li>\n<li>If both proofs are valid, the dispute is resolved based on the most recent valid state proof, determined by the timestamp or sequence number associated with the proofs.</li>\n<li>If neither proof is valid or if one party fails to submit their proof within the required timeframe, the dispute can be escalated to a higher-level contract (e.g., the root contract) or a trusted third party for manual review and resolution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Outcome Enforcement:</strong> Once the dispute is resolved, the smart contracts automatically enforce the outcome by updating the balances of the involved parties according to the resolution decision. This may involve redistributing tokens between the parties’ payment channels or applying penalties for fraudulent behavior.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To incentivize honest behavior and discourage frivolous disputes, the network can implement additional mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dispute Bond:</strong> Parties initiating a dispute may be required to post a bond (in the form of tokens) that is forfeited if their submitted proof is found to be invalid or if they fail to submit their proof within the required timeframe. This bond serves as a deterrent against malicious actors and ensures that disputing parties have a stake in the resolution process.</li>\n<li><strong>Reputation System:</strong> The network can maintain a reputation score for each user based on their history of successful transactions and dispute resolutions. Users with a high reputation score may be given preference in case of ambiguous disputes or may enjoy reduced dispute bond requirements. Conversely, users with a history of fraudulent behavior or frivolous disputes may face higher bond requirements or even temporary suspension from the network.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By combining cryptographic proofs, smart contract automation, and economic incentives, the proposed dispute resolution mechanism ensures that conflicts are resolved fairly and efficiently while maintaining the integrity of the payment network.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 5: Dispute Resolution</strong></p>\n<p>Suppose a dispute arises between Alice and Bob regarding the final state of their payment channel. Alice claims that her final balance is 100 tokens, while Bob claims that Alice’s final balance is 80 tokens.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Dispute Initiation:</strong> Alice initiates a dispute by submitting a dispute request to the intermediate contract <span class=\"math\">IC_1</span> that manages their user group. She deposits the required dispute bond of 10 tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Evidence Submission:</strong> Alice and Bob submit their respective final state proofs, <span class=\"math\">\\pi_A</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\pi_B</span>, to the dispute resolution mechanism within the 24-hour timeframe. Alice’s proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_A</span> shows her balance as 100 tokens, while Bob’s proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_B</span> shows Alice’s balance as 80 tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Proof Verification:</strong> The dispute resolution mechanism verifies the submitted proofs against the Merkle roots stored on-chain. It finds that Alice’s proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_A</span> is consistent with the on-chain state, while Bob’s proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_B</span> is invalid.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> As Alice’s proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_A</span> is valid and Bob’s proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi_B</span> is invalid, the dispute is resolved in favor of Alice. The resolution confirms that Alice’s final balance is indeed 100 tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Outcome Enforcement:</strong> The intermediate contract <span class=\"math\">IC_1</span> automatically updates the balances of Alice and Bob’s payment channels according to the resolution decision. Alice’s balance remains at 100 tokens, while Bob’s balance is adjusted based on the discrepancy. Additionally, Bob’s dispute bond of 10 tokens is forfeited and distributed as a reward to Alice for submitting a valid proof.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This example demonstrates how the dispute resolution mechanism ensures the integrity of the payment network by resolving conflicts based on the validity of the submitted zk-SNARK proofs and the Merkle roots stored on-chain, while also incentivizing honest behavior through the use of dispute bonds.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"comparison-to-alternative-approaches-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#comparison-to-alternative-approaches-24\"></a>Comparison to Alternative Approaches</h2>\n<p>The proposed decentralized payment network offers several advantages over alternative approaches, such as traditional blockchain-based payment systems and centralized payment networks.</p>\n<p>Compared to traditional blockchain-based payment systems, the proposed network provides higher scalability and privacy. The use of off-chain payment channels and zk-SNARKs enables faster and more private transactions, while the hierarchical smart contract structure and partitioned storage nodes enable more efficient processing and storage of transaction data.</p>\n<p>Compared to centralized payment networks, the proposed system offers greater security, transparency, and censorship resistance. By leveraging the security and immutability of blockchain technology and the privacy-preserving properties of zk-SNARKs, the network can provide a more secure and transparent payment infrastructure that is resistant to censorship and control by central authorities.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 6: Comparison to Centralized Payment Networks</strong></p>\n<p>Suppose a centralized payment network relies on a single trusted entity to process transactions and manage user balances. While this approach may offer high transaction throughput, it also presents several risks and limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Single point of failure</strong>: If the central entity experiences technical issues or becomes compromised, the entire payment network may become unavailable or vulnerable to fraud.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of transparency</strong>: Users must trust the central entity to manage their funds honestly and securely, without the ability to independently verify the state of their balances or the validity of transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Censorship risk</strong>: The central entity may choose to block or reverse transactions based on their own criteria, censoring users or restricting access to the payment network.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In contrast, the proposed decentralized payment network addresses these issues through its use of blockchain technology, zk-SNARKs, and a decentralized architecture:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: The network is maintained by a distributed network of storage nodes and smart contracts, eliminating the single point of failure and ensuring the availability and resilience of the system.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency and verifiability</strong>: Users can independently verify the state of their balances and the validity of transactions using the zk-SNARK proofs and the Merkle roots stored on-chain, providing a high level of transparency and trust in the system.</li>\n<li><strong>Censorship resistance</strong>: The decentralized nature of the network and the use of zk-SNARKs ensure that transactions cannot be easily censored or reversed by any single entity, preserving the freedom and autonomy of users.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This example highlights the significant advantages of the proposed decentralized payment network over centralized alternatives, providing a more secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant payment infrastructure for users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"analysis-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#analysis-25\"></a>Analysis</h1>\n<p>This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the security, privacy, and scalability properties of the proposed decentralized payment network, and compares it to alternative approaches.</p>\n<p>We delve into the technical details of the zk-SNARK implementation, discuss potential challenges and trade-offs, explore additional privacy-enhancing techniques, and consider the governance aspects of the system.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-analysis-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#security-analysis-26\"></a>Security Analysis</h2>\n<p>The security of the proposed network relies on the soundness and completeness of the zk-SNARK proofs, as well as the integrity of the hierarchical smart contract structure.

Let <span class=\"math\">c</span> denote the number of channels a node can handle, and let <span class=\"math\">T_{channel}</span> represent the time to process a transaction within a channel.</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nT_{channel} = T_{pg} + T_{nl} + T_{oh} = 70 \\text{ ms} \\quad (\\text{considering optimized conditions})\n</div>\n<p>Thus, the TPS per channel:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nTPS_{\\text{per channel}} = \\frac{1}{T_{channel}} = \\frac{1}{70 \\text{ ms} / 1000 \\text{ ms/s}} \\approx 14.29 \\text{ TPS}\n</div>\n<p>If each node can handle <span class=\"math\">c</span> channels, the total TPS per node considering channels would be:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nTPS_{\\text{node, channels}} = TPS_{\\text{per channel}} \\times c\n</div>\n<p>Assuming a node can handle 10,000 channels:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nTPS_{\\text{node, channels}} = 14.29 \\times 10,000 = 142,900 \\text{ TPS}\n</div>\n<p>For a network with <span class=\"math\">n</span> nodes, the total TPS could be:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nTPS_{\\text{total, channels}} = 142,900 \\times n\n</div>\n<h2><a name=\"real-world-micro-benchmarks-31\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#real-world-micro-benchmarks-31\"></a>Real-World Micro Benchmarks</h2>\n<p>To validate these theoretical calculations, we consider benchmarks from existing state channel implementations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Celer Network</strong>: Claims to handle up to 15,000 TPS per node.</li>\n<li><strong>Raiden Network</strong>: Aims for several thousand TPS per node.</li>\n<li><strong>Lightning Network</strong>: Estimates around 1,000 TPS per node in practical scenarios.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given these benchmarks, our assumption of handling 10,000 channels per node with approximately 14.29 TPS per channel, resulting in 142,900 TPS per node, is ambitious but within a reasonable range for a highly optimized implementation leveraging zk-SNARKs and efficient contract management.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"potential-bottlenecks-32\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#potential-bottlenecks-32\"></a>Potential Bottlenecks</h2>\n<p>Despite the promising scalability, several bottlenecks could impact performance:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Proof Generation and Verification</strong>: While zk-SNARKs are efficient, the complexity of proofs can increase with advanced use cases.</li>\n<li><strong>Network Latency</strong>: Global transactions can introduce delays that affect overall throughput.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart Contract Efficiency</strong>: Inefficiencies in smart contracts can create processing delays.</li>\n<li><strong>Storage and Data Management</strong>: Managing large numbers of channels and associated data could become challenging.</li>\n<li><strong>Node Reliability and Security</strong>: Ensuring the reliability and security of each node is critical.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Addressing these bottlenecks through ongoing optimization and robust infrastructure will be crucial to achieving the theoretical TPS and ensuring the network’s scalability and robustness.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-33\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#summary-33\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>The proposed decentralized payment network, leveraging zk-SNARKs and instant finality mechanisms, exhibits significant scalability potential.

The core components, such as the zk-SNARK proof generation and verification, are written in Rust for performance and security reasons. The smart contracts are developed using Solidity, while the frontend and client-side interactions are built with TypeScript.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specific-zk-snark-construction-39\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#specific-zk-snark-construction-39\"></a>Specific zk-SNARK Construction</h3>\n<p>The system employs the PLONK zk-SNARK construction, which offers universality, updatability, and efficient proof generation and verification. PLONK allows for the creation of a universal and updateable structured reference string (SRS) that can be reused across multiple circuits or applications, reducing the complexity and coordination overhead associated with repeated trusted setups.</p>\n<p>The PLONK circuits are designed using the arkworks library in Rust, which provides a set of tools and primitives for building zk-SNARK circuits compatible with the PLONK proving system. The library supports efficient constraint generation, witness computation, and proof generation, making it well-suited for the development of the decentralized payment network.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-and-optimizations-40\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#challenges-and-optimizations-40\"></a>Challenges and Optimizations</h3>\n<p>One of the main challenges in implementing PLONK is the complexity of designing and optimizing the circuits to take advantage of the universal SRS. This requires a deep understanding of the PLONK framework and the techniques for constructing efficient and secure circuits.</p>\n<p>To address this challenge, the implementation leverages various optimization techniques, such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Constraint system optimization: Minimizing the number of constraints in the circuit by using efficient gate design and layout techniques, such as gate aggregation and constant folding.</li>\n<li>Witness compression: Reducing the size of the witness by using compact data representations and eliminating redundant information.</li>\n<li>Proof aggregation: Batching multiple proofs together to reduce the overall proof size and verification cost.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These optimizations help to improve the performance and scalability of the PLONK-based zk-SNARK circuits, ensuring that the decentralized payment network can handle a high volume of transactions efficiently.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"integration-with-ethereum-41\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#integration-with-ethereum-41\"></a>Integration with Ethereum</h3>\n<p>The smart contracts for the payment network are implemented using Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The contracts interact with the PLONK proofs generated by the Rust components through a verification contract that is optimized for the PLONK proving system.</p>\n<p>The verification contract is designed to be gas-efficient and supports batch verification of PLONK proofs, allowing multiple proofs to be verified in a single transaction. This helps to reduce the overall cost and improve the throughput of the system.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"trusted-setup-ceremony-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#trusted-setup-ceremony-42\"></a>Trusted Setup Ceremony</h3>\n<p>As PLONK requires a trusted setup for the universal SRS, a multi-party computation (MPC) ceremony is conducted to generate the SRS. The ceremony involves multiple participants from different organizations and backgrounds, ensuring that no single party has control over the entire setup process.</p>\n<p>The MPC ceremony is organized and facilitated using secure computation frameworks, such as the ZEXE library, which provides a set of tools and protocols for conducting distributed key generation and parameter setup.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"concise-example-private-asset-transfer-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#concise-example-private-asset-transfer-43\"></a>Concise Example: Private Asset Transfer</h4>\n<p>In a private asset transfer, Alice can transfer assets to Bob without revealing the transaction details to the public. Using PLONK, Alice generates a proof π that verifies the validity of the transfer and her sufficient balance without disclosing the transaction amount Δ.</p>\n<p>Transfer <span class=\"math\">T = (A, B, \\pi)</span> where <span class=\"math\">\\pi</span> is the PLONK proof</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"math\">\\pi \\leftarrow \\text{generateProof}(A, B, \\Delta)</span></li>\n<li>Submit <span class=\"math\">(A, B, \\pi)</span> to the transfer contract</li>\n<li>Contract verifies <span class=\"math\">\\pi</span>\n<ul>\n<li>If <span class=\"math\">\\pi</span> is valid, execute transfer from <span class=\"math\">A</span> to <span class=\"math\">B</span></li>\n<li>Else, reject transfer</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The proof <span class=\"math\">\\pi</span> ensures the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"math\">B_A \\geq \\Delta</span> (Alice’s balance is sufficient)</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">B_A' = B_A - \\Delta</span> (Alice’s updated balance)</li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">B_B' = B_B + \\Delta</span> (Bob’s updated balance)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The smart contract executes the transfer only if the proof is valid, ensuring the transfer’s legitimacy without revealing the transaction details.</p>\n<p>By leveraging PLONK, the proposed decentralized payment network achieves a balance between privacy, scalability, and ease of implementation. The universal and updateable nature of PLONK, combined with the optimization techniques and secure trusted setup ceremony, provides a solid foundation for building a privacy-focused and efficient payment system.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"use-cases-for-privacy-44\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#use-cases-for-privacy-44\"></a>Use Cases for Privacy</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"confidential-voting-systems-45\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#confidential-voting-systems-45\"></a>Confidential Voting Systems</h3>\n<p>Confidential voting systems are a critical use case for enhanced privacy in decentralized networks. Voting systems must ensure that each vote is anonymous and secure while maintaining the integrity and transparency of the election process. By leveraging zk-SNARKs, our network can provide a solution that guarantees the confidentiality of votes while allowing for public verification of election results.</p>\n<p>In a confidential voting system built on the proposed network, voters would cast their votes through private transactions, with zk-SNARKs proving that each vote is valid and belongs to an eligible voter without revealing the voter’s identity. The votes would be tallied through a series of confidential transactions, with the final result verifiable through the aggregated Merkle roots stored on-chain. This approach ensures that the voting process is transparent and auditable while preserving the privacy of individual voters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"private-asset-transfers-46\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#private-asset-transfers-46\"></a>Private Asset Transfers</h3>\n<p>Private asset transfers are another significant use case for enhanced privacy in a decentralized network. These transfers require confidentiality to protect the financial privacy of users, ensuring that transaction details remain private while the integrity of the transfer is verifiable.</p>\n<p>With the proposed network, users can transfer assets through confidential payment channels, with zk-SNARKs proving the validity of the transactions without revealing the amounts or the identities of the parties involved. This feature is particularly valuable for businesses and individuals who wish to keep their financial transactions private, such as in the case of sensitive business deals, wealth management, or personal remittances.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"secure-health-records-management-47\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#secure-health-records-management-47\"></a>Secure Health Records Management</h3>\n<p>Secure health records management is an essential use case for enhanced privacy, where sensitive health information must be kept confidential while ensuring that authorized parties can verify the records. Using zk-SNARKs, the proposed network can enable the secure storage and sharing of health records while maintaining patient privacy.<br>\nIn this use case, health records would be stored off-chain, with zk-SNARKs proving the authenticity and integrity of the records without revealing their contents. Patients can grant access to their records to authorized parties, such as healthcare providers or insurance companies, through private transactions. The authorized parties can then verify the records’ authenticity using the zk-SNARK proofs, ensuring that the records have not been tampered with while preserving patient confidentiality.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"global-payment-system-48\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#global-payment-system-48\"></a>Global Payment System</h3>\n<p>A global payment system is perhaps the most scalable and impactful use case for a decentralized network with enhanced privacy. Such a system must provide sufficient privacy to protect user transactions while ensuring transparency and scalability to facilitate mass adoption. By leveraging zk-SNARKs, the proposed network can achieve a balanced privacy level that ensures transaction confidentiality without hindering scalability or regulatory compliance.</p>\n<p>In a global payment system built on the proposed network, users can transact through confidential payment channels, with zk-SNARKs proving the validity of transactions without revealing the amounts or the identities of the parties involved. This privacy level can be customized based on the specific requirements of different jurisdictions, ensuring compliance with local regulations while still preserving user privacy.</p>\n<p>To facilitate cross-border transactions and enable seamless interoperability with existing payment systems, the network can integrate with traditional financial institutions and payment processors through secure off-chain communication channels. These channels can leverage zk-SNARKs to prove the authenticity of transactions and balances without revealing sensitive information, enabling a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of decentralized privacy with the reach and stability of established financial networks.</p>\n<p>By leveraging zk-SNARKs in these use cases, the proposed decentralized payment network can provide enhanced privacy and scalability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. These examples illustrate how the network can achieve a balance between privacy and transparency, facilitating mass adoption while maintaining the necessary confidentiality.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-49\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#conclusion-49\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The proposed decentralized payment network offers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Higher Throughput:</strong> Comparable to or exceeding state channels and rollups.</li>\n<li><strong>Instant Finality:</strong> Superior to Optimistic Rollups.</li>\n<li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Reduces on-chain interactions and eliminates mining.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Privacy:</strong> Matches or surpasses ZK-Rollups.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The unique combination of features in the proposed network makes it a potentially more scalable and private solution compared to existing Layer 2 systems.<br>\nBy leveraging zk-SNARKs in these use cases, we can provide enhanced privacy and scalability, making our decentralized network suitable for a wide range of applications.

TL;DR</h1>\n<p>The ProbeLab team (<a href=\"https://probelab.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://probelab.io </a>) is carrying out a study on the performance of Gossipsub in Ethereum’s P2P network. Following from our previous post on the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/gossip-iwant-ihave-effectiveness-in-ethereums-gossipsusb-network/19686\">“Effectiveness of Gossipsub’s gossip mechanism”</a>, in this post we investigate the frequency of <code>GRAFT</code> and <code>PRUNE</code> messages and the dynamicity in terms of session duration and network stability that results from these protocol primitives. For the purposes of this study, we have built a tool called Hermes (<a href=\"https://github.com/probe-lab/hermes/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - probe-lab/hermes: A Gossipsub listener and tracer. </a>), which acts as a GossipSub listener and tracer. Hermes subscribes to all relevant pubsub topics and traces all protocol interactions. The results reported here are from a 3.5hr trace.</p>\n<p><strong>Study Description:</strong> The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency between <code>GRAFT</code> and <code>PRUNE</code> messages as a distribution and standard deviation per topic. We measure the session duration between our peer and other peers, split per client and attempt to identify any anomalies (e.g., too short connections) and potential patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <strong>Overall, we conclude that Gossipsub is keeping a stable mesh as far as the <code>MeshDegree</code> goes</strong>, barely exceeding the <code>DLow</code> and <code>DHigh</code> thresholds of 6 and 12, respectively, despite increased dynamicity at times (i.e., increased numbers of <code>GRAFTs</code> and <code>PRUNEs</code>). <strong>Teku nodes always tear down connections to our node within a few seconds (or less) and fail to keep any connection running for longer periods of time (even minutes).</strong> This fact is likely to lead to some instability, which, however, doesn’t seem to be impacting the correct operation of the rest of the network.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For more details and results on Ethereum’s network head over to <a href=\"https://probelab.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://probelab.io </a> for discv5 Weekly Network Health Reports.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1><a name=\"background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#background-2\"></a>Background</h1>\n<p>GossipSub is the most widely used libp2p PubSub routing mechanism. Gossipsub includes enhanced PubSub routing that aims to reduce the bandwidth by maintaining fewer connections per subscribed topic (through the mesh) and sending some sporadic message metadata for resilience purposes (through the gossip mechanism). This ensures that despite the message being broadcasted using the shortest latency path (mesh), the peers still have the backup of sharing <code>msg_ids</code> (gossip) to prevent missing messages that have already propagated through the network.</p>\n<p>Because GossipSub reduces the overall number of connected peers by topic, known as meshes, having enough peers on these is crucial for efficient message broadcasting in any network. These meshes work as a connectivity sub-layer under the libp2p connections, as there is no direct map between 1_libp2p_peer_connection ↔ 1_mesh_peer_connection.<br>\nThis differentiation provides efficiency to the protocol, as a peer doesn’t need to “waste” bandwidth sending full messages to more peers than the needed ones while avoiding to spam peers who already shared the same message.</p>\n<p>However, this means that the routing mechanism has to control how many peers it is connected to, or how many it needs to <code>GRAFT</code> (add) or <code>PRUNE</code> (remove) for each mesh, complicating things a little more.</p>\n<p>This report provides insights into the <code>GRAFT</code> and <code>PRUNE</code> events (Network Dynamicity), and RPC calls (Session Duration) that our <code>Hermes</code>-based node [<a href=\"https://github.com/probe-lab/hermes/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link to Hermes GH repo</a>] could track over 3.5 hours while participating in the Holesky testnet.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"results-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#results-3\"></a>Results</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"add-and-remove-peer-events-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#add-and-remove-peer-events-4\"></a>Add and Remove peer events</h3>\n<p>The stability of the network’s mesh relies heavily on the connections that the libp2p host keeps open.

There are two possible explanations for this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote nodes are dropping our connection for whatever reason (low peer score, or just sporadic <code>PRUNE</code> messages because their mesh is full), and our <code>Hermes</code> node counters this drop of peers by sending more <code>GRAFT</code> messages to keep it up with the <code>MeshDegree = 8</code> .</li>\n<li>We are sending too many <code>GRAFT</code> messages to rotate our peers and test the connection to other nodes in the network, which is countered by the remote peers by sending <code>PRUNE</code> messages as their mesh might be full already. Note that <code>Hermes</code> has an upper limit of 500 simultaneous connections, so we expect it to have a higher range of connected peers than other nodes in the network.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In any case, we do not consider this to be an alarming event and the increased number of events might just be due to increased network activity. We will verify that this is not an alarming case through further experiments in the near future, where we’ll collect traces for a longer period of time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"mesh-connection-times-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#mesh-connection-times-7\"></a>Mesh connection times</h3>\n<p>It is important to have a mix between steady connections and some rotation degree of these ones within each of the topic meshes. In fact, this level of rotation is the one that can guarantee that a node doesn’t end up eclipsed by malicious actors (although GossipSub-v1.1 does have the gossiping feature as well to overcome eclipse attempts).<br>\nThe following graphs show the average connection times per peer and per mesh.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/6/6/66fb050fc61e3129fb919dd9610a801b39b7ae25.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/66fb050fc61e3129fb919dd9610a801b39b7ae25\" title=\"connection_stability_cdf_per_topic\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/6/66fb050fc61e3129fb919dd9610a801b39b7ae25_2_517x309.png\" alt=\"connection_stability_cdf_per_topic\" data-base62-sha1=\"eH0vA0nEiO5mUfqQ6ocAdOGkhEN\" width=\"517\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/6/66fb050fc61e3129fb919dd9610a801b39b7ae25_2_517x309.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/6/66fb050fc61e3129fb919dd9610a801b39b7ae25_2_775x463.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/6/6/66fb050fc61e3129fb919dd9610a801b39b7ae25.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F9F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Measuring which is the average connection stability at the node level can showcase weird behaviours from the network.

To provide more clarity, we plot the connection duration (in seconds) split in 30min windows over the 3.5hr trace period.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/7/d7497c137c7f6a4f77e93f3c5bef2454db964bb5.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/d7497c137c7f6a4f77e93f3c5bef2454db964bb5\" title=\"connection-duration-30min-window-total\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/7/d7497c137c7f6a4f77e93f3c5bef2454db964bb5_2_517x309.png\" alt=\"connection-duration-30min-window-total\" data-base62-sha1=\"uIw5Yim5FCUnVAJqTD4ptHHYHo9\" width=\"517\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/7/d7497c137c7f6a4f77e93f3c5bef2454db964bb5_2_517x309.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/7/d7497c137c7f6a4f77e93f3c5bef2454db964bb5_2_775x463.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/7/d7497c137c7f6a4f77e93f3c5bef2454db964bb5.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F1F3F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Correlating the sudden spikes of GRAFT and PRUNE towards the end of the trace period, we find the following: the connections established over the first 2 hours and a half were indeed longer in duration.</p>\n<p>We have created graphs breaking down the connections by topic, by agent, and by both topic and agent for 30min windows.

This approach uses the Ethereum base layer as a universal and credibly neutral sequencer selection mechanism, intended as a fallback to based sequencing, in cases where based sequencing may not be suitable for an L2 to adopt fully. This is very much an initial proposal intended for general feedback, discussion and debate.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#proposal-1\"></a>Proposal</h1>\n<p>LimeChain’s proposal on <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/vanilla-based-sequencing/19379\">Vanilla Based Sequencing</a> describes two methods for selecting the sequencer on L2: primary selection, when the current L1 proposer has opted-in to be an L2 sequencer for the rollup, and fallback selection, when the current L1 proposer has <em>not</em> opted-in to be an L2 sequencer for the rollup, and hence some other method is required to select the L2 sequencer.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/vanilla-based-sequencing/19379#fallback-selection-12\">fallback selection mechanism</a>, the L2 selects an L1 proposer at random from the other opted-in L1 proposers to be the L2 sequencer. This method will work perfectly well, but limits the possibility for synchronous composability between rollups. A single L1 proposer that is also the designated sequencer on multiple rollups is able to offer guarantees that bundles of transactions will be executed atomically on the respective rollups. In the fallback selection mechanism, there is no longer a single L1 proposer sequencing for two or more rollups at the same time, and instead we have separate and distinct L1 proposers, and guarantees of atomic execution of transactions are no longer possible.</p>\n<p>To address this challenge, I propose to explore the idea of a deterministic sequencer selection function on L1 that can be used by any rollup. This would allow wallets or pre-confirmation gateways to identify which sequencers will be selected when, on which rollups, allowing them to route pre-confirmation requests accordingly.</p>\n<p>The high level idea is that a pre-confirmation gateway can accept a bundle of transactions, typically a pair of transactions to be executed on two distinct rollups, and can route the requests to the relevant sequencers on the respective rollups, obtaining the preconf promises for the user.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"requirements-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#requirements-2\"></a>Requirements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sequencers on L2s will need to be recorded via some central registry on L1 (perhaps an extension of the L1 <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/credibly-neutral-preconfirmation-collateral-the-preconfirmation-registry/19634\">pre-confirmation registry</a>), and will need to be able to issue pre-confirmations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pre-confirmations will probably need to be confirmed in 2 rounds instead of one. The first request is to place a lock on the preconfs (on a very short timeframe, in the order of 100s of milliseconds), and the second is to confirm. This will allow a pre-confirmation gateway (or wallet) to obtain a commitment that both sequencers on their respective rollups will issue a preconf promise, and when the sequencer has commitments from both, it can confirm the preconf requests and receive the preconf promises from both. The nomenclature gets a bit confusing here and will need to be thought about.  Alternatively, another potentially less complicated but less secure approach is to allow the pre-confirmation gateway to cancel a pre-confirmation upon only receiving a preconf promise from one but not both L2 sequencers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is a deterministic function in a smart contract on L1 which can be used to identify which L2 sequencer is going to be selected when on which rollup. This could leverage <code>prevrandao</code> via <code>block.difficulty</code> to provide a lookahead which L2s use to select sequencers on L2.  This could be as simple as function that acts as a PRF which accepts a lookahead size <span class=\"math\">n</span> measured in slots, and bounded range <span class=\"math\">r</span> corresponding to the number of L2 sequencers, and which references <code>block.difficulty</code> to return a list of random sequencers ids of size <span class=\"math\">n</span>, within the range <span class=\"math\">r</span>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>May require some collateral to incentivize L2 sequencers to honor preconf requests, and to keep the L1 registry up-to-date, though this last point could prove difficult to coordinate among L2s and will require some more thought.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>The fallback sequencer selection will be employed by L2s more frequently in the beginning, until enough L1 proposers opt-in to based sequencing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353\">We need at least 20% of Ethereum’s validator set to opt-in to based sequencing in order to have at least 1 proposer per epoch</a>. Moreover, these proposers will need to opt in to being sequencers for a number of rollups (assuming enough rollups will provision for this in their sequencer designs - tbd). All of this is against a background of numerous AVSs that could offer more economically attractive alternatives for proposers to opt into.</p>\n<p>Assuming we do reach the required threshold of 20% of the Ethereum validator set having opted-in to based sequencing (roughly 200K validators), depending on the design of decentralized L2s, they may not be able to support this many sequencers. For L2s that might seek to implement some form of consensus protocol using a validator set with a proposer selection mechanism, it may be impractical to support 200K validators. In this instance, having a credibly neutral sequencer selection mechanism would be helpful.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the fallback selection mechanism will likely to be continued to be employed by newer or smaller rollups in the future, before they can build a large enough share of L1 proposers that opt-in to being sequencers for their rollups. Again, in this instance, credibly neutral sequencer selection could be appealing.</p>\n<p>The fallback selection by itself doesn’t support universal synchronous composability, but synchronizing sequencer selection across rollups in a credibly neutral way (by using the L1), can facilitate USC.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"risks-and-trade-offs-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#risks-and-trade-offs-4\"></a>Risks and Trade-offs</h1>\n<p>Users will need to trust the crypto-economic guarantees of the respective L2s that they are seeking preconfs of atomic execution of transactions from. Even if the L2 sequencers are also L1 validators (note that they don’t need to be), users will still need to rely on the L2’s security.</p>\n<p>Under the primary selection method of the vanilla based sequencing approach, these security guarantees are improved somewhat, as we are dealing with a single L1 proposer for both rollups, and so their ability to offer guarantees of atomic transaction execution across L2s is improved.</p>\n<p>Assuming that the L1 proposer posts the data from each rollup to the L1, then we also benefit from the subjective finality of those transactions, and so we know within one slot if the respective transactions have been included or not. This also a strong assumption however, as it depends on the volume of transactions on L2, with most rollups waiting until they have enough transactions to completely fill a blob with compressed data, which may not happen within one L1 slot. So again, it falls back to the user relying on the crypto-economic security of the L2s themselves.</p>\n<p>This approach will of course require some buy-in from L2s that will need to implement the fallback sequencer selection, but this is also the case with based sequencing in general.</p>\n<p>A major trade-off is the increased complexity from managing atomic execution guarantees, as described in the requirements section above. This will likely involve a lock-and-confirm mechanism between L2 sequencers and the preconf gateways (or a user’s wallet), whereby the preconf gateway asks the sequencer to put a hold on a preconf for about a second, and then confirms that they want to go ahead with the preconf.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"open-questions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#open-questions-5\"></a>Open Questions</h1>\n<p>It’s not clear to me exactly how to incentivize L2s or L2 sequencers to keep the registry up-to-date. If an L2 sequencer ceases to participate as an L2 sequencer, the registry will need to reflect this. This challenge is addressed in mteam’s proposal for <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/credibly-neutral-preconfirmation-collateral-the-preconfirmation-registry/19634#penalties-4\">Credibly Neutral Preconfirmation Collateral</a>, and potentially the same registry could be used for L2 sequencers, but this needs to be explored. Using a separate registry could bloat the ecosystem with the redundant overhead of managing multiple registrations for based-sequencing proposers.</p>\n<p>There may be understandable apprehension from the ecosystem if the preconf gateways on L1 are used to route transactions to sequencers on L2s. This will cause even more centralization across the ecosystem, with potentially only 2 or 3 preconf gateways routing transactions across L1 and also a number of L2s. This could be improved through routing to individual sequencers via independent gateways on each L2, but this needs to be explored further.</p>\n<p>This proposal as it stands will not withstand L1 re-orgs.  It is an open question how the sequencer selection mechanism can be impervious to L1 re-orgs.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All questions, feedback, criticisms are very welcome.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-sequencer-selection/19747\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-sequencer-selection/19747","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 13:59:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19747"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-sequencer-selection/19747.rss","#text":"Based Sequencer Selection"},"filter":false},{"title":"An RSA Deterministic Key Generation Scheme: Algorithm and Security Analysis","dc:creator":"AshelyYan","category":"Cryptography","description":"<p>TL;DR: We propose a secure and practical deterministic key generation scheme and pseudorandom number generator, from which RSA keys can be generated to simplify key backup and retrieval.<br>\nThis research is a joint effort from Ethereum Fellows: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/mason-mind\">@Mason-Mind</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/georgesheth\">@georgesheth</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/dennis\">@dennis</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/u/ashelyyan\">@AshelyYan</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-1-introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-1-introduction-1\"></a>1. Introduction</h1>\n<p>Traditionally, cryptographic keys are generated using randomness to ensure unpredictability.<br>\nIn contrast, deterministic key generation refers to the process of generating cryptographic keys in a deterministic manner. In deterministic key generation, a single starting point (seed) is used to derive the keys using some Key Derivation Function (KDF). It brings some convenience in key management, however, also security risks and privacy concerns. The advantages can be concluded as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Streamlined key management: Users can generate a sequence of keys from the initial seed, eliminating the necessity to store multiple keys individually. Instead, they only need to safeguard the initial seed in order to secure all the derived keys.</li>\n<li>Simplified key backup and retrieval: Users can regenerate all the cryptographic keys from the initial seed, which simplifies the key retrieval.</li>\n<li>Meet the industry demand. Industry developers are always looking for this solution and has huge value to the product delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, in this function, if the seed is compromised, every derived key becomes vulnerable to potential threats. Therefore, it is important to keep the initial seed secure. Meanwhile, it is essential that the initial seed remains unpredictable to adversaries, for reasons that are self-evident.</p>\n<p>The main difficulty in designing a KDF is the initial keying material. When the source keying material is not uniformly random or pseudorandom, additional preprocessing is needed. In blockchain, there are some applications and solutions. <a href=\"https://eprints.qut.edu.au/82221/1/hdwallet.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hierarchical Deterministic Bitcoin Wallets</a> provide an interesting way of managing cryptographic keys, which form a tree structure. At the root, there is a randomly generated master seed. Using the deterministic key generation technique outlined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/70d9b07ab80ab3c267ece48f74e4e2250226d0cc/bip-0032.mediawiki\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BIP32</a> standard, this master seed can produce child keys. Since all the keys are generated deterministically, the same set of keys can be generated from the master seed. <a href=\"https://argon2.online/#:~:text=Argon2%20is%20cryptographic%20hashing%20algorithm,is%20optimized%20for%20password%20hashing.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Argon2</a> is another popular approach for key derivation. It is designed to be resistant against brute-force attacks. Argon2 improves security by using a salt and a password as inputs. The salt is a unique random value. The purpose of using salt is to prevent attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to apply brute-force attacks on passwords. Since unique salts are used, even if two users have the same password, their hashed values are still different.</p>\n<p>In this proposal, we consider a particular problem of deterministic key generation, which generates RSA keys from ECDSA signatures. We assume that each user has an ECDSA private key <span class=\"math\">sk</span>, and wants to generate an RSA key pair. Instead of generating the RSA key pair separately, we make the RSA key pair a deterministic function of <span class=\"math\">sk</span> and a fixed message <span class=\"math\">m</span>. Our goal is to make the RSA keys secure. In particular, we want the probability of RSA key collisions from different users to be negligible. Due to the nature of RSA key generation, it is not enough to generate a single random number and use it directly as the private key. Instead, we need a pseudorandom number generator. Due to this requirement, we cannot use the approaches that we discussed previously.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem, we propose a good deterministic key generation scheme and pseudorandom number generator, from which RSA keys can be generated. From a high level of the scheme, we pick the initial seed to be a signature <span class=\"math\">sig(m, sk)</span>. The hash of the signature is then used as the key of the AES cipher. The algorithm and security analysis can be found as follows.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-2-algorithm-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-2-algorithm-2\"></a>2. Algorithm</h1>\n<p>Our goal is to generate RSA keys securely and deterministically from ECDSA signatures. To achieve this goal, we use the standard procedure to generate RSA keys and a pseudorandom number generator <span class=\"math\">prng</span>, which provides all sources of randomness. The sequence that <span class=\"math\">prng</span> generates is a deterministic function of the ECDSA private key <span class=\"math\">sk</span> and the message <span class=\"math\">m</span>. Therefore, the same user always generates the same RSA key pair. But from the adversary’s point of view, the sequence that <span class=\"math\">prng</span> generates looks random. Hence the RSA keys are random.</p>\n<p>At a high level, we start with an ECDSA signature. We do not assume that the signature is pseudorandom. Instead, we assume it to be unforgeable. This implies that the signatures form a sufficiently large space. (Otherwise, the brute-force attack would succeed with non-negligible probability.) We also assume that SHA256 is a random oracle, which roughly means that the result of the hash function looks random to an adversary unless the adversary knows the preimage of the function. But since we already assumed that ECDSA signatures are unforgeable, the adversary knows the preimage of the hash function with negligible probability. We can safely conclude that the pseudorandom of the result of the hash function, which we use as the key to AES block cipher. We then get a good pseudorandom number generator, from which random keys can be generated.</p>\n<p>Algorithm 1 describes the details of the algorithm. Given an ECDSA private key <span class=\"math\">sk</span> and a message <span class=\"math\">m</span>, first sign <span class=\"math\">m</span> using <span class=\"math\">sk</span> to get an ECDSA signature <span class=\"math\">sig</span>. We then use SHA256 to hash <span class=\"math\">sig</span> to get a <span class=\"math\">key</span>, and set <span class=\"math\">seed</span> to be the hash of <span class=\"math\">key</span>.

Suppose that the probability of collision of keys generated by <span class=\"math\">generateKeyPair</span> is negligible, and the probability of collision of keys generated by <span class=\"math\">deGenKeyPair</span> is non-negligible. The adversary can generate a set of keys <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{K}</span>, and count the number of collisions in <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{K}</span>. If the number of collisions is negligible, then the keys are generated by <span class=\"math\">generateKeyPair</span>, otherwise, they are generated by <span class=\"math\">deGenKeyPair</span>.

Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Our approach begins by enabling users to sign a fixed message using their ECDSA secret keys, ensuring the unforgeability of these signatures against potential adversaries. Subsequently, we employ SHA256 to hash the generated signatures, producing pseudorandom output, with the assumption that SHA256 behaves as a dependable random oracle. This resulting hash serves as the key input for the AES block cipher, facilitating the creation of our PRNG. We provide rigorous proof of the security of this construction from indistinguishability, collusion-resistance and correctness.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/an-rsa-deterministic-key-generation-scheme-algorithm-and-security-analysis/19745\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/an-rsa-deterministic-key-generation-scheme-algorithm-and-security-analysis/19745","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 13:20:32 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19745"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/an-rsa-deterministic-key-generation-scheme-algorithm-and-security-analysis/19745.rss","#text":"An RSA Deterministic Key Generation Scheme: Algorithm and Security Analysis"},"filter":false},{"title":"BlockTech500 Index: Mitigating the greed and centralized mentalities stifling innovation and killing the true ethos","dc:creator":"cryptskii","category":"Meta-innovation","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/4/b45345d09be9f5b1ecace719e29ebfb6e9b9eb41.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/b45345d09be9f5b1ecace719e29ebfb6e9b9eb41\" title=\"IMG_8324.PNG\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/4/b45345d09be9f5b1ecace719e29ebfb6e9b9eb41_2_690x460.jpeg\" alt=\"IMG_8324.PNG\" data-base62-sha1=\"pJem370r1Ir13zPr9zQsM7xTaj7\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/4/b45345d09be9f5b1ecace719e29ebfb6e9b9eb41_2_690x460.jpeg, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/4/b45345d09be9f5b1ecace719e29ebfb6e9b9eb41_2_1035x690.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/4/b45345d09be9f5b1ecace719e29ebfb6e9b9eb41_2_1380x920.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E5DCD3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"backround-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#backround-2\"></a>Backround</h2>\n<p>In the early days of banking, the pitch or narrative presented to customers focused on a few key benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> Banks and early banking institutions like temples or palaces offered a secure place to store valuable commodities, such as grain, precious metals, and other goods. This was particularly important in ancient times when theft and insecurity were common.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> Banking institutions provided a convenient way to manage financial transactions. Instead of carrying large amounts of money or goods, individuals could deposit their wealth and make transactions through the bank, simplifying trade and commerce.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Facilitation of Trade:</strong> By acting as intermediaries, banks facilitated trade by providing loans and credit. This allowed merchants to finance their operations, expand their businesses, and engage in long-distance trade more effectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Record Keeping:</strong> Banks maintained detailed records of deposits, loans, and other transactions. This provided individuals and businesses with a reliable way to keep track of their financial activities and plan for the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Financial Services:</strong> Banks offered various financial services, such as currency exchange, loans, and credit. This enabled individuals and businesses to access funds when needed and manage their finances more effectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interest and Returns:</strong> Early banks often offered interest on deposits, providing an incentive for people to deposit their money rather than keeping it idle. This also allowed banks to use deposited<br>\nfunds for lending and investment, generating returns for both the bank and the depositor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stability and <span class=\"math\">Trust</span>:</strong> Over time, reputable banking institutions established a sense of stability and trust.

Instead, it addresses several critical societal and operational concerns:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Empowerment and Equity</strong>: Decentralization shifts the power from a centralized authority to multiple stakeholders, enabling a fairer distribution of power. This shift promotes equity, allowing individuals and smaller entities more influence over decisions that affect their lives and operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Community and Stakeholder Engagement</strong>: By involving more participants in the decision-making process, decentralization enhances community engagement. This involvement can lead to decisions that better reflect the diverse interests and needs of the broader community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transparency and Accountability</strong>: Decentralized systems often require mechanisms that make operations more transparent and participants more accountable. This openness can reduce corruption and increase trust among stakeholders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Innovation and Diversity of Thought</strong>: Decentralization encourages a wider range of ideas and solutions, fostering innovation. In a decentralized system, individuals and teams have the freedom to experiment and implement diverse solutions, which can lead to more creative and effective outcomes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Resilience Against Failures and Attacks</strong>: A decentralized structure is less prone to systemic failures and cyber attacks. Since there’s no central point of failure, challenges or breaches in one area do not cripple the entire system, making it more robust and reliable.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, when we discuss why we care about decentralization, we’re focusing on building systems that are equitable, inclusive, and designed to serve the broader interests of all stakeholders &amp; users involved, rather than just enhancing the profitability of a few. This approach not only strengthens the system’s ethical foundation but also its operational efficacy and societal impact.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"cause-for-concern-at-the-root-pain-points-for-startups-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#cause-for-concern-at-the-root-pain-points-for-startups-5\"></a>Cause for Concern at the Root (Pain Points for Startups):</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"centralization-in-grant-distribution-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#centralization-in-grant-distribution-6\"></a>Centralization in Grant Distribution</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Resource Allocation</strong>: Even in decentralized networks, there’s often a need to manage resources, including capital, in a way that ensures the ecosystem grows healthily. Foundations often steward these resources because they have the infrastructure to manage and distribute funds effectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quality Control</strong>: By funneling grants through foundations or similar bodies, the ecosystem can maintain a certain level of quality and coherence in development. This helps prevent fragmentation and ensures that projects align with the overall strategic goals of the blockchain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Initial Stages of Ecosystem Development</strong>: In the early phases of any blockchain ecosystem, more centralized control can help steer the project towards stability and maturity. As the ecosystem matures, mechanisms can be implemented to decentralize decision-making processes, including funding.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"implications-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#implications-7\"></a>Implications</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gatekeeping</strong>: Centralized funding can lead to gatekeeping, where only projects that align with the specific visions of the grant-giving bodies are funded. This can stifle innovation outside of those parameters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Influence Over Development</strong>: Foundations or core teams can significantly influence the direction of the blockchain’s development through funding decisions. This can potentially conflict with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dependency</strong>: Relying on central bodies for funding might create dependency, which could be problematic if the goals of the central body change or if it faces financial difficulties.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"vc-funding-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#vc-funding-8\"></a>VC Funding</h3>\n<p>Venture capitalists often look for proof of partnerships with established entities and early user adoption as indicators of a startup’s viability and potential for success.

The choice reflects the entity’s commitment either to maximizing profits for shareholders or to spreading power and benefits more evenly across its network of participants.

Let <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{U}</span> denote the universe of all eligible blockchain assets, and let <span class=\"math\">\\mathcal{I}_0 \\subseteq \\mathcal{U}</span> represent the initial index composition.</p>\n<p>As the blockchain ecosystem evolves over time, it will be necessary to periodically update the index composition to reflect the emergence of new technically meritorious projects. To this end, we propose the following asset addition process.</p>\n<p>This two-part methodology, consisting of a rigorous initial selection process and an ongoing asset addition/removal mechanism, is designed to maintain the <span class=\"math\">BlockTech500</span> index’s compositional legitimacy over time. By subjecting all assets, both initial and subsequent, to the same comprehensive technical evaluation process, we ensure that the index remains a true reflection of the most meritorious projects in the evolving blockchain landscape.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the use of a diverse panel of independent experts (DAO Governance Delegates) which need to be nominated and win enough user votes to be in the top voted on nominees so that they are allowed to stake <span class=\"math\">X</span> tokens and become a delegate and a transparent, scoring system helps to mitigate potential biases and conflicts of interest in the index construction process. The inclusion of a deliberative weight-setting process allows for the incorporation of qualitative expert judgment while still maintaining a high degree of objectivity and repeatability. To become a delegate of the DAO you must stake <span class=\"math\">X</span> amount of tokens and they must vote among themselves to come up with dispute resolutions. they too have rep scores, but not weighted ones in the sense of voting power. but those always opposing the majority vote, would risk being replaced for underperformance at each quarterly review and nomination and election cycle of delegates. as the lowest performing ones could be replaced by new nominees if the voters lean that way</p>\n<p>Ultimately, while no index construction methodology is perfect, we believe that the proposed approach strikes an appropriate balance between rigor, objectivity, and adaptability. By carefully managing the initial index composition and instituting a robust asset addition process, the <span class=\"math\">BlockTech500</span> index can serve as a legitimate and enduring benchmark for technical merit in the dynamic world of blockchain technology.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"comparisons-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#comparisons-23\"></a>Comparisons</h1>\n<p>Sure, let’s correct that section with a comparison to Messari.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Messari vs. BlockTech 500 Index</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Decentralization:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Messari:</strong> Provides comprehensive research and data analysis on various blockchain projects, including decentralization metrics.

Governance tokens and memecoins are two prominent types of tokens with contrasting roles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Governance Tokens</strong>: These tokens are typically used for voting, decision-making, and protocol governance within a blockchain network. They hold significant importance in controlling and influencing the network’s future direction. However, their critical role often results in low transaction frequency, as holders prefer to retain them for strategic governance purposes rather than regular transactions. This low velocity can lead to decreased liquidity and underutilization of their potential as a medium of exchange.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Memecoins</strong>: Designed for high-frequency transactions, memecoins are intended to be used as everyday transactional currency. They offer fast transaction times and are widely adopted for various payment activities. Despite their high velocity and liquidity, memecoins usually do not contribute to the network’s security or governance, leading to a separation between transactional utility and network governance.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This dichotomy creates a fragmented token economy where neither type of token fully exploits its potential, affecting the overall efficiency and stability of the blockchain ecosystem. Governance tokens remain largely inactive in everyday commerce, while memecoins, although frequently used, do not enhance the security or governance of the network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#problem-3\"></a>Problem</h2>\n<p>The key challenge within blockchain systems employing governance tokens and memecoins e.g. <span class=\"math\">(DOGE)</span> or “<span class=\"math\">Dogecoin</span>” revolve around the distinct usage intentions and transaction demands for each type of token. Governance tokens, typically used for voting and protocol governance, often lack incentives for regular transactions due to their importance in network control. This can lead to decreased liquidity and underutilization of the tokens’ potential as a medium of exchange. Conversely, memecoins are designed for high-frequency transactions but might not contribute significantly to network security or governance. This dichotomy results in a fragmented token economy where neither type fully exploits its potential, thus affecting the overall efficiency and stability of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposal-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#proposal-4\"></a>Proposal</h2>\n<p>To address these issues, an innovative system design is proposed dubbed “<span class=\"math\">TTTs</span>” or <strong>“Turtle Time Tokens”</strong>. <span class=\"math\">(TTTs)</span> have intentionally delayed transaction confirmation times to harmonize the economic roles of governance tokens and memecoins. By intentionally extending the confirmation time for governance token transactions, their velocity can be decreased, promoting value stability and encouraging use in strategic, high-value transactions or staking for governance purposes. Conversely, memecoins can serve as the primary medium for everyday transactions due to their faster confirmations, enhancing the blockchain’s usability and liquidity.</p>\n<p>This dual-token system aims to create a balanced distribution of token utility across different network activities, fostering a robust economic environment that supports both governance and rapid transaction needs. The decoupling of governance and transactional roles enhances the efficiency and stability of the blockchain ecosystem, ensuring that each token type serves its intended purpose effectively.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/e/5/e5c5edd5c4d97aa8cb0c718003700faed4f7b44f.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/e5c5edd5c4d97aa8cb0c718003700faed4f7b44f\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 1.14.24 PM\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/5/e5c5edd5c4d97aa8cb0c718003700faed4f7b44f_2_495x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 1.14.24 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"wMFoUkJClZXRAl9zN1YhaElUgDd\" width=\"495\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/5/e5c5edd5c4d97aa8cb0c718003700faed4f7b44f_2_495x500.jpeg, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/5/e5c5edd5c4d97aa8cb0c718003700faed4f7b44f_2_742x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/5/e5c5edd5c4d97aa8cb0c718003700faed4f7b44f_2_990x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"7C8674\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"breakdown-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#breakdown-5\"></a>Breakdown</h2>\n<p>The proposed solution aims to integrate the economic roles of governance tokens and memecoins more cohesively by altering transaction confirmation times and restricting the staking capabilities of the chosen memecoin being used as the native payment token, enhances the distinct utility of each token type, promoting a balanced and efficient blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"governance-tokens-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#governance-tokens-6\"></a>Governance Tokens:</h3>\n<p>By intentionally extending the confirmation time for governance token transactions, we can decrease their velocity, thus stabilizing their value and encouraging their use in more deliberate, high-value transactions or staking for governance purposes. This design leverages longer confirmation times to disincentivize frivolous use and preserve the tokens for strategic decisions and network support. Governance tokens, therefore, become more valuable for long-term network governance and security.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"wrapped-memecoins-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#wrapped-memecoins-7\"></a>Wrapped Memecoins:</h3>\n<p>Wrapped Dogecoin (wDOGE) and similar memecoins can serve as the primary medium for everyday transactions due to their faster confirmations, enhancing the blockchain’s usability and liquidity. To maintain this liquidity and usability, wrapped memecoins would be blocked from staking capabilities. This restriction ensures that memecoins remain liquid and readily available for transactions, preventing them from being locked up in staking contracts. By keeping memecoins out of staking, the focus for staking and network security remains on governance tokens.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"benefits-of-the-dual-token-system-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#benefits-of-the-dual-token-system-8\"></a>Benefits of the Dual-Token System</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Balanced Token Utility</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Governance Tokens</strong>: Used for high-value transactions, governance, and staking.

All else equal, a higher <span class=\"math\">U</span> should correspond to increased demand <span class=\"math\">D</span>, which we can model simply as:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nD = \\alpha U - \\beta P + \\epsilon\n</div>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">P</span> is the token price, <span class=\"math\">\\alpha</span>, <span class=\"math\">\\beta</span> are coefficients representing the sensitivity of demand to utility and price respectively, and <span class=\"math\">\\epsilon</span> captures all other demand factors. Therefore, the increase in utility from permitting <span class=\"math\">T_g</span> transactions should boost demand for governance tokens by <span class=\"math\">\\alpha \\Delta U</span>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"value-stability-and-velocity-impacts-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#value-stability-and-velocity-impacts-11\"></a>Value Stability and Velocity Impacts</h3>\n<p>With intentionally long confirmation times <span class=\"math\">\\tau_g</span> for <span class=\"math\">T_g</span> transactions creating a natural disincentive for using governance tokens in everyday payments and commerce compared to the memecoin with <span class=\"math\">\\tau_m</span> confirmations. This should reduce the velocity <span class=\"math\">V_g</span> of governance tokens. From the equation of exchange:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nMV = PQ\n</div>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">M</span> is money supply, <span class=\"math\">V</span> is velocity, <span class=\"math\">P</span> is price level, and <span class=\"math\">Q</span> is real economic output transacted in the token. Reduced <span class=\"math\">V_g</span> puts upward pressure on <span class=\"math\">P_g</span>. Compared to memecoins used for payments, this dynamic could make governance token prices <span class=\"math\">P_g</span> more stable.</p>\n<p>We can quantify the velocity difference as follows. Let <span class=\"math\">\\lambda_g</span> be the fraction of <span class=\"math\">M_g</span> governance tokens transacted per unit time and <span class=\"math\">\\lambda_m</span> be the equivalent for <span class=\"math\">M_m</span> memecoins. Assuming the confirmation time drives usage, the expected velocities are:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nV_g = \\frac{\\lambda_g}{\\tau_g}, \\quad V_m = \\frac{\\lambda_m}{\\tau_m}\n</div>\n<p>So the velocity ratio simplifies to:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\n\\frac{V_g}{V_m} = \\frac{\\lambda_g \\tau_m}{\\lambda_m \\tau_g}\n</div>\n<p>If <span class=\"math\">\\lambda_g \\approx \\lambda_m</span> (similar transaction demand) but <span class=\"math\">\\tau_g \\gg \\tau_m</span>, then <span class=\"math\">V_g \\ll V_m</span>. Memecoins should have much higher velocity and be the dominant medium of exchange.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"fee-revenue-and-security-budget-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#fee-revenue-and-security-budget-12\"></a>Fee Revenue and Security Budget</h3>\n<p>However, the governance token transactions <span class=\"math\">T_g</span>, though slower, still generate fee revenue for validators. If <span class=\"math\">T_g</span> transactions are a fraction <span class=\"math\">\\phi</span> of all transactions and the average fee is <span class=\"math\">\\bar{f}</span>, then the expected security budget from governance token usage is:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nB_g = \\phi \\bar{f} \\lambda_g M_g\n</div>\n<p>Compared to a system with only memecoins, this design increases the total security budget by <span class=\"math\">B_g</span>, without inflating <span class=\"math\">V_m</span> and putting downward pressure on <span class=\"math\">P_m</span>.

Conversely, governance staking and protocol utility create a strong incentive to hold governance tokens despite their slower transactability.</p>\n<p>In essence, the system economically “prices in” the opportunity cost of using scarce governance tokens in transactions through the longer confirmation times <span class=\"math\">\\tau_g</span>. This encourages efficient allocation between staking and transacting. At the margin, a user should only transact a governance token if the economic gain exceeds the time value and staking opportunity cost.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"memecoin-stability-and-single-purpose-design-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#memecoin-stability-and-single-purpose-design-14\"></a>Memecoin Stability and Single-Purpose Design</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, a key factor in a memecoin’s potential stability is its focused, single-purpose design optimized for payments. Unlike governance tokens or more complex multi-purpose tokens, a memecoin like Dogecoin aims to excel at one core function: facilitating fast, cheap, and reliable transactions.</p>\n<p>This specialization has several potential benefits for stability:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reduced Exposure to Protocol-Level Risks</strong>: By being used across multiple networks, a memecoin can diversify its risk exposure. Even if a particular network experiences issues or a decline in the perceived value of its governance token, the memecoin’s value may remain more stable given its usage and acceptance on other chains.</li>\n<li><strong>Network Effect and Lindy Effect</strong>: As a memecoin gains adoption as a payment method across multiple platforms, it can benefit from a strong network effect. The more users and merchants accept it, the more valuable and stable it becomes. Over time, this can create a self-reinforcing cycle of stability (the Lindy effect).</li>\n<li><strong>Decoupling from Platform Innovation</strong>: A payment-focused memecoin’s value is less strongly coupled to the technological progress and innovations of any single platform. As long as it continues to meet its core payment functionality, its value can remain relatively stable even if some networks advance faster than others.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can formalize this concept of a memecoin’s “stability advantage” <span class=\"math\">SA</span> over a platform-specific governance token as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nSA = \\frac{\\sigma_g}{\\sigma_m}\n</div>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">\\sigma_g</span> is the price volatility of the governance token and <span class=\"math\">\\sigma_m</span> is the price volatility of the memecoin. All else equal, we would expect <span class=\"math\">SA &gt; 1</span> for a widely adopted memecoin used across many platforms.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"quantifying-cross-platform-adoption-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#quantifying-cross-platform-adoption-15\"></a>Quantifying Cross-Platform Adoption</h3>\n<p>The stability advantage of a cross-platform memecoin depends heavily on the degree and distribution of its adoption across networks. We can quantify this “adoption spread” <span class=\"math\">A_s</span> as:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nA_s = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{T_i}{T}\\right)^2\n</div>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">N</span> is the total number of networks the memecoin is used on, <span class=\"math\">T_i</span> is the transaction volume on the <span class=\"math\">i</span>-th network, and <span class=\"math\">T</span> is the total transaction volume across all networks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">A_s</span> ranges from 0 to <span class=\"math\">1 - \\frac{1}{N}</span>, with higher values indicating more evenly spread adoption. An <span class=\"math\">A_s</span> close to 0 means the memecoin is heavily dominated by usage on a single network, while a value close to <span class=\"math\">1 - \\frac{1}{N}</span> indicates relatively equal adoption across all <span class=\"math\">N</span> networks.</p>\n<p>Putting it together, we can propose a simple model for the stability <span class=\"math\">S</span> of a cross-platform memecoin:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nS = k \\cdot A_s \\cdot SA\n</div>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">k</span> is a constant reflecting other factors like overall cryptocurrency market conditions. This suggests that a memecoin’s stability is driven by both its inherent stability advantage over platform-specific tokens and the breadth of its adoption across platforms.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"factors-contributing-to-stability-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#factors-contributing-to-stability-16\"></a>Factors Contributing to Stability</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Increased Liquidity</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Widespread Use</strong>: As <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> is adopted across multiple blockchains, its liquidity would increase. High liquidity typically reduces price volatility, as large trades can be absorbed without significantly affecting the price.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity Pools</strong>: Enhanced liquidity pools and decentralized exchanges on multiple blockchains would facilitate seamless conversion and trading, further stabilizing the price.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Broad Network Effect</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adoption and Usage</strong>: The more widely <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> is used, the stronger its network effect becomes. As more merchants, users, and platforms accept and use <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> for payments, its utility and trust increase, contributing to price stability.</li>\n<li><strong>Lindy Effect</strong>: The longer <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> is used successfully, the more likely it is to continue being used, enhancing its reputation and perceived stability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Diversified Risk</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cross-Platform Stability</strong>: By being used on multiple blockchains, $wDOGE$’s value is less tied to the performance or issues of any single blockchain. This diversification reduces the risk of value fluctuations due to problems on one specific network.</li>\n<li><strong>Decoupling from Governance</strong>: Since <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> is not used for governance or staking, its value is decoupled from the complexities and risks associated with network governance decisions and staking economics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"economic-model-for-stability-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#economic-model-for-stability-17\"></a>Economic Model for Stability</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Supply and Demand Dynamics</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stable Demand</strong>: As <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> becomes a preferred payment token across multiple blockchains, the consistent demand for transactions helps stabilize its value.</li>\n<li><strong>Predictable Supply</strong>: Assuming the supply of wrapped Dogecoin is managed effectively (e.g., through minting and burning mechanisms that maintain a 1:1 peg with the original Dogecoin), the predictability in supply further contributes to price stability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Velocity of Money</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Velocity</strong>: <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> ’s use in frequent, everyday transactions ensures high velocity. According to the equation of exchange <span class=\"math\">(MV = PQ)</span> (where <span class=\"math\">(M)</span> is money supply, <span class=\"math\">(V)</span> is velocity, <span class=\"math\">(P)</span> is price level, and <span class=\"math\">(Q)</span> is real output), high velocity helps maintain a stable <span class=\"math\">(P)</span> if <span class=\"math\">(Q)</span> (transaction volume) is also high and stable.</li>\n<li><strong>Transactional Stability</strong>: As <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> is used primarily for payments, the consistent transaction volume across multiple blockchains contributes to its price stability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"benefits-of-stabilized-wdoge-for-payments-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#benefits-of-stabilized-wdoge-for-payments-18\"></a>Benefits of Stabilized <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> for Payments</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reliable Medium of Exchange</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price Stability</strong>: With reduced volatility, <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> becomes a more reliable medium of exchange, encouraging its use in everyday transactions without concerns over significant value changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Merchant Adoption</strong>: Merchants are more likely to accept a stable token for payments, reducing the risk of loss due to price fluctuations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User Confidence</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trust and Acceptance</strong>: Stability fosters trust among users, making them more comfortable holding and transacting with <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span>.</li>\n<li><strong>Wider Adoption</strong>: As user confidence grows, wider adoption follows, creating a positive feedback loop that further stabilizes the token’s value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integration with Financial Systems</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easier Integration</strong>: A stable payment token can be more easily integrated with traditional financial systems, such as point-of-sale systems, online payment gateways, and financial services.</li>\n<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong>: Stability can also make it easier to comply with regulatory requirements, as regulators often favor less volatile assets for payment purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Widespread adoption of  e.g. <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> across multiple blockchains has the potential to significantly stabilize its value, making it an even more effective and reliable payment token. The increased liquidity, broad network effect, diversified risk, and stable supply and demand dynamics contribute to this stability. A stable Memecoin enhances user confidence, encourages merchant adoption, and facilitates integration with traditional financial systems, promoting its use as a preferred medium of exchange in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"advantages-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#advantages-19\"></a>Advantages</h2>\n<p>Allowing fungible governance tokens to be spent but with slower confirmations than memecoins is a powerful tokenomic design pattern. It creates a natural separation in token utility and incentivizes staking while still harnessing transactional usage for security. More broadly, it illustrates how subtle technical choices like confirmation times can be deeply interlinked with a cryptocurrency’s economic structure and incentives.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"applications-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#applications-20\"></a>Applications</h2>\n<p>Improving our understanding of these tokenomic principles can help inform the rational engineering of future blockchain networks. Despite these challenges, the potential of a widely adopted, cross-platform memecoin to achieve relative stability compared to platform-specific tokens remains compelling. As decentralized networks continue to evolve, observing the dynamics of payment-focused memecoins like <span class=\"math\">Dogecoin</span> can provide valuable insights into the future of cryptocurrency stability and adoption.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"comparisons-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#comparisons-21\"></a>Comparisons</h2>\n<p>The proposed dual-token system with differentiated confirmation times using <span class=\"math\">TTTs</span> for governance tokens and memecoins like <span class=\"math\">DOGE</span>, is a novel approach to harmonizing the economic roles of different token types in blockchain networks. To better understand its potential impact and significance, it’s essential to compare it with other leading concepts and approaches in this area.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dual-Token Economies</strong>: The idea of using multiple token types within a single blockchain ecosystem is not new. Several projects, such as Decred and Cosmos, have implemented dual-token economies to separate the roles of staking, governance, and transactions. However, the proposed system takes this concept further by introducing differentiated confirmation times to optimize the utility and stability of each token type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stablecoin Designs</strong>: Stablecoins, such as Tether <span class=\"math\">(USDT)</span> and USD Coin <span class=\"math\">(USDC)</span>, have gained popularity as a means to mitigate the volatility of cryptocurrencies. These tokens are typically pegged to a stable asset, like the US dollar, to maintain a consistent value. While the proposed system’s memecoin (e.g., <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span>) is not explicitly designed as a stablecoin, its focus on payments and stability shares some similarities with stablecoin concepts. The key difference lies in the approach to achieving stability - through widespread adoption and decoupling from governance, rather than an explicit peg.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Velocity Reduction Mechanisms</strong>: Some projects have explored mechanisms to reduce token velocity and encourage holding, such as transaction fees, demurrage, or time-locked staking. The proposed system’s extended confirmation times for governance tokens can be seen as a novel velocity reduction mechanism that aligns with the token’s intended use case. This approach is more organically tied to the network’s economic incentives compared to external mechanisms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interoperability and Cross-Chain Adoption</strong>: The proposed system emphasizes the importance of widespread adoption of memecoins like <span class=\"math\">wDOGE</span> across multiple blockchains. This aligns with the growing trend of interoperability and cross-chain solutions in the blockchain space. Projects like Polkadot, Cosmos, and Chainlink are working on enabling seamless communication and value transfer between different blockchains. The proposed system can leverage these advancements to facilitate the widespread adoption and stability of memecoins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Economic Incentive Design</strong>: The field of tokenomics focuses on designing incentive structures that align the behavior of network participants with the overall goals of the system. The proposed dual-token system is a prime example of economic incentive design, as it creates a clear separation of roles and incentives for governance token holders and memecoin users. This approach is in line with the ongoing research and experimentation in the field of tokenomics.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While the proposed system introduces novel concepts, such as differentiated confirmation times and the specific focus on memecoins like wDOGE, it also builds upon and complements existing approaches in the blockchain space. The emphasis on stability, interoperability, and incentive alignment is consistent with the general direction of the industry.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#conclusion-22\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The design choices for blockchain governance and payment tokens have far-reaching implications for network dynamics, user behavior, and overall economic stability. By leveraging different confirmation times for governance and payment tokens, we can create a balanced ecosystem that encourages efficient token usage, enhances security, and promotes long-term stability. Further research and comparative analysis will continue to refine these models and inform the development of robust and scalable blockchain systems.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/integrating-governance-tokens-and-memecoins-a-dual-token-system-for-enhanced-blockchain-efficiency-and-stability/19707\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/integrating-governance-tokens-and-memecoins-a-dual-token-system-for-enhanced-blockchain-efficiency-and-stability/19707","pubDate":"Sat, 01 Jun 2024 17:16:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19707"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/integrating-governance-tokens-and-memecoins-a-dual-token-system-for-enhanced-blockchain-efficiency-and-stability/19707.rss","#text":"Integrating Governance Tokens and Memecoins: A Dual-Token System for Enhanced Blockchain Efficiency and Stability"},"filter":false},{"title":"Strawmanning Based Preconfirmations","dc:creator":"linoscope","category":"Layer 2","description":"<p>By <a href=\"https://twitter.com/linoscope\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lin Oshitani</a> (Nethermind Research).

Additionally, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353\">based preconfirmations</a> provide fast preconfirmation services on top of based sequencing, significantly enhancing the user experience as a result. However, compared to non-preconfirming based sequencing, naive implementations of based preconfirmations introduce negative externalities that require thoughtful consideration. Although issues have been highlighted in works such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3o2YP6sxpg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this Bell Curve episode</a> (mainly in the context of non-based sequencers) and <a href=\"https://research.chainbound.io/examining-the-based-sequencing-spectrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this write-up</a> from Chainbound, we believe the topic remains largely underexplored.</p>\n<p>In this post, we will analyze a simple “strawman” preconfirmation setup, identify its shortcomings, and shed light on the challenges that future solutions must address.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-strawman-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#the-strawman-2\"></a>The Strawman</h1>\n<p>The strawman based preconfirmation setup is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The L1 proposer may or may not delegate the preconf right to some external entity.\n<ul>\n<li>We use the term <em>preconfer</em> to describe the entity providing preconfirmations, which can either be the L1 proposer itself or an entity delegated from the L1 proposer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The preconfer handles preconfirmations by providing two endpoints:\n<ul>\n<li>Request endpoint: For users and searchers to request preconfirmations.</li>\n<li>Promise endpoint: For streaming the preconf results to the public. It enables the preconfirmation requester to promptly receive the result while allowing other users to stay updated on the latest preconfirmed state before initiating their own preconfirmations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Users will include a “preconf tip” to the requests to incentivize preconfers to provide preconfirmations.</li>\n<li>The preconfer preconfirms transactions primarily on a first-come-first-serve basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/6/2/62f461e44a685f6ecf9401c8c6ad62689a826ec1.jpeg\" alt=\"Based Preconf (2) (1)\" data-base62-sha1=\"e7onuIzRDpwD9KD1j3CE3w7YPDP\" width=\"649\" height=\"282\"></p>\n<p>Furthermore, because they are significantly more complex to design and implement, we focus solely on execution promises. Execution promises guarantee the exact sequence and state of a transaction. In contrast, inclusion promises only ensure that a transaction will be included without specifying the conditions of its inclusion.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-problems-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#the-problems-3\"></a>The Problems</h1>\n<p>We will cover six problems with the strawman based preconfirmation design:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem 1: Latency races</li>\n<li>Problem 2: Congestion</li>\n<li>Problem 3: Tip pricing</li>\n<li>Problem 4: Fair exchange</li>\n<li>Problem 5: Liveness</li>\n<li>Problem 6: Early auctions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-1-latency-races-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#problem-1-latency-races-4\"></a><strong>Problem 1: Latency races</strong></h2>\n<p>Whoever has the lowest latency to the preconfer gains all the MEV <a href=\"https://docs.cow.fi/mevblocker/concepts/mev-concepts/what-is-backrunning\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">back-running profit</a>. This is because they can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be the first to obtain the latest state of the chain through the promise endpoint and</li>\n<li>be the first to insert their back-run transaction via the request endpoint.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This structure has historically <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/130/4/1547/1916146\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">incentivized <em>latency races</em></a>, where network participants strive to minimize latency to the limit. Eventually, this would lead to searchers choosing to colocate or vertically integrate with preconfers, which significantly risks the network’s <a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/decentralized-crypto-needs-you-to-be-a-geographical-decentralization-maxi/1385\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">geographical decentralization</a>.</p>\n<p>Such latency races have been a long-lasting concern for existing centralized sequencers. For example, the Arbitrum team has explored the idea of <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1504\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">implementing Proof of Work</a> (PoW) where they grant fast connections to participants who succeed in PoW while imposing artificial delays on participants who do not. However, this proposal encountered <a href=\"https://research.arbitrum.io/t/thoughts-on-arbitrums-proposal-to-score-connections-by-pow/8121\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">backlash from the community</a> due to the substantial economic waste introduced.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-2-congestion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#problem-2-congestion-5\"></a>Problem 2: Congestion</h2>\n<p>Given that L2 transaction fees are typically low, searchers may choose to avoid latency races altogether and instead flood the rollup with probabilistic arbitrage attempts. This can be done by spamming an arbitrage contract that attempts an arbitrage and rollbacks if it fails. In Solana, where the fee is extremely low, it has been <a href=\"https://www.jito.network/blog/solving-the-mev-problem-on-solana-a-guide-for-stakers/#:~:text=Solana%20validators%20are%20wasting%20more%20than%2058%25%20of%20their%20time%20processing%20failed%20arbitrages\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">reported</a> that validators waste ~58% of their time processing such failed arbitrage transactions.</p>\n<p>This would result in a situation resembling pre-Flashbots <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">priority gas auctions</a>, where the competition among searchers congests the block space with failed arbitrage transactions, ultimately driving up gas fees for regular users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-3-tip-pricing-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#problem-3-tip-pricing-6\"></a>Problem 3: Tip pricing</h2>\n<p>The preconfer must solve an <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@EspressoSystems/bft-and-proposer-promised-preconfirmations#:~:text=online%20MEV%20maximization%20problem\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">online MEV problem</a>, where they decide whether to preconf a transaction with no/limited visibility to other transactions that compete for the same position. For example, suppose the preconfer receives a preconf request with 1 ETH tip. How would the preconfer know that the tip is appropriately priced? Should they accept the tip and preconf immediately or wait for a while in case there is another request with a higher tip?</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-4-fair-exchange-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#problem-4-fair-exchange-7\"></a>Problem 4: Fair exchange</h2>\n<p>The preconfer can withhold preconf promises and not return them to the user in a timely manner. Note that preconfers are incentivized to withhold preconf promises as much as possible to maximize their opportunity to reorder and insert transactions, thereby increasing their MEV.</p>\n<p>As an extreme example, the preconfer could withhold all promises during its window (12 sec or more), reorder and inject txs as it wishes, and only publish the promises when the final tx batch is submitted to L1.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-5-liveness-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#problem-5-liveness-8\"></a>Problem 5: Liveness</h2>\n<p>For the case when the proposer delegates the preconfirming rights to an external preconfer, the liveness and censorship resistance of the preconfirmations will rely solely on this single external entity for the duration of the preconfer’s slot(s).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"problem-6-early-auctions-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#problem-6-early-auctions-9\"></a>Problem 6: Early auctions</h2>\n<p>Any system with L1 composable preconfirmations (i.e., preconfirmation of L1 transactions) will likely result in <em>preconfer-builder integration,</em> where preconfer and builder become the same entity. This is for two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With L1 preconfirmations, most cross-domain MEV, including CEX-DEX arbitrage, will be captured through preconfirmed transactions.\n<ul>\n<li>Considering the bulk of MEV revenue comes from CEX-DEX arbitrage, this means that most MEV revenue will be secured through preconfirmations. Consequently, the revenue from building the non-preconfirmed portion of the block will be greatly reduced.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Preconfed L1 transactions must be included at the top of the current block.\n<ul>\n<li>Inserting any transactions before a preconfirmed transaction could alter the state anticipated by the preconfirmation, potentially invalidating the preconfirmation guarantee. This means builders must constantly incorporate the latest preconfed transactions into their blocks, which would be extremely difficult, if not unfeasible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Combined with preconf delegation happening ahead of the proposer’s slot, preconfer-builder integration leads us to a world where L1 proposers delegate their preconfirmation rights <em>and block-building rights</em> to the same external entity <em>ahead of time</em> for their slot.</p>\n<p>Selecting the block builder in advance, known as <em>early auctions</em>, contrasts sharply with the current MEV-Boost PBS pipeline, where block builders are dynamically chosen <em>just-in-time</em> (<em>JIT</em>) within the slot through block auctions. More details comparing JIT auctions and early auctions can be found <a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/when-to-sell-your-blocks/2814\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The goal of based sequencing is to inherit the security of L1. However, with based preconfirmations, we risk altering the security landscape of the underlying L1 itself. Although early auctions might not be entirely detrimental (further research and experimentation are needed), they represent a fundamental shift from the current MEV-Boost builder market. Therefore, they should be introduced with great care, especially when introduced off-protocol, where control over centralization tendencies is limited.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>We observed that naive implementations of preconfirmations can lead to various negative externalities.

This post is reporting the first of a list of metrics that the team will be diving into, namely, how efficient is Gossipsub’s gossip mechanism. For the purposes of this study, we have built a tool called Hermes (<a href=\"https://github.com/probe-lab/hermes/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - probe-lab/hermes: A Gossipsub listener and tracer.</a>), which acts as a GossipSub listener and tracer. Hermes subscribes to all relevant pubsub topics and traces all protocol interactions. The results reported here are from a 3.5hr trace.</p>\n<p><strong>Study Description:</strong> The purpose of this study is to identify the ratio between the number of <code>IHAVE</code> messages sent and the number of <code>IWANT</code> messages received from our node. This should be done both in terms of overall messages, but also in terms of <code>msgIDs</code>. This metric will give us an overview of the effectiveness of Gossipsub’s gossip mechanism, i.e., how useful the bandwidth consumed by gossip messages really is.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <strong>The effectiveness of Gossipsub’s gossip mechanism, i.e., the <code>IHAVE</code> and <code>IWANT</code> message exchange is not efficient in the Ethereum network.</strong> Message ratios between Sent <code>IHAVEs</code> and Received <code>IWANTs</code> can reach to more than 1:50 for some topics. Suggested optimisations and things to investigate to improve effectiveness are given at the end of this report.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overall-results-sent-ihaves-vs-received-iwant-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#overall-results-sent-ihaves-vs-received-iwant-2\"></a>Overall Results - Sent IHAVEs vs Received IWANT</h2>\n<p>The plots below do not differentiate between different topics. They present aggregates over all topics. The ratio of sent <code>IHAVEs</code> vs received <code>IWANTs</code> does not seem extreme (top plot) with a ratio of less than 1:2, but digging deeper into the number of <code>msgIDs</code> carried by those <code>IHAVE</code> and <code>IWANT</code> messages shows a different picture (middle plot). The ratio itself for all three topics are given in the third (bottom plot), where we see that especially for the beacon_block topic the ratio is close to 1:100 and going a lot higher at times.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/7/27e3878da92a987de30755da843003d2390d2852.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/27e3878da92a987de30755da843003d2390d2852\" title=\"gossip_control_msgs_sent_ihave_vs_recv_iwant_messages\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/7/27e3878da92a987de30755da843003d2390d2852_2_517x309.png\" alt=\"gossip_control_msgs_sent_ihave_vs_recv_iwant_messages\" data-base62-sha1=\"5GS6guu22d7JvCUaDaT4M9KpCjE\" width=\"517\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/7/27e3878da92a987de30755da843003d2390d2852_2_517x309.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/7/27e3878da92a987de30755da843003d2390d2852_2_775x463.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/7/27e3878da92a987de30755da843003d2390d2852.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F8F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/1/6/169e349eb5bf6f5eae425791f895e9ae32a5a41d.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/169e349eb5bf6f5eae425791f895e9ae32a5a41d\" title=\"gossip_control_msgs_sent_ihave_vs_recv_iwant_message_ids\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/6/169e349eb5bf6f5eae425791f895e9ae32a5a41d_2_517x309.png\" alt=\"gossip_control_msgs_sent_ihave_vs_recv_iwant_message_ids\" data-base62-sha1=\"3e5spcR8uui86liVE47bS1wp1oN\" width=\"517\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/6/169e349eb5bf6f5eae425791f895e9ae32a5a41d_2_517x309.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/6/169e349eb5bf6f5eae425791f895e9ae32a5a41d_2_775x463.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/1/6/169e349eb5bf6f5eae425791f895e9ae32a5a41d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/a/3/a37bfd19efcd740d899634ae0d27a92413c2cb2e.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/a37bfd19efcd740d899634ae0d27a92413c2cb2e\" title=\"gossip_control_msgs_ration_of_sent_ihave_vs_recv_iwant_message_ids_all_topics\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/3/a37bfd19efcd740d899634ae0d27a92413c2cb2e_2_517x309.png\" alt=\"gossip_control_msgs_ration_of_sent_ihave_vs_recv_iwant_message_ids_all_topics\" data-base62-sha1=\"nkfth88x4NjdAsKzgTt6Hkoeym2\" width=\"517\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/3/a37bfd19efcd740d899634ae0d27a92413c2cb2e_2_517x309.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/3/a37bfd19efcd740d899634ae0d27a92413c2cb2e_2_775x463.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/a/3/a37bfd19efcd740d899634ae0d27a92413c2cb2e.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F6F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"per-topic-results-sent-ihaves-vs-received-iwant-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#per-topic-results-sent-ihaves-vs-received-iwant-3\"></a>Per Topic Results - Sent IHAVEs vs Received IWANT</h2>\n<p>Next, we’re diving into the ratio <em>per topic</em> to get a better understanding of the gossip effectiveness for each topic.

By leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for enhanced computational capabilities, DamFi ensures efficient and trustless fund operations. Moreover, DamFi can integrate with external DeFi protocols like EigenLayer, and theoretically any other DeFi protocol, to maximize investment flexibility and diversification.</p>\n<p>Motivation:<br>\nThe motivation behind creating DamFi stemmed from a desire to simplify the investment process for the average person. In traditional finance, ETFs provide a straightforward way to invest in a diversified portfolio with minimal effort. However, the DeFi space lacked a comparable analogue due to the limitations of smart contract technology. With the advent of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), we recognized an opportunity to overcome these limitations. ZKPs enable efficient off-chain computations with proofs uploaded on-chain, allowing us to create On-Chain Autonomous Funds (OAFs) that function similarly to ETFs, making decentralized investing accessible and straightforward for everyone.</p>\n<p>Introduction:<br>\nCurrent crypto investment management often requires significant user involvement and active management. DamFi addresses this by offering automated, on-chain investment funds that adapt to market conditions without requiring constant oversight, making them ideal for both novice and experienced investors.</p>\n<p>Core Features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>On-Chain Autonomous Funds (OAFs):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated rebalancing and management of crypto assets.</li>\n<li>Designed to function similarly to traditional ETFs in a decentralized context.</li>\n<li>Diversified investing solution for both retail and institutional investors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ZKPs enhance computational capabilities by performing calculations off-chain.</li>\n<li>Proofs are uploaded on-chain to ensure efficient and trustless operations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration with External DeFi Protocols:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports integration with protocols like EigenLayer, where tokens will be staked.</li>\n<li>Potential to leverage major DeFi protocols such as Aave, offering extensive investment<br>\nopportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Chainlink Oracles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Utilizing Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network to ensure accurate and reliable off-chain data<br>\nfeeds.</li>\n<li>Enables secure and verifiable price feeds and other external data, enhancing the robustness of<br>\nfund operations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Fund Offerings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heritage Dam: Focuses on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investments.</li>\n<li>Castor Credit Dam: Invests in a range of DeFi protocols.</li>\n<li>Grateful Dam: Specializes in Liquid Staked Derivatives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fund Management:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funds are set to rebalance every x days or when weights deviate by x%, depending on the specific fund’s rules.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Future Developments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customizable investment strategies tailored to user preferences.</li>\n<li>“Funds of Funds” structure, where users can invest in multiple funds, increasing their exposure and diversification.</li>\n<li>Users will have the ability to choose whether to utilize integrated external protocols, how often their funds rebalance, what coins are included, and the associated fees.</li>\n<li>Theoretical possibility to create a “fund of funds” to mimic a crypto S&amp;P 500.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Community and Governance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently, no community governance, but plans to establish a DAO and introduce a governance token in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Technical Overview:<br>\nDamFi’s architecture employs smart contracts for autonomous fund management. The integration of ZKPs ensures efficient off-chain computations, while the proofs are uploaded on-chain for verification. This modular approach enhances security, scalability, and adaptability in the evolving DeFi landscape.</p>\n<p>Partnerships and Collaborations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are partnered with Ora and utilizing their ZKPs to ensure the computational efficiency and security of our protocol.<br>\n- Currently in talks with a few others but not ready to announce them yet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Testnet Launch and Airdrop:<br>\nWe are excited to announce the launch of the DamFi testnet.

Users can use their CAB to transact instantly on any chain with a signature. No fragmentation, no bridging, no GAS, no latency.

Smart-Wallets can by-pass these limitations using Socket’s MOFA.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Single Paymaster Weak</strong>: User gets locked into a single paymaster and if paymaster doesn’t have liquidity userOps will not be executed. SCWs can instead delegate paymaster election to Socket’s MOFA to tap into a global network of competing paymasters and sidestep liquidity and efficiency issues.

To be more specific, there are two fundamental reasons for reducing issuance:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To reduce costs for users, including costs for hardware, risks and opportunity costs, taxes, etc. By maintaining the current reward curve, Ethereum compels users to incur higher costs than necessary for securing the network. Reducing issuance will improve welfare by eliminating implied costs that may very well amount to more than a billion dollars per year.</li>\n<li>To improve Ethereum at the macro level. If everyone stakes, one entity or a cartel might come to exercise control over a large proportion of all ETH. This can reduce security since it becomes harder for the social layer to hold such entities accountable. The potential proliferation of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) may also impede ETH as trustless money, fostering monopolization and making Ethereum a less desirable blockchain to build on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The answer will now take a closer look at these two aspects.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-1-reduced-costs-raise-welfare-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-1-reduced-costs-raise-welfare-6\"></a>1. Reduced costs raise welfare</h4>\n<p>Review Figure 1 (example with more details <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171#h-21-user-utility-9\">here</a>), featuring a <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448\">hypothetical future supply curve</a> in blue. The supply curve indicates the amount of stake deposited <span class=\"math\">D</span> at various staking yields <span class=\"math\">y</span>. It captures the implied marginal cost of staking. What that means is that every ETH holder is positioned along the supply curve according to how high cost they assign to staking, with their required yield reflecting that cost. Relevant costs include hardware and other resources, upkeep, the acquisition of technical knowledge, illiquidity, trust in third parties and other factors increasing the risk premium, various opportunity costs, taxes, etc. The area above the supply curve indicates the stakers’ surplus (what they actually gain). The area below the supply curve—the supply curve’s integral—indicates the costs assigned to staking (the marginal staker would not stake at a yield below the supply curve).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/e/5/e587ae3810f916ac663314fe3227c696b945acc4.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/e587ae3810f916ac663314fe3227c696b945acc4\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/5/e587ae3810f916ac663314fe3227c696b945acc4_2_690x410.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\" data-base62-sha1=\"wKw2amSYoguXC8n487AjJVkXRNa\" width=\"690\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/5/e587ae3810f916ac663314fe3227c696b945acc4_2_690x410.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/5/e587ae3810f916ac663314fe3227c696b945acc4_2_1035x615.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/5/e587ae3810f916ac663314fe3227c696b945acc4_2_1380x820.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E7E8F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Implied cost (blue) and surplus (grey) of staking under a hypothetical future supply curve. A change in issuance policy shifts the equilibrium from the black square to the green circle. The cost reduction (dark blue) leads to aggregate welfare improvement as long as the protocol remains secure and decentralized, and the reduction in surplus (dark grey) simply shifts some utility from stakers to everyone.</p>\n<p>Two reward curves are shown, with maximum extractable value (MEV) added to the staking yield. In this FAQ, MEV will be 300k ETH/year (close to the average over the last few years) and include priority fees. By maintaining the current reward curve in black, Ethereum compels users to incur higher costs than necessary for securing the network. Adopting the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171\">green reward curve</a> eliminates the costs represented by the dark blue area (around 450 000 ETH), thus improving welfare. The issued ETH covered for hardware expenses, taxes, reduced liquidity and risks that users would choose to sidestep under a lower yield. With the green curve, they can, and the benefits are shared by everyone, including remaining stakers. This creates value for all token holders through a reduction in newly minted ETH. It may seem strange that it matters how many new ETH that are created. But imagine if every ETH was converted to 10 ETH tomorrow so that there were 1.2 billion instead of 120 million ETH in total. Then every ETH would be around 10 times less valuable. What matters is the proportion of all ETH that you hold; a concept that we will get back to in a subsequent <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#proportional-yield-40\">answer</a>. There is also a surplus shift from stakers to everyone from a change in issuance policy, indicated by the darker grey area. That ETH indeed previously benefited stakers, since it was taken from everyone (in the form of newly minted ETH), and then given specifically to them.</p>\n<p>It is common to treat the issuance reduction achieved by removing the dark blue area the same as when removing the dark grey area. When not explicitly highlighting the reduction in costs among those that stop staking as the issuance falls, value may appear to merely shift from one class of users to another in the form of a gain or loss in <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675/1#proportional-yield-40\">real/proportional yield</a>. Issued tokens are redistributed among a different quantity of stakers, not creating any new value at the aggregate level. Without a division into cost and surplus, the <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/Foundations-of-MVI\">welfare gain</a> can get lost in translation, especially if it is not otherwise implied by remarking on the outcome among all users at the different equilibria. In a subsequent <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#can-stakers-profit-from-a-reduced-issuance-and-what-is-the-relevance-and-impact-of-the-realproportional-yield-37\">answer</a>, the different effects will be studied more closely.</p>\n<p>Slashing risks or any bugs that would effectively burn the stake are from an “accounting perspective” less attributable as a pure cost at the aggregate protocol level, and taxes will by their nature increase costs for a user when its surplus rises. But the general principle of capturing costs below the supply curve as the issuance that does not generate any surplus to stakers is very useful for understanding staking economics and welfare.</p>\n<p>What <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/Foundations-of-MVI#Let-the-best-money-win\">happens when we impose unnecessary costs</a>  on our users? If they are forced to select between incurring these costs as stakers, or to subject themselves to an increased dilution under equilibrium, they might simply decide to use another blockchain, where the imposed costs are lower. This would of course affect both token holders and anyone building on Ethereum negatively. Ethereum operates in a free market and must always strive to perfect the user experience.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-macro-perspective-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-2-macro-perspective-7\"></a>2. Macro perspective</h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_cost_accounting\">true cost accounting</a> must also incorporate the <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/MinimumViableIssuance#Benefits-of-MVI-from-a-macro-perspective\">macro perspective</a>. An LST exceeding critical thresholds regarding the <em>proportion</em> of stake under its control may compromise the consensus mechanism. Outsized profits from blockspace are here a <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd#Stratum-for-cartelization\">stratum for cartelization</a>. But if everyone is compelled to stake, an entity or cartel of entities may also gain control over a significant proportion of the <em>total</em> ETH—propelled by network externalities such as the money function of an LST. These externalities are a stratum for cartelization extending outside of the consensus mechanism. The compromised institution also sits one layer above, namely the social layer.</p>\n<p>It became apparent with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO\">The DAO</a> that if the proportion of the total circulating supply affected by an outcome grows sufficiently large, then the social layer may waver on its commitment to the underlying intended consensus process. An LST might grow “<a href=\"https://x.com/weboftrees/status/1710713959362252884\">too big to fail</a>” in the eyes of the Ethereum social layer. If the community can no longer effectively intervene in the event of a 51% attack, then Vitalik’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DHGOlIlMvc&amp;t=1938s\">warning system</a> and Danny’s <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd#Risks-on-Capital-vs-Risks-to-Protocol\">recourses</a> may not be effective. Staking becomes so ubiquitous that the social consensus mechanism is overloaded. It is a special and in a way inverted case of issues Vitalik <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/05/21/dont_overload.html\">previously warned about</a>.</p>\n<p>The macro perspective also extends beyond consensus. If one or a few LSTs overtake as money in the Ethereum ecosystem, they will embed themselves across every layer and application. An economy that is not powered by a <a href=\"https://x.com/fradamt/status/1760808900792594593\">trustless asset</a> is arguably not as <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/circulating-supply-equilibrium-for-ethereum-and-minimum-viable-issuance-during-the-proof-of-stake-era/10954#631-money-lego-25\">resilient</a>, regardless of if the consensus process itself is never threatened. The applications powering the money will gain an outsized influence over the applications using the money, and Ethereum will become a less desirable blockchain to build and develop on.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-about-economic-security-more-stake-makes-ethereum-more-secure-right-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#what-about-economic-security-more-stake-makes-ethereum-more-secure-right-8\"></a>What about economic security? More stake makes Ethereum more secure right?</h3>\n<p>It is true that up to a certain point, more stake makes Ethereum more secure. But even before reaching this point, the marginal increase in security from adding another validator brings less utility to users than the utility loss stemming from the numerous downsides of excessive issuance (see the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#why-should-ethereum-reduce-its-issuance-4\">previous answer</a>) that negatively affect users, builders, and holders of the ETH token. Ethereum’s economic security will in the long term inherently be linked to the ability of ETH to retain its value. A holistic perspective is therefore important also when considering economic security. This is underscored by reflecting on the early days of Ethereum, when the ETH token was much less valuable. Eight years ago, In May 2016, <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/05/09/on-settlement-finality\">Vitalik deliberated on</a> the value that Ethereum can and cannot secure at a stake participation of 30%. At the time, the market cap of the ETH token was roughly 500 times lower than today, and the economic security that Ethereum could offer was therefore limited. Increasing stake participation from 30% to 60% would only increase the value of 1/3 of the stake (the threshold for the ability to delay finality) from $70M to $140M. This highlights that once the proportion staked has risen above insignificant levels, it will ultimately be Ethereum’s role in the world economy, and the ether’s role in the Ethereum economy, that determines the economic security.</p>\n<p>In a recent AMA, Justin Drake <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/191kke6/comment/kh79gh1\">suggested</a> that a stake participation of 1/4 (30M ETH) is appropriate. Vitalik Buterin <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/191kke6/comment/kh7do9k/\">concurred</a>, but also added a personal note of finding 1/8 (15M ETH) fine. As the quantity of stake grows, the prospects for high economic security in the long term gradually begin to diminish. It seems reasonable to argue that Ethereum would have higher economic security twenty years from now with a reward curve that sees the deposit size settle on 30M ETH staked than at 90M ETH—as long as the composition of the staking set remains viable. Beyond certain limits, even short-term security begins to degrade, in line with the reasoning around the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#h-2-macro-perspective-7\">macro perspective</a>. The social layer may lose its neutrality and credibility as the ultimate arbitrator against attacks from dominant SSPs. At the other end, even long-term security will be negatively affected if users are not incentivized to add another validator while that brings positive utility: a blockchain with poor short-term security from too little stake becomes undesirable to build on as well.</p>\n<p>The outlined considerations hint at a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/weboftrees/status/1585641193982918656\">range</a> within which it is desirable to keep stake participation. There is no single ideal quantity because Ethereum can adapt its security expenditures based on the prevailing price of security, something which is facilitated through a reward curve. The staking yield should be very high at 15M ETH to ensure sufficient participation. When the quantity of stake is 60M ETH, the staking yield should be very low, to dissuade additional staking. At 30M ETH staked, the staking yield can be set in between these extremes, at a level that makes an equilibrium likely. Note that the total security expenditure (issuance, <span class=\"math\">Y_i</span>) potentially can remain rather fixed as the issuance yield <span class=\"math\">y_i</span> varies, since the issued tokens will be distributed to more stakers when more stake is deposited, thus bringing down the yield. This relationship is expressed by the equation <span class=\"math\">Y_i=y_iD</span>. Economic security is also discussed <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171#h-51-economic-security-30\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-is-a-desirable-issuance-reduction-for-the-near-future-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#what-is-a-desirable-issuance-reduction-for-the-near-future-9\"></a>What is a desirable issuance reduction for the near future?</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"overview-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#overview-10\"></a>Overview</h4>\n<p>It is desirable to adopt a reward curve situated within the yellow area in Figures 2-4 below. It can be done using a reward curve with tempered issuance (slowly falling as the amount of stake increases) as exemplified in green or a reward curve with capped issuance with examples shown in pink. A reward curve below the yellow area would make the influence of MEV rather troublesome because block proposal rights would bring in relatively more value than attestations, and might also not be warranted at this point. A reward curve above the yellow area might not be sufficiently impactful relative to the potentially fractious governance process that comes with changing issuance policy.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"influence-of-mev-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#influence-of-mev-11\"></a>Influence of MEV</h4>\n<p>Any change to the reward curve should account for MEV. Forcing a low quantity of stake is undesirable if the MEV is not at the same time burned, as explored in a <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448\">recent write-up</a>, and the following <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#variability-for-solo-stakers-23\">answer</a>. If issuance yield is reduced to strictly enforce an equilibrium in the presence of high MEV, block proposal rights may be the only remaining source of revenue. This would significantly increase the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448#h-43-variability-with-fixed-supply-and-varied-demand-15\">relative standard deviation</a> in staking yield for non-pooled stakers, disadvantaging solo stakers. At some point, stakers may simply <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448/2\">stop attesting</a>. Additional changes to the consensus mechanism would be required to preserve micro incentives when the issuance yield becomes too low. A staking fee taken out each epoch in my view then seems like the best option and would promote “<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448/11#introduction-1\">incentive invariance</a>”. Non-pooled stakers would then need to lose ETH each epoch even under a low positive issuance yield, in the hope that they may be assigned to propose a block. A simple solution, useful for example under reward curves at the lower edge or a bit below the yellow area, is to <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448/2\">increase penalties</a> for missed attestations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"a-reasonable-range-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#a-reasonable-range-12\"></a>A reasonable range</h4>\n<p>What then are the more moderate options that can be contemplated at the present? Figure 2 shows a range in yellow that is reasonable to target currently. Below this range, block proposals will generate more than half of the rewards under the present level of MEV, which could be an uncomfortably high level. Above this range, the change is rather small, and the potentially fractious governance process of changing the reward curve might not be worthwhile. There are also some options that push down the staking yield slightly further at high quantities of stake, which cannot be fully ruled out, discussed <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#h-3-cut-issuance-33\">here</a>.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/b/5/b56eb9daa51f177a7470ecb60ec01edf619417f0.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/b56eb9daa51f177a7470ecb60ec01edf619417f0\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/5/b56eb9daa51f177a7470ecb60ec01edf619417f0_2_690x404.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"pT1EolLP20g4d9eu44AvkEQu8sU\" width=\"690\" height=\"404\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/5/b56eb9daa51f177a7470ecb60ec01edf619417f0_2_690x404.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/5/b56eb9daa51f177a7470ecb60ec01edf619417f0_2_1035x606.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/5/b56eb9daa51f177a7470ecb60ec01edf619417f0_2_1380x808.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F8F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> A reasonable issuance range in yellow achieved through a reward curve with tempered issuance (green) or capped issuance (pink).</p>\n<h4><a name=\"reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-green-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-green-13\"></a>Reward curve with tempered issuance (green)</h4>\n<p>The current reward curve in black follows the equation for issuance yield <span class=\"math\">y_i = cF/\\sqrt{D}</span>, with the constant <span class=\"math\">c\\approx2.6</span> and the base reward factor set to <span class=\"math\">F=64</span>.

The <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171\">reward curve with tempered issuance</a> in green is created by division with <span class=\"math\">1+D/k</span>, thus:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\ny_i = \\frac{cF}{\\sqrt{D}(1+D/k)},\n</div>\n<p>with <span class=\"math\">k</span> set to <span class=\"math\">2^{25}</span>. The variable <span class=\"math\">k</span> defines participation at peak issuance, which also becomes the point where issuance is halved, indicated by the lower cross at around 33.6M ETH. The dashed green reward curve makes a small change to the computation, subtracting a fixed constant <span class=\"math\">k_2</span> from <span class=\"math\">D</span> (minimum 0) when computing the new term. This constant was here set to <span class=\"math\">k_2=2^{23}</span>. The idea is to provide stronger guarantees of a sufficient quantity of stake and thus security. While this is very unlikely to be required, it might still make the governance process of finding an agreement on the change easier. A similar effect can also be achieved by using a reward curve of a <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#h-3-cut-issuance-33\">higher order</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"reward-curve-with-capped-issuance-pink-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#reward-curve-with-capped-issuance-pink-14\"></a>Reward curve with capped issuance (pink)</h4>\n<p>In pink are reward curves with capped issuance (shorter write-up <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/Reward-curve-with-capped-issuance\">here</a>). The cap <span class=\"math\">D_c</span> defines stake participation when issuance diverges from the current reward curve and flatlines. The lowest setting within the sought range is <span class=\"math\">D_c=2^{23}</span> (8.4M ETH) indicated by a dotted curve and the highest is <span class=\"math\">D_c=2^{24}</span> (16.8M ETH) indicated by a full curve. One interesting detail is that Vitalik Buterin’s <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022\">active validator cap and rotation proposal</a> from March 2021 has the same effect on issuance as when applying <span class=\"math\">D_c=2^{24}</span>. One benefit of this reward curve is thus its long history, potentially being the first serious proposal for tempering the growth in the actively participating stake. The reader might find the comment section on that post interesting, with early thinking on Ethereum’s circulating supply equilibrium, targeting a participation ratio, and variable validator balances.

This is also the staking yield if all MEV has been successfully burned, a scenario that may not materialize. Two hypothetical supply curves are indicated in blue.</p>\n<p>It can be noted that the reduced staking yield from MEV burn makes an equilibrium at a desirable quantity of stake rather likely, even if the supply curve continues to fall. Therefore, adopting something close to the dashed green reward curve, followed up by MEV burn a little later, could bring Ethereum to a stage where the quantity of stake is tempered and remains firmly below 60M ETH, likely closer to 30M ETH. This does not mean that this reward curve necessarily must remain in place. But the reward curve should give us plenty of time to continue the debate on the “endgame” issuance policy (see <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#what-is-the-endgame-issuance-policy-28\">this answer</a> without having to worry about the quantity of stake growing debilitatingly high.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"why-not-dynamically-adjust-the-yield-with-a-mechanism-like-eip-1559-to-guarantee-some-fixed-target-participation-level-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#why-not-dynamically-adjust-the-yield-with-a-mechanism-like-eip-1559-to-guarantee-some-fixed-target-participation-level-16\"></a>Why not dynamically adjust the yield with a mechanism like EIP-1559 to guarantee some fixed target participation level?</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"overview-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#overview-17\"></a>Overview</h4>\n<p>One common suggestion is that Ethereum should use a mechanism like EIP-1559 to automatically adjust the yield, ensuring that the stake participation is kept at some specific targeted level. Allowing the market to set the issuance yield may seem more neutral, taking away control from developers. Of course, this merely shifts the problem to defining one specific appropriate quantity of stake instead. And what is worse, it constrains Ethereum to purchase an equal amount of security, regardless of its cost. Arguably, there is not one specific appropriate quantity of stake, because the price of the security (the equilibrium issuance level) also matters.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#what-about-economic-security-more-stake-makes-ethereum-more-secure-right-8\">previously discussed</a>, the marginal increase in security from adding another validator provides diminishing utility as the quantity of stake increases. At some point, the utility loss of excessive issuance becomes greater than the utility gain from more security. Clearly, that point will depend also on the cost of the security. Another concern with a target participation level is that it gives stakers incentives to discouragement attack Ethereum to drive up the issuance, in one version operating as a union. Trying to rectify these flaws will ultimately recreate some form of reward curve, because it is in many ways a more sophisticated solution.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"a-fixed-target-participation-level-is-a-vertical-reward-curve-with-subpar-budgeting-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#a-fixed-target-participation-level-is-a-vertical-reward-curve-with-subpar-budgeting-18\"></a>A fixed target participation level is a vertical reward curve with subpar budgeting</h4>\n<p>When the yield adjusts dynamically to enforce some specific target participation level, the mechanism behaves similar to a vertical reward curve in the long run. Any such mechanism will of course adapt gradually to avoid too big changes in yield from small shifts in the supply curve, but the equilibrium ultimately returns to a point where the supply curve intersects the vertical “dynamic” reward curve. Two such reward curves are illustrated in magenta in Figure 5, one where the target has been set to 30M ETH staked and one at 60M ETH staked. The figure presumes 300k ETH in MEV per year.

Green circles represent desirable outcomes, red crosses undesirable outcomes, and yellow triangles are outcomes somwehere in between. As captured by the red crosses, a fixed target does not facilitate proper budgeting.</p>\n<p>Three hypothetical supply curves are shown in blue, intended to illustrate what the outcome would be under vastly different scenarios. With a 30M target under a high supply curve, an equilibrium forms at a 2.87% staking yield; a desirable outcome under the presence of MEV as marked by a green circle. Under the outlined medium supply curve, an equilibrium forms at 1.87% instead. This might be perceived as slightly problematic because MEV will constitute 53.5% of the total staking rewards. As a result, block proposals bring home around 59.3% of all rewards under the current consensus specification, and so the equilibrium is marked by a yellow triangle to indicate a medium outcome. Yet, it is rather close to being classified as a green circle in my view.  The equilibrium under the low supply curve at a 0.5% staking yield is marked by a red cross to indicate undesirability. This equilibrium happens under a negative issuance yield since the MEV yield is 1%. Non-pooled stakers (e.g., most solo stakers) must then lose money each epoch in the hope of eventually being assigned to propose a block.</p>\n<p>With a 60M target under the high supply curve, an equilibrium forms at a 4.6% staking yield. This is very undesirable. Ethereum would in this scenario issue 2.45M ETH per year when the equilibrium issuance of 0.56M ETH at 30M ETH would be sufficient. The downside of course is the unnecessary <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#h-1-reduced-costs-raise-welfare-6\">costs</a> that Ethereum is subjecting its users to. For the users, this manifests as being coerced into taking on some of those costs as a staker, or otherwis see their savings eroded by dilution. The equilibrium for the medium supply curve is also undesirable for the same reason. The equilibrium at the low supply curve however seems acceptable, at a staking yield of 1.11%. The MEV is a bit high at 45% of the rewards, and indeed the proposer gets 51.8% of the expected staking yield. Yet this seems acceptable in order to keep the quantity of stake from growing too high under a low supply curve, where 60M ETH is already undesirably high.</p>\n<p>The problem with a dynamic reward curve and a specific target is that the associated vertical shape may lead to undesirable staking equilibria. The reader will note that by using the purple reward curve denoted as “Endgame (3)”, an acceptable equilibrium is reached under all three supply curves, as marked by green circles. If the supply curve is higher, an equilibrium with a low quantity of stake is attained, ensuring that the costs to Ethereum’s users do not grow too large. If the supply curve is lower, the quantity of stake is allowed to grow to ensure that a reasonable issuance yield is provided to stakers.

The excessively high issuance under high supply curves and a fixed target of 60M ETH is very problematic. Likewise concerning the high issuance under low supply curves with the current reward curve. Note that the really problematic outcomes for the current reward curve instead happens under low supply curves, because it is designed to increase issuance as the quantity of stake increases.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/e/f/efce4de2bd9c71175c7d7feab5aaed4b212ab564.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/efce4de2bd9c71175c7d7feab5aaed4b212ab564\" title=\"Figure 7\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/f/efce4de2bd9c71175c7d7feab5aaed4b212ab564_2_690x423.png\" alt=\"Figure 7\" data-base62-sha1=\"ydq7sbqm0umxC2bSM7Z9T1pgaFu\" width=\"690\" height=\"423\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/f/efce4de2bd9c71175c7d7feab5aaed4b212ab564_2_690x423.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/f/efce4de2bd9c71175c7d7feab5aaed4b212ab564_2_1035x634.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/e/f/efce4de2bd9c71175c7d7feab5aaed4b212ab564_2_1380x846.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F6F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 7.</strong> Yearly issuance under MEV burn for various supply curves in blue when using a fixed target participation level (magenta), a reward curve with cut issuance (purple), or the current reward curve (black).

It may lead to Ethereum overpaying for security, or paying so little that solo stakers needlessly are driven out. Some may consider concerns around solo staking overblown, and feel that the benefit of a specific target outweighs, because Ethereum will at least have some specific participation level that has been deemed appropriate by the community. The issue with a fixed target is however a little deeper. Stakers need to come to consensus under <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2017/07/16/triangle_of_harm.html\">listener–speaker fault equivalence</a>, something that opens up avenues for <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/4a3bc39e11acede672770475ab254a1a882a5bbe/papers/discouragement/discouragement.pdf\">discouragement attacks</a>. The protocol cannot ascertain who is at fault for a failed consensus message delivery. An attacker can therefore act maliciously against honest consensus participants to deprive them of rewards, subsequently profiting as they leave and the staking yield increases. There exists various avenues even for <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448/11\">minority discouragement attacks</a> at the present.</p>\n<p>With a fixed target participation level that adapts relatively quickly, the “<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171#h-53-discouragement-attacks-32\"><span class=\"math\">p_i</span>-elasticity</a>” becomes infinite. The incentives for discouragement attacks are then <a href=\"https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1542162089304784897\">maximized</a>; less stake must leave to drive up the yield. A related concept is <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171#h-54-cartelization-attacks-33\">cartelization attacks</a>, consisting of SSPs working together to try to reduce quantity staked, potentially also among themselves. When issuance increases with a reduction in quantity staked (<span class=\"math\">p_i&gt;1</span>), all stakers could try to agree to reduce their stake, and everyone would be better off (as long as new entrants are kept out or discouraged). This framing can provide a suitable backdrop for convincing the social layer to not interfere when a staking cartel tries to inhibit Ethereum’s permissionlessness, utilizing discouragement attacks.</p>\n<p>The importance of discouragement attacks should not be overblown, but it is unnecessary to open up for them when safer designs so easily can be achieved. It is particularly striking that under the strict target, attacking the consensus through censorship can generate what is essentially an infinite-money glitch without breaking validity.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"rectifying-the-outlined-flaws-recreates-a-subpar-reward-curve-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#rectifying-the-outlined-flaws-recreates-a-subpar-reward-curve-20\"></a>Rectifying the outlined flaws recreates a subpar reward curve</h4>\n<p>To protect against stakers turning the consensus mechanism into a money-printing machine, the protocol might of course impose some maximum yield beyond which no further increases are deemed necessary (besides relying on the social layer and the threat of intervention). For good measure, the issuance policy may also define a floor, so that stakers always receive some yield, ensuring a viable composition of the staking set. Figure 8 plots this new hypothetical updated fixed target reward curve (once again ignoring the time component).

However, a reward curve remains the better solution.</p>\n<p>The mechanism now prevents the infinite-money glitch, and gives stakers at least some guaranteed yield. However, it arguably remains flawed, with improper budgeting. The incentives for discouragement attacks and cartelization attacks are still unnecessarily pronounced in the vertical part of the curve. The fixed floor and ceiling should instead have the smooth characteristics of a reward curve, gradually increasing or decreasing as the utility function changes.</p>\n<p>The outlined flaws do not mean that there is no value in a dynamic approach; it is possible to combine it with a reward curve.

Such a “<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#h-5-time-quantity-policy-35\">time–quantity policy</a>” is explored in the answer on the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#what-is-the-endgame-issuance-policy-28\">staking economics endgame</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-will-a-reduction-in-issuance-affect-the-composition-of-the-staking-set-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#how-will-a-reduction-in-issuance-affect-the-composition-of-the-staking-set-21\"></a>How will a reduction in issuance affect the composition of the staking set?</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"overview-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#overview-22\"></a>Overview</h4>\n<p>This depends on how sensitive relevant groups such as solo stakers and delegating stakers are to low staking yields and high variability. One concern is unfavorable economies of scale for solo stakers at low yields. At the same time, the delegating staker subjects itself to unique risks when trusting a third party with its ETH, and may for this reason also be hesitant to stake if the yield goes too low. There is furthermore a dynamic at play wherein delegated staking becomes relatively more favorable as the quantity of stake grows. There is thus a multitude of conflicting economic forces to consider. One way to approach this complex subject is by comparing distributions that attempt to capture the willingness to stake at different yields among solo stakers and delegating stakers, as shown, for example, in Figure 11 below.</p>\n<p>It is important to understand the probabilistic nature of issuance policy, and that the design ultimately tries to optimize outcomes under any scenario (e.g., a lower or higher supply curve). As outlined in <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#philosophical-underpinnings-of-the-optimization-problem-30\">another answer</a>, a suitable reward curve can in this context be understood as the expansion path across potential supply curves that optimally balances trade-offs. One of these trade-offs is the equilibrium composition of the staking set. With this viewpoint and in light of potential concerns, an equilibrium at 30M ETH can be desirable, but still not enforced by economic capping. Under a particularly low supply curve, the quantity of stake can be allowed to expand. The composition of the staking set must thus ultimately be analyzed and optimized for across two dimensions, both issuance level and quantity of stake.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"variability-for-solo-stakers-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#variability-for-solo-stakers-23\"></a>Variability for solo stakers</h4>\n<p>If issuance is moderated, a larger part of rewards will stem from REV, and the relative variability in staking rewards will therefore increase. This affects solo stakers negatively since they cannot effortlessly rely on pooling for smoothing out variability. A review of how variability affects the solo staker is offered in a previous write-up on <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448#h-4-variability-in-rewards-for-solo-stakers-12\">properties of issuance level</a>. It seems reasonable to assume that stakers may be more <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448#h-43-variability-with-fixed-supply-and-varied-demand-15\">more sensitive to variance at lower staking yields</a>—the <em>relative</em> variability matters. This of course certainly holds true under an equilibrium where the issuance yield is negative but the staking yield (which includes REV) is positive—for example when instituting economic capping (<a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/single_slot_finality#Economic-capping-of-total-deposits\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751\">2</a>). Solo stakers that do not pool their execution layer rewards will then need to lose ETH each epoch in the hope of being assigned to propose a block. Since MEV yield is shared among stakers, it rises with a lower quantity of stake, and such an equilibrium therefore becomes increasingly more likely the lower the economic cap is set, because the MEV yield can then still be a sufficient incentive on its own. Relative variability is one of the reasons for pursuing the more moderate reward curves discussed in a <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#what-is-a-desirable-issuance-reduction-for-the-near-future-9\">previous answer</a> before MEV burn is in place. This does not mean that a low economic cap will be enforced afterward, merely that it is much more feasible once MEV burn is in place.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"equilibrium-yield-and-the-proportion-of-solo-stakers-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#equilibrium-yield-and-the-proportion-of-solo-stakers-24\"></a>Equilibrium yield and the proportion of solo stakers</h4>\n<p>Ethereum wants to retain solo stakers, at least when measured as a proportion of all stakers. The anticipated outcome of a reduction in issuance level is that less ETH will be staked by both delegating and solo stakers, relative to the outcome when issuance is not reduced (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448/12#the-complex-conundrum-of-retaining-solo-stakers-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/electra-issuance-curve-adjustment-proposal/18825/11\">2</a>). A concern is if there might be a staking yield below which solo stakers in particular would drop off due to, e.g., the relatively higher fixed costs associated with solo staking.</p>\n<p>Take for example <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#staking-yield-and-outlook-15\">Figure 3</a> as a starting point. It is not clear whether the proportion of solo stakers is lower at a hypothetical equilibrium of around 36M ETH staked and a staking yield of 2.44% (green dashed reward curve with tempered issuance) than at around 50M ETH staked and a staking yield of 2.94% (black current reward curve). If solo stakers leave en masse below a yield of 2.6%, then a staking yield of 2.44% at 36M ETH staked will give a lower proportion than when the yield is 2.94% at 50M ETH staked. This is of course something to take seriously. Economies of scale are hard to design away in a decentralized blockchain.</p>\n<p>There are however also some arguments as to why a more restrictive reward curve could give a higher or at least similar proportion of solo stakers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dominant SSPs have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/weboftrees/status/1710719496971862072\">better economies of scale at higher quantities staked</a>, increasing their cost advantage over solo stakers.</li>\n<li>Likewise, the <a href=\"https://x.com/weboftrees/status/1710712326117097785\">positive network externality of the money function</a> grows with quantity staked, and with it the competitive advantage of dominant LST-issuing SSPs.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the principal–agent problem associated with an LST may seem less risky if everyone else also uses the LST, with the expectation that the social layer will waver on its commitment to the intended consensus process in the event of a failure.</li>\n<li>Risks could very well price out delegating stakers earlier than solo stakers as the yield falls. For example, if a large enough subset of potential delegators believe that there is a 1% risk of failure over a year for the LST they wish to hold, then favorable economies of scale or liquidity can be insufficient as a competitive edge. Self-custody is undeniably <a href=\"https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1766354381543292985\">important</a> to a relevant proportion of ETH token holders; this factor should not be overlooked when evaluating the staking supply side.</li>\n<li>On a similar theme, if the yield becomes negative, there is still an altruistic motive for solo staking.  The delegating staker will either need to take on a loss or face adverse selection. An SSP that subsidizes delegators will do so under the expectation of future profits, which may be attained by monopolizing some critical function, or worse, by attacking the consensus. An SSP profiting from restaking could just as well profit using non-staked ETH.</li>\n<li>Token holders with enough ETH and the technical ability to solo stake are not necessarily abundant, implying a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/weboftrees/status/1710723555476803643\">soft upper bound</a> on the solo staked quantity. It can be argued that if this pool is more or less depleted, then relatively <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751#supply-side-give-me-eth-and-have-my-stake-4\">few of the new stakers</a> will be solo stakers as the supply curve falls and <span class=\"math\">D</span> increases under the current policy. Still, concerning this particular argument, it should be remembered that if the yield is reduced substantially to halt the increase in <span class=\"math\">D</span>, there is no guarantee of retaining a larger proportion of solo stakers in the long run. This ultimately depends on the finer-grained distribution of reservation yields among them, as explored in the next subsection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Issuance policy should be focused on long-term objectives and not rely on short-term remedies. This also relates to the presently rather valuable solo staking airdrops, if they can be expected to cease. Yet, Ethereum’s evolving consensus mechanism may look different in ten years, with different requirements for staking anyway—there may even be different classes of validators (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/unbundling-staking-towards-rainbow-staking/18683\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/bW2PeHdwRWmeYjCgCJJdVA\">2</a>)—so circumstances of the present and in the near-term future cannot be completely ignored. For example, it must be acknowledged that if the yield falls, the impact of any solo-staking airdrops will multiply. As an example, if their expected value is 1% per year, and the staking yield falls from 4% to 1%, then airdrops will go from giving solo stakers a 25 % higher revenue than the delegating staker to giving a 100% higher revenue.</p>\n<p>An additional nuance can also be added to the fourth bullet point: some solo stakers stake quite a bit more than 32 ETH, and these may be more resilient to low yields. Finally note that solo stakers who do not own their hardware may still enjoy some external economies of scale; home stakers on the contrary are directly affected by hardware costs.</p>\n<p>At a fundamental level, the <a href=\"https://x.com/weboftrees/status/1710723376233304391\">conjecture</a> is that the relative distribution of reservation yields may differ between different classes of stakers. This then leads to different proportions of solo stakers under different issuance policies. But whether one policy is better than the other in this respect cannot be ascertained and may also vary over the forthcoming decade.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"relative-distribution-of-reservation-yields-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#relative-distribution-of-reservation-yields-25\"></a>Relative distribution of reservation yields</h4>\n<p>This subsection will explain the conjecture from the previous paragraph by visualizing some hypothetical distributions of reservation yields among different classes of stakers. Naturally, such distributions emerge from some fundamental functions capturing the willingness to supply stake, which ultimately depends on the composition of those seeking exposure to the ETH asset and how they value various costs associated with staking. I will present such models at a later date. These visualizations will simply illustrate what the distributions might look like based on the ideas presented in the previous subsection, without quantifying the actual underlying economic forces.</p>\n<p>The notion of a “reservation yield” is lent from labor economics, in which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_wage\">reservation wages</a> influence the quantity of supplied labor across wage (the labor supply curve). Staking economics and labor economics have some similarities; after all, staking is work done to maintain the consensus process, and stakers—just as workers—can under certain circumstances cartelize (i.e., a labor union/cartelization attack) as discussed in a <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#a-fixed-target-participation-level-may-incite-stakers-to-attack-ethereum-19\">previous answer</a>. The laborer’s valuation of their leisure time to some extent then corresponds to the premium that the token holder attaches to non-staked ETH. It should however be mentioned that the “reservation yield” here applies to a “prospective” token holder. The purpose is to capture the specific yield at which some token would be staked, but it must be recognized that the actual token holder might change due to changing circumstances.</p>\n<p>A specified reservation yield is assumed to apply under the equilibrium formed also when accounting for other stakers’ reservation yields, and stake will not switch staking modality across staking yield. Also note that the reservation yield represents what the staking yield must be, and is not a staker’s profit, because there are also costs/fees. The example is intended to capture what the distributions might hypothetically look like a few years from now, assuming that a functioning MEV burn is in place and that airdrops to solo stakers unfortunately have become less ubiquitous.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"illustrating-hypothetical-distributions-of-reservation-yields-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#illustrating-hypothetical-distributions-of-reservation-yields-26\"></a>Illustrating hypothetical distributions of reservation yields</h4>\n<p>The dotted line in Figure 9 shows a hypothetical distribution of reservation yields for solo stakers, with staking yield on the x-axis. Presumably, not many stakers have a zero or negative reservation yield. A tiny few might be inclined to stake even if there are no direct monetary incentives provided by the consensus mechanism (a staking yield of 0), perhaps to defend or attack the network. But these incentives are not something that Ethereum would like to rely on. As the staking yield rises, each marginal increase brings in a larger subset of ETH token holders as solo stakers. The pool of prospective solo stakers then gradually depletes as the overall staking participation rate increases, the curve peaks (here at around 2%), and an increase in yield will ultimately not bring in many new stakers.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/5/2539759699b9ada34cf8bacbbc7ab9c5d5d5cee1.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/2539759699b9ada34cf8bacbbc7ab9c5d5d5cee1\" title=\"Figure 9\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/5/2539759699b9ada34cf8bacbbc7ab9c5d5d5cee1_2_690x440.png\" alt=\"Figure 9\" data-base62-sha1=\"5jiLTiSmhYA1H4Xaydjg8tm5bWh\" width=\"690\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/5/2539759699b9ada34cf8bacbbc7ab9c5d5d5cee1_2_690x440.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/5/2539759699b9ada34cf8bacbbc7ab9c5d5d5cee1_2_1035x660.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/5/2539759699b9ada34cf8bacbbc7ab9c5d5d5cee1_2_1380x880.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 9.</strong> Hypothetical distribution of reservation yields among solo stakers.</p>\n<p>Figure 10 instead shows with a dashed line what the distribution of reservation yields among prospective delegating stakers may look like.

The previously illustrated hypothetical distribution of solo stakers is also included in the plot, but they are relatively fewer, so it is hard to compare the shapes.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/9/f9870c9aacc3ea85b539eee5aef947bdcaa7f135.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/f9870c9aacc3ea85b539eee5aef947bdcaa7f135\" title=\"Figure 10\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/9/f9870c9aacc3ea85b539eee5aef947bdcaa7f135_2_690x440.png\" alt=\"Figure 10\" data-base62-sha1=\"zBqen0VxeevewpLMRKfVSOW7Dmt\" width=\"690\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/9/f9870c9aacc3ea85b539eee5aef947bdcaa7f135_2_690x440.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/9/f9870c9aacc3ea85b539eee5aef947bdcaa7f135_2_1035x660.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/9/f9870c9aacc3ea85b539eee5aef947bdcaa7f135_2_1380x880.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAFBFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 10.</strong> Hypothetical distribution of reservation yields among delegating stakers (dashed line).

Still, remember that these curves are just an attempt to illustrate the ideas presented in the previous subsection, and as such are hypothetical. But this caveat might on the other hand always be applicable, even under more deliberate models. The relative comparison of distributions captures the notion that a smaller proportion of delegating stakers would be willing to stake at a negative yield, given the potential for adverse selection and less clear altruistic motive. But then the distribution might shoot up quicker than for solo stakers as the yield becomes positive, due to the favorable economies of scale of delegated staking. As the yield increases further, solo staking comes into play,  but then dwindles, because the last quantile of stakers are unwilling to give up liquidity or technically unable to solo stake. The proportion of solo stakers might thus vary intermittently.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/9/d925ec1e2e8ebaa5bbd273a65864dd38e3c7f31c.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/d925ec1e2e8ebaa5bbd273a65864dd38e3c7f31c\" title=\"Figure 11\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/9/d925ec1e2e8ebaa5bbd273a65864dd38e3c7f31c_2_690x440.png\" alt=\"Figure 11\" data-base62-sha1=\"uYYRhdd9K8ka2TZYkc4EXT5D50g\" width=\"690\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/9/d925ec1e2e8ebaa5bbd273a65864dd38e3c7f31c_2_690x440.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/9/d925ec1e2e8ebaa5bbd273a65864dd38e3c7f31c_2_1035x660.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/9/d925ec1e2e8ebaa5bbd273a65864dd38e3c7f31c_2_1380x880.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9FBFA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 11.</strong> Hypothetical distribution of reservation yields for solo stakers and delegating stakers, normalized to represent an equal share of all ETH.</p>\n<p>Having reviewed two hypothetical distributions, it is now time to review how the proportion of solo stakers evolves across staking yield under them.

It can emerge, e.g., if the delegating stakers’ assigned risk premium is more dispersed than the fixed cost structure of solo stakers. Proponents of a higher issuance level would suggest that this valley exists and is pronounced (when removing solo-staking airdrops), but there are many nuances beyond economies of scale to consider, as previously outlined.

Stake participation of each class (circles) are found at the horizontal line extending from the equilibrium (squares).</p>\n<p>Note that the hypothetical distributions here presented only give one specific supply curve. Under another lower supply curve, the distributions would presumably be compressed such that many features, e.g., the transition to favoring delegated staking, emerge at a lower yield. I have been working for quite some time on a complex probabilistic model trying to unify these considerations, and hope to present it in a while. This topic is certain to receive further attention also from other researchers (e.g., <a href=\"https://cyber.fund/content/mvi-grants\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/electra-issuance-curve-adjustment-proposal/18825/17\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/initial-analysis-of-stake-distribution/19014\">3</a>).</p>\n<h4><a name=\"equilibrium-yield-and-the-broader-composition-of-the-staking-set-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#equilibrium-yield-and-the-broader-composition-of-the-staking-set-27\"></a>Equilibrium yield and the broader composition of the staking set</h4>\n<p>The relationship between issuance level and diversity in SSPs also entails a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/weboftrees/status/1710723555476803643\">trade-off</a> between economies of scale and factors such as the positive network externality of the money function. Offering a positive yield beyond 30M ETH is helpful for alleviating concerns that a major SSP with a structural advantage such as a centralized exchange (CEX)—perhaps leveraging some hypothetical staked ETF—can push up their proportion of the stake to critical levels. At the same time, the risks of centralization around such entities should not be disproportionately emphasized over other risk scenarios. There are already today SSPs attaining critical proportions of the stake by leveraging network externalities onchain, ostensibly foregoing profits in the pursuit of monopolization. This type of structural advantage could also grow with higher issuance, and stifling that before native ETH possibly is in the minority relative to one LST must be considered as a net positive to the community. When weighing these trade-offs, an issuance level that invariably forces any outcome—whether a very low or very high quantity staked—does not seem desirable.</p>\n<p>Each SSP, reaching for a specific market segment, incurs unique costs besides the cost of running staking nodes, with a wide variety ranging from compliance to software. Indeed, CEXes have somewhat of a local monopoly on their customers-as-delegators, and the opportunity cost of keeping fees competitive with any onchain option is presumably so high that it does not represent the profit-maximizing strategy. What is clear is that competition for delegated stake will unfold across diverse market segments, and perfect competition is not a reasonable assumption. If the cost of operating a node is not prohibitively high relative to the income that the SSP can make from running it, then variety in preferences and circumstances between delegators will take a central role in shaping the composition of the staking set. The concern is therefore only valid with a yield that goes close to 0 or negative at a low quantity of stake. No SSP can reasonably outcompete all others at an equilibrium staking yield of, e.g., 2% at 30M ETH staked.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-is-the-endgame-issuance-policy-28\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#what-is-the-endgame-issuance-policy-28\"></a>What is the endgame issuance policy?</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"overview-29\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#overview-29\"></a>Overview</h4>\n<p>Certain parts of the endgame have a rather broad agreement. Firstly, Ethereum should transition to using <span class=\"math\">d</span> (referred to in this text as the deposit ratio or stake participation ratio) in the equation for the reward curve instead of <span class=\"math\">D</span> (deposit size or quantity staked). This can simply be done (<a href=\"https://x.com/weboftrees/status/1710728179260731715\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://warpcast.com/anderselowsson/0xad4454fd\">2</a>) by swapping out <span class=\"math\">D</span> for <span class=\"math\">d</span> in the equation for the reward curve, and normalizing by including the circulating supply at the time of the swap, once the circulating supply <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751#how-to-set-the-target-in-relative-staking-ratio-instead-of-absolute-fixed-eth-amount-terms-20\">begins to be tracked</a> at the consensus layer. The main reason for this transition is that the long-run staking equilibrium under reward curves that adapt to <span class=\"math\">D</span> instead of <span class=\"math\">d</span> is ultimately also influenced by the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/circulating-supply-equilibrium-for-ethereum-and-minimum-viable-issuance-during-the-proof-of-stake-era/10954\">circulating supply equilibrium</a>, since the circulating supply will <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtEMabS0Oas&amp;t=1187s\">drift</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/weboftrees/status/1710725744651825281\">balance</a> supply, demand, and protocol income.</p>\n<p>Secondly, Ethereum should pursue MEV burn. As explained in the previous answers (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#influence-of-mev-11\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#variability-for-solo-stakers-23\">2</a>), this will reduce relative variability and is a prerequisite for being able to reduce the staking yield substantially without causing too much concern for non-pooled stakers. As the answer soon turns to reduced issuance, it must be remembered that there is no direct financial motive for staking if the <a href=\"https://x.com/weboftrees/status/1710720809797407063\">endogenous staking yield</a> (MEV + issuance + airdrops) is negative. An equilibrium at negative issuance attracting a sufficiently large quantity of stake should thus still involve a positive expected endogenous yield. One concern is that the variability in MEV then involves non-pooled stakers taking on small losses each epoch while they wait for being assigned to special duties (note that variability in airdrops are not resolved by pooling). But there are many other reasons for MEV burn as well, as explored by <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/cA3EzpNvRBStk1JFLzW8qg\">Francesco</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-burn-a-simple-design/15590\">Justin</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/dr-changestuff-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-mev-burn/17384\">Mike, Toni, and Justin</a>.</p>\n<p>The endgame when it comes to issuance level is currently a subject of debate but does indeed by all accounts involve an issuance reduction. The options can roughly be divided into five different categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do nothing</strong>; an alternative that must always be part of the conversation, but which is becoming increasingly less attractive assuming that staking costs continue to fall and the quantity of stake increases further.</li>\n<li><strong>Temper issuance</strong>; but to a level that is perfectly sufficient also under the presence of MEV.</li>\n<li><strong>Cut issuance</strong>; an option situated in between (2) and (4). Does not institute an economic capping, but makes a high quantity of stake incredibly unlikely by lowering the yield substantially.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic capping</strong>, by letting the staking yield go to negative infinity at some desirable quantity of stake.</li>\n<li><strong>A time–quantity policy</strong>; where the reward curve is allowed to slowly alter/bend in response to changes in the supply curve.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Among these options, (2) is becoming increasingly desirable at this point in my view. There is then a sliding scale from (3) to (4), where stricter reward curves are advantageous due to their ability to offer guarantees on the quantity of stake, while some restrictive settings at the same time also require more deliberations. There can be merits to an economic cap (4), ideally then after MEV burn, but in my view not at a too low quantity of stake. Some examples will be illustrated.  Category (5) has not yet received much study and will be presented a little deeper. The answer will now briefly review the philosophical underpinnings of the optimization problem, and then take a closer look at each of the five categories.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"philosophical-underpinnings-of-the-optimization-problem-30\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#philosophical-underpinnings-of-the-optimization-problem-30\"></a>Philosophical underpinnings of the optimization problem</h4>\n<p>The reward curve is in essence an attempt to optimize between all known trade-offs (long-run and short-run economic security, low costs, a viable composition of the staking set, reward variability, etc.), ensuring a utility-maximizing equilibrium under any supply curve. One way to understand the issue is thus that each hypothetical supply curve (low as well as high) has one optimal equilibrium, and the reward curve should intersect each supply curve at this point.</p>\n<p>In economics, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_path\">expansion path</a> connects optimal input combinations across output level, and an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income%E2%80%93consumption_curve\">income expansion path</a> selects the optimal consumption bundles across income. A suitable reward curve is the expansion path that optimizes all known trade-offs associated with high/low yield and stake participation across potential supply curves. <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#a-fixed-target-participation-level-is-a-vertical-reward-curve-with-subpar-budgeting-18\">Figures 5-8</a> in a previous answer illustrated the concept under three supply curves at different levels, where an optimal equilibrium could be found under all three using a reward curve from endgame (3).</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448/2\">framed by Vitalik</a> in a similar context: if a reward curve is designed such that some specific equilibrium is made possible, then that equilibrium should first have been deemed acceptable. In particular, it should ideally be the optimal equilibrium for the prevailing supply curve. But it must then also be noted that not only the <em>level</em>, but also the <em>shape</em> of the supply curve will matter. The reason is that the shape will influence which alternatives a specific equilibrium point can be substituted for when optimizing. There is a difference between the almost horizontal supply curve between 30M and 120M ETH in figures by <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751#implications-of-targeting-14\">Caspar and Ansgar</a>, and the supply curves in this post that slope almost vertically upwards towards 120M ETH. In the former case, setting a negative yield at 30M ETH will seem like a more natural solution, because an economic cap at a low quantity of stake might not matter to solo stakers anyway, regardless of if the supply curve is lower or higher.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-1-do-nothing-31\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-1-do-nothing-31\"></a>1. Do nothing</h4>\n<p>This option remains valid while the quantity of stake remains reasonably close to 30M ETH (1/4 of the stake), previously discussed as a potential limit. There is a switching barrier associated with changing the issuance policy of a decentralized blockchain. The potential for discontent is higher if the switch takes place too close to previously discussed limits. But as mentioned in another answer, it seems reasonable to assume that the current quantity of stake of 32M ETH will not hold in the long run, as staking costs (broadly defined) fall. A threshold that would fit neatly with the notion of operating on powers of two is <span class=\"math\">2^{25}</span> ETH, corresponding to 33.6M ETH. Once this threshold is exceeded (or on the path of being exceeded) when doing nothing, then doing something seems like a better option to me.</p>\n<p>Excessive incentives for staking, beyond what is necessary for security, can unfortunately over time turn into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy#Perverse_subsidies\">perverse subsidies</a>. In a scenario where the application layer is built around excessive staking yield, the Ethereum economy will arguably not have proper trustless foundations, as <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#h-2-macro-perspective-7\">previously discussed</a>.</p>\n<p>One thing to keep track of before deciding to “not do nothing”, and to “do something”, is the progress of MEV burn. A reduction in issuance should not take place at the same hard fork as when incorporating MEV burn. If MEV burn is very close to being ready, then this can be accounted for under certain circumstances. But MEV burn is still at an early research stage. One path is therefore to shortly institute a moderate reduction in issuance, a year or two before MEV burn, and then let MEV burn make another dent in the staking yield.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-temper-issuance-32\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-2-temper-issuance-32\"></a>2. Temper issuance</h4>\n<p>This option is presented in a <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#what-is-a-desirable-issuance-reduction-for-the-near-future-9\">previous answer</a>. In summary, it represents a “safe” issuance reduction that will not increase relative variability too much for non-pooled stakers, providing a relevant staking yield for stakers across the full range. The option provides a sufficiently big reduction in issuance to make the associated governance process worth it—and small enough to make that process potentially easier. The option will still substantially temper the growth in the quantity of stake. Together with MEV burn, it can reasonably constitute an endgame issuance policy, in the sense that the quantity of stake remains close to 30M ETH and firmly below 60M ETH. However, this does not mean that (2) necessarily must be an endgame. Reducing the issuance even further at higher quantities of stake as in (3) and (4) will after MEV burn seem like a reasonable option. However, proceeding further than (2), for example to (4), would then need to be a separate discussion. There is a simple “on-switch” that could be used for such a transition, as discussed in the associated <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#h-4-economic-capping-34\">subsection</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-3-cut-issuance-33\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-3-cut-issuance-33\"></a>3. Cut issuance</h4>\n<p>I refer here to the option situated in between economic capping and tempered issuance as “cut issuance”. The limits of this category are a bit diffuse, but it attempts to capture reward curves that are intended potentially for an Ethereum with MEV burn, that still does not pursue economic capping.

The pink curve has the equation</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\ny_i = \\frac{cF}{\\sqrt{D}+(D/k)^2}\n</div>\n<p>with <span class=\"math\">k=2^{19}</span>. The purple curve has the equation</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\ny_i = \\frac{cF}{\\sqrt{D}(1+(D/k)^2)}\n</div>\n<p>with <span class=\"math\">k=38\\times10^6</span>. All reward curves in the figure have <span class=\"math\">F=64</span>. One idea behind these sorts of reward curves that would have a positive issuance yield across the full range also after MEV burn has been instituted is to provide guarantees to solo stakers that the issuance yield will always stay positive. Of course, the staking yield (issuance + MEV) should intuitively always stay positive, since there is no point in staking unless the <a href=\"https://x.com/weboftrees/status/1710720809797407063\">endogenous yield</a> is positive. But the guarantees here pertain to issuance yield, meaning that solo stakers might always be able to enjoy a positive yield on a more regular basis (even without being assigned as proposer from time to time) under circumstances where some MEV still remains (due to, e.g., a partial MEV burn or consensus layer preconfirmations).</p>\n<p>The violet curve subtracts <span class=\"math\">(D/k_2)^2</span> from the purple curve, with <span class=\"math\">k_2=9\\times10^8</span>. The effect is that the staking yield gradually turns negative, without ever going to negative infinity. This is a more restrained way to use negative yields. In reality the effects would be very similar. Some hypothetical benefits are that the equilibrium cannot happen at a point where the yield falls very sharply at the limit (influenced by a high MEV scenario) and that stakers will have better guarantees of not encountering a double-digit negative yield (which of course should not happen anyway). A downside is that there are no hard guarantees of capping the quantity of stake. Figure 16 shows the staking yield (inclusive of 300k ETH in execution layer rewards per year) and Figure 17 shows the issuance yield (no MEV).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/f/2f98e52e5dca73a297848e9d17a7a7a3fa00522b.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/2f98e52e5dca73a297848e9d17a7a7a3fa00522b\" title=\"Figure 16\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/f/2f98e52e5dca73a297848e9d17a7a7a3fa00522b_2_690x421.png\" alt=\"Figure 16\" data-base62-sha1=\"6N415QkIdBJSHrpElpWjdPsEaxB\" width=\"690\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/f/2f98e52e5dca73a297848e9d17a7a7a3fa00522b_2_690x421.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/f/2f98e52e5dca73a297848e9d17a7a7a3fa00522b_2_1035x631.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/f/2f98e52e5dca73a297848e9d17a7a7a3fa00522b_2_1380x842.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBF9FB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 16.</strong> Staking yield under three reward curves that cut issuance.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/6/d6b587dda3da7de95e2bba2194c886e3414cef73.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/d6b587dda3da7de95e2bba2194c886e3414cef73\" title=\"Figure 17\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/6/d6b587dda3da7de95e2bba2194c886e3414cef73_2_690x421.png\" alt=\"Figure 17\" data-base62-sha1=\"uDp6BeVqstzibbLE3RJuYW0saqv\" width=\"690\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/6/d6b587dda3da7de95e2bba2194c886e3414cef73_2_690x421.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/6/d6b587dda3da7de95e2bba2194c886e3414cef73_2_1035x631.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/6/d6b587dda3da7de95e2bba2194c886e3414cef73_2_1380x842.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAF9FA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 17.</strong> Issuance yield under three reward curves that cut issuance.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-4-economic-capping-34\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-4-economic-capping-34\"></a>4. Economic capping</h4>\n<p>Economic capping was <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/single_slot_finality#Economic-capping-of-total-deposits\">introduced by Vitalik</a> as a way to guarantee that the quantity of stake does not grow beyond some set limit. A more extensive write-up on economic capping was recently provided by <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751\">Caspar and Ansgar</a>, including the <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/electra-issuance-curve-adjustment-proposal/18825\">notion</a> of applying (4) after (2). Vitalik’s reward curve can be generalized to</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\ny_i = \\frac{cF}{\\sqrt{D}} - \\frac{cF_c}{\\sqrt{l-D}},\n</div>\n<p>here adapting the equation to a format that easily can be incorporated directly into the protocol spec. The first term is the current reward curve, and the second term is subtracted from it. Since the second term will go to infinity when the limit <span class=\"math\">l=D</span>, the staking yield will go to negative infinity at that point, capping the quantity of stake. Vitalik used <span class=\"math\">l=2^{25}</span>. The variable <span class=\"math\">F_c</span> shapes the magnitude of the reduction leading up to the cap, and was set to 32 in Vitalik’s curve (implied by <span class=\"math\">0.5\\times64</span> in his equation). Figures 18-21 show this reward curve in red.</p>\n<p>The first term of Vitalik’s equation can be swapped out for some other reward curve, as desired, to allow Ethereum to produce a desirable issuance in the critical region around 20M-40M ETH where an equilibrium is the most desirable. Using the purple curve from the previous subsection gives the equation</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\ny_i = \\frac{cF}{\\sqrt{D}(1+(D/k)^2)} - \\frac{cF_c}{\\sqrt{l-D}}.\n</div>\n<p>Figure 18 shows reward curves produced from this equation with a cap set at <span class=\"math\">l=</span> 60M ETH (1/2 of the stake; orange), <span class=\"math\">l=</span> 80M ETH (2/3 of the stake; yellow) and <span class=\"math\">l=</span> 90M ETH (3/4 of the stake; lime).

The red reward curve is Vitalik’s previous proposal, and the other three reward curves cap the deposit size at 60M ETH, 80M ETH and 90M ETH respectively.</p>\n<p>A cap at a low quantity of stake under MEV is not desirable, due to among other things the high relative variability, as discussed in previous answers (<a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#influence-of-mev-11\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#variability-for-solo-stakers-23\">2</a>). In my view, if Ethereum is to pursue economic capping, then reward curves that institute the cap at or above 60M ETH seem more promising, even after MEV burn. This will allow the quantity of stake to expand somewhat under particularly low supply curves. Yet, having a cap offers an ultimate guarantee and this can be very useful from a <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#h-2-macro-perspective-7\">macro perspective</a>. At some higher stake participation, the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#philosophical-underpinnings-of-the-optimization-problem-30\">expansion path</a> should therefore arguably venture into negative issuance yields (which will still lead to a <a href=\"https://x.com/weboftrees/status/1710720809797407063\">positive endogenous staking yield</a> under equilibrium), and this expansion path could then ultimately reach such a low negative territory that it can only be reached with an economic cap. In simpler terms, the negative aspects of stake participation growing very large are worse than the negative aspects of having a very low issuance yield.</p>\n<p>A beneficial feature of the presented equation system is that the cap would not involve some completely new equation, and can instead be conceived of as an “on-switch” when moving from (2) to (4). An example is shown in Figure 21, where the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-green-13\">previously presented</a> dashed green tempered issuance curve is updated by simply adding Vitalik’s cap term with <span class=\"math\">l</span> equal to 60M ETH, 80M ETH and 90M ETH respectively, setting <span class=\"math\">F_c=10</span>.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/f/a/fa300b09b139ef69a04bb500e66bf232faca0f9e.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/fa300b09b139ef69a04bb500e66bf232faca0f9e\" title=\"Figure 21\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/a/fa300b09b139ef69a04bb500e66bf232faca0f9e_2_690x421.png\" alt=\"Figure 21\" data-base62-sha1=\"zHgizkNAh756uTllitMcAxG4xA2\" width=\"690\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/a/fa300b09b139ef69a04bb500e66bf232faca0f9e_2_690x421.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/a/fa300b09b139ef69a04bb500e66bf232faca0f9e_2_1035x631.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/a/fa300b09b139ef69a04bb500e66bf232faca0f9e_2_1380x842.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9FAF9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 21.</strong> Switching on an economic cap. The reward curve with tempered issuance illustrated by a dashed green line is updated by adding a cap term limiting the quantity of stake to 60M ETH, 80M ETH and 90M ETH respectively (full green lines). Vitalik’s original reward curve for economic capping is shown in red.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-5-time-quantity-policy-35\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#h-5-time-quantity-policy-35\"></a>5. Time–quantity policy</h4>\n<p>Adding the dimension of <em>time</em> to the dimension of <em>quantity</em> is also worthy of consideration as an endgame, as described in the last paragraph of <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171#h-63-the-unknown-endgame-39\">Section 6.3</a> of a previous write-up. Under a time–quantity policy, the reward curve facing the user on shorter time scales can have a moderate predefined shape, but the whole curve is allowed to <a href=\"https://x.com/weboftrees/status/1710728448543523219\">gradually adapt</a> to changes in the supply curve, implied by the equilibrium. The mechanism is enforced by letting one or two of the variables defining the curve drift as a response to the deposit ratio deviating from some target. This drift can trivially be instituted as a small tick change each epoch, with a size that may or may not depend on the scale of the deviation.</p>\n<p>One key realization is that the reward curve variables should change slowly, with larger effects taking place at a time scale of years or even decades. There are a few reasons for this, related to issues discussed in a <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#why-not-dynamically-adjust-the-yield-with-a-mechanism-like-eip-1559-to-guarantee-some-fixed-target-participation-level-16\">previous answer</a> when targeting a fixed quantity of stake. Discouragement attacks and cartelization attacks may become less attractive if there is no immediate response in terms of an issuance increase. Furthermore, the protocol will produce a more stable yield if the short-run reward curve is flatter. From a communication perspective, the mechanism always provides a clear trajectory, whereas trying to rely <em>only on time</em> makes issuance trajectories harder to interpret. Finally, the mechanism provides a natural way to transition from one issuance policy to another without causing disruptions. One clear downside is added complexity in the design. As will be shown by the end of this subsection, it is also possible to more strictly retain the notion of budgeting by not relying on a fixed target, instead relying on an underlying target reward curve.</p>\n<p>Figure 22 shows yearly issuance under a time–quantity policy. For this example, the reward curve with tempered issuance <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-green-13\">previously presented</a> was used as a potential starting point in dashed green. A target of 30M ETH is marked by a dark grey vertical line, situated in between the blue crosses. If the quantity of stake is higher than the target, a cap similar to those described in the previous subsection slowly comes into play, gradually shifting the reward curve as indicated in light green, pushing down the yield. Over infinite time, with some fixed supply curve, the equilibrium will be situated either on the grey vertical line or the black curves at the edge that describes the maximum and minimum allowed settings for the reward curve. In this example, that corresponds to the current reward curve as a maximum and a cap at 80M ETH as the minimum (2/3 of the stake). It should be noted that a time–quantity policy does not require that the minimum reward curve institutes economic capping. In a way, this strategy is even more suitable in scenarios where there is no definite guarantee of some cap anyway.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/2/9/2967cb780e20fb051e64a7bbf7198bcc7baf67b5.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/2967cb780e20fb051e64a7bbf7198bcc7baf67b5\" title=\"Figure 22\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/9/2967cb780e20fb051e64a7bbf7198bcc7baf67b5_2_690x411.png\" alt=\"Figure 22\" data-base62-sha1=\"5UhXfpLpw9Z5SKV3OxD8z4wW9BH\" width=\"690\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/9/2967cb780e20fb051e64a7bbf7198bcc7baf67b5_2_690x411.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/9/2967cb780e20fb051e64a7bbf7198bcc7baf67b5_2_1035x616.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/2/9/2967cb780e20fb051e64a7bbf7198bcc7baf67b5_2_1380x822.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8FAF9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 22.</strong> Issuance under a time–quantity policy with a cap.

Over time scales of several years, the user faces something in between—a smoothed-out version of the current trajectory, drifting towards the black and grey parts of the reward curve.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/3/8/3873c05b46373aa8710e704853aaf6fa7b99455f.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/3873c05b46373aa8710e704853aaf6fa7b99455f\" title=\"Figure 23\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/8/3873c05b46373aa8710e704853aaf6fa7b99455f_2_690x422.png\" alt=\"Figure 23\" data-base62-sha1=\"83oJxEiklAX55BNkAk0vG3G8IvJ\" width=\"690\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/8/3873c05b46373aa8710e704853aaf6fa7b99455f_2_690x422.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/8/3873c05b46373aa8710e704853aaf6fa7b99455f_2_1035x633.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/8/3873c05b46373aa8710e704853aaf6fa7b99455f_2_1380x844.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8FAF8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 23.</strong> Issuance yield under a time quantity policy with a cap. A further description is provided in the figure text of Figure 22.</p>\n<p>One idea behind the time–quantity policy is that the supply curve might slowly fall as the relative costs associated with staking decrease, and that we cannot then enforce some specific quantity of stake over time without having the reward curve close to vertical. As previously discussed, one reason why a vertical reward curve seems undesirable is the high “<span class=\"math\">p_i</span>-elasticity” that it brings.</p>\n<p>Even if some specific quantity of stake is optimal, there might also be budgeting considerations in the long run. After all, the notion of not overpaying for security was stipulated as a benefit of using a reward curve in the first place. Figure 24 shows issuance under a smooth time–quantity policy with a cap. It attempts to achieve the best of both worlds: a stricter range in the long run that still has some notion of budgeting incorporated; a flatter reward curve for the short run, moderating fluctuations in yield/issuance, and budgeting based on recent steady states of the supply curve. The black curve is the target reward curve at infinite time scales. In the short run, the protocol will still operate according to a green reward curve, adapting the yield to a change in the quantity of stake.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/d/2/d21549907a63ac113784b2290f2acb935f37b0ba.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/d21549907a63ac113784b2290f2acb935f37b0ba\" title=\"Figure 24\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/2/d21549907a63ac113784b2290f2acb935f37b0ba_2_690x411.png\" alt=\"Figure 24\" data-base62-sha1=\"tYtSmf91wNu0ZVy7ipgIecps3RE\" width=\"690\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/2/d21549907a63ac113784b2290f2acb935f37b0ba_2_690x411.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/2/d21549907a63ac113784b2290f2acb935f37b0ba_2_1035x616.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/d/2/d21549907a63ac113784b2290f2acb935f37b0ba_2_1380x822.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9FAF9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 24.</strong> Issuance under a smooth time–quantity policy with a cap.

Furthermore, stakers are diluted from newly issued tokens just like everyone else. Therefore, if a high issuance compels many to stake, those that would have staked also at a lower issuance—with fewer stakers competing for the yield—might benefit at a lower issuance. It is by no means certain that the proportion of the ETH that a remaining staker attains will increase from a reduction in issuance (positive <span class=\"math\">y_p</span> as defined below), but any potential loss will be much more modest than what is implied by the change in issuance yield. The condition is illustrated with an isoproportion map in Figure 28.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"welfare-gain-stakers-as-eth-owners-39\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#welfare-gain-stakers-as-eth-owners-39\"></a>Welfare gain – stakers as ETH owners</h4>\n<p>When discussing the effect of issuance policy on stakers, it is first important to recognize that they own the underlying ETH. The native asset of a well-designed decentralized blockchain is more valuable than that of a poorly designed one. In the following subsections, the proportional yield/real yield will be analyzed, accounting for issuance and burn. But it is ultimately Ethereum’s ability to power the world economy that will affect the ETH token holder the most, including the staker. The real “real yield” incorporates the change in value of the underlying ETH—including any staking yield—relative to a relevant consumer price index. It is indeed very useful to have sound native money in an economic system. And the best sound money will not encumber its users to research the reliability of various SSPs, track staking income and see it taxed, or risk being wiped out in a slashing event or other failure.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"proportional-yield-40\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#proportional-yield-40\"></a>Proportional yield</h4>\n<p>Review Figure 26, an updated version of <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#h-1-reduced-costs-raise-welfare-6\">Figure 1</a>.

The height of the dark grey area represents the loss in yield <span class=\"math\">y</span> for stakers, captured by the red arrow.

If that height surpasses the height of the dark grey area, the staker will gain a higher proportion of the circulating supply from a reduction in issuance, otherwise it will not.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/c/0/c07e23557a6d6ede60faa43a1ac3b99052814a83.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/c07e23557a6d6ede60faa43a1ac3b99052814a83\" title=\"Figure 26\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/0/c07e23557a6d6ede60faa43a1ac3b99052814a83_2_673x500.png\" alt=\"Figure 26\" data-base62-sha1=\"rsRVh41GVKGUQEih9bC3Uc4eRVh\" width=\"673\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/0/c07e23557a6d6ede60faa43a1ac3b99052814a83_2_673x500.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/0/c07e23557a6d6ede60faa43a1ac3b99052814a83_2_1009x750.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/0/c07e23557a6d6ede60faa43a1ac3b99052814a83_2_1346x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E7E7F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 26.</strong> Implied cost (blue) and surplus (grey) of staking under a hypothetical future supply curve. A change in issuance policy shifts the equilibrium from the black square to the green circle. The cost reduction (dark blue) leads to aggregate welfare improvement as long as the protocol remains secure and decentralized, and the reduction in surplus (dark grey) simply shifts some utility from stakers to everyone. The remaining stakers lose out on yield (red arrow). They however gain from a reduction in the inflation rate (orange arrow), represented by the combined dark blue and grey area extended across the full 120M ETH supply.</p>\n<p>The issuance rate is formed as <span class=\"math\">i=y_id</span>, where <span class=\"math\">y_i</span> is the issuance yield and <span class=\"math\">d</span> is the proportion of the circulating supply that is staked. It was indeed the change in both <span class=\"math\">d</span> and <span class=\"math\">y_i</span> that determined the height of the orange arrow in Figure 26 (the change in <span class=\"math\">i</span>). The issuance rate affects the circulating supply inflation rate according to <span class=\"math\">s=i-b</span>.

There are three categories: the remaining <em>stakers</em>, the <em>de-stakers</em> between the green circle and black square on the supply curve, and those who were <em>non-stakers</em> already from the beginning. The idea is to compare <span class=\"math\">y_p</span> at the two different equilibria for all token holders, as it changes from <span class=\"math\">y^b_p</span> (black square) to <span class=\"math\">y^a_p</span> (green circle). If <span class=\"math\">y^a_p</span> is higher, the token holder benefits, otherwise it incurs losses. The comparison gives a change in cardinal utility as</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\nu’=\\frac{1+y^a_p}{1+y^b_p}-1.\n</div>\n<p>However, one addition is required: use the <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/MinimumViableIssuance#Benefits-of-MVI-to-user-utility\">reservation yield</a> as <span class=\"math\">y</span> for those who stop staking when computing <span class=\"math\">y^a_p</span>. Below that yield, they do not stake anyway, so they suffer no additional loss in utility as the yield decreases further. As shown in the bottom pane, de-stakers will under this definition derive a higher utility at the new equilibrium, with non-stakers clearly better off.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/a/2/a2330abe0b83f23e396a5e32c03e02f69a7aee2b.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/a2330abe0b83f23e396a5e32c03e02f69a7aee2b\" title=\"Figure 27\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/2/a2330abe0b83f23e396a5e32c03e02f69a7aee2b_2_690x465.png\" alt=\"Figure 27\" data-base62-sha1=\"n8SHQ8LwP2pE0XzKcGD7cC2eoqf\" width=\"690\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/2/a2330abe0b83f23e396a5e32c03e02f69a7aee2b_2_690x465.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/2/a2330abe0b83f23e396a5e32c03e02f69a7aee2b_2_1035x697.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/2/a2330abe0b83f23e396a5e32c03e02f69a7aee2b_2_1380x930.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F6F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 27.</strong> The change in <span class=\"math\">y</span> and <span class=\"math\">s</span> between two hypothetical equilibria is utilized to isolate a change in cardinal utility <span class=\"math\">u'</span> for all token holders. Stakers are subjected to a reduction in yield <span class=\"math\">y</span>, but the reduction in the inflation rate <span class=\"math\">s</span> is similar, so they are left unaffected (<span class=\"math\">y_p</span> stays the same).

The red arrows illustrate how a decrease in yield reduces utility for stakers, corresponding to the height of that dark grey area in Figure 26.

While stakers may be left unaffected by a reduction in issuance in terms of the proportion of the circulating supply they retain, they can <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/Foundations-of-MVI#Let-the-best-money-win\">still gain</a>, because the utility of the ETH asset has increased, in accordance with the size of the orange region. The purpose of <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/MinimumViableIssuance#Benefits-of-MVI-to-user-utility\">introducing</a> this figure in my original thread on minimum viable issuance was to encapsulate these insights (welfare gain + proportional yield) in one plot.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"the-isoproportion-map-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#the-isoproportion-map-42\"></a>The isoproportion map</h4>\n<p>Clearly the shape of the supply curve will be influential when determining if stakers gain from a reduction in issuance. Stakers benefit from an issuance increase under steep supply curves where no new stakers enter if the yield <span class=\"math\">y</span> goes up. Stakers do not benefit under flat supply curves where a slight bump to the yield makes a ton of new stakers enter, creating circulating supply inflation <span class=\"math\">s</span> in the process. In economics, it is common to use diagrams to illustrate trade-offs by drawing lines along which conditions remain constant, similar to contour lines on a topographical map indicating equal elevation. Figure 28 shows such a map, with “isoproportion lines” indicating where <span class=\"math\">y_p</span> stays the same. Each line is drawn according to the following equation:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\ny = \\frac{y_p-(1+y_p)(v+b)}{1-d-y_pd},\\quad \\quad  y_p&lt;\\frac{1-d}{d}.\n</div>\n<p>It is <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171#h-44-the-isoproportion-map-28\">formed</a> by reworking the equation for <span class=\"math\">y_p</span>.

If the slope of the corresponding grey isoproportion line is steeper than the slope of the supply curve under equilibrium, stakers benefit from a reduction in issuance. The red area is at a lower elevation on the map than the orange area even though the staking yield is higher, and thus a worse equilibrium for stakers.</p>\n<p>Review the purple dashed isoporoportion line. Stakers get a real staking yield of 1.7% anywhere on this line, although the staking yield and stake participation vary. The red region lies below the line, so ending up there is worse for stakers than ending up in the orange region above the line, even though the staking yield is higher in the entire red region than in the orange region. When nearly everyone stakes, the supply curve must be almost vertical for stakers to benefit from an increase in issuance yield, since the supply inflation rate will increase nearly as much. The orange arrow points towards higher elevation on the isoproportion map, and the ideal equilibrium for stakers lies in the top left corner. But unfortunately for stakers, an equilibrium must lie on the supply curve. Now look at the purple full isoproportion line.</p>\n<p>The hypothetical supply curve in blue from the earlier Figures 26-27 intersects both the current reward curves (black) and reward curve with tempered issuance (green) along this line—the equilibria (black square and green circle) are thus at the same “elevation”. This explains why stakers were unaffected in the previous discussion. The highest elevation of the supply curve is marked by a blue star, situated between the two equilibria.  At this point, the supply curve is tangent to the corresponding isoproportion line. Plots by <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/electra-issuance-curve-adjustment-proposal/18825#proposal-for-electra-issuance-curve-adjustment-3\">Caspar and Ansgar</a> as well as <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@mikeneuder/subsol#3-Scaled-Root-Curve-alternative-issuance\">Mike</a> of the green reward curve are useful for showing how its elevation (<span class=\"math\">y_p</span>) varies across stake participation (without incorporating MEV or burn). This is akin to sampling its value from the map across stake participation.</p>\n<p>How might the supply curve evolve going forward? Use your intuition to outline its shape and check where your imaginary supply curve reaches the highest elevation on the map (as marked by the star). That’s where the reward curve should intersect the supply curve for stakers to gain the highest proportion of the circulating supply. However, also remember the lessons from the earlier discussion: stakers also gain by holding the native token of a well-designed cryptocurrency that remains secure and imposes low aggregate costs on its users.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"some-users-think-that-more-yield-is-more-fun-and-like-to-collect-yield-on-their-eth-why-not-lean-into-this-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#some-users-think-that-more-yield-is-more-fun-and-like-to-collect-yield-on-their-eth-why-not-lean-into-this-43\"></a>Some users think that more yield is more fun and like to collect yield on their ETH.

Behavioral economics can be helpful in this way for explaining why some economic agents act irrationally, perhaps for lack of education or time to deliberate on a topic. But Ethereum should not harness people’s bounded understanding of yield, and keep it high to trick users into thinking that they gain something, when they do in fact not. It is instead important to educate people on these matters so that user utility is not degraded for some hypothetical short-term gain, which is unlikely to materialize. More yield is not more fun. An optimally designed Ethereum is more fun.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675","pubDate":"Wed, 29 May 2024 15:20:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19675"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675.rss","#text":"FAQ: Ethereum issuance reduction"},"filter":false},{"title":"Big blocks, blobs, and reorgs","dc:creator":"Nero_eth","category":"Sharding","description":"<h1><a name=\"big-blocks-blobs-and-reorgs-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#big-blocks-blobs-and-reorgs-1\"></a>Big blocks, blobs, and reorgs</h1>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.eip4844.com/\">EIP-4844</a> going live, Ethereum effectively increased its transaction throughput by providing dedicated space for rollups to post their data down to L1.</p>\n<p>Blobs are now the main contributor to the block size, while the average beacon block size (excluding blobs) went down from ~<span class=\"math\">125</span> KB to ~<span class=\"math\">90</span> KB.</p>\n<p><strong>In the chart below, one can see the impact of blobs on the data throughput of Ethereum:</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/9/9/992968f3269c56752a8fc1ce4805ff35f91c1f03.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/992968f3269c56752a8fc1ce4805ff35f91c1f03\" title=\"block_content_over_time\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/9/9/992968f3269c56752a8fc1ce4805ff35f91c1f03.png\" alt=\"block_content_over_time\" data-base62-sha1=\"lQVLWZ4FMxYJeVwnWoejm9qmj7R\" width=\"690\" height=\"394\" data-dominant-color=\"CFDBD9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Such an increase in throughput is expected to push certain “weaker” validators to their limits.

As this separation seems inevitable in the long term, what does it mean to separate and pipeline consensus and execution validations into different stages? This post will explore the details, going into the benefits and downsides.</p>\n<p>Since Ethereum moved to <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proof of stake</a>, a node runs two pieces of software: <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/#merging-with-mainnet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a consensus client and an execution client</a>. The consensus client verifies the consensus part of the block, while the execution client verifies the execution part. Although the validations are separated in two different software, the validation result is coupled. If either the consensus validation or the execution validation fails, the whole block fails. Timeline-wise, both validations must be completed before the <span class=\"math\">AttestationDeadline</span> (4 seconds into the beacon slot) for the block to be considered as <a href=\"https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/forkchoice/#whats-a-fork-choice\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">head</a> for the attestation vote. This separation of concern for the two layers allows a node to verify consensus and execution in parallel. But despite parallel validation, both the consensus and execution parts of the block <strong>MUST</strong> be validated before the <span class=\"math\">AttestationDeadline</span>. Currently, the average block arrives at the 1 to 2-second mark into the slot, giving the running node less than 2 seconds to complete the verifications. This is called the <strong>validation</strong> <strong>hot path</strong>.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/5/9/59b830c5f23687d39a664ce8187c4d5672bbee06.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/59b830c5f23687d39a664ce8187c4d5672bbee06\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-23 at 6.47.57 AM\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/9/59b830c5f23687d39a664ce8187c4d5672bbee06_2_690x307.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-23 at 6.47.57 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"cNH7w2Sst6mgVuNQzWLEToDO19Q\" width=\"690\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/9/59b830c5f23687d39a664ce8187c4d5672bbee06_2_690x307.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/9/59b830c5f23687d39a664ce8187c4d5672bbee06_2_1035x460.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/9/59b830c5f23687d39a664ce8187c4d5672bbee06_2_1380x614.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1B2121\"></a></div><br>\n<em>How long it took the beacon block + execution payload to arrive on my local NUC node</em><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/c/7/c7581900ce6df801b5261dc709b5344e35480859.png\" data-download-href=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/c7581900ce6df801b5261dc709b5344e35480859\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-23 at 6.50.00 AM\"><img src=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/7/c7581900ce6df801b5261dc709b5344e35480859_2_690x308.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-23 at 6.50.00 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"srtLqFOjmQm64wkn9IEjZT1QLSV\" width=\"690\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/7/c7581900ce6df801b5261dc709b5344e35480859_2_690x308.png, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/7/c7581900ce6df801b5261dc709b5344e35480859_2_1035x462.png 1.5x, https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/7/c7581900ce6df801b5261dc709b5344e35480859_2_1380x616.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1B2020\"></a></div><br>\n<em>How long it took the execution layer client to finish processing the execution payload on my local NUC node</em><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"consensus-and-execution-pipelining-in-pbs-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#consensus-and-execution-pipelining-in-pbs-2\"></a>Consensus and execution pipelining in PBS</h2>\n<p>In this section, we’ll focus on block-auction-based EPBS.

Nothing else changes here.</p>\n<p>As a winning <strong>builder</strong> for the current slot, I reveal my execution block at the 6-second mark. I may choose to withhold my execution block to gain a <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/payload-boosts-in-epbs/18769\">withhold boost</a> if the beacon block is very weak, but I will reveal it as long as there is 40% of the current slot beacon committee voted for my execution header as canonical.</p>\n<p>As a <strong>PTC attester</strong> for the current slot, I cast my vote on the execution block revealed on time and verify that the execution block hash is valid. I don’t need to perform complete execution verification tasks like heavy state root validation before casting my vote. More on how PTC attester votes <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@ttsao/epbs-annotated-validator#PTC-attestation-duty\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>As a <strong>builder</strong> trying to win the next slot, as soon as the current slot builder reveals its winning execution block, I can begin building. This happens in less than 6 seconds. Before I build my block, I need to verify that the execution block I’m building on is valid.</p>\n<p>As a <strong>proposer</strong> for the next slot, I package the current slot PTC attestations into my block and pick the best bid that reflects my local chain view, which includes the beacon head root and execution reveal status. I should also verify the execution block to ensure I do not choose a header that builds on top of an invalid execution block as a parent.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"execution-validation-hot-path-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://ethresear.ch#execution-validation-hot-path-3\"></a>Execution validation hot path</h2>\n<p>Now you ask… <strong>When is the deadline to verify the execution block for slot</strong> <span class=\"math\">n</span>?

(Cheaper validations like block hash can still be done) If the <span class=\"math\">n+1</span> proposer reveals the consensus block that builds on top of the execution payload and the attester casts its vote on the beacon block, the attesters will apply the builder’s boost to the execution block if the previous PTC has voted reveal on time and the execution block is valid.

Bottom: block production under block-auction based ePBS.</em><p></p>\n<p>One downside that is worth mentioning is that builders competing for the next slot now have less time to prepare for the block. Assuming honest builder behavior and no <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/builder-reveal-timing-game-in-epbs/19424\">builder timing games</a>, this time decreases from today’s 8 seconds to 6 seconds.</p>\n<p>I hope this post was able to illustrate the key point that by separating consensus and execution into different stages, the network reaps additional benefits like those mentioned above. This is one positive side effect of PBS, although it may not have been what PBS was initially intended to solve. Given that there’s more time to process the execution block, it’s up to the execution layer to innovate and determine what benefits it could bring, such as increasing the gas limit once state growth has a clear solution or other improvements.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/advantage-of-pipelining-consensus-and-execution-delayed-execution/19668\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://ethresear.ch/t/advantage-of-pipelining-consensus-and-execution-delayed-execution/19668","pubDate":"Tue, 28 May 2024 13:35:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"ethresear.ch-topic-19668"},"source":{"@url":"https://ethresear.ch/t/advantage-of-pipelining-consensus-and-execution-delayed-execution/19668.rss","#text":"Advantage of Pipelining Consensus and Execution: Delayed Execution"},"filter":false}]}}}
