This upgrade will burn an amount of POL equivalent to MATIC in the addresses currently used to permanently remove (burn) MATIC tokens from supply (ex: 0x000…dEaD) as well as other permanently inaccessible tokens, thus bringing the POL circulating supply in line with the MATIC supply.</p>\n<p>Execution</p>\n<p>The subsequent section of the code provides a detailed overview of the execution specifications related to the proposed system smart contract change.

Since then, I’ve embarked on a journey filled with experiences in these exciting fields. Today, I aim to provide an overview of my four-year journey.</p>\n<p>The Beginning:<br>\nUpon stepping into the world of cryptocurrency, I realized that Bitcoin was not just a currency but also a revolutionary technology. The power and potential of blockchain fascinated me. Witnessing how this technology could potentially revolutionize financial systems was exhilarating. I felt a keen eagerness to observe and understand the technological advancements in this field, alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>Crypto Trading and Investments:<br>\nOver time, I began to acquire more knowledge about trading and investing in cryptocurrencies. I made efforts to analyze price movements, monitor market trends, and diversify my portfolio. Throughout this process, I learned to cope with market volatility and developed strategies to minimize risks. Concurrently, I continued to conduct research to keep abreast of innovations in the crypto world and evaluate potential opportunities.</p>\n<p>The Rise of NFTs:<br>\nIn conjunction with developments in the crypto world, I also became captivated by the rise of NFTs. The concept of tokenizing unique digital assets in areas such as art, gaming, music, and beyond was revolutionary in cultural and artistic terms. Numerous interesting discussions and projects emerged regarding how NFTs could transform the creative economy. Intrigued by this field, I delved into researching NFTs and participated in various projects.</p>\n<p>Conclusion:<br>\nThroughout this four-year journey, I have learned and experienced many aspects of cryptocurrency and NFTs. The rapid pace of change and development in these fields continues to excite and motivate me. I firmly believe that cryptocurrency and NFTs will become even more pervasive in the future, exerting a significant impact worldwide.

Currently, I work as a blockchain developer, focusing on smart contract development and decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p>How do you see your skills and experiences contributing to your Web3 journey?<br>\nMy experience in software engineering allows me to understand and implement complex blockchain solutions efficiently. Additionally, my passion for decentralized technologies drives me to constantly learn and adapt to the rapidly evolving Web3 landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Interests in Web3:</strong> What specific areas of Web3 are you most passionate about (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Gaming)?<br>\nI’m particularly passionate about DeFi and DAOs. The idea of financial services being accessible to everyone and the potential for decentralized governance models is incredibly exciting to me.</p>\n<p>Are there any projects or technologies in Web3 that you find particularly exciting or innovative?<br>\nI’m very interested in the developments around layer 2 scaling solutions, such as zk-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups. These technologies promise to make blockchain more scalable and accessible.</p>\n<p><strong>Feature Recommendations:</strong> Have you or a friend ever experienced any pain points when using Polygon PoS? Or, do you have any exciting ideas for the chain you would like to voice?<br>\nOne pain point I’ve experienced with Polygon PoS is the occasional congestion during peak usage times, which can lead to higher transaction fees and slower confirmations.</p>\n<p>If so, do you have any specific features/solutions you think would work well?<br>\nImplementing more efficient load-balancing mechanisms and optimizing the consensus protocol could help alleviate these issues. Additionally, enhancing user experience through better wallet integrations and developer tools would be beneficial.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Projects:</strong> Are you currently working on any Web3 projects? If so, please briefly overview what you’re working on.<br>\nYes, I’m currently working on a DeFi project that aims to provide decentralized lending and borrowing services. The goal is to offer a more inclusive financial platform that anyone can access, regardless of their location or background.</p>\n<p>How can the community support your projects? Are there specific collaborations or insights you’re seeking?<br>\nThe community can support by providing feedback on our platform and participating in our beta testing phase. We’re also looking for partnerships with other DeFi projects and insights on improving user experience and security.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning and Development:</strong> What challenges have you faced in the Web3 space, and how have you overcome them?<br>\nOne of the biggest challenges is keeping up with the fast-paced developments and ever-evolving technologies in Web3. I’ve overcome this by dedicating time to continuous learning through online courses, attending industry conferences, and participating in developer communities.</p>\n<p>Are there any resources or learning paths you’ve found invaluable in your Web3 education that you’d like to share?<br>\nI highly recommend resources like CryptoZombies for learning smart contract development, and platforms like Coursera and Udemy for more structured blockchain courses. Additionally, following industry leaders on social media and reading whitepapers has been incredibly valuable.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> How do you envision contributing to the Polygon Labs community?<br>\nI plan to contribute by sharing my knowledge through tutorials and blog posts, participating in community discussions, and helping with open-source projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and look forward to building alongside fellow Polygon enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>Are you looking forward to participating in any discussions, events, or initiatives?<br>\nYes, I’m excited about participating in hackathons and developer meetups. These events are great for networking, learning, and showcasing innovative projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Aspirations:</strong> What are your long-term goals within Web3 and blockchain technology?<br>\nMy long-term goal is to contribute to the development of a more decentralized and equitable digital economy. I hope to create solutions that empower individuals and communities, fostering greater financial inclusion and innovation.</p>\n<p>How do you see the future of blockchain evolving, and what role do you hope to play in it?<br>\nI see blockchain evolving to become a fundamental part of our digital infrastructure, with widespread adoption across various industries. I hope to play a role in driving this adoption by building robust and user-friendly blockchain applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Share a fun fact about yourself or your hobbies outside of Web3.<br>\nOutside of Web3, I’m an avid rock climber and enjoy exploring the great outdoors. I also love playing the guitar and experimenting with different music genres.</p>\n<p>Is there anything else you’d like the community to know about you?<br>\nI’m always open to new ideas and collaborations. I believe that the strength of the Web3 community lies in our collective creativity and willingness to support each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Connect and Collaborate:</strong> How can other community members reach out to you for collaborations or discussions?<br>\nYou can reach out to me on Twitter <span class=\"mention\">@TomoFujikawa</span> or via LinkedIn. I’m always happy to connect with like-minded individuals and discuss potential collaborations.</p>\n<p>Are you looking for feedback, partners, or resources for your projects?<br>\nYes, I’m always looking for feedback on my projects and am interested in finding partners who share a passion for decentralized technologies. Any resources or insights that can help improve our platform are greatly appreciated.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/introduction-im-tomo/16882\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/introduction-im-tomo/16882","pubDate":"Mon, 17 Jun 2024 14:11:31 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-16882"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/introduction-im-tomo/16882.rss","#text":"Introduction, Im Tomo"},"filter":false}]}}}
