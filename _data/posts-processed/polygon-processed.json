Under highly specific – and very unlikely – conditions being met, the bug could have potentially allowed a malicious actor to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Heimdall network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"root-cause-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#root-cause-2\"></a>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>Heimdall needs to acquire specific public keys, which are contained in two messages (ValidatorJoin, SignerUpdate). These keys are crucial for the validator to sign PoS commitments and votes. The validity of these public keys is confirmed against the corresponding Ethereum log in the StakeInfo contract. This process is meant to ensure that the public key aligns with the one selected by the validator.</p>\n<p>However, a complication arises due to an implementation nuance in the secp256k1 library utilized in Heimdall/Peppermint. Public keys must include an additional prefix byte, making them a total of 65 bytes long. Unfortunately, Heimdall does not verify the first byte of the public key in any message. This contrasts with the secp256k1 signature validation, which requires the prefix to be 0x04, 0x06, or 0x07; otherwise, validation fails.</p>\n<p>The sole validation performed on the public key bytes is to ensure that the slice pubkey[1:] matches the 64-byte public key from the Ethereum log. The initial byte provided in the message is merely copied and stored without validation. Additionally, attempting to verify the address generated by hashing the public key proves futile, as the address is derived from the truncated hash of the 64-byte public key, once again disregarding the prefix byte.</p>\n<p>As a result of this lack of validation, whenever a new validator joins the network or an existing validator updates their signing key, a malicious actor can exploit the situation by submitting a message containing a corrupted version of the public key for that validator, such as setting the first byte to 0xff.</p>\n<p>This corrupted message will be readily accepted and verified by all validators, including the victim validator. Consequently, each validator will store the corrupted public key. Subsequently, when the victim validator attempts to send a commitment or proposal, all other validators will attempt to verify the signature using the corrupted key, leading to constant verification failures.</p>\n<p>This situation renders the victim validator incapable of participating in the PoS protocol until the signing key is updated again, a process that takes 100 epochs. Moreover, even after updating the signing key, the attacker can simply repeat the attack.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"resolution-and-recovery-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#resolution-and-recovery-3\"></a>Resolution and Recovery</h2>\n<p>A patch was successfully released on March 14th 2024, with Heimdall <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v1.0.5\">tag v1.0.5</a>. It consists of one <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/pull/1149\">main PR</a>, where a new method has been introduced. The function, called <code>IsPubKeyFirstByteValid</code> checks the first byte of the validator’s public key every time a <code>SignerUpdate</code> or a <code>ValidatorJoin</code> event is invoked. It basically validates that the first byte of the public key is <code>0x04</code>, which stands for “uncompressed public key”, the format used by Polygon PoS nodes. The unit tests confirmed the validity of this new method.</p>\n<p>The patch was first tested on a devnet, then tested and rolled out on Mumbai and Mainnet nodes. A release announcement was shared, allowing all the validators to upgrade.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 14:50:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13780"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780.rss","#text":"Heimdall Security Bug Fix"},"filter":false},{"title":"Recent Downtime on Astar zkEVM","dc:creator":"J_Nicolas","category":"Announcements","description":"<p>Earlier this week, an outage on Astar zkEVM required an emergency upgrade of the network.

As such, they need to possess the skills necessary to assess these efforts well or delegate them to other collaborators they deem qualified.</li>\n<li>Community Expertise—The Polygon ecosystem is at a pivotal moment as it builds a strong community ready to advance it even further. Prospective CTB members need to be able to leverage this effort as an opportunity for long-term ecosystem growth.</li>\n<li>Operational Expertise—Operating the CT is a significant undertaking that requires CTB members to have operational expertise to spin up large programs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"ctb-responsibilities-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#ctb-responsibilities-5\"></a>CTB Responsibilities</h3>\n<p>The Community Treasury Board will be able to determine its procedures to address the following responsibilities.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"strategy-setting-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#strategy-setting-6\"></a>Strategy Setting</h4>\n<p>Before a funding cycle starts, CTB prepares and publishes a strategy document. The document sets out a framework for project funding categories, subcategories, and the eligibility of each funding track in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>Pre-cycle preparation is accomplished when the CTB produces a final strategy delineating the above-described allocations. This strategy is published transparently.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"track-selection-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#track-selection-7\"></a>Track Selection</h4>\n<p>This proposal distinguishes two tracks, which the CTB may employ as needed on a per-season basis by including in the strategy document.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct Funding Track</strong></p>\n<p>The direct funding track facilitates submissions from individual projects to the CTB. All prospective grantees will require CTB approval to receive funding from the CT, following a process laid out by the CTB.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Allocator track</strong></p>\n<p>The Grant Allocator track relies on specialized entities facilitating the distribution of allocated funds to grantees. Similarly to individual projects, prospective Grant Allocators will follow a process laid out by the Community Treasury Board.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"expenditure-approval-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#expenditure-approval-8\"></a>Expenditure Approval</h4>\n<p>At all times, the CTB is responsible for reviewing applications from all tracks and approving all expenditures from the Community Treasury, assisted by the Polygon Village Grants team as needed. The Village Grants team may propose funding proposals, but CTB approval is always final and necessary.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"post-cycle-reporting-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#post-cycle-reporting-9\"></a>Post-Cycle Reporting</h4>\n<p>Post-cycle, the CTB is responsible for producing a transparency report capturing the decisions, expenses, and the total impact across all participating Grant Allocators.

Resolution required recomputation of the network’s state. A new version of the sequencer (v0.6.5-RC6), released shortly after, included an additional protection to prevent this issue from recurring in the short term. An additional, independent protection was added on April 09.</p>\n<p>In resolving the issue, the network was down for twenty minutes. Polygon PoS, chains built with Polygon CDK, and chains connected to the AggLayer were unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>For dApps on zkEVM: Transactions made on April 08, between approximately 3:00 UTC and 7:30 UTC, had to be re-executed. These transactions may have been processed in a different block or may not have been processed—please get in touch below, if this is the case. Approximately 1,000 transactions may have been affected.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"description-of-the-incident-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#description-of-the-incident-1\"></a>Description of the Incident</h2>\n<p>On April 08, the sequencer for Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta detected a reorg on the underlying L1, at block 19608115.</p>\n<p>Because of the network’s recent state sync issue, a protection was already included in the sequencer. This protection worked as expected, but the network’s synchronizer did not handle the reorg properly. Instead of just updating a record, in this case it inserted a new record. The sequencer then inserted a new Global Exit Root at batch 2005906. While this Global Exit Root was correct, it took an index that it was one greater than what it should be.</p>\n<p>When this batch was inserted in L1, the selected index still didn’t exist, causing it to be interpreted as invalid.</p>\n<p>In summary, the network’s trusted state included this batch as valid while the virtual state considered it invalid. Resolving this required re-execution of the trusted state with this block as invalid in order to build the proof. Consequently, some transactions were not executed and some transactions were re-executed with different results.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"future-mitigation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#future-mitigation-2\"></a>Future Mitigation</h2>\n<p>This is the second state synchronization issue for Polygon zkEVM. The core engineers for zkEVM have since released two independent protections, each of them robust enough to prevent L1 reorgs from causing this state synchronization issue to recur.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sequencer v0.6.5-RC6, released April 08, includes a mechanism for detecting when an L1 reorg occurs; once a reorg is detected, the network will continue operating normally, but the sequencer will temporarily stop accepting new Global Exit Roots until confirmation that the network’s state is synchronized.</li>\n<li>An additional protection was added to the synchronizer on April 09. It allows the network to synchronize from older blocks, where older blocks are a config parameter that act as a safe checkpoint.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-of-events-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#timeline-of-events-3\"></a>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p><strong>April 08, 2024</strong><br>\n<strong>02:56 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe sequencer for Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta detected a reorg at block <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/19608115\">19608115</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reorg: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/19608115/f\">https://etherscan.io/block/19608115/f</a></li>\n<li>The synchronizer failed to properly handle this reorg, inserting a new record instead of updating the existing record.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Approximately 03:00 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe sequencer inserted a new Global Exit Root at batch 2005906. This Global Exit Root was correct, but improper handling by the synchronizer caused an incorrect index taken by the sequencer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When this batch was committed to the L1, it was interpreted as invalid.</li>\n<li>At this point, the network’s trusted state and virtual state were synchronized with different states.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>03:36 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe core engineers for zkEVM received an alert of a state synchronization issue.</p>\n<p><strong>6:47 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe correct state of the network was recomputed at batch 2005966, using the same sequenced batches except for those that may have been invalid.</p>\n<p><strong>7:30 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe network was restarted and resumed normal operation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Infrastructure providers were asked to resync permissionless nodes</li>\n<li>Etherscan and the Graph reindexed from L2 block 11425001</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>7:48 UTC:</strong><br>\nNetwork downtime began</p>\n<p><strong>8:06 UTC:</strong><br>\nNetwork downtime ended</p>\n<p><strong>09:50 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe sequencer was updated to v0.6.5-RC6, which includes the first protection mechanism described above.

Polygon PoS, chains built with Polygon CDK, and chains connected to the AggLayer were unaffected.</p>\n<p>Resolving the outage resulted in an emergency upgrade to the Verifier, as well as a reindexing on Etherscan and resynchronization of permissionless nodes. For dApps on Polygon zkEVM: Some transactions made on March 22 and March 23 were affected by a network reorg and may have been processed in a different block or may not have been processed—please get in touch below, if this is the case. Approximately 4,000 transactions may have been affected.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"description-of-incident-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#description-of-incident-1\"></a>Description of Incident</h2>\n<p>The network outage was caused by a reorg on the underlying L1, a relatively common situation, usually involving a depth of 1 or 2 blocks. The original version of the reorged block included a deposit transaction from Polygon zkEVM that generated an update on the Global Exit Root, which is the root of the bridge’s global exit Merkle Tree. The reorged block that followed did not include this deposit transaction.</p>\n<p>The synchronizer for Polygon zkEVM did not correctly detect this reorg and the record was not deleted or updated from the State Database for over two epochs, approximately 12 minutes. As a result, the sequencer included the incorrect Global Exit Root in the next L2 block. The actual state of the network was different from the one that was published.</p>\n<p>As a result of the reorg, many transactions following this block returned an invalid nonce. Valid proofs for these transactions were generated, but the result of these transactions were no-operation, as if they were not there. The analysis of the incident, development of the fixes, and synchronization of these no-op transactions delayed recovery of the network.</p>\n<p>Resolving these issues ultimately required putting the network into an Emergency State, a security mechanism that allows the network to be upgraded without a timelock, conditional on the approval of the Security Council. The Security Council is a 6/8 multisig, with two members from Polygon Labs. On March 24, at 23:00 UTC, the network was halted and upgraded. This is the first time that the Emergency State mechanism has been used. For more on the network’s security mechanisms, see zkEVM’s governance model: <a href=\"https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/architecture/protocol/security-council/\">Security Council</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solution-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#solution-2\"></a>Solution</h2>\n<p>Due to the invalid management of the L1 reorgs from synchronization, updated versions of the Node and Prover were released.

This suggested funding process could become a highly effective and scalable approach for Web3 ecosystems to more consistently generate impact.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to experiment with a contributor funding approach is better highlighted by understanding some of the problems that exist with idea based funding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For contributors, the proposal submission process can require a large amount of effort and time upfront for contributors to participate and then also handle the ongoing burden of proposal writing and budgeting complexities to get involved in an ecosystem. The structure and incentives of this funding process result in a reduced amount of contribution flexibility and income stability that can deter contributors from participating or limit their ability to easily generate high impact.</li>\n<li>For voters, it is often highly complex to compare and select ideas effectively. Many voters lack the sufficient context, skills and experience required to be well informed and effectively participate in these decisions. The selection process can be highly time consuming and complex for the voters. Voters can rarely express their exact preferences with their voting decisions and also do not have enough accountability or incentives to be expected to spend a meaningful amount of time on voting to make more optimal and well informed decisions.</li>\n<li>For Web3 ecosystems, ideas are often treated as ephemeral yes or no funding decisions rather than being a collaborative process that looks to discuss and explore different solution approaches. In larger funding processes it can also become easier for innovative ideas to be ignored due to being less well understood or known. The allocation of assets can also be more inefficient in situations where the allocated funds are not actively being used to generate contribution outcomes, this can increase the percentage of deadweight assets that are not being fully utilised at a given point in time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To understand these problems in more detail you can review our analysis on the current funding landscape - <a href=\"https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/current-funding-landscape\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/current-funding-landscape</a></p>\n<p>The good news is that most of these problems can be either greatly reduced or fully resolved! An open source contributor funding process can help with resolving these problems and also could become a highly reliable and effective process for maintaining and improving Web3 ecosystems over the long term.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996\" title=\"web3-open-source-contributor-funding\"><img src=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ce9432c6200335b971ca40a62076ca9cdbea996.jpeg\" alt=\"web3-open-source-contributor-funding\" data-base62-sha1=\"dfVGL3faJmTg9b9msENXyJpbhnE\" width=\"690\" height=\"365\" data-dominant-color=\"D1DEE6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Our proposal outlines the suggestion of experimenting with directly funding a small number of open source developers that would help with developing any open source initiatives - this could include improving any existing pieces of software used in the ecosystem or creating entirely new tools and libraries.</p>\n<p>The advantages and long term opportunities for adopting a contributor funding approach are numerous. We’ve covered the advantages and opportunities of this suggested funding process in more detail in our proposal - <a href=\"https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/open-source-contributor-funding\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors/open-source-contributor-funding</a></p>\n<p>You can alternatively watch our videos that cover the same content from our proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZWo9qNm3mvs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/ZWo9qNm3mvs</a> - Current Web3 funding landscape</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/f3fP2bjf6rY\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/f3fP2bjf6rY</a> - Tech company comparison with Web3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/mQHqwHIDKMo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/mQHqwHIDKMo</a> - Open source contributor funding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The background analysis that helps to support this proposal can be found here - <a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://disbursement.treasuries.co</a></p>\n<br> \n<h1><a name=\"experimentation-in-polygon-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#experimentation-in-polygon-1\"></a>Experimentation in Polygon</h1>\n<p>Polygon has an idea funding grants process called <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/village\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Polygon Village</a>. This is an open process however is currently fairly targeted towards zero knowledge DeFi solutions. Arguably this makes it closer towards a request for proposals type of structure.</p>\n<p>Experimenting with an open source contributor funding process could simply mean adding in an extra form process to enable software developers to indicate their interest in contributing to the Polygon ecosystem as a contributor. These individuals could then help with existing open source solutions being built or new ones that the Polygon Foundation suggest to them.</p>\n<p>The immediate opportunity with experimenting with a contributor focused funding approach would be that it would make it easier for software developers to indicate their interest in working in the Polygon ecosystem. The Polygon Foundation could then identify if there are any promising candidates that could be suitable for contributing towards any relevant initiative in the ecosystem. Contributor funding proposals could end up bringing in impactful talent that otherwise might not have got involved due to the more time consuming upfront idea proposal process. The idea process can make it more difficult for these individuals to just express their interest in working in the ecosystem. A contributor focussed process could provide a more collaborative path for identifying promising talent and matching them with ongoing work that could create impact in the ecosystem.</p>\n<br> \n<h1><a name=\"experiment-facilitation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#experiment-facilitation-2\"></a>Experiment facilitation</h1>\n<p>If any ecosystem was interested in experimenting with this suggested funding process but doesn’t want to handle the process fully themselves I am eager to collaborate with them and help wherever I can with setting up and running any of these experiments that are focussed on contributor funding.</p>\n<p>In either event, contributor funding experiments across many ecosystems could be highly beneficial for the wider industry. The outcomes from these experiments can be analysed to better compare the strengths and weaknesses of this suggested approach against the widely adopted idea based funding approach that we see being more widely used across Web3 ecosystems today. Analysing and documenting these experiment outcomes is something that we intend to work on at the <a href=\"https://web3association.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Web3 Association</a>!</p>\n<br> \n<h1><a name=\"community-discussion-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#community-discussion-3\"></a>Community discussion</h1>\n<p><strong>General thoughts &amp; feedback</strong><br>\nThere’s likely going to be many opportunities and problems that could be better explored and addressed.
