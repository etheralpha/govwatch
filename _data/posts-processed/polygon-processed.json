With a background of commmercial activities as a red line throughout my life. The mechanics of web3 and cryptography intrigue me ,as they  enforce by default. This is a charactieristic and skill at the same time.

While defi brings the masses together ,games will ofcourse soon emerge. To entertain these masses. By communication ,trial and error i hope to be part of the evolution of this ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Soon multichain- smartwallets will bring blockchain interoperabillity to be carried without noticing or significant extra costs and delays. I would be surprised if the fastest  and most chains like Ppos wot be leading this development.</p>\n<p>As newcomers our first hirdle is the terminology of web3. Reading ,interacting and practice are the most helpful and available tools i have found to overcome this. A more profound understanding of these gives any web3 experience true depth and empowers us as users to stay in control. Not only managing our assets but also when defending against bad actors.</p>\n<p>Herefore we should share the best but also the worst we encounter. Trusted and controlled environments like poly forum are the trool of my choice to consume and relay reliable info on developments and events</p>\n<p>Liquidity ,efficiency ,management of assets are a restless ever evolving flow. With inflation as a immortal reminder and driver to stay flowing. With such forces working on this ecosystem ,i am excited to to not just praticipate but take control of our future.</p>\n<p>As a self-taught craftsman i will always prioritize sharing knowledge and experience before capitalizing knowledge.</p>\n<p>If anything is said got you wondering or thinking. i must first thank you for reading this far.

For the past five years, I worked at a consulting firm servicing the Financial Services sector, primarily focusing on Private Equity, Investment Banking, Venture Capital, M&amp;A, and Alternative Asset Management firms. I spent my tenure there overseeing and expanding our Business Development &amp; Executive Search departments while also building up a new division from scratch offering Marketing &amp; Strategy consulting services to clients on an international scale.</p>\n<p>The firm recently sold (while I was at ETH Denver, ironically) resulting in the laying off of all the current staff, myself included. I viewed this as the perfect opportunity to transition full-time into the crypto space, where my passion truly lies.</p>\n<p>How do you see your skills and experiences contributing to your Web3 journey?<br>\nI have become known in the crypto world for being the guy that’s everywhere and able to eye new, profitable opportunities that pop up throughout just about every major network/ecosystem while having a constant pulse on trending and fading narratives and overall user sentiment.   I have been in the crypto space on a personal level for around 3-4 years, degening my way through every dApp category across every major L1 &amp; L2 blockchain ecosystem. From DeFi protocols &amp; Derivatives/Perp Exchanges to NFTs and Lending Protocols, I have witnessed first hand how either strong or poor community management and marketing can impact user retention, growth, and engagement in either a positive or negative way based on their unique user base and what each “type” of user is receptive towards and/or in opposition against.</p>\n<p>I lead investment research for t*DAO and moderate several communities within the thesis ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Interests in Web3:</strong><br>\nWhat specific areas of Web3 are you most passionate about (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Gaming)?<br>\nI would have to say I am most passionate about DeFi products but am also bullish on the AI and DePIN narratives I have seen starting to emerge.</p>\n<p>Are there any projects or technologies in Web3 that you find particularly exciting or innovative?<br>\nBitcoin Layer 2 networks and the <a href=\"https://bitvm.org/bitvm.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bitVM whitepaper</a></p>\n<p><strong>Feature Recommendations:</strong><br>\nHave you or a friend ever experienced any pain points when using Polygon PoS? Or, do you have any exciting ideas for the chain you would like to voice?<br>\nAt times network congestion can be an issue, but overall Polygon is where most of my GameFi activity lives and am a fan. zkEVM could definitely use some improvements.</p>\n<p>If so, do you have any specific features/solutions you think would work well?<br>\nI think Polygon currently has the best suite of GameFi applications available.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Projects:</strong><br>\nAre you currently working on any Web3 projects? If so, please briefly overview what you’re working on.<br>\nCurrently contributing to Mezo Network, the Bitcoin Economic Layer as well as launching the t*DAO, a Bitcoin-focused DAO governed by the thesis community.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning and Development:</strong><br>\nWhat challenges have you faced in the Web3 space, and how have you overcome them?<br>\nTutorials for new programming languages / updates to current languages as they come up.</p>\n<p>Are there any resources or learning paths you’ve found invaluable in your Web3 education that you’d like to share?<br>\nThe best source of knowledge always lies within the various communities. So join, be active, forge relationships, and learn from those with more experience than you.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong><br>\nHow do you envision contributing to the Polygon Labs community?<br>\nHowever possible.</p>\n<p>Are you looking forward to participating in any discussions, events, or initiatives?<br>\nAlways open to things of this nature</p>\n<p><strong>Future Aspirations:</strong><br>\nWhat are your long-term goals within Web3 and blockchain technology?<br>\nI am looking to take my skills acquired from my web2 professional career and combine them with my web3 knowledge to transition my career into web3 full time, specifically in the areas of either Business Development, Marketing, Strategy, Research, and/or Partnerships.</p>\n<p>How do you see the future of blockchain evolving, and what role do you hope to play in it?<br>\nI see blockchain technology as the key to unlocking financial freedom and individual data protection/privacy on a global scale by putting financial and data ownership back into the hands of the consumer. I plan to contribute through the knowledge and unique set of skills I have currently and continue to expand upon them while spreading the knowledge to as many people as I can to help the collective space push forward towards mass adoption.</p>\n<p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong><br>\nShare a fun fact about yourself or your hobbies outside of Web3.<br>\nIs there anything else you’d like the community to know about you?<br>\nSpent my early years in Los Angeles as a child actor.

Note that this is different from state pruning, which prunes unused/inactive state from the db. The aim is to remove historical block data (headers, body, and receipts) from the freezer database as they are no longer used for chain verification. This also means that your node will no longer be able to serve RPC queries for those blocks (RPC operators shouldn’t ideally use this).</p>\n<p>It is available as a sub-command <code>bor snapshot prune-block [options...]</code> and the number of blocks to keep (post pruning) is configurable via <code>block-amount-reserved</code> flag. More details and usage info can be found in the PR itself (<a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/pull/1216\">https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/pull/1216</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Important points to note</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This version is backwards in-compatible if pruning is performed (at least once) on the node.</li>\n<li>This feature is only enabled in <code>hash</code> based

href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#abstract-4\"></a>Abstract</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-4-validator-performance-management/9956\">PIP-4</a> Part C, outlines the path of Validator Admissions into the network. This proposal outlines an admissions framework that includes a set of objective parameters to determine a prospective validator’s eligibility to validate the PoS network.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>A healthy network requires healthy validators/operators. The aim of a validator admission process is to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>ensure a competent set of validators on PoS with greater transparency and community input on validator admissions, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ensure network security, reliability and uptime.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having a quantitative, objective process in place will ensure that those who are becoming part of the network are experienced and able to participate at a high rate of adherence to on-chain operations.</p>\n<p>A large, mature and widely used network like the PoS chain, requires quality validators who uphold reliability and performance to meet the demands of the industry in which they operate.</p>\n<p>The proposed admissions process assists in providing the network with a framework to evaluate potential validators who request to join the PoS network. This process scores and ranks applicants based on the evaluation criteria described in the specification.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-6\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>In accordance with PIP-4, a scoring system that will rank validator applicants is proposed, allowing only the highest-scoring candidates to be selected for onboarding to the network.</p>\n<p>To define the scoring system, identified below are characteristics of validators that correlate with high performance; utilizing a number of heuristics based on the correlation matrix.</p>\n<p>The scoring is composed of the three following factors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>MATIC stake to provide enhanced network security.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Experience</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Number of years operating a validating node on a PoS network.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Expertise</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Validator operators score on an assessment test.</p>\n<p>The correlation matrix below shows a moderately positive correlation between PoS validator experience and performance. In other words, validators with more experience tend to perform better.</p>\n<p>Based on these findings, adjustments were made to the scoring logic used to evaluate the prospective validators. These adjustments ensured a fair and accurate performance assessment, considering their experience and expertise.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that while experience was found to have a high correlation with performance, stake and expertise also played significant roles in determining a validator’s effectiveness. Therefore, a holistic approach was taken to consider multiple factors in the scoring logic adjustments.</p>\n<p>Using the insights gained from this survey, the evaluation process was improved, and informed decisions regarding the validators’ contributions and rewards can continue to be made.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b3113b6d00331fbbd15cf84293c4a1721fc7f186.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/b3113b6d00331fbbd15cf84293c4a1721fc7f186\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b3113b6d00331fbbd15cf84293c4a1721fc7f186.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"py6nZb12XjXp15qJmUwKxcsqQoS\" width=\"624\" height=\"221\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"2C2148\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to quantify the relationship between performance and experience for Polygon PoS’s current validators, which measures the linear association between two variables. It has a value between -1 and 1 where:</p>\n<p>-1 indicates a perfectly negative linear correlation between two variables</p>\n<p>0 indicates no linear correlation between the two variables</p>\n<p>1 indicates a perfectly positive linear correlation between two variables</p>\n<p>The further away the correlation coefficient is from zero, the stronger the relationship between the two variables.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"results-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#results-7\"></a>Results:</h4>\n<p>Thus far, 12 entities have been recently onboarded to the network through the new admissions process, with zero breakages or bugs in the test phase.</p>\n<p>To illustrate the effectiveness of this process, below is data referring to the amount of times these validators fell into Grace Period 1 in their first 2100 checkpoints after joining the network.</p>\n<p>*<em>The <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-04.md\">PIP4 performance management process</a> outlines that if a validator falls below a 95% performance in signing checkpoints, they move into Grace Period 1. This Grace Period is a 700 checkpoint window in which they have to regain 95% adherence. If they once again fail to meet the 95% adherence requirement, they fall into Grace Period 2, another 700 checkpoint period. If they then again fail to meet this 95% requirement they then receive Final Notice and are removed from the network.</em></p>\n<p>Regaining adherence moves them straight back into healthy status.</p>\n<p>The following table shows the validators who were recently onboarded through this Admissions Process and the corresponding times they fell into Grace Period 1 in their first 2100 checkpoints in the network. Only 3 of these 12 validators have entered the grace period, reflecting a healthy admission process.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Validator ID</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"># of times in GP1</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Currently in active set</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">170</td>\n<td>Sensei Node</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">156</td>\n<td>Nexon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">163</td>\n<td>Upbit</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">161</td>\n<td>Northstake</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">152</td>\n<td>Zee Prime</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">162</td>\n<td>P2P Network</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">164</td>\n<td>Validatrium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">165</td>\n<td>Simply Staking</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">159</td>\n<td>Mantra DAO</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">160</td>\n<td>NEOPIN</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">167</td>\n<td>Ryabina</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Notes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/update-pos-validator-admissions/12344\">1.

This proof of consensus would be in addition to the pessimistic proof, which ensures the safety of all chains connected to the AggLayer. For more on the pessimistic proof, see here: <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-pessimistic-proof-for-the-agglayer-zk-security-for-cross-chain-interoperability\">Introducing the Pessimistic Proof</a></p>\n<p>The proof of consensus would be secured by the Plonky3 proving system via Succinct Labs’ SP1, a general purpose zkVM that allows the AggLayer to prove the execution of standard Rust. For more on the collaboration between Polygon Labs and Succinct Labs, see here: <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/blog/succincts-sp1-built-with-polygon-plonky3-will-help-enable-performant-cross-chain-interoperability-for-the-agglayer\">Built on Plonky3, SP1 Will Help Secure Unified Liquidity</a></p>\n<p>This upgrade would introduce two major direct benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Greater network effects for users and devs, resulting from aggregating liquidity, users, and state via the AggLayer</li>\n<li>An upgraded bridge experience, including permissionless token transfers</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#background-2\"></a>Background</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187\">A year ago</a>, the community began discussing a proposal that would see Polygon PoS become a zkEVM Validium, thereby upgrading the network to a ZK-powered Layer 2 (L2). This remains the long term goal for the endstate of Polygon PoS. The challenge of achieving this is largely a function of the commitment to preserve Polygon PoS’ low-fees, Ethereum-for-all ethos.</p>\n<p>The Type 1 zkEVM prover that would be used to upgrade Polygon PoS to a ZK L2 is already able to prove existing Ethereum blocks at low-cost. For the application of Polygon PoS, it’s now a question of doing so at scale.</p>\n<p>For the time being, if this discussion is favorable and the subsequent PIP is accepted by the community, the upgrade would act as an intermediate step to becoming a full ZK L2. Connecting Polygon PoS to the AggLayer would provide the benefits of the Unified Bridge, while still being able to rely on the hardened security guarantees that the validator set provides.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"technical-details-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#technical-details-3\"></a>Technical Details</h1>\n<p>If community discussion aligns around this proposal, a future PIP or PIPs would provide the proper technical specification. However, at a high level, this upgrade would require at least the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proof of consensus: A new consensus verification contract would be deployed on Ethereum. This contract would be able to verify that Polygon PoS reached consensus, and, in parallel, that any withdrawals meet the criteria imposed by the logic of the pessimistic proof. A proposal would be created to add this to the <a href=\"https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/architecture/protocol/lxly-bridge/\">Unified Bridge</a> list of available verification contracts. (For additional considerations on this point, see Practical Concerns below.)</li>\n<li>Bridge implementation: The Unified Bridge contracts would be deployed on Polygon PoS.</li>\n<li>PoS Portal: The existing tokens in the PoS Portal Bridge would be upgraded to use the Unified Bridge and ownership would be burned, thereby removing multisig control over these tokens.</li>\n<li>Network role: Settling to the AggLayer using a proof of consensus design would require some entity to submit the required information. (For additional considerations on this point, see Practical Concerns below.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"changes-to-the-client-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#changes-to-the-client-4\"></a>Changes to the Client</h3>\n<p>Completing this upgrade would not require any significant client changes to Bor or Heimdall. While a future optimization may be possible with an upgrade to Heimdall v2, this is not required for initial deployment.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"changes-to-the-bridge-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#changes-to-the-bridge-5\"></a>Changes to the Bridge</h3>\n<p>Completing this upgrade would not require changes to the StateSync mechanism that powers FxPortal or the Plasma Bridge. Additionally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Unified Bridge would be deployed as a stand alone new bridge.</li>\n<li>Tokens mapped using PoS Portal would be upgraded to use the Unified Bridge instead of FxPortal, and PoS Portal would be deprecated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#timeline-6\"></a>Timeline</h1>\n<p>If this discussion is favorable, a formal PIP will follow. The primary dependency is completion of a production-ready implementation of the pessimistic proof, expected in mid-Summer. Once this is complete, the formal PIP would follow, most likely in the Fall. On this timeline, assuming community acceptance, connecting Polygon PoS to the AggLayer could occur before the end of 2024.</p>\n<p>Parallel to these efforts, the core engineers for Polygon PoS are expecting the forthcoming Ahmadabad hardfork to be deployed in July, with the rollout of Heimdall v2 expected sometime after. Currently, neither of these upgrades are dependencies for connecting Polygon PoS to the AggLayer. However, there is an alternative implementation of the proof of consensus that would require deeper changes to Heimdall.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"practical-concerns-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#practical-concerns-7\"></a>Practical Concerns</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"signature-based-proof-of-consensus-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#signature-based-proof-of-consensus-8\"></a>Signature-based Proof of Consensus</h3>\n<p>This proposal outlines using Polygon Plonky3 to represent the consensus of Polygon PoS, with the SP1 zkVM providing the maintainability and developer velocity advantages of Rust. Broadly, the goal of the proof of consensus is to represent the local chain state. This could also be accomplished by modifying Heimdall to use a different signature method.</p>\n<p>For instance, if a BLS or ICE-FROST threshold signature was used during consensus, that single signature could represent consensus to the AggLayer. One benefit of this approach is simplicity: communication between Polygon PoS and the AggLayer could be added as a task to Heimdall in the same process which currently submits checkpoints to the L1.</p>\n<p>One potential drawback is that this approach would require deeper changes to the network’s consensus mechanism, which may extend the development time. This design would obviate the need for a new network role.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"network-role-of-communicating-with-agglayer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#network-role-of-communicating-with-agglayer-9\"></a>Network Role of Communicating with AggLayer</h3>\n<p>For Polygon PoS to connect to the AggLayer using a proof of consensus, a new role would be needed. This role would be responsible for submitting the following information to the AggLayer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The network’s local bridge state</li>\n<li>The proof of consensus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How and by whom this function is performed is an area of active investigation. At a high-level, protocol researchers are considering one of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An allowlisted address performs this role at first, with the goal of making it permissionless once the AggLayer stack has had a chance to harden</li>\n<li>The role is permissionless immediately, in which case a network participant would perform this function in exchange for some as-yet unquantifiable reward. Should this be the preferred option and there are no additional security concerns, it would require determining by what mechanism this network participant is selected; one potential option would be using the existing leadership selection that occurs in Heimdall.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>With 400M+ unique addresses, $2B+ assets bridged from Ethereum, and tens of thousands of apps, Polygon PoS remains one of the most used blockchains in the world. Users and developers prefer it because of its strong community, network effects, and Ethereum-for-all low fees, oftentimes orders of magnitude lower than prominent Ethereum L2s.</p>\n<p>Core developers at Polygon Labs have spent years focused on research in and development of Ethereum scaling technology; it started with Polygon PoS. The years since have led to two conclusions: ZK technology is the only practical way to achieve verifiable off chain computation, and aggregation is the only way to achieve multichain interoperability without sacrificing chain sovereignty.</p>\n<p>The joint effort of Succinct Labs and Polygon Labs is based on the shared belief that collaboration with open source technology builds the best possible public good. The outcome of this discussion on the future of Polygon PoS is, ultimately, in the hands of the community.

By increasing the number of validators, validation responsibilities are distributed more widely, which reduces the risk of centralization and strengthens the network’s security and resilience. This proposal outlines the considerations for expanding the number of validator slots to ensure robust network performance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The primary motivation for increasing the number of validator slots within the Polygon PoS network is to improve decentralization which can be observed via the following metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Geographical Distribution of Nodes</strong>: Expanding the number of validator slots allows for a wider geographical distribution of nodes. By having validators in diverse locations globally, the risk of localized disruptions is reduced, and the network’s health is enhanced to prevent regional failures.</li>\n<li><strong>Decrease Stake Centralisation</strong>: More validator slots means that voting power and block production can be more evenly distributed across a larger number of validators.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve Nakamoto Coefficient</strong>: The Nakamoto Coefficient, which measures the minimum number of validators required to compromise a network, should improve with an increase in validator nodes. A higher coefficient indicates a more secure and decentralized network, as it becomes harder for any group to disrupt the network’s consensus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>The proposed expansion involves a phased increase in the number of validator slots, starting from the current 105 slots to 110, then to 115, further to 120 and finally to 125. This incremental approach, with ongoing community review and feedback, allows for careful monitoring and management of each expansion stage. The specific steps include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Assessing the current infrastructure and ensuring it can support the additional validators.</li>\n<li>Implementing the first phase by adding 5 validator slots and monitoring the network’s performance and stability.</li>\n<li>Gradually increasing the slots in subsequent phases (as noted above) based on performance metrics and network impact.</li>\n<li>Conducting thorough monitoring at each stage to ensure seamless integration and functionality.</li>\n<li>In the event that the expansion from 105 to 110 validators negatively impacts the network’s health, the community may consider taking corrective action to offboard the last 5 validators who were onboarded.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-7\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>Increasing the number of validator slots in phases offers several advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It helps the network grow gradually, lowering the risks that come with adding many new validators all at once.</li>\n<li>Each phase can be evaluated for performance, ensuring that any issues are identified and addressed promptly.</li>\n<li>It ensures that the network infrastructure and support mechanisms are adequately scaled to handle the increased load, thereby maintaining overall network health and performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"backwards-compatibility-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#backwards-compatibility-8\"></a>Backwards Compatibility</h3>\n<p>The expansion of validator slots is designed to be fully backwards compatible. Existing validators and network operations should not be affected by the increase in slots. The system architecture should ensure that the integration of new validators occurs smoothly, without disrupting ongoing operations or diminishing the performance of current validators.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"test-cases-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#test-cases-9\"></a>Test Cases</h3>\n<p>To ensure the success of the validator slot expansion, the following test cases will be conducted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Performance Testing</em>: Evaluate the network’s ability to handle the increased number of validators, focusing on transaction processing times, block generation, and overall output.</li>\n<li><em>Stability Testing</em>: Monitor the network for any signs of instability or degradation in performance following the addition of new validators.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"security-considerations-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#security-considerations-10\"></a>Security Considerations</h3>\n<p>Security remains a top priority during the expansion process. Security measures will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to any abnormal activity.</li>\n<li>Suggested implementation of best practices for validator operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"copyright-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#copyright-11\"></a>Copyright</h3>\n<p>All copyrights and related rights in this work are waived under CC0 1.0 Universal.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-38-phased-expansion-of-validator-slots-on-polygon-pos/14200\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-38-phased-expansion-of-validator-slots-on-polygon-pos/14200","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Jun 2024 14:37:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-14200"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-38-phased-expansion-of-validator-slots-on-polygon-pos/14200.rss","#text":"PIP 38 - Phased expansion of Validator Slots on Polygon PoS"},"filter":false},{"title":"Polygon Staking Report.

Under specific conditions being met, the bug could have potentially allowed a malicious validator to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Heimdall network, causing the PoS network to halt.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"root-cause-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#root-cause-2\"></a><strong>Root Cause</strong></h2>\n<p>In the milestones workflow, when a validator proposes a milestone, a stream of bytes is generated, and then signed by all the validators. Given that the structure of this bytes stream is very similar to the one that gets created for the checkpoints, a single malicious validator could manipulate the data, get the signatures from all validators, and then submit it as a valid checkpoint to the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract on Ethereum. Specifically, we refer to the <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> struct in <strong><code>heimdall/checkpoint/types/msg_milestone.go</code>,</strong> where the <strong><code>GetSignSideBytes()</code></strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/blob/ae5a160feaf278b0127c3e2b45bb1338b1de9d7a/checkpoint/types/msg_milestone.go#L86-L98\">function</a> returns the side sign bytes that validators are supposed to sign during the voting process of a side block.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"go\"><code class=\"lang-go\">func (msg MsgMilestone) GetSideSignBytes() []byte {\n    // keccak256(abi.encoded(proposer, startBlock, endBlock, rootHash, accountRootHash, bor chain id))\n    borChainID, _ := strconv.ParseUint(msg.BorChainID, 10, 64)\n\n    return appendBytes32(\n            msg.Proposer.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.StartBlock).Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.EndBlock).Bytes(),\n            msg.Hash.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(borChainID).Bytes(),\n            []byte(msg.MilestoneID),\n    )\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Similarly, the <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong> is what gets eventually committed by the proposer to the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract. The <strong><code>GetSideSignBytes()</code></strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/blob/ae5a160feaf278b0127c3e2b45bb1338b1de9d7a/checkpoint/types/msg.go#L163-L175\">function</a> for this message looks like the following.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"go\"><code class=\"lang-go\">func (msg MsgCheckpoint) GetSideSignBytes() []byte {\n    // keccak256(abi.encoded(proposer, startBlock, endBlock, rootHash, accountRootHash, bor chain id))\n    borChainID, _ := strconv.ParseUint(msg.BorChainID, 10, 64)\n\n    return appendBytes32(\n            msg.Proposer.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.StartBlock).Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.EndBlock).Bytes(),\n            msg.RootHash.Bytes(),\n            msg.AccountRootHash.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(borChainID).Bytes(),\n    )\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>By looking at the <strong><code>submitCheckpoint()</code></strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/eef53596046eda70a53653a8e5ff79b1cbf0a4f9/contracts/root/RootChain.sol#L27-L53\">function</a> in <strong><code>contracts/root/RootChain.sol</code></strong> , we can see that the ABI decoding accepts as parameter the side sign bytes of the <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong>.</p>\n<p>The bug here is that both <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> and <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong> are signed by the same validators to reach consensus, hence a signed <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> can be used in place of a <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong>.</p>\n<p>In the case of the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract, a <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> could be submitted and this would be interpreted as a valid checkpoint because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The malicious validator could make sure that <code>proposer</code>, <code>startBlock</code> and <code>endBlock</code> align</li>\n<li>The milestone <code>hash</code> would be committed in place of a checkpoint <code>rootHash</code></li>\n<li>The <code>borChainID</code> would be interpreted as the <code>AccountRootHash</code></li>\n<li>The <code>MilestoneID</code> would have to be equal to the <code>borChainID</code> in bytes, which can happen since the <code>MilestoneID</code> can be arbitrarily chosen by the validator each time</li>\n</ul>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">function submitCheckpoint(bytes calldata data, uint[3][] calldata sigs) external {\n    (address proposer, uint256 start, uint256 end, bytes32 rootHash, bytes32 accountHash, uint256 _borChainID) = abi\n        .decode(data, (address, uint256, uint256, bytes32, bytes32, uint256));\n    require(CHAINID == _borChainID, \"Invalid bor chain id\");\n\n    require(_buildHeaderBlock(proposer, start, end, rootHash), \"INCORRECT_HEADER_DATA\");\n\n    // check if it is better to keep it in local storage instead\n    IStakeManager stakeManager = IStakeManager(registry.getStakeManagerAddress());\n    uint256 _reward = stakeManager.checkSignatures(\n        end.sub(start).add(1),\n        /**\n            prefix 01 to data\n            01 represents positive vote on data and 00 is negative vote\n            malicious validator can try to send 2/3 on negative vote so 01 is appended\n            */\n        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytes(hex\"01\"), data)),\n        accountHash,\n        proposer,\n        sigs\n    );\n\n    require(_reward != 0, \"Invalid checkpoint\");\n    emit NewHeaderBlock(proposer, _nextHeaderBlock, _reward, start, end, rootHash);\n    _nextHeaderBlock = _nextHeaderBlock.add(MAX_DEPOSITS);\n    _blockDepositId = 1;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>With these premises, if a malicious validator is able to modify the data in a way that matches the previous points, it can submit a valid signed milestone instead of a checkpoint on the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract on Ethereum. This would lead to chain failure of Polygon PoS.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"resolution-and-recovery-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#resolution-and-recovery-3\"></a><strong>Resolution and Recovery</strong></h2>\n<p>A patch was successfully released on May 23rd 2024, with Heimdall tag <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v1.0.6\">v1.0.6</a>.</p>\n<p>It consists of <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/pull/1163\">one main PR</a>, where the <strong><code>GetSideSignBytes</code></strong> function for milestones workflow has been modified to return <strong><code>nil</code></strong>. This is basically what happens for every kind of <strong><code>sideTx</code></strong> in Heimdall, exception made for checkpoints, which is the only case that requires the data to be broadcasted to all validators, signed, and then submitted to the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract, which has the ultimate task of checking the validity of the bytes stream, and reverting the execution in case the arguments do not match with the expected ones.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to increase the security around milestones submission, the <strong><code>ValidateMilestone</code></strong> function - which is invoked by the milestones side handler at time of voting on correct data - has been enriched with an additional check. Since the <strong><code>milestoneID</code></strong> is of format <strong><code>UUID - HexAddress</code></strong>, the validation now ensures that the first part of such string is a valid UUID and the second part is a valid hex-based address. The implemented behaviour has been covered with unit tests.</p>\n<p>The patch was first tested on a devnet, then tested and rolled out on Amoy and Mainnet nodes simultaneously . A release announcement was shared, allowing all the validators to upgrade.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix-for-milestones-checkpoints/14093\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix-for-milestones-checkpoints/14093","pubDate":"Sat, 25 May 2024 15:08:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-14093"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix-for-milestones-checkpoints/14093.rss","#text":"Heimdall security bug fix for milestones/checkpoints"},"filter":true},{"title":"Heimdall v1.0.6 Mainnet Release for Validator Nodes","dc:creator":"0xsajal","category":"Announcements","description":"<p>Dear Validators,</p>\n<p>A new Heimdall version <code>v1.0.6</code> has been released, which includes a patch for a bug in the milestones/checkpoints module.

The main focus was on PIP 22, PIP 36, PIP 30, and increasing the minimum gas price.</p>\n<p>With the inclusion list finalized, Polygon will target shipping these changes at the end of May or early June depending on testnet deployment timelines. The next PPGC meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 30 but may shift a week or two to align with the rollout.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 22 (EIP 3074)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/manav24_\">Manav Darji</a> from the Bor client team provided an update on their progress in implementing EIP 3074 style account abstraction. The Bor team has a PR open that implements the AUTH and AUTH_CALL opcodes. Over the past two weeks, they have been adding more tests and accommodating changes to match the latest spec of EIP 3074. Bor is currently testing their implementation internally on a devnet. There are patches for Solidity and Foundry available to test these new opcodes. The next step is to do as much adversarial testing as possible before deploying to Polygon’s testnet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Harry__Rook\">Harry Rook</a>, Polygon Governance PM, noted recent <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-5003-auth-usurp-publishing-code-at-an-eoa-address/8979\">discussions</a> about potentially including EIP 5003 in the fork after Pectra on Ethereum to mitigate some concerns with EIP 3074. This will likely be a topic in the next PPGC meeting.</p>\n<p>Note: EIP 3074 introduces AUTH (sets a context variable authorized based on an ECDSA signature) and AUTHCALL (sends a call as the authorized account). Through EIP 3074, control of the externally owned account (EOA) is delegated to a smart contract.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 36 (Replay Failed State Syncs)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/imderl\">Dhairya Sethi</a>, the author of PIP 36, explained that the purpose is to add the ability to replay failed state syncs until the full migration to the LXLY bridge is complete. It also patches a bug in the Matic token contract related to the gas cost increase of SLOAD in Ethereum’s Berlin hard fork which broke contracts using TRANSFER to send ETH to contracts with code in the RECEIVE or FALLBACK functions.</p>\n<p>PIP 36 aims to fix failed state syncs in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Replace TRANSFER with CALL in the Matic token contract to provide sufficient gas and prevent failed deposits when the receiver is a contract with code. This requires a hard fork since the contract is not upgradeable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the ability to replay failed state syncs, both past and future. For past failed state syncs between the Shanghai fork and, a Merkle tree will be constructed of the failed state IDs so users can prove and replay their failed state sync. For future failed state syncs, the contract will store the receiver and calldata so it can be replayed externally. Security considerations are taken to prevent reentrancy and ensure immutability of the replayed transaction.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The failed state syncs that occurred from block 38,457,210 (around Nov 30, 2023) up to the fork will be replayable.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 30 (Increase Max Code Size Limit)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidesilverman\">David Silverman</a> explained PIP 30 which proposes increasing the max code size and max initcode size by 33% to allow deploying more complex contracts. The current limits were set arbitrarily in the Spurious Dragon hard fork and developers are now frequently hitting these limits. Analysis shows this increase would not negatively impact the ZK migration plans. The intent is to slowly raise this limit, potentially moving to even higher values later in conjunction with the rollup coordination group.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Gas Price Increase</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcell033\">Marcelo Ardizzone</a> presented a new PIP to increase the default minimum gas price to 30 gwei to reduce spam transactions. Currently this is just a node client setting, not a network level parameter. Having different minimum gas prices across validators leads to transactions getting stuck if they are priced for a validator with a lower minimum.</p>\n<p>The PIP enforces the 30 gwei minimum at the network level in three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the default minimum gas price for validators to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the default gas price limit for accepting txs into the transaction pool to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the threshold below which the gas price oracle ignores transactions to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is implemented via code changes in the Bor and Erigon clients. Validators can still set custom gas parameters if desired by modifying the client code and running a custom version.</p>\n<p>With no major concerns expressed, developers seemed ready to move forward with this inclusion list for the upgrade. The Bor and Erigon teams confirmed they are okay with the proposed changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Coordination with Ethereum</strong></p>\n<p>When asked about coordination with Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade that also plans to include EIP 3074, David Silverman said the intention is for Polygon to move ahead of Ethereum on this as they have done with previous upgrades like EIP 7212. Protocol developers are working closely with rollup teams who are also implementing 3074 to maintain compatibility. The hope is that Ethereum does not intentionally try to break this compatibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>With the inclusion list finalized, protocol developers will target shipping these changes at the end of May or early June depending on testnet deployment timelines. The next PPGC meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 30 but may shift a week or two to align with the rollout.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-protocol-governance-call-ppgc-19/13946\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-protocol-governance-call-ppgc-19/13946","pubDate":"Tue, 07 May 2024 21:07:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13946"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-protocol-governance-call-ppgc-19/13946.rss","#text":"Polygon Protocol Governance Call (PPGC) #19"},"filter":false},{"title":"Scheduled zkEVM Mainnet beta Update","dc:creator":"obinna","category":"Announcements","description":"<p><strong>Scheduled zkEVM Mainnet beta Update</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Date</strong></em>: Thursday, 9th, May 2024<br>\n<em><strong>Time</strong></em>: 12:00 PM CET /10:00 AM UTC<br>\n<em><strong>Duration</strong></em>: ~ 15 minutes</p>\n<p>There would be a scheduled zkEVM mainnet beta update, this update includes enhancements to the Sequencer.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Details</strong><br>\n<em>Node version</em> : <a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node/releases/tag/v0.6.7\">v0.6.7</a><br>\n<em>Prover/executor version</em>: <a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-prover/releases/tag/v6.0.2\">v6.0.2</a></p>\n<p><strong>Scheduled Downtime Alert</strong><br>\nThe network will experience a brief downtime during this update</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/scheduled-zkevm-mainnet-beta-update/13944\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/scheduled-zkevm-mainnet-beta-update/13944","pubDate":"Tue, 07 May 2024 15:23:08 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13944"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/scheduled-zkevm-mainnet-beta-update/13944.rss","#text":"Scheduled zkEVM Mainnet beta Update"},"filter":true}]}}}
