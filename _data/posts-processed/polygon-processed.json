Under specific conditions being met, the bug could have potentially allowed a malicious validator to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Heimdall network, causing the PoS network to halt.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"root-cause-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#root-cause-2\"></a><strong>Root Cause</strong></h2>\n<p>In the milestones workflow, when a validator proposes a milestone, a stream of bytes is generated, and then signed by all the validators. Given that the structure of this bytes stream is very similar to the one that gets created for the checkpoints, a single malicious validator could manipulate the data, get the signatures from all validators, and then submit it as a valid checkpoint to the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract on Ethereum. Specifically, we refer to the <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> struct in <strong><code>heimdall/checkpoint/types/msg_milestone.go</code>,</strong> where the <strong><code>GetSignSideBytes()</code></strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/blob/ae5a160feaf278b0127c3e2b45bb1338b1de9d7a/checkpoint/types/msg_milestone.go#L86-L98\">function</a> returns the side sign bytes that validators are supposed to sign during the voting process of a side block.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"go\"><code class=\"lang-go\">func (msg MsgMilestone) GetSideSignBytes() []byte {\n    // keccak256(abi.encoded(proposer, startBlock, endBlock, rootHash, accountRootHash, bor chain id))\n    borChainID, _ := strconv.ParseUint(msg.BorChainID, 10, 64)\n\n    return appendBytes32(\n            msg.Proposer.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.StartBlock).Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.EndBlock).Bytes(),\n            msg.Hash.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(borChainID).Bytes(),\n            []byte(msg.MilestoneID),\n    )\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Similarly, the <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong> is what gets eventually committed by the proposer to the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract. The <strong><code>GetSideSignBytes()</code></strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/blob/ae5a160feaf278b0127c3e2b45bb1338b1de9d7a/checkpoint/types/msg.go#L163-L175\">function</a> for this message looks like the following.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"go\"><code class=\"lang-go\">func (msg MsgCheckpoint) GetSideSignBytes() []byte {\n    // keccak256(abi.encoded(proposer, startBlock, endBlock, rootHash, accountRootHash, bor chain id))\n    borChainID, _ := strconv.ParseUint(msg.BorChainID, 10, 64)\n\n    return appendBytes32(\n            msg.Proposer.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.StartBlock).Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(msg.EndBlock).Bytes(),\n            msg.RootHash.Bytes(),\n            msg.AccountRootHash.Bytes(),\n            new(big.Int).SetUint64(borChainID).Bytes(),\n    )\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>By looking at the <strong><code>submitCheckpoint()</code></strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/eef53596046eda70a53653a8e5ff79b1cbf0a4f9/contracts/root/RootChain.sol#L27-L53\">function</a> in <strong><code>contracts/root/RootChain.sol</code></strong> , we can see that the ABI decoding accepts as parameter the side sign bytes of the <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong>.</p>\n<p>The bug here is that both <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> and <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong> are signed by the same validators to reach consensus, hence a signed <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> can be used in place of a <strong><code>MsgCheckpoint</code></strong>.</p>\n<p>In the case of the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract, a <strong><code>MsgMilestone</code></strong> could be submitted and this would be interpreted as a valid checkpoint because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The malicious validator could make sure that <code>proposer</code>, <code>startBlock</code> and <code>endBlock</code> align</li>\n<li>The milestone <code>hash</code> would be committed in place of a checkpoint <code>rootHash</code></li>\n<li>The <code>borChainID</code> would be interpreted as the <code>AccountRootHash</code></li>\n<li>The <code>MilestoneID</code> would have to be equal to the <code>borChainID</code> in bytes, which can happen since the <code>MilestoneID</code> can be arbitrarily chosen by the validator each time</li>\n</ul>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">function submitCheckpoint(bytes calldata data, uint[3][] calldata sigs) external {\n    (address proposer, uint256 start, uint256 end, bytes32 rootHash, bytes32 accountHash, uint256 _borChainID) = abi\n        .decode(data, (address, uint256, uint256, bytes32, bytes32, uint256));\n    require(CHAINID == _borChainID, \"Invalid bor chain id\");\n\n    require(_buildHeaderBlock(proposer, start, end, rootHash), \"INCORRECT_HEADER_DATA\");\n\n    // check if it is better to keep it in local storage instead\n    IStakeManager stakeManager = IStakeManager(registry.getStakeManagerAddress());\n    uint256 _reward = stakeManager.checkSignatures(\n        end.sub(start).add(1),\n        /**\n            prefix 01 to data\n            01 represents positive vote on data and 00 is negative vote\n            malicious validator can try to send 2/3 on negative vote so 01 is appended\n            */\n        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytes(hex\"01\"), data)),\n        accountHash,\n        proposer,\n        sigs\n    );\n\n    require(_reward != 0, \"Invalid checkpoint\");\n    emit NewHeaderBlock(proposer, _nextHeaderBlock, _reward, start, end, rootHash);\n    _nextHeaderBlock = _nextHeaderBlock.add(MAX_DEPOSITS);\n    _blockDepositId = 1;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>With these premises, if a malicious validator is able to modify the data in a way that matches the previous points, it can submit a valid signed milestone instead of a checkpoint on the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract on Ethereum. This would lead to chain failure of Polygon PoS.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"resolution-and-recovery-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#resolution-and-recovery-3\"></a><strong>Resolution and Recovery</strong></h2>\n<p>A patch was successfully released on May 23rd 2024, with Heimdall tag <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v1.0.6\">v1.0.6</a>.</p>\n<p>It consists of <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/pull/1163\">one main PR</a>, where the <strong><code>GetSideSignBytes</code></strong> function for milestones workflow has been modified to return <strong><code>nil</code></strong>. This is basically what happens for every kind of <strong><code>sideTx</code></strong> in Heimdall, exception made for checkpoints, which is the only case that requires the data to be broadcasted to all validators, signed, and then submitted to the <strong><code>RootChain</code></strong> contract, which has the ultimate task of checking the validity of the bytes stream, and reverting the execution in case the arguments do not match with the expected ones.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to increase the security around milestones submission, the <strong><code>ValidateMilestone</code></strong> function - which is invoked by the milestones side handler at time of voting on correct data - has been enriched with an additional check. Since the <strong><code>milestoneID</code></strong> is of format <strong><code>UUID - HexAddress</code></strong>, the validation now ensures that the first part of such string is a valid UUID and the second part is a valid hex-based address. The implemented behaviour has been covered with unit tests.</p>\n<p>The patch was first tested on a devnet, then tested and rolled out on Amoy and Mainnet nodes simultaneously . A release announcement was shared, allowing all the validators to upgrade.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix-for-milestones-checkpoints/14093\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix-for-milestones-checkpoints/14093","pubDate":"Sat, 25 May 2024 15:08:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-14093"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix-for-milestones-checkpoints/14093.rss","#text":"Heimdall security bug fix for milestones/checkpoints"},"filter":true},{"title":"Heimdall v1.0.6 Mainnet Release for Validator Nodes","dc:creator":"0xsajal","category":"Announcements","description":"<p>Dear Validators,</p>\n<p>A new Heimdall version <code>v1.0.6</code> has been released, which includes a patch for a bug in the milestones/checkpoints module.

The main focus was on PIP 22, PIP 36, PIP 30, and increasing the minimum gas price.</p>\n<p>With the inclusion list finalized, Polygon will target shipping these changes at the end of May or early June depending on testnet deployment timelines. The next PPGC meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 30 but may shift a week or two to align with the rollout.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 22 (EIP 3074)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/manav24_\">Manav Darji</a> from the Bor client team provided an update on their progress in implementing EIP 3074 style account abstraction. The Bor team has a PR open that implements the AUTH and AUTH_CALL opcodes. Over the past two weeks, they have been adding more tests and accommodating changes to match the latest spec of EIP 3074. Bor is currently testing their implementation internally on a devnet. There are patches for Solidity and Foundry available to test these new opcodes. The next step is to do as much adversarial testing as possible before deploying to Polygon’s testnet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Harry__Rook\">Harry Rook</a>, Polygon Governance PM, noted recent <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-5003-auth-usurp-publishing-code-at-an-eoa-address/8979\">discussions</a> about potentially including EIP 5003 in the fork after Pectra on Ethereum to mitigate some concerns with EIP 3074. This will likely be a topic in the next PPGC meeting.</p>\n<p>Note: EIP 3074 introduces AUTH (sets a context variable authorized based on an ECDSA signature) and AUTHCALL (sends a call as the authorized account). Through EIP 3074, control of the externally owned account (EOA) is delegated to a smart contract.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 36 (Replay Failed State Syncs)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/imderl\">Dhairya Sethi</a>, the author of PIP 36, explained that the purpose is to add the ability to replay failed state syncs until the full migration to the LXLY bridge is complete. It also patches a bug in the Matic token contract related to the gas cost increase of SLOAD in Ethereum’s Berlin hard fork which broke contracts using TRANSFER to send ETH to contracts with code in the RECEIVE or FALLBACK functions.</p>\n<p>PIP 36 aims to fix failed state syncs in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Replace TRANSFER with CALL in the Matic token contract to provide sufficient gas and prevent failed deposits when the receiver is a contract with code. This requires a hard fork since the contract is not upgradeable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the ability to replay failed state syncs, both past and future. For past failed state syncs between the Shanghai fork and, a Merkle tree will be constructed of the failed state IDs so users can prove and replay their failed state sync. For future failed state syncs, the contract will store the receiver and calldata so it can be replayed externally. Security considerations are taken to prevent reentrancy and ensure immutability of the replayed transaction.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The failed state syncs that occurred from block 38,457,210 (around Nov 30, 2023) up to the fork will be replayable.</p>\n<p><strong>PIP 30 (Increase Max Code Size Limit)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidesilverman\">David Silverman</a> explained PIP 30 which proposes increasing the max code size and max initcode size by 33% to allow deploying more complex contracts. The current limits were set arbitrarily in the Spurious Dragon hard fork and developers are now frequently hitting these limits. Analysis shows this increase would not negatively impact the ZK migration plans. The intent is to slowly raise this limit, potentially moving to even higher values later in conjunction with the rollup coordination group.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Gas Price Increase</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcell033\">Marcelo Ardizzone</a> presented a new PIP to increase the default minimum gas price to 30 gwei to reduce spam transactions. Currently this is just a node client setting, not a network level parameter. Having different minimum gas prices across validators leads to transactions getting stuck if they are priced for a validator with a lower minimum.</p>\n<p>The PIP enforces the 30 gwei minimum at the network level in three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the default minimum gas price for validators to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the default gas price limit for accepting txs into the transaction pool to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sets the threshold below which the gas price oracle ignores transactions to 30 gwei</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is implemented via code changes in the Bor and Erigon clients. Validators can still set custom gas parameters if desired by modifying the client code and running a custom version.</p>\n<p>With no major concerns expressed, developers seemed ready to move forward with this inclusion list for the upgrade. The Bor and Erigon teams confirmed they are okay with the proposed changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Coordination with Ethereum</strong></p>\n<p>When asked about coordination with Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade that also plans to include EIP 3074, David Silverman said the intention is for Polygon to move ahead of Ethereum on this as they have done with previous upgrades like EIP 7212. Protocol developers are working closely with rollup teams who are also implementing 3074 to maintain compatibility. The hope is that Ethereum does not intentionally try to break this compatibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>With the inclusion list finalized, protocol developers will target shipping these changes at the end of May or early June depending on testnet deployment timelines. The next PPGC meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 30 but may shift a week or two to align with the rollout.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-protocol-governance-call-ppgc-19/13946\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-protocol-governance-call-ppgc-19/13946","pubDate":"Tue, 07 May 2024 21:07:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13946"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-protocol-governance-call-ppgc-19/13946.rss","#text":"Polygon Protocol Governance Call (PPGC) #19"},"filter":false},{"title":"Scheduled zkEVM Mainnet beta Update","dc:creator":"obinna","category":"Announcements","description":"<p><strong>Scheduled zkEVM Mainnet beta Update</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Date</strong></em>: Thursday, 9th, May 2024<br>\n<em><strong>Time</strong></em>: 12:00 PM CET /10:00 AM UTC<br>\n<em><strong>Duration</strong></em>: ~ 15 minutes</p>\n<p>There would be a scheduled zkEVM mainnet beta update, this update includes enhancements to the Sequencer.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Details</strong><br>\n<em>Node version</em> : <a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node/releases/tag/v0.6.7\">v0.6.7</a><br>\n<em>Prover/executor version</em>: <a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-prover/releases/tag/v6.0.2\">v6.0.2</a></p>\n<p><strong>Scheduled Downtime Alert</strong><br>\nThe network will experience a brief downtime during this update</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/scheduled-zkevm-mainnet-beta-update/13944\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/scheduled-zkevm-mainnet-beta-update/13944","pubDate":"Tue, 07 May 2024 15:23:08 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13944"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/scheduled-zkevm-mainnet-beta-update/13944.rss","#text":"Scheduled zkEVM Mainnet beta Update"},"filter":true},{"title":"Polygon Staking Report.

To address this issue, we propose patching the bug &amp; introducing the ability to replay failed state syncs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-2\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLDR: Plasma MATIC deposits revert with out of gas when the receiver is a GnosisSafe contract because it uses <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/main/contracts/child/MRC20.sol#L44\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">transfer instead of call</a> when sending MATIC (native on child) and the fallback required more than 2300 gas (and more recently <a href=\"https://help.safe.global/en/articles/40813-why-can-t-i-transfer-eth-from-a-contract-into-a-safe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2600</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>MATIC deposits occur via the plasma bridge, wherein a user holding MATIC on L1 calls <strong><code>depositERC20()</code></strong> on the Plasma bridge <strong><code>DepositManager</code></strong>. This action emits a State Sync, which is picked up by validators and executed on L2. This state sync triggers the <strong><code>StateReceiver</code></strong> on L2, which, after the necessary validations, calls the <strong><code>deposit</code></strong> method on the childToken (MATIC(0x00…1010) in this instance).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">    function deposit(address user, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {\n\t... // perform necessary checks and log effects\n\n        // interaction: transfer amount to user\n        _user.transfer(amount); // &lt;-- the bug\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t...\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This contract utilizes the built-in Solidity transfer method, which limits the available transferred gas to 2300. Before the Berlin Hardfork, this amount was generally sufficient for most contracts. However, post-Berlin Hardfork, accessing a contract for the first time (which occurs when MATIC is moved to an account that is a contract) incurs gas costs of 2600, resulting in a failure with an <code>out of gas</code> revert.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Gas costs before Berlin hardfork</p>\n<p>Access account: 700 gas</p>\n<p>Read storage slot: 800 gas</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gas costs after Berlin hardfork</p>\n<p>Access account:</p>\n<p>First time per address in tx: 2600 gas</p>\n<p>Any additional time in tx: 100 gas</p>\n<p>Read storage slot:</p>\n<p>First time per storage slot in tx: 2100 gas</p>\n<p>Any additional time in tx: 100 gas</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This issue also exists in Ethereum, leading to the inclusion of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-2390.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-2930</a> alongside <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2929.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP-2929</a> to mitigate such occurrences. EIP-2930 introduces an access list, prepaying gas for any address or storage slot on the list, thus reducing runtime costs to 100 gas. This solution addresses the problem of insufficient gas availability when transferring ETH from one contract to another using default Solidity methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that this is a special case for the MATIC token only and not any other <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-20.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20</a> token as this token has the unique property of being a native token on L2.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>This PIP proposes to patch the transfer vs send bug mentioned above by updating the bytecode of MRC-20 MATIC token on L2 through a hardfork. We specify a <strong><code>txGasLimit</code></strong> while doing the call such that the receiver doesn’t consume all available gas in the state sync block limit to prevent DoS (state sync’s are batched together in one txn).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">      (bool success, ) = _user.call(value: amount, gas: txGasLimit);\n      require(success, \"!transfer\");\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Replay Failed State Syncs</strong></p>\n<p>Along with the above, this PIP proposes two more additions for the replayability of failed state syncs.</p>\n<p>The State Receiver currently emits <code>StateCommitted(uint stateId, bool success)</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">  function commitState(uint256 syncTime, bytes calldata recordBytes) external onlySystem returns(bool success) {\n    ...\n\n    if (isContract(receiver)) { // notify state receiver contract, in a non-revert manner\n      uint256 txGas = 5000000;\n      bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature(\"onStateReceive(uint256,bytes)\", stateId, stateData);\n      assembly {\n        success := call(txGas, receiver, 0, add(data, 0x20), mload(data), 0, 0)\n      }\n      emit StateCommitted(stateId, success);\n    }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>We propose the StateReceiver also stores the failed state syncs.</p>\n<p>mapping failedStateSyncs (uint stateId ⇒ bytes encodedData (abi.encode(receiver, data)).</p>\n<p>which can be re-executed once by anyone through an external method <code>replayFailedStateSync(uint stateId)</code></p>\n<p>This would delete the entry in failedStateSyncs mapping only on a successful call.</p>\n<p>This enabled users with failed state syncs to replay their transaction with</p>\n<ul>\n<li>higher gas, and</li>\n<li>at a different time (where the state has changed &amp; possibly the control flow if receiver succeeds).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Replay Failed State Syncs</strong></p>\n<p>The State Receiver currently emits <code>StateCommitted(uint stateId, bool success)</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLDR: make a merkle tree of previous failed state syncs, post immutable root on StateReceiver, such that anyone can prove their failed state sync and replay them on chain trustlessly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A merkle tree of previous failed state syncs from the Shanghai Hardfork (50563600) until the present (an ever-expanding list) is created.</p>\n<p>A package to fetch and filter historic events will be made public such that this tree can be built, and root cross-checked by anyone. This will be small merkle tree of depth 16, where the leaf’s will be the keccak(abi.encode(stateId, receiver, calldata)) [stateId provides sufficient collision resistance].</p>\n<p>An external method on StateReceiver will be exposed: <code>replayHistoricFailedStateSync(bytes32[16] calldata proof, uint256 leafIndex, uint256 stateId, address receiver, bytes calldata data) </code> which nullifies the leaf on successful state syncs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"observability-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#observability-4\"></a>Observability</h3>\n<p>The overall observability of the plasma bridge would increase with this update.<br>\nThe main improvement is that failed state syncs would be recorded.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"backward-compatibility-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#backward-compatibility-5\"></a>Backward Compatibility</h3>\n<p>As the contract impacted by this PIP is not upgradeable, the changes would require a hardfork.</p>\n<p>The L2 contracts being upgraded would be the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>StateReceiver: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001</li>\n<li>MRC-20(Matic Token): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"security-considerations-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#security-considerations-6\"></a>Security Considerations</h3>\n<p>Internal as well as external security reviews will have to be done to ensure maximum safety.

Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved decision making</strong> - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Retaining top performers</strong> - Some ideas and teams won’t produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher self awareness &amp; accountability</strong> - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowers individual contributors</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.</li>\n<li><strong>Removed intermediaries</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone’s compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible information usage</strong> - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source contribution data</strong> - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches.

Under highly specific – and very unlikely – conditions being met, the bug could have potentially allowed a malicious actor to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Heimdall network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"root-cause-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#root-cause-2\"></a>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>Heimdall needs to acquire specific public keys, which are contained in two messages (ValidatorJoin, SignerUpdate). These keys are crucial for the validator to sign PoS commitments and votes. The validity of these public keys is confirmed against the corresponding Ethereum log in the StakeInfo contract. This process is meant to ensure that the public key aligns with the one selected by the validator.</p>\n<p>However, a complication arises due to an implementation nuance in the secp256k1 library utilized in Heimdall/Peppermint. Public keys must include an additional prefix byte, making them a total of 65 bytes long. Unfortunately, Heimdall does not verify the first byte of the public key in any message. This contrasts with the secp256k1 signature validation, which requires the prefix to be 0x04, 0x06, or 0x07; otherwise, validation fails.</p>\n<p>The sole validation performed on the public key bytes is to ensure that the slice pubkey[1:] matches the 64-byte public key from the Ethereum log. The initial byte provided in the message is merely copied and stored without validation. Additionally, attempting to verify the address generated by hashing the public key proves futile, as the address is derived from the truncated hash of the 64-byte public key, once again disregarding the prefix byte.</p>\n<p>As a result of this lack of validation, whenever a new validator joins the network or an existing validator updates their signing key, a malicious actor can exploit the situation by submitting a message containing a corrupted version of the public key for that validator, such as setting the first byte to 0xff.</p>\n<p>This corrupted message will be readily accepted and verified by all validators, including the victim validator. Consequently, each validator will store the corrupted public key. Subsequently, when the victim validator attempts to send a commitment or proposal, all other validators will attempt to verify the signature using the corrupted key, leading to constant verification failures.</p>\n<p>This situation renders the victim validator incapable of participating in the PoS protocol until the signing key is updated again, a process that takes 100 epochs. Moreover, even after updating the signing key, the attacker can simply repeat the attack.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"resolution-and-recovery-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#resolution-and-recovery-3\"></a>Resolution and Recovery</h2>\n<p>A patch was successfully released on March 14th 2024, with Heimdall <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v1.0.5\">tag v1.0.5</a>. It consists of one <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/pull/1149\">main PR</a>, where a new method has been introduced. The function, called <code>IsPubKeyFirstByteValid</code> checks the first byte of the validator’s public key every time a <code>SignerUpdate</code> or a <code>ValidatorJoin</code> event is invoked. It basically validates that the first byte of the public key is <code>0x04</code>, which stands for “uncompressed public key”, the format used by Polygon PoS nodes. The unit tests confirmed the validity of this new method.</p>\n<p>The patch was first tested on a devnet, then tested and rolled out on Mumbai and Mainnet nodes. A release announcement was shared, allowing all the validators to upgrade.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 14:50:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13780"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-bug-fix/13780.rss","#text":"Heimdall Security Bug Fix"},"filter":false},{"title":"Recent Downtime on Astar zkEVM","dc:creator":"J_Nicolas","category":"Announcements","description":"<p>Earlier this week, an outage on Astar zkEVM required an emergency upgrade of the network.

This includes but isn’t limited to, creating a Community Treasury strategy and post-season impact reports, approving grants and expenses, and managing a budget.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>The CTB is an independent body responsible for shepherding the Polygon Community Treasury. It should comprise thought leaders and experts in ecosystem growth and grant operations. Members must be familiar with ecosystem trends and opportunities and able to formulate a compelling thesis to support their strategic decisions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ctb-qualifications-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#ctb-qualifications-4\"></a>CTB Qualifications</h3>\n<p>Among others, the following qualifications are needed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Value Alignment with the Polygon vision and Wider Ethereum and Web3 Values— CTB members should be aligned with Polygon, follow Ethereum’s ethos, and be aligned with general Web3 values, such as decentralization, self-sovereignty, and unconstrained access to the Internet of Value.</li>\n<li>Ecosystem Growth Expertise— CTB will be critical in guiding both early seasons to success via strategy-setting and working on the framework’s evolution towards more efficient and decentralized growth strategies.</li>\n<li>Specific Field Expertise—CTB members will ultimately assess the value of individual projects and allocators to the development of the Polygon ecosystem. As such, they need to possess the skills necessary to assess these efforts well or delegate them to other collaborators they deem qualified.</li>\n<li>Community Expertise—The Polygon ecosystem is at a pivotal moment as it builds a strong community ready to advance it even further. Prospective CTB members need to be able to leverage this effort as an opportunity for long-term ecosystem growth.</li>\n<li>Operational Expertise—Operating the CT is a significant undertaking that requires CTB members to have operational expertise to spin up large programs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"ctb-responsibilities-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#ctb-responsibilities-5\"></a>CTB Responsibilities</h3>\n<p>The Community Treasury Board will be able to determine its procedures to address the following responsibilities.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"strategy-setting-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#strategy-setting-6\"></a>Strategy Setting</h4>\n<p>Before a funding cycle starts, CTB prepares and publishes a strategy document. The document sets out a framework for project funding categories, subcategories, and the eligibility of each funding track in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>Pre-cycle preparation is accomplished when the CTB produces a final strategy delineating the above-described allocations. This strategy is published transparently.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"track-selection-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#track-selection-7\"></a>Track Selection</h4>\n<p>This proposal distinguishes two tracks, which the CTB may employ as needed on a per-season basis by including in the strategy document.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct Funding Track</strong></p>\n<p>The direct funding track facilitates submissions from individual projects to the CTB. All prospective grantees will require CTB approval to receive funding from the CT, following a process laid out by the CTB.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Allocator track</strong></p>\n<p>The Grant Allocator track relies on specialized entities facilitating the distribution of allocated funds to grantees. Similarly to individual projects, prospective Grant Allocators will follow a process laid out by the Community Treasury Board.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"expenditure-approval-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#expenditure-approval-8\"></a>Expenditure Approval</h4>\n<p>At all times, the CTB is responsible for reviewing applications from all tracks and approving all expenditures from the Community Treasury, assisted by the Polygon Village Grants team as needed. The Village Grants team may propose funding proposals, but CTB approval is always final and necessary.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"post-cycle-reporting-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#post-cycle-reporting-9\"></a>Post-Cycle Reporting</h4>\n<p>Post-cycle, the CTB is responsible for producing a transparency report capturing the decisions, expenses, and the total impact across all participating Grant Allocators. The transparency report may summarize the decisions around individual projects funded within the season, and any learnings from the season.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"allocation-technical-flow-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#allocation-technical-flow-10\"></a>Allocation - Technical Flow</h3>\n<p>In the current phase, the Polygon Village Grants team will assist with Community Treasury operations, aggregating approved applications and the preparation of corresponding on-chain transactions. A set of on-chain mechanisms is proposed to facilitate the flow of funds.</p>\n<p>The address of the current interim SAFE contract, introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-17.md\">PIP-17</a> and to which Community Treasury emissions stream to, is <code>0x2ff25495d77f380d5F65B95F103181aE8b1cf898</code>.</p>\n<p>A new governance contract (Governor Bravo) is proposed that will govern the Community Treasury. At the core is a timelock controller, which holds funds and executes transactions. The timelock also allows for upgrades to the governance structure itself.</p>\n<p>Governor Bravo contracts will be used with voting ERC-721 SBTs held by two SAFE contracts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>PROPOSER</code> ERC-721 SBT held by [address to be added] multisig wallet operated by Polygon Labs</li>\n<li><code>EXECUTOR</code> ERC-721 SBT held by [address to be added] ⅗ consensus multisig wallet operated by the Community Treasury Board</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any transaction execution, both of the above SBTs will be necessary - <code>PROPOSER</code> SBT responsible for putting forward an on-chain transaction, and <code>EXECUTOR</code> SBT responsible for voting in favor, consequently executing the transaction (or rejecting in case of an <code>against</code> vote).</p>\n<p>The above setup ensures that while Polygon Labs may assist the Community Treasury Board with day-to-day administrative and other non-managerial operations, it may not execute any transactions, including the distribution of funds, without the CTB’s on-chain approval.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"compensation-to-initial-ctb-members-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#compensation-to-initial-ctb-members-11\"></a>Compensation to Initial CTB Members</h3>\n<p>Each of the initial CTB members will receive a monthly payment equal to $5,000 USD, payable in POL, from the Community Treasury, calculated using the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon-ecosystem-token/historical_data\">Coingecko Historical POL Close Price</a> as of the last day of each month (or a pro-rata portion thereof for any partial month service).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"copyright-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#copyright-12\"></a>Copyright</h2>\n<p>All copyrights and related rights in this work are waived under CC0 1.0 Universal.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-2-community-treasury-board/13760\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-2-community-treasury-board/13760","pubDate":"Thu, 11 Apr 2024 13:00:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.polygon.technology-topic-13760"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-2-community-treasury-board/13760.rss","#text":"PFP-2: Community Treasury Board"},"filter":false},{"title":"PFP-1: Polygon Funding Proposal Framework","dc:creator":"0xJustice","category":"Polygon Funding Proposals","description":"<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>PFP</th>\n<th>Title</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Author</th>\n<th>Discussion</th>\n<th>Status</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Date</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-01.md\">1</a></td>\n<td>PFP Purpose and Guidelines</td>\n<td>Describes PFP processes for the Polygon Community Treasury</td>\n<td>Mateusz Rzeszowski, Justice Conder, Bojana Tomic, Mihailo Bjelic</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/\">Forum</a></td>\n<td>Continuous</td>\n<td>Informational</td>\n<td>2024-04-11</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><hr>\n<h1><a name=\"pfp-1-polygon-funding-proposal-frameworkhttpsgithubcom0xpolygonpolygon-funding-proposalsblobmainpfpspfp-01md-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#pfp-1-polygon-funding-proposal-frameworkhttpsgithubcom0xpolygonpolygon-funding-proposalsblobmainpfpspfp-01md-1\"></a><a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/blob/main/PFPs/PFP-01.md\">PFP-1: Polygon Funding Proposal Framework</a></h1>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Community Treasury is an in-protocol fund independent from Polygon Labs (and other Polygon entities), governed via a framework that aims to enable community participation. It is designed and introduced to provide ongoing economic support for further development and growth of the Polygon ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Funded via a dedicated POL token emission stream, the Treasury provides strong ecosystem support during the period of early adoption, which is critical for the development, growth, and positioning of the Polygon ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Polygon Funding Proposals (PFPs), in turn, help govern the Community Treasury openly and transparently, describing processes and templates.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>In a self-sustainable and decentralized ecosystem, a framework is necessary to help gradually direct the value created by the network in a community-centered fashion. By introducing a transparent and versioned repository, the community maintains a historical record of the Community Treasury-related operations.  <br>\n<br>\nThe main discussion space for all PFPs is the <a href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology/\">Polygon Community Forum</a>.

In the initial phase of the PFP framework, only Treasury Board proposals will be merged into the repository. As the Community Treasury evolves, other types of PFPs may be proposed, e.g., funding proposals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pfp-flow-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#pfp-flow-6\"></a>PFP Flow</h3>\n<p>Polygon Funding Proposals progress through five possible states:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"proposed-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#proposed-7\"></a>Proposed</h4>\n<p>Initial PFPs should be posted to the Polygon community forum for community discussion and feedback, alongside a Pull Request to the PFP repository.

The author is then responsible for amending the document and resubmitting the request. Once all issues are resolved, the Pull Request will be accepted to the <a href=\"https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals\">PFP Github repository</a>, and the PFP will be assigned a number.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"review-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#review-8\"></a>Review</h4>\n<p>Once a PFP has been added to the PFP Github repository, it can be more formally discussed, circulated, and ultimately evaluated by the Community Treasury Board. PFPs in a review state will be announced in the community Discord and other communication channels to maximize awareness. Authors should be available for any public discussions related to their proposals.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"accepted-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#accepted-9\"></a>Accepted</h4>\n<p>A PFP approved using one of the relevant consensus mechanisms will be marked as accepted.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"rejected-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#rejected-10\"></a>Rejected</h4>\n<p>PFPs that fail to gather the necessary consensus are marked as rejected and may be resubmitted with modifications in the future.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"archived-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#archived-11\"></a>Archived</h4>\n<p>Outdated proposals may be moved into an archival state but will remain in the repository.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pfp-body-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#pfp-body-12\"></a>PFP Body</h3>\n<p>PFPs should contain the following:</p>\n<p><strong>Title:</strong> The Title of the PFP should be concise and accurately explain the purpose of the PFP.</p>\n<p><strong>Status:</strong> 1 of 5 statuses for the PFP, described in the PFP Flow section.</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A short (~200 word) summary of the proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Specification:</strong> The specification should provide the reader an in-depth understanding of the proposal.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pfp-editors-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#pfp-editors-13\"></a>PFP Editors</h3>\n<p>PFP editors are responsible for ensuring that PFP submissions are properly structured and advanced through designated stages.

Resolution required recomputation of the network’s state. A new version of the sequencer (v0.6.5-RC6), released shortly after, included an additional protection to prevent this issue from recurring in the short term. An additional, independent protection was added on April 09.</p>\n<p>In resolving the issue, the network was down for twenty minutes. Polygon PoS, chains built with Polygon CDK, and chains connected to the AggLayer were unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>For dApps on zkEVM: Transactions made on April 08, between approximately 3:00 UTC and 7:30 UTC, had to be re-executed. These transactions may have been processed in a different block or may not have been processed—please get in touch below, if this is the case. Approximately 1,000 transactions may have been affected.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"description-of-the-incident-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#description-of-the-incident-1\"></a>Description of the Incident</h2>\n<p>On April 08, the sequencer for Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta detected a reorg on the underlying L1, at block 19608115.</p>\n<p>Because of the network’s recent state sync issue, a protection was already included in the sequencer. This protection worked as expected, but the network’s synchronizer did not handle the reorg properly. Instead of just updating a record, in this case it inserted a new record. The sequencer then inserted a new Global Exit Root at batch 2005906. While this Global Exit Root was correct, it took an index that it was one greater than what it should be.</p>\n<p>When this batch was inserted in L1, the selected index still didn’t exist, causing it to be interpreted as invalid.</p>\n<p>In summary, the network’s trusted state included this batch as valid while the virtual state considered it invalid. Resolving this required re-execution of the trusted state with this block as invalid in order to build the proof. Consequently, some transactions were not executed and some transactions were re-executed with different results.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"future-mitigation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#future-mitigation-2\"></a>Future Mitigation</h2>\n<p>This is the second state synchronization issue for Polygon zkEVM. The core engineers for zkEVM have since released two independent protections, each of them robust enough to prevent L1 reorgs from causing this state synchronization issue to recur.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sequencer v0.6.5-RC6, released April 08, includes a mechanism for detecting when an L1 reorg occurs; once a reorg is detected, the network will continue operating normally, but the sequencer will temporarily stop accepting new Global Exit Roots until confirmation that the network’s state is synchronized.</li>\n<li>An additional protection was added to the synchronizer on April 09. It allows the network to synchronize from older blocks, where older blocks are a config parameter that act as a safe checkpoint.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-of-events-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.polygon.technology#timeline-of-events-3\"></a>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p><strong>April 08, 2024</strong><br>\n<strong>02:56 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe sequencer for Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta detected a reorg at block <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/19608115\">19608115</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reorg: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/19608115/f\">https://etherscan.io/block/19608115/f</a></li>\n<li>The synchronizer failed to properly handle this reorg, inserting a new record instead of updating the existing record.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Approximately 03:00 UTC:</strong><br>\nThe sequencer inserted a new Global Exit Root at batch 2005906.
