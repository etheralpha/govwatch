anti-censorship. We believe this embodies Gitcoin’s mission to “create technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund, and protect what matters.” Asia’s vast community and user base will also best ensure Gitcoin’s intents of network effect, community-first approach, and financial longevity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-7\"></a>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The matching pool is anticipated to be 25k-50k USD.

Team members will screen projects that meet the eligibility criteria, and then the matching amount for each project will be calculated based on the donations received by that project. However, the maximum matching amount for any single project should not exceed 10% of the total matching pool.</p>\n<p><strong>Signal booster:</strong>  Inspired by the Gitcoin Citizen Round and in order to better combat Sybil attacks and introducing expert opinions, we will allocate $5000 from the matching pool and form a group of 10 people selected from our advisors, sponsors, community partners, and the GCC Standing Voting Committee. Each member will be given $500 to distribute to the Asia round projects and share their allocation strategies publicly. This design, combined with community donations, will determine the final amount of funds each Asia round project will receive from the matching pool based on QF mechanism.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-size-and-engagement-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-10\"></a>Community Size and Engagement:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In this round - we are capturing the network of two major communities 1) GCC and 2) Pagoda.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GCC is short for global Chinese community of Universal Digital Commons.  We have a core community of over 2,000 people distributed across X, Telegram, and WeChat. Additionally, we have partnerships with 15+ Chinese-speaking communities and media outlets, reaching an audience of 10k+ people. In the past 4 community rounds that we initiated, <strong>we mobilized a total of around 8k individual donors, raising over $58k from them.</strong> This is a testament to our impact. This time, by collaborating with community partners across Asia, we aim to expand the influence by 3 to 5 times.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/1eade5cc2721deec2c59da460d7f931e52a75862.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/1eade5cc2721deec2c59da460d7f931e52a75862\" title=\"截屏2024-07-13 11.30.19\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/1eade5cc2721deec2c59da460d7f931e52a75862_2_444x500.jpeg\" alt=\"截屏2024-07-13 11.30.19\" data-base62-sha1=\"4noTGiYRI5O3I0BP4boQ7uEoIgi\" width=\"444\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/1eade5cc2721deec2c59da460d7f931e52a75862_2_444x500.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/1eade5cc2721deec2c59da460d7f931e52a75862_2_666x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/1eade5cc2721deec2c59da460d7f931e52a75862_2_888x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DCD6D9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pagoda is the Asia Ethereum network with 60 registered members from <strong>14 different Asia countries</strong>, including Korea, Japan, Mongolia, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Phillipines, Indonesia, Combodia, Myanmar, India and Vietnam.

We will use Hypercerts to establish the impact of the P2P Foundation. Moreover, the bioregional blockchain initiatives that we are planning to map and document will also be encouraged to build their impact assessment on Hypercents, and further to build their portable identity and reputation on Karma GAP, enabling them to unlock future opportunities.</p>\n<p>We also plan to to include regular reporting, community feedback mechanisms, and independent audits to measure and evaluate the success and impact of the grantees over successive rounds.</p>\n<p>Additional Considerations: Community members should consider the potential for creating a comprehensive and transparent documentation system that could serve as a model for other bioregional and commons-based projects globally.</p>\n<p>Potential Conflicts of Interest: There are no known conflicts of interest. All round operations team members have no direct involvement in any projects that will participate to receive a grant.</p>\n<p>Primary Resource:</p>\n<p>The P2P wiki will serve as the decentralized, open-source home for storing bioregional data, using blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and traceable documentation.

From multiple meetings with various city officials, collecting the data on city’s grants programs, analysing it, presenting at <a href=\"https://innovation.eurasia.undp.org/urban-transformation/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UNDP</a> conference for cities, researching the needed tech stacks and potential integrations, to narrowing down the how and where we would use QF.</p>\n<p>Also, I applied for EF Next Billion with this project in mind. Not only the <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/24/next-billion-cohort4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">project was selected</a> as one of the very few, but it got additional funding for the purpose of building the app.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-are-we-building-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-are-we-building-3\"></a>What are we building?</h2>\n<p>Ethereum has a number of protocols and apps that are both mature enough and solve a need a city has. We are building an open-source app customised for cities, which will serve as an interface to the Ethereum ecosystem of apps and protocols. Premier example of these, and the first one we want to offer access to is Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>One of the most important things cities do, is allocating money for public goods. Whether they need direct grants, QF, retro funding or something else, they could and should use Allo protocol. We intend on running our grant programs on Allo protocol.</p>\n<p>Gitcoin has built Grants Stack for the purpose of providing an easy and powerful interface for using Allo protocol. While using Allo protocol is a non-brainer for us, for Grants Stack we have some obstacles to use it as-is. It comes with its own set of features which are not directly usable by cities in their interaction with non-web3-native citizens, while some features which are needed are missing. We want to use as much of Grants stack as possible, but we have yet to look deeper and decide how to do it.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the things we’ll probably need to do differently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we need to offer users an in-app non-custodial wallet with no need to manage private keys (we plan to use Cometh Connect for this)</li>\n<li>we need to offer simple in-app onramp solution which works well with local banks, cards, currencies and KYC requirements.</li>\n<li>we need to abstract away the cryptocurrency used, so that users who top up euros, see euro balance (which means we need to use euro stablecoin)</li>\n<li>we need to make it in local language with local legal documents</li>\n<li>we need to be able to support different types of grants than what is currently supported by Gitcoin. (Eg. citizens propose projects, but the city gets the money and executes)</li>\n<li>we need to use city-specific tools and available data for sybil resistance, and possibly for KYC</li>\n<li>we need to only show the rounds which a citizen can participate in</li>\n<li>we might need to integrate a forum for discussions on the rounds</li>\n<li>we might need to integrate an option for donors to vote on disbursement of funds after the execution</li>\n<li>we might need to allow for documents submission</li>\n<li>we might need to add additional types of fields in the submission forms</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"where-are-we-now-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#where-are-we-now-4\"></a>Where are we now?</h2>\n<p>To advance [or help implement] this project I was recently selected as part of the Ethereum Foundation’s Next Billion Fellowship Program.  With their advisory and financial support we will build a minimum viable app for the purpose of running one specific QF grant round in Split, Croatia. Unfortunately, this funding is limited and besides building the app for pilot, doesn’t cover much more.</p>\n<p>Also, there are multiple grant programs with multiple grant rounds which we could run through the app as well. We could just run the pilot, or we could build such an MVP, which would be usable by any city or other institution to run local grant programs on Ethereum and Allo. We have already started talks with UNDP about this possibility. They work directly with more than 100 cities and national governments, and thourgh their network, we could reach more users quickly.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-do-we-expect-from-the-pilot-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-do-we-expect-from-the-pilot-5\"></a>What do we expect from the pilot?</h2>\n<p>The pilot will run in Split in September 2024. with a goal of at least 30 proposals and 1500 citizens donating (1% of population).</p>\n<p>These citizens will be onboarded on Ethereum and Gitcoin.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-do-we-expect-to-achieve-with-additional-funding-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-do-we-expect-to-achieve-with-additional-funding-6\"></a>What do we expect to achieve with additional funding?</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"june-2024-november-2024-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#june-2024-november-2024-7\"></a>June 2024 - November 2024</h3>\n<p>We will create an app and run a successful pilot in the city of Split during the fellowship ().

GG20, running from April 23 to May 7, 2024, saw a $1.6M matching pool, the election of a Community Council, a protocol upgrade, and an improved sybil resistance strategy.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-learnings-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#key-learnings-2\"></a>Key Learnings:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Governance:</strong> The new Community Round governance process required proposals reviewed and voted on by a newly elected Community Council. The top five rounds received an extra $25K each in matching funds. Moving forward, Gitcoin plans to include more rounds in the marketing efforts, above and beyond of the top 5 chosen for extra matching funds.</li>\n<li><strong>Grantee Experience:</strong> Improvements in communication and platform navigation led to an 81% satisfaction rate among grantees (which met our key success metric). Positive feedback highlighted the need for better marketing resources, a more user-friendly grantee portal, and clearer guidance on creating strong grant proposals. Future plans include enhancing resources, such as Canva kits, and providing streamlined application processes for returning grantees.</li>\n<li><strong>Donor Experience:</strong> Despite a decrease in the number of donors, each donor contributed more, leading to a $27K increase in crowdfunding. Focus on retaining first-time donors and simplifying the donation process is essential. Strategies include potentially collecting donor emails for updates and making the donation process more user-friendly, especially for new donors. Running all rounds on Arbitrum and partnering with ThankARB enhanced the donor experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Operations:</strong> The introduction of decentralized review processes with “Team Tiger” and the use of the AI-based tool “Checker” improved transparency and efficiency. Clearer instructions and better support for grantees were identified as areas for further improvement. Future plans include refining the review process, enhancing support during the application phase, and expediting payout timelines by improving the QF/COCM calculator app and pre-approving matching results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"moving-forward-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#moving-forward-3\"></a>Moving Forward:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marketing</strong>: Expand marketing efforts to include more community rounds, providing broader exposure and support to teams beyond the top five. This approach aims to ensure a more inclusive and impactful experience for all participants.</li>\n<li><strong>Grantee Support:</strong> Enhance resources to guide grantees in successfully marketing their grants. Improve the grantee portal to be more user-friendly and easier to navigate. Provide clearer resources on creating strong grant proposals and consider rolling applications for returning grantees to streamline the process. Finding ways to build a stronger builder community centered around mentorship, growth and education.</li>\n<li><strong>Donor Retention:</strong> Implement strategies to retain donors by collecting their emails for updates and exploring ways to allow grantees to email their donors. Make the donation process more user-friendly and continue promoting the popular collections feature to make the experience more social and engaging.</li>\n<li><strong>Operations:</strong> Continue refining the review process and expediting payout timelines. Improve support for grantees during the application phase and enhance project impact reporting. Maintain a fair and transparent process by not making team member wallet addresses public and focusing on the core mission of supporting open-source software and digital public goods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gitcoin is committed to evolving its grants program to be more resilient, inclusive, and impactful. The insights from GG20 will guide future strategies, ensuring continuous improvement and innovation as we move forward to GG21 and GG22. As we move into a multi-mechanism future, further experimentation and expansion will be enabled as we continue to evolve.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitcoin.mirror.xyz/GyT9ZE_PuopPVwSlgRIF-o7cm_ZTCqcXBKXMCNkc1Sk\">Read the detailed post here</a></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-reflections-insights-and-future-plans/19045\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-reflections-insights-and-future-plans/19045","pubDate":"Wed, 26 Jun 2024 11:04:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19045"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-reflections-insights-and-future-plans/19045.rss","#text":"GG20 Reflections, Insights, and Future Plans"},"filter":false},{"title":"Onchain Capital Allocation Handbook","dc:creator":"owocki","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>At ETHcc this year I will be launching a new book entitled the <strong>Onchain Capital Allocation Handbook</strong>.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863\" title=\"GQ3Ki7kWMAAmmUD\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_338x499.jpeg\" alt=\"GQ3Ki7kWMAAmmUD\" data-base62-sha1=\"ndxEc7u8sxgMm5BUm5wBFCxyUv1\" width=\"338\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_338x499.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_507x748.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_676x998.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ADA9A1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://twitter.com/owocki\">DM me on twitter</a> if you would like an invite.

If you’ve ever paid bills, taxes, or repaid friends for a meal, you’ve allocated capital.</p>\n<p>Capital allocation can become a full time job: governments and grant-making organi- zations spend vast amounts of time and money figuring out the process, logistics, and decision-making involved in allocating capital. At scale, capital allocation inevitably be- comes mired in gatekeeping, rivalrous decision making, and lack of transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>Crypto with its programmable smart contracts, present incredible advantages towards allocating capital in an efficient, effective, and transparent manner.</p>\n<p>The internet revolutionized how information was distributed in society. If crypto succeeds in revolutionizing how society distributes scarce resources, it follows that it will upend, and improve, how we do capital allocation.</p>\n<p>What if we could solve coordination failures with capital allocation? What if we could create better, more sovereign, collective action? How might we bring centuries old capital allocation strategies onchain? Can we invent new onchain capital allocation strategies that were not possible before Ethereum?</p>\n<p>The next horizon is hard to see alone, but by exploring it together, we can grasp it.</p>\n<p>This book is a celebration of the design space, and your no-hype resource to understand- ing the emergent pluralistic ecology of capital allocation developing in the web3 space. I’ve enjoyed putting together this handbook of the latest and greatest in what’s possible. It is my great pleasure to have a front row seat to this movement as a member of Gitcoin. My hope for this book is that I can pay it forward to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/onchain-capital-allocation-handbook/19041\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/onchain-capital-allocation-handbook/19041","pubDate":"Tue, 25 Jun 2024 19:58:35 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19041"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/onchain-capital-allocation-handbook/19041.rss","#text":"Onchain Capital Allocation Handbook"},"filter":false},{"title":"The Grants Program Canvas + Playbook: An open source tool for easy grant-making","dc:creator":"Viriya","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>Yesterday we launched the Grants Program Canvas and Playbook! This is a set of open-source (creative commons) resources designed to empower growth leaders to create and manage high-impact grants programs within the web3 space.</p>\n<p>The project was birthed out of a question that we kept getting asked: “How do I launch a grants program? Where do I even start?”</p>\n<p>So we went to work building a simple design tool that breaks down each step into manageable pieces that makes it easy for the most novice of grants operators to launch a program.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"streamlined-grantmaking-with-the-grants-program-canvas-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#streamlined-grantmaking-with-the-grants-program-canvas-1\"></a>Streamlined Grantmaking with the Grants Program Canvas</h3>\n<p>Our launch is mainly focused on introducing and driving adoption for the Grants Program Canvas — which is a tool that visualizes the different elements of a grants program in phases (Define, Design, Execute and Learn), each with specific quadrants leading users through a complete process for program design.</p>\n<p>Taking inspo from the <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-business-model-canvas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">business model canvas</a>, we believe that this framework could become a standard for more comprehensive and streamlined grantmaking that has been a major gap for web3 ecosystems.</p>\n<p>The exciting part about this tool is that it can be used for both grants program creation AND evaluation and elevation of existing programs.</p>\n<p>We are already using this too internally to evaluate the Citizens Retro and are incorporating the tool in our grants services offerings as well.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://grantscanvas.gitcoin.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">download the canvas here</a> and upload it into any whiteboard tool to get started with it.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921\" title=\"Screenshot_2024-06-25_at_15.16.11\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921_2_618x500.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_2024-06-25_at_15.16.11\" data-base62-sha1=\"uYJya7Qd99dWhnxydRviyEm971L\" width=\"618\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921_2_618x500.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921_2_927x750.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"BECAD4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"dive-deeper-with-the-grants-program-design-playbook-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#dive-deeper-with-the-grants-program-design-playbook-2\"></a>Dive Deeper with the Grants Program Design Playbook</h2>\n<p>The comprehensive 100+ page guide dives deeper into each quadrant of the Canvas, offering invaluable tools insights.

We are driving towards $50M in GMV this year and a north star of $1B in GMV through Allo over the next several years.</p>\n<p>To hit these goals, we need best-in-class contributor talent that is motivated and aligned with our mission and ambition.</p>\n<p>Token grants are a key tool we have to create those alignments. After all – the idea that we can program our values into money to ensure alignment is central to <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/whitepaper/read\">our vision for capital allocation</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"structure-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#structure-2\"></a>Structure</h1>\n<p>I propose that every contributor to Grants Lab is eligible for a 4-year token grant. These grants will be subject to linear vesting schedules and a 1-year cliff. Contributors who have been at Gitcoin for over a year and have not previously received a token grant will be eligible for an accelerated 6-month cliff, instead of 1 year.</p>\n<p>This proposal covers all current contributors to Grants Labs as well as an option pool for future contributors. In total, 3M GTC is requested. This represents 3% of the supply of GTC and is aligned with (or below) industry standards for team allocations. Though team allocations are typically only done at launch, Gitcoin has evolved substantially since the token launch in 2021. Most of the team that was present in 2021 are no longer active contributors, and the vast majority (80%) of current contributors do not have any token grants.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"potential-risks-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#potential-risks-3\"></a>Potential Risks</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Operational overhead\n<ul>\n<li>This will be part of the Grants Lab budgeting process and we will use available tools on the market (Liquifi or Hedgey or Gnosis Safe) to minimize overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How can we avoid negative impacts to the organization?\n<ul>\n<li>Tokens, once earned (including vesting), are wholly owned by the contributor and they have the freedom to do whatever they want with them. This autonomy and ownership are core to the culture we want to build.</li>\n<li>Additionally, unlocks will occur over a long period of time (4 years) to minimize potential disruption.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why now / how is this fiscally responsible?\n<ul>\n<li>As mentioned above, we’re at a critical juncture in Gitcoin’s ambition. Token grants are a tool we are deploying to ensure the success of our organization through creating a talented and aligned contributor base. (In fact, we believe it’s irresponsible to have a bunch of contributors who are NOT aligned with the long term org!)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>COI?\n<ul>\n<li>The proposer of this plan (Owocki) will not be a beneficiary of it. Owocki will not be requesting token grants through this program.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What about individuals who have current token grants?\n<ul>\n<li>These will be negotiated on an individual basis and may be transitioned to the new structure if the individual consents.

If we spent $25m on traditional QF ($3.5m GMV in 2024), then how might we learn from newer initiatives that costed closer to $200k to build, like EasyRetroPGF ($1.95m GMV in 2024)?</p>\n<p>What if we can make bets in multiple areas?

We have some exciting updates to share regarding the evolution of our organization as we transition into Gitcoin 2.1 and what that means right now, and for the future we’re creating.The following message has been shared with our core DAO contributors and I wanted to extend context to the broader community on some of the recent developments we’re making to our org.

This mission requires improved execution and sharper focus to navigate the fluctuations of the market—through bull runs, bear markets, and beyond.</p>\n<p>To align our strategic goals with the evolving demands of our industry, we are making some significant changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dissolving the Ecosystem Collective: We will concentrate our efforts where they count the most.</li>\n<li>Focusing solely on our Grants Program and Product: Levelling up our leadership in grant-making technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The primary goals of these decisions are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus our energy on the initiatives that will keep us at the forefront of the Grants and Grant tech ecosystem, increase GMV, and position ourselves as thought leaders.</li>\n<li>Work towards financial sustainability and extend our operational runway beyond current projections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The competitive landscape has evolved, with multiple new players entering the market. To remain at the forefront, we must adapt and innovate rapidly. This means developing highly configurable, custom solutions that cater to the specific needs of our community and partners. We are dedicating more energy to these key areas and focusing our resources on onboarding every web3 grants program into Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>In line with our proactive approach, we are hyperfocused on making adjustments that concentrate us on the greatest impact and alignment for our mission. As Passport spins out and we streamline the Grants Lab and Ecosystem Collective teams, we aim continue to strengthen  and position ourselves for future success. We intend to move more work into the community, leveraging their expertise and enthusiasm to deliver updates across Gitcoin more efficiently.</p>\n<p>We understand that these changes come with their challenges and will impact some of our valued contributors. We are committed to providing financial support and assistance to those affected during this transition, helping them find new roles within the industry or beyond.</p>\n<p>We want to assure all community members, stewards, and token holders that these changes have been taken very seriously and carefully considered. Our intention is to make Gitcoin as operationally efficient as possible while continuously bolstering our efforts to grow adoption for our suite of products, and knowledge base, further ensuring their longevity.</p>\n<p>I want to thank and show my genuine gratitude for the work that the Ecosystem Collective team has poured into the heart and soul of Gitcoin, and I’m optimistic that we’ll have further opportunities to work together again in the future.

We learned so much over the past 3 rounds (see <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/citizens-round-a-case-study-retroactive-qf\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/overall-learnings-from-gcp-004-and-gitcoin-citizens-round-2-results/17201\">here</a> and this recent <a href=\"https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK8Zo6Ok=/?share_link_id=825112287835\">internal retro</a>), incrementally improving this initiative’s success and impact, with Round <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span> being the <a href=\"https://x.com/GitcoinCitizens/status/1780596740728430821\">most successful one to date</a>. We will continue to apply these learnings in what’s next.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s dive in.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-we-know-so-far-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-we-know-so-far-1\"></a>What we know so far:</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"timing-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#timing-2\"></a>Timing</h3>\n<p>Deviating from what was announced <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-proposed-updates/17649\">previously</a>,  <strong>we are now planning to run Citizens Retro <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2024-strategy-outline/18991\">after GG21</a>,</strong> which will allow us to reward Citizens for work done over the two preceding rounds, increase the available funding, and focus on some internal reorganization (more on this below), which will ideally lead to more impact, both for Gitcoin and for all Citizens.</p>\n<p>We are planning to run <strong>Citizens Retro <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> from September 24 to October 8, with applications opening up on August 27</strong>. This timing will be confirmed once we have secured the full budget.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"budget-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#budget-3\"></a>Budget</h3>\n<p>We have funding available for one more round through the current GCP. However, we plan to request an additional budget to bring <strong>the total sum of matching funding to 100K GTC</strong> ($125.000 at time of writing). We are announcing this well in advance, to invite Citizens to start working today towards earning their fair share of this budget tomorrow.</p>\n<p>This is the largest amount we’ve allocated to Citizens to date, effectively doubling the matching. Our previous rounds had matching funds of 20K, 22K and 50K GTC respectively, not counting donations. Additionally, <strong>we hope to secure extra funding</strong> through external support, as we did in the past with the help of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> (respectively 4.20 eth + 10K GTC in the last two rounds) and Arbitrum (who doubled our matching for Retro <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span>).</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to get to work right now, you can and should</strong>: <a href=\"https://gitcoin.notion.site/Discord-Access-Guide-for-Citizens-5a91a307428b43c6966a5466438ff9fd\">join our Discord</a>,<a href=\"https://lu.ma/calendar/cal-yYcYQVROlvvWseF\"> attend Citizen office hours</a>, <a href=\"https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Idea-Board-3d839ea2b299495d9e4a6268cf1e0f9e\">dive into our idea board, propose your own ideas</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/GitcoinCitizens\">and follow us on X for inspiration</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-we-would-love-feedback-on-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-we-would-love-feedback-on-4\"></a>What we would love feedback on:</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"engage-builder-citizens-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#engage-builder-citizens-5\"></a>Engage Builder Citizens</h3>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoin-s-ratified-essential-intents-2023-2024-and-a-recap-of-our-successes/16818\">updated essential intents</a>, the focus of the Gitcoin team is more than ever on increasing <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2024-gmv-strategy-overview-grants-lab/18805\">Allo’s GMV</a>. Citizens contribute to our ‘Gross Merchandise Value’ in so many ways, as explained <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-citizens-rounds-value-generation-opportunities/18727\">here</a>. However, technical submissions have been mostly limited to (epic!) dashboards, and we want to take this a step further.</p>\n<p><strong>For our next round we would love to see more technical applications: not just submissions for standalone work, but deep integrations with Allo Protocol and Grants Stack</strong>, which we can provide support for. We would love to know: how do you think we can ensure deep integrations with Grants Lab and how can we better encourage Citizens to submit more technical work?</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Idea-Board-3d839ea2b299495d9e4a6268cf1e0f9e\">some ideas already popping up</a>, and feel free to submit yours!

After an entirely retroactive round, one mixed, and another retroactive one, each on a different network, <strong>we are now planning to run our next round as <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack/rpgf\">a fully retroactive funding round, with badgeholders (RetroPGF).</a></strong> We have a lot of in-house experience with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a>’s team, who built one of the two frontends for <a href=\"https://round3.optimism.io/projects?after=undefined&amp;display=grid&amp;sort=mostAwarded&amp;search=&amp;seed=1718378572712&amp;categories=\">Optimism RPGF Round 3</a>, and Gitcoin is now also offering this <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack/rpgf\">as a service</a>.</p>\n<p>Next to our enthusiasm about <strong>dogfooding all things Gitcoin</strong>, we also have noticed how it is very often the same limited group of warm-hearted people donating to these public greats. We want to address <strong>potential donor fatigue,</strong> and see how only working with voting could influence the results of our next round. Next to this, it will allow us to work with <strong>categories of submitted work</strong>, which will make it easier to evaluate submissions, and potentially allocate funds in a different way.</p>\n<p>Switching to RPGF will be our biggest experiment yet, and we have a lot of things to figure out by then. <strong>We feel very inspired, and would like to use this opportunity to ask for your input on organizing this round.</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the questions that have come up for us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who should be the <strong>badgeholders</strong>, the voters for our round? Should it be all GG grantees? All donors? Should it only be participants of previous Citizens rounds?</li>\n<li>Should <strong>GTC holders</strong> be voters for this round, and if so, how do we set this up? Do we use simple voting, quadratic voting, conviction voting, …? Should we mix grantees and GTC holders? Or try something else?</li>\n<li>Do we keep our successful <strong><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/signal-boosting-for-gitcoin-citizens-retro-3/18518\">signal boosting experiment</a></strong> in the mix, and how do we make this work with badgeholders? Do they have double or quadratic voting power, versus badgeholders just having one vote?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have so many questions (and a few potential answers) but first of all: we want to hear your thoughts. Let us know in the comments!</p>\n<h3><a name=\"one-more-thing-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#one-more-thing-7\"></a>One more thing</h3>\n<p>Lastly, <strong>I’ve decided to step down as the main round operator for the Gitcoin Citizens Retro rounds, so we are looking for someone new</strong>. It has been a true honor and a tremendous, heart-warming, inspiring pleasure to interact with our community of passionate Citizens on a daily basis.

This year’s approach builds upon the valuable insights gained from previous rounds, ensuring that we continue to evolve and improve and serve the community’s best interests.</p>\n<p>Our strategy for Gitcoin Grants across the remainder of 2024 centers on three core pillars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inclusivity: Broaden participation by reaching diverse communities and supporting various projects across different sectors</li>\n<li>Transparency: Clear communication and open processes to maintain trust and engagement</li>\n<li>Sustainability: Ensuring long-term growth and impact through strategic funding and resource allocation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov\">@sov</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sejalrekhan\">@sejalrekhan</a> for your thought partnership in baking out this strategy for 2024 and beyond.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overall-strategy-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overall-strategy-2\"></a><strong>Overall Strategy</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"oss-program-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#oss-program-3\"></a>OSS Program</h3>\n<p>Since its inception, Gitcoin Grants has been committed to furthering the ethos of OSS/Digital Public Goods while fostering project growth and sustainability through novel funding mechanisms. GG supports both early-stage and more mature builders across the wider Ethereum ecosystem and  is run by Gitcoin core contributors. <strong><em>These rounds run twice annually.</em></strong></p>\n<p>With Gitcoin Grants 20, we refocused on our core mission of supporting open-source software and digital public goods and started on a journey to redefine how we continually fund and sustain the digital infrastructure that underpins our modern world.</p>\n<p><em>You have our commitment that we will work tirelessly to continue to create a more resilient, inclusive, and thriving future.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-rounds-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-rounds-4\"></a>Community Rounds</h3>\n<p>GG20 was the first iteration of a new Community Round structure: we created a dedicated pool of funds (up to $125K quarterly) available to support “matching on matching” pools and highlighting them alongside the Program rounds. Communities with any amount raised for matching and meeting the round criteria could apply for up to $25K in funding from Gitcoin to go toward their matching pool. The Community Council (a Gitcoin DAO-elected external council) reviews applications and votes on which communities to fund and accept into the round.

Note that due to time constraints, we will only run three GG rounds in 2024:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GG20:</strong> April 23 - May 7th [COMPLETED]\n<ul>\n<li><em>OSS Program (4 rounds) $1M Matching Pool</em></li>\n<li><em>5+ Community Rounds</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GG21:</strong> August 7 - 21\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ecosystem ‘Spotlight’ Rounds</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ecosystem Rounds will now have the opportunity to share the stage alongside the community rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>10 Community Rounds</em></li>\n<li><em>$125k allocated towards matching for top 5 Community Rounds</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GG22:</strong> End of October (exact dates announced in the coming weeks)\n<ul>\n<li><em>OSS Program (4 rounds) $1M Matching Pool</em></li>\n<li><em>8 Community Rounds</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>During OSS rounds, our internal resources will likely be more constrained and due to this, we will only be able to support 8. (Subject to change).</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>$125k allocated towards matching for top 5 Community Rounds</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>One key difference</strong> to note is that our OSS Program will only run again in GG22, sticking to the twice annual  cadence that was first <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-proposed-updates/17649\">announced and outlined in this post</a>. Because the Gitcoin Grants matching pool are funds that were entrusted to us by the community (separate from our treasury), it’s important that we run a program that is sustainable for the long term, which will create a runway for our builders well into the future beyond the next few years. To fund what matters to us, we realize we have to take steps to ensure financial sustainability, but still serve our community and builders in a foundational way.  Additionally, as Gitcoin grows its presence and product stack to the wider Web3 Ecosystem we want to allow these groups to be able to run during GG.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"learnings-from-past-rounds-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#learnings-from-past-rounds-6\"></a><strong>Learnings from Past Rounds</strong></h2>\n<p>Reflecting on past rounds, we’ve gleaned several critical learnings that have shaped our 2024 strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Matching Algorithms:</strong> We’ve improved our Quadratic Funding algorithms to better match contributions with projects, ensuring a more equitable distribution of funds. This has been done through the use of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/nerd-post-updates-to-cluster-mapping-matching/18705&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1718383498828793&amp;usg=AOvVaw3zm5wpN0R4XtOjQ6nZhIGs\">COCM</a> and Passport’s Model Based Detection: a <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524\">two-pronged sybil resistance strategy</a> that we rolled out in GG20, which proved to be incredibly successful.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Feedback:</strong> Incorporating feedback from participants has been invaluable. We’ve streamlined the application process and introduced more robust support systems to assist grantees. GG20 saw an 80% grantee satisfaction rate, the highest we’ve seen in at least the past year. <em>This was measured through a GG20 grantee survey conducted, where we received more than 70 detailed responses.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Operations:</strong> We saw the need for improving our operations for an enhanced user experience, and in GG20 we introduced Checker and ‘Team Tiger’ which helped expedite grantee applications reviews.<br>\nBy integrating these learnings, we aim to create a more effective and rewarding experience for everyone involved.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"new-updates-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#new-updates-7\"></a><strong>New Updates</strong></h2>\n<p>We plan to release dates of GG rounds further in advance than we have historically. This will allow Community Rounds and grantees to prepare for the rounds ahead of time adequately, and will enable us to better plan internally. Within the following weeks, we will release a 12-18 month roadmap for GG that will flow over into rough dates for next year. From 2025 onwards, we will return to <strong>4 rounds per year.</strong></p>\n<p>Builder engagement in between GG rounds is top of mind for the Gitcoin team, and we are proactively working on how to set up stronger 1) support systems 2) education funnels 3) active community spaces 4) builder care that fosters innovation and collaboration not only during a GG round but also during the periods outside of the rounds. <strong>No one knows what developers need more than developers.</strong></p>\n<p>We are exploring ways to introduce new funding mechanisms into the grants program. This could include ways to adapt our QF mechanism even more, such as introducing MACI, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/signal-boosting-for-gitcoin-citizens-retro-3/18518\">continuing signal boosting</a>, <a href=\"https://easyretropgf.xyz/\">easyRPGF</a>, and more. <em>More about how this might unfold is coming soon.</em></p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates and get ready to contribute to the future of open-source innovation with Gitcoin Grants 2024!</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2024-strategy-outline/18991\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2024-strategy-outline/18991","pubDate":"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 16:26:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18991"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2024-strategy-outline/18991.rss","#text":"Gitcoin Grants 2024 Strategy Outline"},"filter":false},{"title":"DAO Financial Report - May 2024","dc:creator":"Sor03","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>In the past month, operational expenses amounted to $633,758, marking a decrease of $109,585 compared to the previous month.

The setup involved careful planning, including defining criteria, selecting and onboarding token engineers as advisors, and implementing a robust application and review system to ensure transparency and fairness. Key partners and stakeholders were engaged early in the process to align goals and expectations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"grant-round-objectives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#grant-round-objectives-2\"></a>Grant Round Objectives</h2>\n<p>The primary objectives of this grant round were to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support and accelerate public good projects that align with token engineering principles</li>\n<li>Encourage new ideas and solutions that will advance the token engineering field</li>\n<li>Build a stronger community by fostering connections between token engineering innovators and the broader public goods ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The grant round was specifically designed to engage and support projects and individuals advancing the field of token engineering, an area encompassing economics, system design with crypto, and the design and analysis of cryptoeconomic systems. The round targeted academics, researchers, educators, and developers focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Token engineering research</li>\n<li>Events, seminars, and papers educating the community about token engineering</li>\n<li>Software development for token engineering tools</li>\n<li>Building or enhancing social infrastructure related to token engineering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#implementation-3\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"setup-and-management-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#setup-and-management-4\"></a>Setup and Management</h3>\n<p>This being our 4th grant round, the setup process was streamlined based on previous experiences. We maintained the matching cap at 15% to allow up to 5-6 bigger projects to receive a substantial matching amount, optimizing the distribution of funds to drive meaningful impact. The eligibility criteria were improved with a list of project types perfectly aligned with the identified needs within the token engineering community, as informed by a TEC-sponsored <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xw48b/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Engineering Stakeholder Study</a>.</p>\n<p>We also implemented a new communication strategy that involved promptly notifying applicants of their acceptance or rejection, followed by a structured appeal process. This approach ensured clear and timely communication throughout the grant round, maintaining transparency and managing expectations effectively.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-and-solutions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#challenges-and-solutions-5\"></a>Challenges and Solutions</h3>\n<p>One ongoing challenge has been defining project qualifications clearly—distinguishing between projects that genuinely advance token engineering as a discipline versus those that merely apply token engineering elements, such as launching a token or incorporating a token economy. To address this, we focused on enhancing the review process by involving advisors who are experts in token engineering. The involvement of 9 seasoned advisors enriched the evaluation process. Their insights were crucial in accurately assessing the true impact and relevance of each project to the field of token engineering. Additionally, we recognized the need to provide clearer feedback on application rejections, helping applicants understand exactly why they did not meet the criteria and how they might improve for future submissions.</p>\n<p>During this grant round, managing the simultaneous processes of late applications, appeals, and the donation period also proved challenging. The need to address late submissions and appeals while simultaneously driving the donation campaign stretched our resources. To streamline future rounds, we hope to establish a more definitive schedule that separates the closing of applications from the start of the donation period. This will allow dedicated attention to appeals and ensure all applications are considered without compromising our donation campaign efforts. Assigning specific team roles for managing appeals and rejections will further prevent operational overlap, maintaining our focus on effective campaigning and meticulous evaluation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"unique-features-or-approaches-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#unique-features-or-approaches-6\"></a>Unique Features or Approaches</h3>\n<p>Continuing from a previous round, we employed the <a href=\"https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF)</a> Matching Boost, a strategic enhancement to the Quadratic Funding allocation process that leverages token engineering expertise. TQF works by analyzing token-based signals of token engineering expertise in the wallets of donors participating in our Token Engineering Grants Round. When such signals are detected, we apply a ‘boost’ to the donations, thereby increasing the funding received by projects that attract support from well-regarded members of the token engineering community. This approach not only incentivizes quality contributions but also ensures that funding is aligned with genuine expertise in the field.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"outcomes-and-statistics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outcomes-and-statistics-7\"></a>Outcomes and Statistics</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"funding-and-contributions-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-and-contributions-8\"></a>Funding and Contributions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Total funding: $9,365</li>\n<li>Number of contributions: 1,619</li>\n<li>Average contribution: $16.90</li>\n<li>Unique donors: 554</li>\n<li>Participating projects: 32</li>\n<li>Average grant size: $TEC 2,975.88</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"participant-feedback-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#participant-feedback-9\"></a>Participant Feedback</h3>\n<p>Every round, we gather open and honest feedback from our grantees using an anonymous feedback form.

We were honored to be selected as one of Gitcoin’s sponsored community rounds, which significantly amplified our reach. The support from Gitcoin not only helped us attract a wider array of projects but also expanded our circle of grantees beyond the familiar faces from previous rounds. These new ideas and perspectives have been refreshing for our community.</p>\n<p>One critical insight from this round was the absolute necessity of crystal-clear criteria. We realized that to truly achieve our objectives, we must sharpen our ability to distinguish between projects that are simply using token engineering and those that are pushing the boundaries of the field. This clarity is crucial for steering our efforts towards projects that promise genuine advancement in token engineering.</p>\n<p>Another major takeaway involved the importance of supporting impactful initiatives. The round reaffirmed our commitment to not just funding projects but also measuring their long-term impact. This means developing robust metrics to assess both the potential and the realized impact of projects, ensuring that our investments continue to bear fruit long after the funding has been disbursed.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"areas-for-improvement-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#areas-for-improvement-15\"></a>Areas for Improvement</h3>\n<p>We discovered that many of our grantees were not maximizing opportunities to promote their projects. In future rounds, we need to provide more support for grantee marketing and engagement. Whether through resources, training, or incentives, we must empower our grantees to champion their projects effectively, to better boost their visibility and impact.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in future grant rounds, we plan to introduce detailed metrics and evaluation tools specifically designed to assess the direct impact of our funding on the supported projects. This initiative will allow us to track how our contributions aid in advancing each project’s goals and development within the field of token engineering. By refining our evaluation framework, we aim to ensure that our funding not only supports worthy projects but also maximizes their potential for success and growth.</p>\n<p>One logistical improvement from this round we would suggest is having earlier clarification of grant round dates. Knowing these dates in advance would significantly enhance our planning and coordination. This advance notice is crucial for ensuring that all aspects of the grant round—from application deadlines to project evaluation and donation campaigns—are better organized and clearly communicated.</p>\n<p>As we reflect on these lessons, we are inspired to refine our processes and approaches for future rounds. Each grant round is an opportunity to learn, adapt, and enhance the transformative potential of our funding. The insights gained from this round will undoubtedly influence our strategies moving forward, making each successive round more impactful than the last.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"closing-thoughts-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#closing-thoughts-16\"></a>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Reflecting on this grant round, several key learnings stand out as crucial for our growth and future planning. The importance of setting clearer criteria and an evaluation matrix cannot be overstated—it is essential for guiding both applicants and reviewers, ensuring that projects align with the true spirit of token engineering. This round has reinforced the necessity of planning ahead and meticulous time management, especially when aligning with Gitcoin’s timeline and balancing multiple processes such as appeals, late applications, and active donation campaigns.</p>\n<p>Constant and clear communication has been an essential component in running our round. Maintaining open channels with grantees, our community, and partners like Gitcoin has helped keep the process transparent and inclusive, fostering a trusting and engaged community environment.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, we are excited to continue refining these processes. Each round brings new opportunities to enhance our approach, deepen our impact, and expand our community’s engagement with token engineering. We encourage everyone—projects/grantees, donors, and partners—to share their feedback on this round. Your insights are invaluable as they help us improve and innovate for future rounds.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/token-engineering-qf-grants-round-spring-2024-gg20-round-retro/18978\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/token-engineering-qf-grants-round-spring-2024-gg20-round-retro/18978","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 15:53:09 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18978"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/token-engineering-qf-grants-round-spring-2024-gg20-round-retro/18978.rss","#text":"Token Engineering QF Grants Round: Spring 2024 GG20 Round Retro"},"filter":false},{"title":"[Discussion] Allo Fee Switch Proposal","dc:creator":"James","category":"🤖 DAO Governance and Vision","description":"<h1><a name=\"allo-fee-switch-proposal-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#allo-fee-switch-proposal-1\"></a>Allo Fee Switch Proposal</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#abstract-background-2\"></a>Abstract &amp; Background</h2>\n<p>Fire Eyes DAO has been working towards creating a roadmap for <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380\">GTC Value Accrual</a>  as well as driving more clear sustainability and value to the GitcoinDAO.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380\">GTC Value Accrual Intro</a> forum post, introducing a fee switch to the Allo Protocol is a straightforward decision that can allow us to begin this journey.</p>\n<p><strong>This forum post aims to ignite initial discussion on an Allo fee switch, not be a ‘ready to vote’ proposal.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Allo protocol v2 (and its predecessors) have had $60m+ in combined volume. The introduction of a fee to Allo would create a new revenue stream which would be passed back into the DAO treasury.</p>\n<p>Uniswaps previous discussion on the activation of their fee switch provides some guidance around the process involved in making this change, and valuable insight into the wider community response to such a change.</p>\n<p>Although Gitcoin is a different protocol to Uniswap, the foundation of these decisions should follow the same logical course. <strong>Protocols cannot sustain being public goods indefinitely and leaning into value accrual as a protocol is important.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>This initial pre-proposal discussion centres around two decisions that need to be made before we move forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly (1.) if the fee is added to Gitcoin’s deployment of Allo protocol <strong>or</strong> (2.) to all deployments of Allo protocol.</li>\n<li>Secondly if this fee was to be added, what percentage of volume the fee would take.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Firstly:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The fee switch could added to the Allo Protocol but only be enacted via the official Gitcoin deployment, not at the overall contract level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This allows others to fork the contracts and deploy their own instance without the fee if they wish to.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The fee switch could be implemented at the contract level, meaning that all deployments would include the switch unless it was removed from the contract itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This more strongly encourages anyone using the allo contracts to contribute to the funding of public goods via GitcoinDAO.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Secondly:</strong> The fee level is an open question - we invite community feedback and discussion but envision the fee sitting at one of the following levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5%</li>\n<li>1%</li>\n<li>3%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For context, looking at these fee levels retroactively gives us an idea of how impactful a fee could be over time:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"gg20-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#gg20-5\"></a>GG20:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5% of total GG20 donations = $3165</li>\n<li>1% of total GG20 donations = $6330</li>\n<li>3% of total GG20 donations = $18,990</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"all-time-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#all-time-6\"></a>All time:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$300k</li>\n<li>1% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$600k</li>\n<li>3% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$1.8m</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These numbers show value flows that could be directed towards sustainability.</p>\n<p><strong>It is important to note that the proceeds of this fee will be deposited back into the Gitcoin DAO treasury,</strong> to be directed into funding both the development of Gitcoin infrastructure, and the commons more broadly. As such, it makes sense for the fee to be higher than average and that most users would be accepting of this given that the fee exists purely to sustain the provision of Allo and related public goods.</p>\n<p><em>FireEyes would recommend that the switch be implemented at the Allo contract level with a fee of 1%. This is because it provides a clear value proposition to GitcoinDAO’s sustainability whilst remaining reasonably unobtrusive to users donating via the Allo protocol. It is obviously still possible to remove or reduce this fee switch, but this would need to be an explicit decision to exclude by anyone deploying.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"drawbacks-risks-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#drawbacks-risks-7\"></a>Drawbacks / Risks</h2>\n<p>There are reasonable discussion points that this type of fee switch could damage Gitcoin’s public goods reputation, here’s how we feel that we could mitigate this if deemed necessary by the community:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with the checkout process having an optional donation/fee to Gitcoin DAO.</li>\n<li>Only enact the fee switch on the official Gitcoin frontend, and let others deploy their own frontends without fee switches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Allo has established itself as a credible tool for capital allocation, projects with large sums of capital have two incentives to use Allo with a fee switch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has pre-existing infrastructure which is easy to use, making the fee worthwhile.</li>\n<li>Using Allo (with a fee) also means that you are also contributing to public goods inherently by contributing to the sustainability of public goods infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We hope to foster community discussion around both the introduction of this mechanism and its finer details, as well as more broadly around sustainability for the GitcoinDAO and it’s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We realise this is a controversial topic to introduce to a public goods focused community like Gitcoin however starting this conversation is an important step towards ensuring that we can continue sustainably building public goods infrastructure for years to come!</p>\n<p>Please share your thoughts and feedback in this forum post <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/robot.png?v=12\" title=\":robot:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":robot:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974","pubDate":"Mon, 10 Jun 2024 22:27:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18974"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974.rss","#text":"[Discussion] Allo Fee Switch Proposal"},"filter":false},{"title":"Dark Matter, coin voting, bribes, transferable stake, etc","dc:creator":"skilesare","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>Hey all…I’ve started a bit of discussion over on the DFINITY forums(i know, i know) about some issues we’re running into.

It has been a goal of mine and others on the team to graduate Passport from Gitcoin as Gitcoin has been focused on Grants and growing GMV for a while now. At the same time, the Passport team has been focused on identity and the emerging world of onchain reputation, with some support for Gitcoin, but largely prioritizing the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Creating separation from the two entities ensures Passport’s actions across the space are no longer associated with the Gitcoin brand, and while Gitcoin continues to focus on capital allocation, there will no longer be questions on why we have an identity solution in the portfolio.</p>\n<p>This budget request seeks funding to enable the spin out of Passport and fund the business for its initial six months. Here is what we are thinking. Passport has generated revenue on OP and Linea (by enabling onchain attestations of one’s unique humanity, and OP RPGF3). Together with this funding, and a six month budget, we would like to formally request a vote to spin out of Gitcoin DAO. In return for bootstrapping the business unit, we will ensure Gitcoin has equity ownership in the new entity, a token allocation if/when we launch a token and a board seat in the new entity. The details on how a DAO may participate are a little murky (ie, have equity, and a board seat) and so we will be working with the Gitcoin Foundation to formalize the ownership and board seat appointment.</p>\n<p>Passport currently drives the majority utility use case for GTC and we plan to keep GTC utility in the product for the foreseeable future. We do not have details on if/when Passport has its own token, but we want to ensure as Gitcoin will likely be a large token holder in Passport, there will be token use cases that extend utility for other ERC-20 (like GTC).</p>\n<p>We are aiming to have this spinout complete in July, and would expect the Passport team to start to use its own properties (ie, Passport.xyz for the website and app, its own discord server, its own email, etc.) on July 1. While Passport will be an independent entity, there will still be lots of areas of collaboration as those running grants programs often need Sybil protection (and those doing airdrops often want to seed a Grants program after TGE).</p>\n<p>As for the progress the team has been making, updates below outline both progress and the roadmap we have ahead.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tldr-on-the-next-6mos-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-on-the-next-6mos-1\"></a>TL;DR on the next 6mos</h2>\n<p>Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity and reputation management. We are continuing to focus on ways to build a reputational substrate that can be leveraged permissionlessly onchain:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Adoption</strong> - Continue to expand the number of real humans with a passport</li>\n<li><strong>Growth</strong> - Grow the number of onchain attestations</li>\n<li><strong>Sustainability</strong> - Ensure continued runway extension</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"outline-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outline-2\"></a>Outline</h2>\n<p>Passport is the premier web3 native offering that enables ecosystems to protect, understand and organically grow what matters most – their communities. We see Passport at the confluence of a best in class identity solution, backed by the most relevant and comprehensive data analysis toolset that also offers communities the ability to ascribe reputation.</p>\n<p>Objectives for Seasons 23: This table lists the milestones and deliverables we plan to tackle.

We now have a total of 1.4M unique all time passports. We also continued to drive strongly against our targets in GTC staking, hitting over 1.75M GTC staked.</p>\n<p>With a focus on onchain attestations, we have launched two new networks where Passport holders can attest to their unique humanity. This means, we now support attestations on Arbitrum, Optimism, Linea, and zkSync. Onchain attestations have started to unlock novel use cases where smartcontract interactions can now directly confirm a wallet’s humanity score, enabling truly permissionless and decentralized humanity confirmation.</p>\n<p>We have also done a lot of work to revamp the GTC staking experience to make the process more intuitive and informative. This has brought the creation of privacy policy details and user terms as the GTC staked can be slashed when users are acting in bad faith.</p>\n<p>And finally, our new Model Based Detection endpoint, and L2 coverage has continued to expand. We now can review wallets using our models across ARB, OP, zkSync, Polygon, Eth Mainnet, and NFT communities. This capability is incredibly helpful when engaging with other communities (new L2s) to help them understand who is likely a sybil actor and who is likely human on their network.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"milestone-report-for-past-season-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#milestone-report-for-past-season-4\"></a>Milestone Report for Past Season</h3>\n<p><strong>Legend:</strong> <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/green_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":green_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":green_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Success/Completed/Shipped <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">Incomplete, but partial success <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":red_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":red_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">Incomplete, Will Not Hit Goal <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/black_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":black_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":black_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Canceled</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n   <td><strong>Initiative/Project</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Key Results</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Value Delivered</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Ease\n   </td>\n   <td>🟢Simplified Passport user experience\n   </td>\n   <td>Revamped Passport with fewer stamps, credentials, and simplified path to 20 score.\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Effectiveness\n   </td>\n   <td>🟡Updated score weights for all Passports based on previous 6 months of data\n<p>\n🟢Aggregate L2 Models\n   </p></td>\n   <td>In addition the revamp of Passpot and the addition of the new models we’ve made significant progress dropping the False positive rate under 16%, did not hit the target of &lt;10%.\n<p>\nWe’ll have a working model by June 30th..\n   </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Adoption\n   </td>\n   <td>🟢1.4M Passports\n<p>\n🟢Scored 400k addresses with MDB \n   </p></td>\n   <td>Continued to drive top line growth of unique Passports by adding 255k new Passports exceeding our target of 1.3M driven by new partners Initia and zkLink.
