We refer to this minimum amount for the project to become viable as the ‚ÄúThreshold‚Äù. The program we‚Äôre proposing will incorporate the use of self-declared Thresholds (reviewed and approved by our grant committee) so that projects only receive funding if the donations+matching pool amount would be sufficient to meet the threshold. This ensures the program is only awarding projects that, funding-wise, have a real chance of delivering a valuable output. The donations to projects that fail to meet the Threshold are returned to the donors and the matching pool is re-allocated to others. This mechanism has the advantage of nudging projects towards minimum viable products and of reducing wastage in capital allocation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-size-and-engagement-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-10\"></a>Community Size and Engagement:</h3>\n<p>For the past 2 years, RnDAO has positioned itself as a thought leader and go-to community for CollabTech.

We believe that by aligning with Gitcoin‚Äôs mission and utilizing innovative technologies, we can lay the groundwork for a more enlightened and compassionate world.</p>\n<p><strong>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:</strong></p>\n<p>We are planning to contribute $10,000 CAD in matching funds from a private Bitcoin donation we received in November of 2023. When selected, we feel confident in raising further matching funds through donations.</p>\n<p>ETH address: 0xadaa3b0d9b96df7e338b6db62e7daa073e0e94a5</p>\n<p><strong>Further fundraising:</strong></p>\n<p>In late-2024, our organization is preparing for the launch of an NFT collection of twenty 1-minute digital video works about alternate histories with psychedelic puppets coming at key moments of consciousness expanding inspiration. The primary objective of this initiative is to continue raising funds through various channels, including online platforms and potential partnerships with sponsors and donors.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, we are actively collaborating with CreativeBC, an organization dedicated to fostering the development of creative industries in British Columbia. Through this strategic partnership, we aim to secure matching funds that will be instrumental in supporting the development phase of an exciting TV series. This ambitious project will serve as a platform to showcase the exceptional talent and creativity within our growing community of collaborators.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our non-profit organization will become eligible for funding from the Canada Council for the Arts in 2025. This milestone will provide financial support that will enable us to expand our reach, enhance our programming, and continue to make a positive impact on the cultural landscape of psychedelics.</p>\n<p>See NFT collaboration examples below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C3IjtoVp4Qf/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Paul Stamets</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C4Dx5FPxW6J/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Jason Silva</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C2_PYe0pwPp/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MMA MDMA</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Advisors for This Round:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scott Nelson (long-term web3 investor)</li>\n<li>Shawn Anderson (blockchain engineer and founder of Long Tail Financial)</li>\n<li>Adam Szymanski (Art Consultant specializing in NFTs)</li>\n<li>Ben West (Gitcoin).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Funding Mechanism:</strong></p>\n<p>For this funding round, we will utilize the pluralistic QF (Quadratic Funding) algorithm, a collusion-resistant version, to ensure fair and equitable distribution of funds. The maximum matching amount will be capped at 10%, with a minimum donation requirement of $1. This approach guarantees that contributions from our community are amplified, supporting a diverse range of decentralized science and art projects related to psychedelics.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Size and Engagement:</strong></p>\n<p>With an increasing number of thought leaders in the psychedelic space, our focus is expanding to include and empower creators globally. Through our social media platforms and support from influencers like Paul Stamets and Jason Silva, we‚Äôve reached over a million people. Our goal is to bring more creators into the fold, allowing them to share their visions and experiences.</p>\n<p>In November 2023, we received a 0.5 Bitcoin donation, along with community support from two Gitcoin rounds totalling approximately 2 Ethereum. These funds have been used to fund two positions in our organization, put on a live film festival in NYC, create a DAO blueprint, and connect with dozens of creatives globally.</p>\n<p>We aim to fund projects that align with two core areas development:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decentralized Science</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Artistic Creations</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are committed to funding 6-8 outstanding projects that promise sustainable growth and long-term benefits for our organization and community. With five core contributors currently driving our vision forward, we are keen to welcome additional individuals and organizations. Their fresh perspectives and innovative approaches will undoubtedly enrich and expand our capabilities beyond what we could achieve independently. We are enthusiastic about the prospect of incorporating new voices into our project, enhancing its diversity and impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact Assessment Plan:</strong></p>\n<p>In collaboration with Shawn Anderson from Longtail Financial, we will explore the potential of Hypercerts and DeReSy to enhance our grant assessment process. Hypercerts could be used to create a transparent, verifiable record of a project‚Äôs impact, allowing us to track and reward achievements effectively. These tokens would enable us to retrospectively fund projects based on their proven impact, fostering a more dynamic and responsive funding model.</p>\n<p>With DeReSy, we could implement a robust system for on-chain project reviews, providing clear, immutable assessments of each project‚Äôs progress and outcomes. This would allow for transparent and objective evaluations, facilitating better decision-making for future grant allocations.</p>\n<p>By working with Longtail Financial, we aim to integrate these technologies into our grant-making process, ensuring that we fund projects that offer significant, verifiable impact. This strategic collaboration will help us leverage cutting-edge blockchain technology to make more informed and impactful funding decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\n<p>Our organization, dedicated to promoting public good, believes in the transformative power of psychedelics and the arts towards making a better world. We view artists as essential in shaping public perception and preparing society for the changes psychedelics can bring. Recognizing the value of their work, we advocate for fair compensation for artists. Through this funding round, we aim to support projects that establish enduring, sustainable contributions to our organization and vision, empowering artists to create and disseminate their work, thereby influencing global consciousness positively.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Conflicts of Interest:</strong></p>\n<p>Not that we are aware of.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-decentralized-science-and-art-in-psychedelics/19127\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-decentralized-science-and-art-in-psychedelics/19127","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 23:22:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19127"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-decentralized-science-and-art-in-psychedelics/19127.rss","#text":"[GG21 Community Round Proposal] Decentralized Science and Art in Psychedelics"},"filter":false},{"title":"[GG21 Community Round Proposal] LUKSO Community Grants","dc:creator":"clara","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/a/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c\" title=\"LGP_Gitcoin\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c_2_690x345.jpeg\" alt=\"LGP_Gitcoin\" data-base62-sha1=\"nzmgN78c9emv4UT13cNXV0KmPN2\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c_2_690x345.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c_2_1035x517.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c_2_1380x690.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DB7ABB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"we-are-excited-to-share-our-proposal-for-the-gg21-community-round-our-goal-is-to-empower-builders-and-community-led-projects-to-foster-a-vibrant-ecosystem-of-social-creative-and-cultural-projects-through-decentralised-funding-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#we-are-excited-to-share-our-proposal-for-the-gg21-community-round-our-goal-is-to-empower-builders-and-community-led-projects-to-foster-a-vibrant-ecosystem-of-social-creative-and-cultural-projects-through-decentralised-funding-1\"></a><em>We are excited to share our proposal for the GG21 Community Round.

By utilising quadratic funding, we aim to create a decentralised funding mechanism that empowers our community to propose and support impactful projects. This mirrors Gitcoin‚Äôs commitment to cultivating a vibrant, engaged community and ensuring the economic health and vitality of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>On a higher level, the LUKSO ecosystem is social and reputation-based by default, led by our core product <a href=\"https://universalprofile.cloud\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Universal Profiles</a>. These smart contract accounts unlock account abstraction from the start, enabling a user-friendly and feature-rich ecosystem built on social, creative, and cultural use cases. This alignment with Gitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúcommunity-first‚Äù approach is likely one of the reasons why our previous collaborations within the ‚ÄúGitcoin-Verse‚Äù have always been extremely positive.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-8\"></a>ANTICIPATED SIZE OF THE MATCHING POOL</h2>\n<p>The matching pool is anticipated to be $50,000 in LYX, funded by the Foundation for the New Creative Economies.</p>\n<p>Funding address: Please find the publicly disclosed Genesis Address for the Foundation for the New Creative Economies in this <a href=\"https://medium.com/lukso/its-happening-the-genesis-validators-are-coming-ce5e07935df6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Medium Article</a> under ‚ÄúThe Genesis Addresses‚Äù.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"advisors-for-this-round-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#advisors-for-this-round-9\"></a>ADVISORS FOR THIS ROUND</h2>\n<p>Our team has been in close contact with Sov from the Gitcoin team, who has been immensely helpful in patiently answering all our questions.

Given our community‚Äôs strong engagement in building on LUKSO and advocating for ecosystem projects, we are confident in the success of this funding approach.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"community-size-and-engagement-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-11\"></a>COMMUNITY SIZE AND ENGAGEMENT</h2>\n<p>Our community is highly active and continuously engaged in driving both the education and adoption of LUKSO‚Äôs technology stack within the EVM builder community. On <a href=\"https://x.com/lukso_io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a>, we have 64k organic followers, and our <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/lukso\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Discord</a> server hosts 18.5k members. <a href=\"https://www.commonground.cg/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CommonGround</a>, a web3 alternative to Discord, hosts its most active ecosystem server with LUKSO. During the BuildUP! 1 hackathon in 2022, nearly 200 individual community members participated in the quadratic voting community awards, with <a href=\"https://l14.universalprofile.cloud/asset/0xE951ACAf8D0502276279783D4390f4bbcf757F6B\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">participation NFTs</a> still on our testnet and set to be migrated soon.</p>\n<p>For the GG21 LUKSO Community Grants, we will closely track engagement and feedback on our social media channels.

After consulting with Sov, we will set the matching pool limit to 10%.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impact-assessment-plan-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-plan-14\"></a>IMPACT ASSESSMENT PLAN</h2>\n<p>For the GG21 LUKSO Community Grants, we will closely track engagement on Twitter, the number of submitted versus eligible projects, the number of contributors, and financial contributions (total, average, median, etc.). We will also analyse the distribution of matched funds to evaluate the signalled preferences by our community and identify potential biases in our ecosystem. Tracking these metrics both across Gitcoin grant rounds and contrasting them with the funding decisions of our centralised program will provide our team with meaningful insights and feedback.</p>\n<p>Our team is currently working on integrating both on- and off-chain analysis tools.

Our round helps attract and strengthen Gitcoin‚Äôs ties with the expertise and skills of the token engineering community, contributing to boosting the intent of network effects. The TEC‚Äôs dedication to catalyzing token-engineered public goods aligns with Gitcoin‚Äôs commitment to positive change.</p>\n<p>This round is the first time for the TEC to focus on accelerating the adoption of token engineering in web3 ecosystems, which is where it is needed the most. By choosing this round as a Community Round, Gitcoin would play a critical role in building networks between this new engineering discipline and Optimism and the broader Superchain.</p>\n<p>This round also supports Gitcoin‚Äôs spirit of innovation, by continuing to build on our Tunable Quadratic Funding and by integrating it with a follow-on Retro round as a mechanism for incentivizing actual impact by grantees.</p>\n<p><strong>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have a total of $50K available for both the QF and Retro rounds in this integrated grant-making campaign. Of this, we are currently dedicating $10K to the QF portion in hopes of receiving Gitcoin Community Round matching. If that does not happen, we may reallocate a larger portion of that $50K to the QF round.</li>\n<li>Funding address: <a href=\"https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x690ab933C5082049d20E53B21Dd37F9A346C8B47\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x690ab933C5082049d20E53B21Dd37F9A346C8B47</a></li>\n<li>Although we don‚Äôt expect additional funding from sponsors for the August QF round, we‚Äôre securing alternative funding sources for the retro round through token engineering firm sponsorships and Optimism community partnerships, while also evaluating Superchain, Celo grants, and Ethereum Support Program for sustainable future funding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Advisors for This Round:</strong><br>\nWe‚Äôll invite our previous round advisors to join us again for the upcoming round:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jeff Emmett - Former TEC steward, writer, researcher at BlockScience</li>\n<li>Phil H ‚Äì DAO governance, Mangrove</li>\n<li>Vasily - Ph.D. researcher and token engineer, PowerPool</li>\n<li>YGG Anderson - Former TEC steward, data scientist at BlockScience</li>\n<li>Lisa Tan - Token engineering economist, author at Orus and Economics Design</li>\n<li>Enti - Former TEC round operator, GG17, 18, 19.

This will be complemented by a Retroactive Funding round, using <a href=\"https://easyretropgf.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin‚Äôs EasyRetro on Allo Protocol</a>, in November to reward projects based on their milestone achievements and demonstrated progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Reason:</strong><br>\nTQF leverages community intelligence to efficiently allocate funds, supporting high-potential projects. It incorporates values important to the token engineering community by including signals of token engineering expertise and stake in the Superchain (OP delegates and badge holders). The Retroactive Funding round incentivizes milestone achievement and continuous improvement within the OP ecosystem. This dual-funding approach maximizes the likelihood of success and impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Size and Engagement:</strong><br>\nOur community consists of 795 token holders, 6,183 followers on Twitter, and 2,000 Discord members.</p>\n<p>Tangible metrics from our past round (GG20) indicating the strength of our community include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 60 applications, out of which 32 projects were selected for the round</li>\n<li>1,619 donations</li>\n<li>554 sponsors</li>\n<li>Total of $9,365.14 crowdfunded</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/9\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin | Explorer</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Type of Projects to Fund:</strong><br>\nWe aim to fund projects dedicated to driving the adoption of token engineering within the OP ecosystem. This includes initiatives in education, tooling, research, social infrastructure, and consulting. We are specifically seeking projects that are committed to tracking and reporting their impact in the Superchain. By coupling this QF round with a follow-on Retro round, we provide additional incentives for meaningful participation and impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Estimated Number of Eligible Grantees:</strong><br>\nIn our first three rounds, the number of grantees ranged from 15-20, while last round the number of grantees increased to 32. This round has a more specific focus on Optimism and Superchain ecosystem development through token engineering, therefore we are expecting the number of grantees to be around 5-10.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact Assessment Plan:</strong><br>\nWe plan to run a TEC Retro round, using Gitcoin‚Äôs EasyRetroPGF, open only to previous TQF round grantees who meet a predetermined performance threshold. TEC will work closely with grantees to provide feedback on their milestones and impact goals, ensuring they are meaningful and achievable. Grantees will use Karma to track progress against the milestones and goals included in their application. This impact assessment process will measure and evaluate their success, determining the Retro round awards.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Considerations:</strong><br>\nCommunity members should consider the integration of TE projects with the OP ecosystem and the potential for significant impact on both token engineering and the broader blockchain community. The TEC is committed to innovation and experimentation, being one of the first communities to tie a Quadratic Funding (QF) round with a Retroactive Funding round using Gitcoin‚Äôs tools.</p>\n<p>We are dedicated to evolving the Tunable QF process, building on Gitcoin‚Äôs pioneering work with Quadratic Funding. This approach <a href=\"https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">embeds token engineering expertise</a> into the QF voting signal, extending the impact of Gitcoin‚Äôs Allo Protocol. Additionally, we are focused on exploring the templating of our novel allocation mechanism - TQF to allow for any community running a QF round on Gitcoin to experiment with their own signals.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Conflicts of Interest:</strong><br>\nNo conflicts of interest. All round operations team members will ensure transparency and fairness in the selection and evaluation process.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-token-engineering-the-superchain/19115\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-token-engineering-the-superchain/19115","pubDate":"Sun, 14 Jul 2024 16:11:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19115"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-token-engineering-the-superchain/19115.rss","#text":"[GG21 Community Round Proposal] Token Engineering the Superchain"},"filter":false},{"title":"[GG21 Community Round Proposal] Regen Coordi-NATION üå±","dc:creator":"MontyMerlin","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/b/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998\" title=\"Regen CoordiNATION Banner\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998_2_690x107.jpeg\" alt=\"Regen CoordiNATION Banner\" data-base62-sha1=\"qrGL9zjwdhcev3aBVL0fLxW1N4A\" width=\"690\" height=\"107\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998_2_690x107.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998_2_1035x160.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998_2_1380x214.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C8C1AC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-regen-coordi-nation-round-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#the-regen-coordi-nation-round-1\"></a>The Regen Coordi-NATION Round</h2>\n<p>The Regen Coordi-NATION Round is a proposal for a GG21 community round centered on the themes of<a href=\"https://jessykate.medium.com/coordi-nations-a-new-institutional-structure-for-global-cooperation-3ef38d6e2cfa\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Coordi-nations</a>,<a href=\"https://www.thealternative.org.uk/dailyalternative/2019/5/13/what-is-cosmo-localism-and-why-we-think-its-a-game-changer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Cosmo-localism</a>,<a href=\"https://darkmatterlabs.org/Bioregional-Financing-Facilities\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Bio-Regionalism</a>, and<a href=\"https://www.regenerative.fi/insights/what-is-refi-regenerative-finance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Regenerative Finance (ReFi)</a>.

OpenCivics Grants Program which has run two previous rounds.\n<ul>\n<li>Our first round offered an experimental context to evaluate the benefits of a round in which all grantees were members in a non-rivalrous network of innovators.</li>\n<li>Our second round offered an experimental context to evaluate impact attestations and a hypothesis that larger grants would support more significant impacts which could be more easily documented and attested.</li>\n<li>Our third round offers a new experimental context to evaluate how grant funding can be utilized to catalyze experimentation in on-chain collaboration and to develop open source civic engagement research that can be compiled and shared as a public good.</li>\n<li>We will continue to iterate based on insights from our last round, including a smaller matching cap and an exploration of solutions to process credit card donations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"team-running-this-round-5\" class=\"anchor\"

mission and essential intents by supporting open source research that directly empowers communities to utilize web3 coordination tools for civic engagement and collective action.</li>\n<li>This research will be shared as a public good in the form of educational resources and foundational explorations of new approaches and utilities that support both civic innovators and local community organizers.</li>\n<li>The research we hope to see emerge from this round will increase accessibility to web3 tooling for community organizers engaged in civic initiatives. This applied research will  serve communities‚Äô autonomous self-organization and expand blockchain network effects by broadening the scope of how web3 tools can be applied the context of civics and community organizing.</li>\n<li>Making web3 infrastructure for civic engagement more accessible through documented case studies, curricula, and research will help communities directly coordinate to meet their own needs instead of having to rely on large centralized bureaucracies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-7\"></a>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial matching pool is currently 3.9 ETH.</li>\n<li>The matching pool is anticipated to be $60,000 - 70,000 USDC, fundraised through DeCiv Fund, Gitcoin, and Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Funding address: OpenCivics.eth (Mainnet Multi-sig) or 0x4D652fB5C0119650a5563B978105D05F8333b44d (Arbitrum One).</li>\n<li>We have a clear plan in place for future fundraising, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring matching fund partnerships with Arbitrum, Celo, Optimism, Ethereum Foundation, Octant and other social impact foundations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"advisors-for-this-round-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#advisors-for-this-round-8\"></a>Advisors for This Round:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Renee DAOs: Lobby3, Talent DAO, DeSci\n<ul>\n<li>Renee ran the first two OpenCivics Rounds and has been a leader in experimental funding mechanisms for public goods development and DeSci research.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"funding-mechanism-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-mechanism-9\"></a>Funding Mechanism:</h3>\n<p>We are using quadratic funding on Allo Protocol because it supports the collective evaluation of which research initiatives would be maximally beneficial to the broader regen web3 systems change community. We are also requiring grantees to direct grant funding to multi-signature wallets to ensure that the utilization of grant funds is democratic and transparent. We will continue to utilize Karma Gap for impact attestations.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-size-and-engagement-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-10\"></a>Community Size and Engagement:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The OpenCivics community consists of approximately 133 members and our social media following is 1,300.</li>\n<li>Previous rounds received donations from over unique 800 donors</li>\n<li>Previous rounds received $18,934 in crowdfunding</li>\n<li>Funded projects will likely be small research pods of no more than 10 individuals</li>\n<li>We estimate 10-20 grantees will be eligible for the round</li>\n<li>OpenCivics will continue to develop our impact attestation program with Karma Gap and our open impact schema development within the still-emerging Quadratic Funding Impact Alliance\n<ul>\n<li>Grantees in this round will be encouraged to identify research-oriented attestation schema to document their impact (how many people read, commented on, or shared their research, how many citations their research synthesized, how many subsequent publications cite their research, etc).</li>\n<li>Grantees will be required to share their research findings in an open forum on X in order to be eligible for future funding.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"type-of-projects-to-fund-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#type-of-projects-to-fund-11\"></a>Type of Projects to Fund:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We aim to fund projects that are developing open source research into various forms of civic innovation and civic engagement, ranging from:\n<ul>\n<li>Impact and contribution measurement, reporting, and valuation</li>\n<li>Commons governance, self-organization, and decision-making</li>\n<li>Collaborative knowledge management, learning and sensemaking</li>\n<li>Open protocols, community templates, and coordination infrastructure</li>\n<li>Community currencies, cooperatives, and alternative economics</li>\n<li>Decentralized project management, roles, and certifications</li>\n<li>Resource allocation, funding mechanisms, and funding sources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"estimated-number-of-eligible-grantees-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#estimated-number-of-eligible-grantees-12\"></a>Estimated Number of Eligible Grantees:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We believe that 10-20 grantees will be eligible to apply for this round.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"impact-assessment-plan-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-plan-13\"></a>Impact Assessment Plan:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We intend to assess grantee impact through Hypercerts and GAP.</li>\n<li>Our detailed plan includes\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluating applications based on listed milestones for low, medium, and large funding outcomes</li>\n<li>Conducting three milestone reporting office hour sessions for grantees</li>\n<li>Providing 1x1 mentorship and support for impact attestation and reporting</li>\n<li>Conducting an open grantee impact showcase before GG22 for grantees to report back to the community what they accomplished with their grant funding</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"additional-considerations-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#additional-considerations-14\"></a>Additional Considerations:</h3>\n<p>Community members should also consider OpenCivics‚Äô commitment to learning and growing round over round. This upcoming round, we will implement the feedback we received from grantees and donors in the previous round. To make our round more accessible, we will be exploring a partnership with viaPrize in an attempt to provide matching pool-eligible credit card donations from non-web3 users. We will also be lowering the matching cap to ensure a more equitable distribution of matching funds to grantees. These innovations demonstrate our commitment to learning and growing in public and continuing to support the development and maturation of the quadratic funding and public goods ecosystems.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"potential-conflicts-of-interest-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#potential-conflicts-of-interest-15\"></a>Potential Conflicts of Interest:</h3>\n<p>Because of the collaborative nature of the OpenCivics Consortium, round operators and Stewards may engage in collaboration with grantees to support their research initiatives and collate their research. To avoid a conflict of interest, round operators agree to not receive payment from any funds distributed during this round.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>\n<p>Public goods are good.</p>\n<p>In Us We Trust,</p>\n<p>Benjamin, Patricia, and Spencer <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/seedling.png?v=12\" title=\":seedling:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":seedling:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/heart_hands.png?v=12\" title=\":heart_hands:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":heart_hands:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/handshake.png?v=12\" title=\":handshake:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":handshake:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12\" title=\":sparkles:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":sparkles:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19111\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19111","pubDate":"Sun, 14 Jul 2024 04:25:16 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19111"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19111.rss","#text":"[GG21 Community Round Proposal] OpenCivics Collaborative Research Round"},"filter":false},{"title":"[GG21 Community Round Proposal] the 1st Asia Round with Gitcoin","dc:creator":"HazelHu","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<h3><a name=\"name-or-topictheme-of-proposed-round-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#name-or-topictheme-of-proposed-round-1\"></a>Name (or Topic/Theme) of Proposed Round</h3>\n<p><strong>Asia Round</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"social-handle-of-your-organization-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#social-handle-of-your-organization-2\"></a>Social Handle of Your Organization:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/GCCofCommons\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@GCCofCommons</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://x.com/Pagodasia\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@Pagodasia</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"eligibility-criteria-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#eligibility-criteria-3\"></a>Eligibility Criteria:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Grant must be in support of or directly advance <strong>the Asian public goods ecosystem</strong>; or at least one founder identifies him/herself as Asian.

anti-censorship. We believe this embodies Gitcoin‚Äôs mission to ‚Äúcreate technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund, and protect what matters.‚Äù Asia‚Äôs vast community and user base will also best ensure Gitcoin‚Äôs intents of network effect, community-first approach, and financial longevity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-7\"></a>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The matching pool is anticipated to be 25k-50k USD.

Team members will screen projects that meet the eligibility criteria, and then the matching amount for each project will be calculated based on the donations received by that project. However, the maximum matching amount for any single project should not exceed 10% of the total matching pool.</p>\n<p><strong>Signal booster:</strong>  Inspired by the Gitcoin Citizen Round and in order to better combat Sybil attacks and introducing expert opinions, we will allocate $5000 from the matching pool and form a group of 10 people selected from our advisors, sponsors, community partners, and the GCC Standing Voting Committee. Each member will be given $500 to distribute to the Asia round projects and share their allocation strategies publicly. This design, combined with community donations, will determine the final amount of funds each Asia round project will receive from the matching pool based on QF mechanism.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-size-and-engagement-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-10\"></a>Community Size and Engagement:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In this round - we are capturing the network of two major communities 1) GCC and 2) Pagoda.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GCC is short for global Chinese community of Universal Digital Commons.  We have a core community of over 2,000 people distributed across X, Telegram, and WeChat. Additionally, we have partnerships with 15+ Chinese-speaking communities and media outlets, reaching an audience of 10k+ people. In the past 4 community rounds that we initiated, <strong>we mobilized a total of around 8k individual donors, raising over $58k from them.</strong> This is a testament to our impact.

In addition, this community grant promotes open-source bioregional projects, which align with the sustainability goals of Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>For the infrastructure development track we will insist on using the Ethereum blockchain, thus furthering the goal of Gitcoin to advance the growth and adoption of the Ethereum Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The documentation track brings together projects in bioregional blockchain applications, strengthening Gitcoin‚Äôs schelling point status in this particular niche. Moreover, the documentation efforts will surface individuals with key skills and achievements in this domain.</p>\n<p>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool: We have already received a $50,000 grant from GCC, which we invested in management infrastructure. We are now actively pursuing new funds to support the development of P2P documentation and enhance our marketing and exposure efforts. The matching pool is anticipated to be fundraised through partnerships with bioregional organizations and blockchain innovators. P2P Foundation is currently engaged in funding operations with several leading organizations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Funding Address:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>eth:0xa386C179424D8493Ed9A6259F0C3Cc2b941Fd4fB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>oeth:0x25e5d6504F529ec97B7E9A59BE89cCa1a83a0721</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>arb1:0xa8c871B9298A515845233a245FF59cA7f30eF434</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advisors for This Round:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advisor 1:\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Michel Bauwens</li>\n<li>Relevant Experience: A theorist, writer, and speaker on the subject of peer-to-peer economy, with a focus on the commons-based approach.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Advisor 2:\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Tiberius Brastaviceanu</li>\n<li>Relevant Experience: A leader in the field of decentralized collaboration, with extensive experience in open-source project development.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Funding Mechanism: We are using quadratic funding because it allows for community-driven support, ensuring that a broad base of contributors can influence the allocation of funds, which aligns with the decentralized and participatory nature of our bioregional documentation project. In addition, we will be working on integrating Gitcoin Passport.</p>\n<p>Community Size and Engagement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Community Size: The P2P Foundation has grown to encompass a vast, worldwide community over the past 20 years. As a network of networks, the size of collaborations is variable. The P2P Foundation is unique in that it builds bridges and connections amongst many different subcultures and projects in the p2p space.</li>\n<li>Tangible Metrics: The wiki consists of 25k documentary entries that had been consulted already a billion times by 2020.</li>\n<li>Type of Projects to Fund: Projects that document bioregional activities and innovations using blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and traceability.</li>\n<li>Estimated Number of Eligible Grantees: We estimate that around 50 grantees will be eligible to apply for this round.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Impact Assessment Plan: The P2P Foundation Wiki has evolved as a very reputable information source for everything P2P, as a result of almost 20 years of curation done by Michel Bauwens, with help from other collaborators. We will use Hypercerts to establish the impact of the P2P Foundation. Moreover, the bioregional blockchain initiatives that we are planning to map and document will also be encouraged to build their impact assessment on Hypercents, and further to build their portable identity and reputation on Karma GAP, enabling them to unlock future opportunities.</p>\n<p>We also plan to to include regular reporting, community feedback mechanisms, and independent audits to measure and evaluate the success and impact of the grantees over successive rounds.</p>\n<p>Additional Considerations: Community members should consider the potential for creating a comprehensive and transparent documentation system that could serve as a model for other bioregional and commons-based projects globally.</p>\n<p>Potential Conflicts of Interest: There are no known conflicts of interest. All round operations team members have no direct involvement in any projects that will participate to receive a grant.</p>\n<p>Primary Resource:</p>\n<p>The P2P wiki will serve as the decentralized, open-source home for storing bioregional data, using blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and traceable documentation. The P2P Foundation aims to build a comprehensive and accessible library for all things bioregional, ensuring that cutting-edge technology and concepts are readily available to the community.

By removing this governance step, we can streamline the process and distribute matching funds more quickly to grant recipients.</p>\n<p>The ratification vote has served an important role in maintaining transparency and community approval for past funding rounds.

We will still publish results but won‚Äôt have to formally request the funds from the Matching Pool in order to do so.</p>\n<p>The Gitcoin team has shown a strong commitment to transparency and fairness in fund distribution. Our upgraded methodologies and tools, such as the cluster-matching quadratic funding mechanism (COCM) and Passport‚Äôs model-based detection system, have significantly enhanced our ability to allocate funds objectively and resist sybil attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>By removing ratification, we can realize the following benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster payouts to grant recipients after each round concludes</li>\n<li>Reduced overhead and operational strain on the Gitcoin team</li>\n<li>Implicit trust in Gitcoin‚Äôs processes and methodologies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will continue to publicly disclose all relevant data, methodologies and funding calculations for each round.

From multiple meetings with various city officials, collecting the data on city‚Äôs grants programs, analysing it, presenting at <a href=\"https://innovation.eurasia.undp.org/urban-transformation/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UNDP</a> conference for cities, researching the needed tech stacks and potential integrations, to narrowing down the how and where we would use QF.</p>\n<p>Also, I applied for EF Next Billion with this project in mind. Not only the <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/24/next-billion-cohort4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">project was selected</a> as one of the very few, but it got additional funding for the purpose of building the app.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-are-we-building-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-are-we-building-3\"></a>What are we building?</h2>\n<p>Ethereum has a number of protocols and apps that are both mature enough and solve a need a city has. We are building an open-source app customised for cities, which will serve as an interface to the Ethereum ecosystem of apps and protocols. Premier example of these, and the first one we want to offer access to is Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>One of the most important things cities do, is allocating money for public goods. Whether they need direct grants, QF, retro funding or something else, they could and should use Allo protocol. We intend on running our grant programs on Allo protocol.</p>\n<p>Gitcoin has built Grants Stack for the purpose of providing an easy and powerful interface for using Allo protocol. While using Allo protocol is a non-brainer for us, for Grants Stack we have some obstacles to use it as-is. It comes with its own set of features which are not directly usable by cities in their interaction with non-web3-native citizens, while some features which are needed are missing. We want to use as much of Grants stack as possible, but we have yet to look deeper and decide how to do it.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the things we‚Äôll probably need to do differently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we need to offer users an in-app non-custodial wallet with no need to manage private keys (we plan to use Cometh Connect for this)</li>\n<li>we need to offer simple in-app onramp solution which works well with local banks, cards, currencies and KYC requirements.</li>\n<li>we need to abstract away the cryptocurrency used, so that users who top up euros, see euro balance (which means we need to use euro stablecoin)</li>\n<li>we need to make it in local language with local legal documents</li>\n<li>we need to be able to support different types of grants than what is currently supported by Gitcoin. (Eg. citizens propose projects, but the city gets the money and executes)</li>\n<li>we need to use city-specific tools and available data for sybil resistance, and possibly for KYC</li>\n<li>we need to only show the rounds which a citizen can participate in</li>\n<li>we might need to integrate a forum for discussions on the rounds</li>\n<li>we might need to integrate an option for donors to vote on disbursement of funds after the execution</li>\n<li>we might need to allow for documents submission</li>\n<li>we might need to add additional types of fields in the submission forms</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"where-are-we-now-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#where-are-we-now-4\"></a>Where are we now?</h2>\n<p>To advance [or help implement] this project I was recently selected as part of the Ethereum Foundation‚Äôs Next Billion Fellowship Program.  With their advisory and financial support we will build a minimum viable app for the purpose of running one specific QF grant round in Split, Croatia. Unfortunately, this funding is limited and besides building the app for pilot, doesn‚Äôt cover much more.</p>\n<p>Also, there are multiple grant programs with multiple grant rounds which we could run through the app as well. We could just run the pilot, or we could build such an MVP, which would be usable by any city or other institution to run local grant programs on Ethereum and Allo. We have already started talks with UNDP about this possibility. They work directly with more than 100 cities and national governments, and thourgh their network, we could reach more users quickly.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-do-we-expect-from-the-pilot-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-do-we-expect-from-the-pilot-5\"></a>What do we expect from the pilot?</h2>\n<p>The pilot will run in Split in September 2024. with a goal of at least 30 proposals and 1500 citizens donating (1% of population).</p>\n<p>These citizens will be onboarded on Ethereum and Gitcoin.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-do-we-expect-to-achieve-with-additional-funding-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-do-we-expect-to-achieve-with-additional-funding-6\"></a>What do we expect to achieve with additional funding?</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"june-2024-november-2024-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#june-2024-november-2024-7\"></a>June 2024 - November 2024</h3>\n<p>We will create an app and run a successful pilot in the city of Split during the fellowship ().

Thank you to my co-author, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a>, and for the key inputs from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sejalrekhan\">@sejalrekhan</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov\">@Sov</a>. As we continue to move forward and iterate on the grants program, it‚Äôs important to take stock on learnings and community feedback to inform the decision we make ahead of the remainder of this year and as we look into 2025.</p>\n<p>Below I am sharing a summary of the post, with the link to the detailed Mirror post for those who want to take some time for a deep dive.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Duration of GG20: <strong>April 23 - May 7, 2024</strong></li>\n<li>Key Learnings: Governance, Grantee Experience, Donor Experience, Operations</li>\n<li>Future Plans: Continuous improvement and innovation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Gitcoin Grants, a community-driven funding initiative, has facilitated over 3,500 projects with $60M distributed since 2019. GG20, running from April 23 to May 7, 2024, saw a $1.6M matching pool, the election of a Community Council, a protocol upgrade, and an improved sybil resistance strategy.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-learnings-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#key-learnings-2\"></a>Key Learnings:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Governance:</strong> The new Community Round governance process required proposals reviewed and voted on by a newly elected Community Council. The top five rounds received an extra $25K each in matching funds. Moving forward, Gitcoin plans to include more rounds in the marketing efforts, above and beyond of the top 5 chosen for extra matching funds.</li>\n<li><strong>Grantee Experience:</strong> Improvements in communication and platform navigation led to an 81% satisfaction rate among grantees (which met our key success metric). Positive feedback highlighted the need for better marketing resources, a more user-friendly grantee portal, and clearer guidance on creating strong grant proposals. Future plans include enhancing resources, such as Canva kits, and providing streamlined application processes for returning grantees.</li>\n<li><strong>Donor Experience:</strong> Despite a decrease in the number of donors, each donor contributed more, leading to a $27K increase in crowdfunding. Focus on retaining first-time donors and simplifying the donation process is essential. Strategies include potentially collecting donor emails for updates and making the donation process more user-friendly, especially for new donors. Running all rounds on Arbitrum and partnering with ThankARB enhanced the donor experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Operations:</strong> The introduction of decentralized review processes with ‚ÄúTeam Tiger‚Äù and the use of the AI-based tool ‚ÄúChecker‚Äù improved transparency and efficiency. Clearer instructions and better support for grantees were identified as areas for further improvement. Future plans include refining the review process, enhancing support during the application phase, and expediting payout timelines by improving the QF/COCM calculator app and pre-approving matching results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"moving-forward-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#moving-forward-3\"></a>Moving Forward:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marketing</strong>: Expand marketing efforts to include more community rounds, providing broader exposure and support to teams beyond the top five. This approach aims to ensure a more inclusive and impactful experience for all participants.</li>\n<li><strong>Grantee Support:</strong> Enhance resources to guide grantees in successfully marketing their grants. Improve the grantee portal to be more user-friendly and easier to navigate. Provide clearer resources on creating strong grant proposals and consider rolling applications for returning grantees to streamline the process. Finding ways to build a stronger builder community centered around mentorship, growth and education.</li>\n<li><strong>Donor Retention:</strong> Implement strategies to retain donors by collecting their emails for updates and exploring ways to allow grantees to email their donors. Make the donation process more user-friendly and continue promoting the popular collections feature to make the experience more social and engaging.</li>\n<li><strong>Operations:</strong> Continue refining the review process and expediting payout timelines. Improve support for grantees during the application phase and enhance project impact reporting. Maintain a fair and transparent process by not making team member wallet addresses public and focusing on the core mission of supporting open-source software and digital public goods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gitcoin is committed to evolving its grants program to be more resilient, inclusive, and impactful. The insights from GG20 will guide future strategies, ensuring continuous improvement and innovation as we move forward to GG21 and GG22. As we move into a multi-mechanism future, further experimentation and expansion will be enabled as we continue to evolve.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitcoin.mirror.xyz/GyT9ZE_PuopPVwSlgRIF-o7cm_ZTCqcXBKXMCNkc1Sk\">Read the detailed post here</a></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-reflections-insights-and-future-plans/19045\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-reflections-insights-and-future-plans/19045","pubDate":"Wed, 26 Jun 2024 11:04:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19045"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-reflections-insights-and-future-plans/19045.rss","#text":"GG20 Reflections, Insights, and Future Plans"},"filter":false},{"title":"Onchain Capital Allocation Handbook","dc:creator":"owocki","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>At ETHcc this year I will be launching a new book entitled the <strong>Onchain Capital Allocation Handbook</strong>.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863\" title=\"GQ3Ki7kWMAAmmUD\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_338x499.jpeg\" alt=\"GQ3Ki7kWMAAmmUD\" data-base62-sha1=\"ndxEc7u8sxgMm5BUm5wBFCxyUv1\" width=\"338\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_338x499.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_507x748.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a2b9e77f77954f1bb62613dc78220d614aeef863_2_676x998.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ADA9A1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://twitter.com/owocki\">DM me on twitter</a> if you would like an invite.

If you‚Äôve ever paid bills, taxes, or repaid friends for a meal, you‚Äôve allocated capital.</p>\n<p>Capital allocation can become a full time job: governments and grant-making organi- zations spend vast amounts of time and money figuring out the process, logistics, and decision-making involved in allocating capital. At scale, capital allocation inevitably be- comes mired in gatekeeping, rivalrous decision making, and lack of transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>Crypto with its programmable smart contracts, present incredible advantages towards allocating capital in an efficient, effective, and transparent manner.</p>\n<p>The internet revolutionized how information was distributed in society. If crypto succeeds in revolutionizing how society distributes scarce resources, it follows that it will upend, and improve, how we do capital allocation.</p>\n<p>What if we could solve coordination failures with capital allocation? What if we could create better, more sovereign, collective action? How might we bring centuries old capital allocation strategies onchain? Can we invent new onchain capital allocation strategies that were not possible before Ethereum?</p>\n<p>The next horizon is hard to see alone, but by exploring it together, we can grasp it.</p>\n<p>This book is a celebration of the design space, and your no-hype resource to understand- ing the emergent pluralistic ecology of capital allocation developing in the web3 space. I‚Äôve enjoyed putting together this handbook of the latest and greatest in what‚Äôs possible. It is my great pleasure to have a front row seat to this movement as a member of Gitcoin. My hope for this book is that I can pay it forward to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/onchain-capital-allocation-handbook/19041\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/onchain-capital-allocation-handbook/19041","pubDate":"Tue, 25 Jun 2024 19:58:35 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19041"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/onchain-capital-allocation-handbook/19041.rss","#text":"Onchain Capital Allocation Handbook"},"filter":false},{"title":"The Grants Program Canvas + Playbook: An open source tool for easy grant-making","dc:creator":"Viriya","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>Yesterday we launched the Grants Program Canvas and Playbook!

In total, 3M GTC is requested. This represents 3% of the supply of GTC and is aligned with (or below) industry standards for team allocations.

Most of the team that was present in 2021 are no longer active contributors, and the vast majority (80%) of current contributors do not have any token grants.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"potential-risks-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#potential-risks-3\"></a>Potential Risks</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Operational overhead\n<ul>\n<li>This will be part of the Grants Lab budgeting process and we will use available tools on the market (Liquifi or Hedgey or Gnosis Safe) to minimize overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How can we avoid negative impacts to the organization?\n<ul>\n<li>Tokens, once earned (including vesting), are wholly owned by the contributor and they have the freedom to do whatever they want with them.

We have some exciting updates to share regarding the evolution of our organization as we transition into Gitcoin 2.1 and what that means right now, and for the future we‚Äôre creating.The following message has been shared with our core DAO contributors and I wanted to extend context to the broader community on some of the recent developments we‚Äôre making to our org.

This mission requires improved execution and sharper focus to navigate the fluctuations of the market‚Äîthrough bull runs, bear markets, and beyond.</p>\n<p>To align our strategic goals with the evolving demands of our industry, we are making some significant changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dissolving the Ecosystem Collective: We will concentrate our efforts where they count the most.</li>\n<li>Focusing solely on our Grants Program and Product: Levelling up our leadership in grant-making technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The primary goals of these decisions are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus our energy on the initiatives that will keep us at the forefront of the Grants and Grant tech ecosystem, increase GMV, and position ourselves as thought leaders.</li>\n<li>Work towards financial sustainability and extend our operational runway beyond current projections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The competitive landscape has evolved, with multiple new players entering the market. To remain at the forefront, we must adapt and innovate rapidly. This means developing highly configurable, custom solutions that cater to the specific needs of our community and partners. We are dedicating more energy to these key areas and focusing our resources on onboarding every web3 grants program into Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>In line with our proactive approach, we are hyperfocused on making adjustments that concentrate us on the greatest impact and alignment for our mission. As Passport spins out and we streamline the Grants Lab and Ecosystem Collective teams, we aim continue to strengthen  and position ourselves for future success. We intend to move more work into the community, leveraging their expertise and enthusiasm to deliver updates across Gitcoin more efficiently.</p>\n<p>We understand that these changes come with their challenges and will impact some of our valued contributors. We are committed to providing financial support and assistance to those affected during this transition, helping them find new roles within the industry or beyond.</p>\n<p>We want to assure all community members, stewards, and token holders that these changes have been taken very seriously and carefully considered. Our intention is to make Gitcoin as operationally efficient as possible while continuously bolstering our efforts to grow adoption for our suite of products, and knowledge base, further ensuring their longevity.</p>\n<p>I want to thank and show my genuine gratitude for the work that the Ecosystem Collective team has poured into the heart and soul of Gitcoin, and I‚Äôm optimistic that we‚Äôll have further opportunities to work together again in the future.
