With just three weeks left in Q3 and a pivotal DevCon on the horizon, we‚Äôre honing in on our focus to ensure we‚Äôre delivering impactful solutions, leading innovation in our space, and of course capturing that all important GMV.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs the game plan as we finish up September and transition into Q4:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Interim Indexer Solution &amp; High-Priority Builds:</strong> We‚Äôll continue pushing forward with our interim indexer solution to reduce errors and resolve missing data issues quickly until we implement the new indexer in Q4, and also finish up support for the SUNNYs customer build with Optimism. Additionally, we‚Äôll address high-priority customer requests from Filecoin to ensure we‚Äôre meeting their needs effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Revamping Checker with Allo Starter Kit:</strong> Our next major task is building with Allo Starter Kit by integrating the Checker experience into the user flow. This enhancement will streamline our offerings and provide a more cohesive experience for our users, while also letting us take ASK for a spin rebuilding a high value feature that we can maintain easily in future.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Rebuilding Direct Grants:</strong> We‚Äôre excited to announce that we‚Äôll be revamping our Direct Grants mechanism. This upgrade will include significant improvements to payouts and introduce an impact metrics feature, addressing key areas for enhancement and ensuring we can build with ASK on one of our core mechanisms ahead of DevCon.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Introducing Multichain Checkout Bridging:</strong> For Gitcoin Grants 22, we‚Äôre prioritizing the development of a bridging solution for multichain checkout. This feature addresses the biggest pain point from GG21 and will provide a seamless experience for our users. I know this has been a long time customer feature request, so I‚Äôm very excited to ship it.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Mint Attestations ‚Äì A Revenue and Engagement Opportunity:</strong> Given the market downturn, we‚Äôve decided to make a strategic bet with Mint Attestations, allowing users to mint and share their donation during checkout for a small additional fee. This feature aims to create new revenue streams, bring some extra delight to the donation experience and reinforce Gitcoin‚Äôs position as a leading attestor in the open-source funding ecosystem. Passport is almost profitable with attestations so I‚Äôm excited to see how much revenue we can drive with this bet.</p>\n<p>Our renewed focus reflects our commitment to delivering value and innovation. Each of these initiatives is designed to enhance our platform, future proof our technology, respond to customer needs, and position Gitcoin as a forward-thinking leader in our field.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm incredibly excited about what we‚Äôre building and the positive impact it will have. Let‚Äôs continue to channel our energy and passion into these efforts, and as always, thank you for your hard work and dedication. Together, we‚Äôre driving the future of open-source funding and capital allocation!</p>\n<p>Onward and upward!</p>\n<p>Kat, Head of Product at Gitcoin Grants Lab</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/september-product-memo/19377\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/september-product-memo/19377","pubDate":"Wed, 18 Sep 2024 14:05:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19377"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/september-product-memo/19377.rss","#text":"September Product Memo"},"filter":false},{"title":"[GG21 Retrospective] Token Engineering the Superchain","dc:creator":"Moni_boo","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p><strong>Token Engineering the Superchain Grants Round: Summer/Fall 2024</strong> was designed as a <a href=\"https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/token-engineering-the-superchain-8a8acdca826b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dual-phase initiative</a> to advance token engineering within the Optimism and broader Superchain ecosystems. The first phase, completed in August 2024, was a Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) round aimed at funding high-potential projects. The second phase, a Retroactive Funding round, is scheduled for later this year to reward grantees based on completed milestones and demonstrated impact.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"grant-round-objectives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#grant-round-objectives-2\"></a>Grant Round Objectives</h1>\n<p>The primary objectives of this grant round were to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advance Token Engineering field:</strong> support projects that demonstrate potential to advance token engineering field and contribute to the OP and broader Superchain ecosystems.</li>\n<li><strong>Drive Superchain impact:</strong> support initiatives with the potential to create measurable, positive effects within Optimism and its broader ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Prepare for Retroactive funding round:</strong> set the foundation for a follow-up Retro Round using Gitcoin‚Äôs RetroPGF platform, which will reward projects based on the milestone achievement and demonstrated impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"grant-round-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#grant-round-overview-3\"></a>Grant Round Overview</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Total donations:</strong> $ 5,792.59</li>\n<li><strong>Number of contributions:</strong> 914</li>\n<li><strong>Average contribution:</strong> $ 16.6</li>\n<li><strong>Unique donors:</strong> 349</li>\n<li><strong>Participating projects:</strong> 18</li>\n<li><strong>Average grant size:</strong> $ 3,333</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The round focused on funding projects with strong alignment to both token engineering and OP ecosystem, selecting projects based on their potential to drive significant impact.</p>\n<p>The grant round targeted projects advancing token engineering through various means, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tooling:</strong> building tools and infrastructure that enhance token engineering practices within the Superchain.</li>\n<li><strong>Research and Education:</strong> conducting research and creating educational resources to expand the understanding and application of token engineering.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Infrastructure and Consulting Services:</strong> developing frameworks and offering services that support the community‚Äôs capacity to apply token engineering principles effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"setup-and-management-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#setup-and-management-4\"></a>Setup and Management</h1>\n<p>The TQF round built on the lessons learned from previous rounds, further refining the <a href=\"https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF)</a> approach. This round also introduced new criteria for evaluating the potential impact within the OP ecosystem. By incorporating token engineering expertise signals (TEA NFT credentials, $TEC holdings) and boosting them with Optimism Delegate, Badgeholder and $OP holdings as signals, TQF ensured funding aligned with stakeholders knowledgeable in both token engineering and OP ecosystems.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"challenges-and-solutions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#challenges-and-solutions-5\"></a>Challenges and Solutions</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Volume of applications:</strong> despite a more focused round, the unexpected volume of last-minute applications created challenges in evaluation. To address this, future rounds will consider increasing evaluation capacity by engaging more reviewers to manage the load more effectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Superchain alignment:</strong> many projects struggled to clearly articulate both token engineering relevance and OP ecosystem impact. We supported these grantees through application revisions but recognized that more upfront guidance might be needed in future rounds to help projects fully align with our goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Time management and appeals:</strong> the short timeline between application deadlines and the start of the donation period, combined with managing late appeals, stretched resources thin. Moving forward, we might consider separating the closing of applications from the donation period to better manage both processes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"outcomes-and-statistics-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outcomes-and-statistics-6\"></a>Outcomes and Statistics</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"overall-payouts-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overall-payouts-7\"></a>Overall Payouts</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Grant name</th>\n<th>Total Funding (DAI)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Pairwise: Simplifying Choices, Amplifying Voices</td>\n<td>9000.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inverter Network</td>\n<td>8928.09</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Superchain Innovation and Competition</td>\n<td>8239.55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bonding Curve Research Group (BCRG)</td>\n<td>5227.51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Swaps as a Mechanism for Superchain alignment</td>\n<td>4445.47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Treegens DAO</td>\n<td>3732.94</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Valueverse Labs</td>\n<td>3600.49</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TPRO Network</td>\n<td>3090.28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow State (Streaming Quadratic Funding)</td>\n<td>2963.42</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GovGraph</td>\n<td>2285.61</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EVMcrispr</td>\n<td>2159.55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Breadchain Cooperative</td>\n<td>1749.53</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1Hive Gardens</td>\n<td>1398.04</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Change Code: Permissionless Results-Based Fund</td>\n<td>930.92</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Super DCA: The Time-Weighted Average Market Ma‚Ä¶</td>\n<td>841.54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Simplicity Group</td>\n<td>574.94</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regen Atlas</td>\n<td>501.28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eisodos Multimodal</td>\n<td>330.86</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"tegr4-vs-token-engineering-the-superchain-project-funding-changes-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tegr4-vs-token-engineering-the-superchain-project-funding-changes-8\"></a>TEGR4 vs Token Engineering the Superchain- Project &amp; Funding Changes</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>TEGR4</th>\n<th>Token Engineering the Superchain</th>\n<th>Difference</th>\n<th>% Change</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Total projects</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>-14</td>\n<td>-44%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recurring projects</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>22%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>New projects</td>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>-16</td>\n<td>-70%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unique donors</td>\n<td>554</td>\n<td>349</td>\n<td>-205</td>\n<td>-37%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total crowdfunded</td>\n<td>$9,363.07</td>\n<td>$5,792.59</td>\n<td>-3570.48</td>\n<td>-38%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total contributions</td>\n<td>1,579</td>\n<td>914</td>\n<td>-665</td>\n<td>-42%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Average contribution</td>\n<td>$ 16.9</td>\n<td>$ 16.6</td>\n<td>-0.3</td>\n<td>-2%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li><strong>Total projects</strong>: in the previous round (TEGR4), we had 32 projects, while the current round focused on OP/Superchain had 18 projects, reflecting a more selective approach aligned with OP ecosystem goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Unique donors:</strong> the previous round had 554 donors, whereas this round saw a drop to 349, likely due to the more focused nature of the round.</li>\n<li><strong>Crowdfunding amount:</strong> TEGR4 raised $9,363.07, while the current round raised $5,792.59, reflecting the narrower focus but also the strong support within the OP/Superchain community.</li>\n<li><strong>New projects:</strong> in the previous round, there were 23 new projects, whereas this round saw only 7 new projects, as many returning projects already had ties to the OP/Superchain.</li>\n<li><strong>Average contribution:</strong> both rounds had similar average contributions, around $16.9, indicating stable community engagement per donor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-9\"></a>Conclusion:</h3>\n<p>While participation numbers and funding were lower compared to previous rounds, this was expected due to the more selective approach.

To address this in future rounds, we will:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide more detailed, upfront guidance and templates during the application phase to help grantees align their project goals with both token engineering and Superchain impact.</li>\n<li>Host pre-application workshops or AMAs to clarify expectations and offer Q&amp;A opportunities for prospective applicants.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Managing last-minute applications:</strong> the high volume of last-minute applications created a challenge in ensuring thorough evaluation. In future rounds, we will:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Expand the reviewer pool and ensure more time is allocated between the application deadline and the start of the donation period.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Grantee marketing support</strong>: several grantees did not fully leverage the opportunity to promote their projects and attract contributions. To improve this, we will:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Offer marketing toolkits and resources earlier in the process, including sample social media posts, graphics, and outreach strategies.</li>\n<li>Provide incentives for projects to engage with the community to boost visibility and increase their chances of success.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Refining impact metrics and evaluation criteria</strong>: setting and tracking meaningful metrics has proven to be a challenge in terms of capturing both short-term milestones and long-term impact. To improve this, we will:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement clearer milestone-setting requirements that include both quantitative and qualitative impact metrics (e.g., community engagement, adoption rates, technical milestones).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This focus on refining guidance, streamlining processes, and enhancing grantee support will help us to improve our future rounds and create greater alignment between grantee projects and community priorities.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-successes-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#key-successes-11\"></a>Key Successes</h1>\n<p>Key Successes from the 2024 TQF Round:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strong alignment with Superchain objectives:</strong> despite being a more focused round, the projects selected demonstrated clear potential to impact both token engineering and the broader OP ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimized use of Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF):</strong> this round successfully built upon the TQF model, incorporating expertise signals from Optimism delegates and badge holders. This enhanced the quality of decision-making and ensured funding aligned with community priorities, demonstrating the power of fine-tuned quadratic funding mechanisms.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased returning grantees:</strong> we saw a 22% increase in returning grantees, which indicates that previous participants continue to see value in our rounds. These returning projects showed strong progress and further alignment with OP ecosystem goals, solidifying their role as key contributors to both token engineering and Superchain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-preparing-for-retroactive-funding-round-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#next-steps-preparing-for-retroactive-funding-round-12\"></a>Next Steps: Preparing for Retroactive Funding Round</h1>\n<p>The Retro Round, scheduled for October- December, 2024 will use Gitcoin‚Äôs RetroPGF platform to allocate additional funding based on demonstrated impact.

Ecosystem-Specific Venture Funding</h2>\n<p>Convertible grants are a hybrid mechanism bridging the gap between traditional ecosystem grants and VC investments. The most well-known early examples of these <a href=\"https://solana.com/news/solana-foundation-convertible-grants-investments\">come from Solana</a> as non-dilutive grants that can convert to equity investments upon reaching specific milestones, such as raising a priced round or hitting growth targets. Another example is Giveth‚Äôs q/acc program with Polygon.</p>\n<p>This model allows grantors to support various projects, including closed-source and potentially commercial initiatives that still deliver ecosystem value. It offers projects the flexibility to build viable businesses without typical grant restrictions while giving foundations a stake in successful ventures.</p>\n<p>We know that many of the longest-running and well-funded grants programs in the Ethereum ecosystem are thinking about this. Optimism, Arbitrum, Aave, Maker, and the Uniswap Foundation have all either announced ecosystem-specific VC programs or stated that they are looking into them. Venture programs are typically well-funded which means that there may be high potential GMV. Since these programs are also typically run off-chain, even in Web3, we would need to come up with a compelling case for running them on-chain.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2-rising-demand-for-verifiable-impact-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-2-rising-demand-for-verifiable-impact-3\"></a>2. Rising demand for verifiable impact</h2>\n<p>Grants are not dying, but they are entering their Reputation era. This means it‚Äôs time to reinvent, to be outspoken and advocate for change where it‚Äôs needed!</p>\n<p>There is a new category of ecosystem incentives programs that only spend on verifiable impact (eg some action is taken onchain.) This category represents both an evolution of historically hard-to-verify grants programs, as well as a push back against grant farming and even the idea of grants themselves. Some mechanisms in this category may fit more in the ‚Äúecosystem growth‚Äù bucket than ‚Äúgrants.‚Äù The largest and savviest programs are already moving in this direction and we expect that the rest of the market will follow them.</p>\n<p>This category includes things like</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Direct to Contract Incentives from Boost.xyz</li>\n<li>Incentivized Action Market (IAM) from Royco</li>\n<li>Retro Funding (esp Round 4 style Impact Metrics Funding) from Optimism (we built R4 app!)</li>\n<li>The Sunny Awards (funded by Optimism, built by Gitcoin)</li>\n<li>Primitives for proving out impact like Karma/Hypercerts</li>\n<li>Verified Impact using Thrive Protocol</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The rise of verifiable impact is a threat to Gitcoin Grants if other players are able to segment the market into verified impact/unverified impact, and our solutions are cast as unverified impact.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to evolve Gitcoin Grants into including verifiable impact is a great way to counter that threat, and even turn it into a strength.</p>\n<p>Should Gitcoin make a play in verified impact? And if so, what primitive do we bet on? Where do we think we can provide value/win?</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-3-futarchy-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-3-futarchy-4\"></a>3. Futarchy</h2>\n<p>2024 was undeniably the year of the prediction markets, with platforms like Polymarket gaining unprecedented attention and usage. Prediction markets, where users bet on future events and outcomes, surged in popularity as tools for both governance and decision-making. Polymarket, one of the leading platforms in this space, became a central hub for predictions on everything from elections to cryptocurrency trends.</p>\n<p>Futarchy is a governance model proposed by economist Robin Hanson, where decisions are made based on prediction markets. In a futarchy, elected officials (or protocol governors) define national welfare metrics, such as GDP or well-being, while policy choices are determined by markets that predict which policies will most likely improve those metrics. The idea is that by relying on market-driven predictions, it could lead to better decisions than traditional voting, leveraging collective intelligence to forecast outcomes more accurately.</p>\n<p>Endorsed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Polymarket gained credibility and momentum, symbolizing the growing interest in decentralized forecasting. With its rapid expansion, 2024 marked the mainstream emergence of prediction markets as a powerful tool for collective intelligence and economic insights.</p>\n<p>In the past, following Vitalik‚Äôs research/thinking has yielded great results (AMMs=&gt; Uniswap, QF =&gt; Gitcoin Grants, RetroPGF on Optimism). It might be a good bet for Gitcoin to get ahead of this one and build futarchy into the allo ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-4-more-ppl-building-on-allo-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-4-more-ppl-building-on-allo-5\"></a>4.

A key principle of onchain social is that Ethereum is a social network. How might we showcase the best of what is being built in the Ethereum ecosystem, by who, and who has supported them? This could be woven throughout the product experience as a light touch, providing users with insights into the network and impact driven by the projects they support. By doing so, we aim to inspire trust, transparency, and a deeper connection between users and the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"ask-get-involved-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#ask-get-involved-7\"></a>ASK: Get involved</h1>\n<p>This is a live conversation.

He bet Noah $1000 that he would fail to make a place where he could simply let an idea go and let it grow.</p>\n<p>Noah and a friend each adding $50 to prize for building a productivity app that asks you why you are opening your phone and adds a time-out feature to make sure you don‚Äôt lose hours of your week thoughtlessly. A random developer won this with Intenty which now has 10,000+ downloads.</p>\n<p>During Zuzalu which was funded and partially organized by Gitcoin community members, many people added $20 each to a prize to make an AI voice for a river. Within 5 days, the prize incentivized an impromptu team of 12 to build the first ever AI voice for a nature entity <a href=\"http://airiverchat.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">airiverchat.com</a> and presented it to the Prime Minister of Montenegro.</p>\n<p>In June, Noah crowdfunded a prize for delivering medical supplies to medics in Ukraine. After driving to the front-lines and narrowly avoiding a kamikaze drone, the successful delivery resulted in the treatment of 45 injured and undoubtedly at least one life saved.</p>\n<p>The Team</p>\n<p>Using funds donated through Gitcoin, Noah launched ‚Äúmeta-prizes‚Äù which motivated 30+ developers worldwide to build features for the platform.

This is partially solved by recurring grant rounds with projects that share their progress, but as a donor contributes they can‚Äôt be certain that their funds will result in a successfully created project.</p>\n<p>OP style Retro PGF maximizes funder confidence because they only fund things once they‚Äôve seen an impact, but builders have no guarantees of funds while they are building.</p>\n<p>Crowdfunded prizes find a middle ground where builders know how much money is waiting for them if they succeed and funders know they can be refunded if no one does. In user interviews we have found a segment of previous funders of Gitcoin who would prefer to fund projects in this way. Each has different strengths and weaknesses, and prizes offers a complementary option that will appeal more to certain groups.</p>\n<p>-Crowdfunded prizes allow the best ideas to rise to the top<br>\nAn idea may gain momentum in a crowdfunded prize marketplace as more people contribute. This allows the incentive for building the idea to grow until a builder decides to pursue it.</p>\n<p>-Crowdfunded prizes empower freelancing like an entrepreneur<br>\nBuilders may see which ideas have more proven demand in terms of dollar value and from how many people. We‚Äôve found that crowdfunded prizes are quadratic psychologically because the more funders supported a prize the more motivated the builder is.<br>\nIn this new model for freelancing, prizes don‚Äôt pay builders per hour. They pay them for how much demand the builder fulfills, which is closer to how entrepreneurship works.</p>\n<p>-Prizes are an open invitation that welcomes new collaborators<br>\nPrizes fund an idea instead of a particular team.<br>\nMultiple teams may pursue a prize at once, and we ensure that builders are aware of their competition. Builders are self-directed and have fluidity in forming teams.<br>\nA ¬º of the time we‚Äôve found that they enjoy the challenge and compete.<br>\nRoughly ‚Öú of the time they talk and decide amongst themselves who will continue because they have the best chance of succeeding.<br>\nAnother ‚Öú of the time they decide to work together.</p>\n<p>An RFP process is less open. Builders bid down until the funder chooses one team upfront based on their reputation and their price.<br>\nIn a crowdfunded prize, funders bid up until builders pursue the prize. If there are multiple submissions, judges will choose the best. Choosing who wins is therefore more merit-based than reputation-based. It‚Äôs based on any builder who wants to prove themselves showing evidence of their work instead of funders guessing upfront who they think will do the best.<br>\nMore on RFP vs Prizes <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/rfp-allo-yeeter-build/19277/3\">here</a></p>\n<p>-Prizes are hyper-efficient (because they‚Äôre fun)<br>\nIn academic literature, prizes are known as inducement prize contests and are labeled a ‚Äúhyper-efficient‚Äù economic system. This basically means that people are more motivated to accomplish something for the same amount of money because it is presented in a way that is more fun. Prizes motivated Charles Lindbergh to cross the ocean (Orteigh Prize), resulted in the first non-government flight to space (Ansari XPrize), and we‚Äôve all seen how hackathon prizes motivate intense effort. Imagine you have $10,000 and one weekend to build something.<br>\nIf you hired programmers in the Bay Area at their usual per hour rate, you might afford 3-10 hackers for a couple days.<br>\nNow add that $10,000 to a prize that brings 100 hackers for a weekend. They will work far harder and be much more motivated.</p>\n<p>-Weaknesses of Prizes</p>\n<p>No upfront funding. If a builder needs a certain amount of capital to even get started on a project, prizes alone will not work.<br>\nWe look forward to seeing a future with multiple funding mechanisms working in conjunction such as a team receiving a QF grant, using the funds to recruit team members through prizes, and receiving retroPGF as their impact is seen.</p>\n<p>Theoretically, upset builders from wasted or duplicated efforts.

This is different from the first Zuzalu round, which was public.</li>\n<li>In this post, we analyze differences between the public (Q1) and private (MACI) Zuzalu rounds to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of this approach at preventing kickbacks. We find mixed results, indicating the difficulty of determining whether this approach was effective.</li>\n<li>We compare different anti-collusion strategies and how they could be combined to achieve results that best aid the community in funding the right projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Last month Gitcoin spearheaded its first successful implementation of MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) in a quadratic funding round for the Zuzalu community.</p>\n<p>MACI ensures private voting to reduce incidences of bribes or kickbacks. It makes it impossible to send or request a transaction receipt to verify that someone voted a particular way. However, vote integrity is still preserved through the use of zero-knowledge proofs and the results are still guaranteed to be correct. However, MACI is not a voting algorithm ‚Äì instead, it‚Äôs a wrapper around another voting algorithm which adds extra security. In this case, MACI was a wrapper around standard Quadratic Funding.</p>\n<p>As data science nerds (Umar) and fairness-obsessed mechanism designers (Joel), we‚Äôre constantly looking for ways to improve our mechanisms and spot new issues. However, analyzing the quality of public goods funding results is tricky because there‚Äôs no way to tell what the results ‚Äúshould‚Äù look like. The best we can do is analyze patterns in the data over time. Luckily, the recent MACI rounds, which focused on Zuzalu-related projects, bear a lot of similarities to the non-MACI Zuzalu rounds that happened in Q1 of this year: both sets of rounds focused on the same community, had the same subdivisions (tech and events), and we can even look at the folks who claimed a ZuPass in Q1 to get a group of users roughly comparable to to the folks on the allowlist for the MACI rounds (all of our experiments on the Q1 rounds are filtered to look at just the ZuPass holders).</p>\n<p>So now, let‚Äôs go over some common patterns that can indicate collusion. For each pattern, we‚Äôll first ask how we would expect the MACI data to change if it were reducing kickbacks, and then see what really happened.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pattern-analysis-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#pattern-analysis-3\"></a>Pattern Analysis</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><a name=\"entropy-based-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#entropy-based-4\"></a>Entropy-Based</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One way collusion could kick off is with a message in a private group chat. We would then expect the donations to that project from those group members to be close together in time and/or close together in donation amount.</p>\n<p>Entropy is a measure of unpredictability or randomness. Here we apply it to donation patterns. Higher entropy would suggest more diverse, less coordinated donation behavior, while lower entropy would indicate more predictable or potentially coordinated patterns. We calculate entropy by measuring the diversity of donation amounts for each day, where a wider range of donation amounts results in higher entropy. We would expect a round with kickback-motivated donations to have lower entropy.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d_2_624x340.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"4ErQZB9oYuGhQaPxSpFQ20JgY21\" width=\"624\" height=\"340\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d_2_624x340.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d_2_936x510.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FCFCFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433_2_624x340.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hA8vy6VVWmSwEPsOD4fri1dYssH\" width=\"624\" height=\"340\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433_2_624x340.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433_2_936x510.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In the entropy distribution graph, the position along the x-axis indicates the level of entropy (randomness), with higher values suggesting more diverse donation patterns; additionally, curves that are taller and narrower indicate more consistent day-to-day entropy, while wider, flatter curves suggest more variability in daily donation patterns.</p>\n<p>The Q2 Tech round showed higher average daily entropy (1.73) compared to Q1 Tech (1.25) and a slightly wider, flatter curve suggesting more variability. The increase in average entropy from Q1 to Q2, although not statistically significant, suggests MACI might have encouraged more diverse donation patterns.</p>\n<p>In the Events Rounds, Q1 Events surprisingly showed slightly higher average daily entropy (1.87) compared to Q2 Short (1.48) and Long (1.79) Events. On the other hand, Q2 rounds displayed broader entropy distributions, indicating more day-to-day variability.</p>\n<p>Overall, MACI‚Äôs impact varies between Tech and Events rounds. While the Tech round shows promising signs of increased donation diversity, the Events rounds had entropy values that were closer together. The results indicate that MACI‚Äôs effects might be more nuanced or harder to detect than anticipated, potentially influenced by other factors such as the nature of projects (tech vs events) and changes in the round structure.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3><a name=\"jaccard-indices-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#jaccard-indices-5\"></a>Jaccard Indices</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bribery attacks often result in donation patterns where many voters donate similarly. One popular way of measuring similarity is with the Jaccard index. It‚Äôs measured like this: for two voters, first find the set of projects they both donated to. Then their jaccard index is the money they both donated to those ‚Äúshared‚Äù projects, divided by the money they both donated overall. If the two people donated to completely different projects, their Jaccard index is 0. If they only donated to the same projects, their Jaccard index is 1.</p>\n<p>So, if MACI was effective at preventing bribery attacks, one sign might be a more diverse donor base, and accordingly more pairs of voters with very low Jaccard indices (or similarly, fewer pairs of voters with very high Jaccard indices). However, the distributions of Jaccard indices over pairs of voters only partially affirm this pattern:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/1eb82cb674a0f596ef1580a442511ecbc2b8983a.png\" alt=\"|479.55284552845524x360.17479674796743\" data-base62-sha1=\"4nKUP1LwqSYC4d17PgRrgzVKgQy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/8/8db4102ca31cdd7af724b7ce8e7d0d20a041680c.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"kdz6CZWlilxbPPnl2fxbZWcnd9y\" width=\"499\" height=\"375\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p>(By the way‚Äì the Q1 events round had ~35 projects, while the two MACI events rounds had 6 and 8 projects. With more projects, there‚Äôs naturally more room for donor diversity, so we controlled for this by slimming down the Q1 events round to its 7 most popular projects before running these experiments.)</p>\n<p>These data show that while the MACI tech round had voters around as similar as they were in the Q1 tech round, the MACI long events round had significantly more pairs of very similar voters compared to the Q1 events round.</p>\n<p>To be clear, a high percentage of similar voters isn‚Äôt a smoking gun indicating bribery attacks. For example, this donation pattern could be a result of the MACI projects each appealing to very distinct sets of users, which is especially likely where events are concerned. If one project wants to hold an event in Berlin and another project wants to hold an event in Boston, and so on, one might expect voters to be relatively single-issue in their support, only giving to the project holding an event where they live. This would result in some very similar Jaccard indices.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"evaluating-maci-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#evaluating-maci-6\"></a>Evaluating MACI</h2>\n<p>MACI has immense potential as a mechanism for PGF. In the automated world of the blockchain, many types of attacks can be expressed purely in technical terms, and MACI eliminates them. Moreover, it‚Äôs also worth noting that there were much fewer accusations of projects promising kickbacks during and after the MACI rounds, compared to Q1. This could be partly attributed to not just MACI but a clearer social agreement on what constitutes appropriate behavior.</p>\n<p>However, it‚Äôs also worth noting that we were not able to find any measure that strongly affirmed a reasonable hypothesis about how MACI‚Äôs collusion resistance would play out in the data. While entropy was slightly increased moving to MACI, voter similarity stayed the same or increased. Of course, comparing the Q1 ZuZalu rounds to the MACI ZuZalu rounds isn‚Äôt a perfect comparison, but there was certainly not a smoking gun showing that collusion was reduced by MACI.</p>\n<p>One reason for this might be that collusion isn‚Äôt always expressed in purely technical terms ‚Äì for example, by a smart contract that scans the blockchain for donations and awards airdrops accordingly. It can also be expressed in social terms ‚Äì by a group of close friends all voting similarly. While MACI undeniably helps with technically driven collusion, it doesn‚Äôt have any guardrails to prevent social collusion.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"a-simple-social-collusion-attack-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#a-simple-social-collusion-attack-7\"></a>A simple social collusion attack</h3>\n<p>Social collusion attacks are possible because social connections govern the actions people take just as much as technical rules do. Anyone who has ever passed the salt to someone they don‚Äôt like at a meal knows this ‚Äì even without any technical or measurable incentive to perform an action (i.e. it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre getting paid to pass the salt), social norms can still induce us to behave a certain way.</p>\n<p>In the world of blockchain, social collusion attacks could look like a project owner getting a group of close friends to vote for them. Another attack bridging the social and the technical could look like a project owner bribing people to film themselves donating to their project on MACI in the last thirty minutes before voting closes ‚Äì here, the attack is not technically sound, since the bribed persons could change their votes at the last minute, but if the attacker thinks that enough people won‚Äôt bother to do this, then it could still be profitable.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"plural-approaches-prevent-social-collusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#plural-approaches-prevent-social-collusion-8\"></a>Plural approaches prevent Social Collusion</h2>\n<p>At Gitcoin, we‚Äôve been using <a href=\"https://wtfiscocm.streamlit.app/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">COCM</a> (<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4311507\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Connection Oriented Cluster Match</a>) to address exactly the types of social collusion attacks that are in MACI‚Äôs blind spot. COCM is based on the principle of plurality, where proposals generating agreement across differences are preferred over proposals generating agreement within single sections of the population.</p>\n<p>This approach prevents collusion because colluding parties tend to not have much internal diversity, and therefore aren‚Äôt rewarded as much. Of course, colluding parties can try to make themselves look more different by spreading out donations to other projects, but that also gives a leg up to the other projects they donate to.</p>\n<p>COCM is one of several approaches to enhance quadratic funding‚Äôs resistance against social collusion, building upon Vitalik Buterin‚Äôs earlier work on <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pairwise Matching</a>. While both methods aim to reward diversity, they differ in their approach. Pairwise Matching calculates a similarity coefficient for each pair of donors, reducing matching for projects with highly similar donation patterns among their supporters. COCM, on the other hand, examines the relationships between projects based on their shared donors, rewarding projects that attract support from donors who contribute to diverse sets of projects. In essence, Pairwise Matching focuses on individual donor behaviors, while COCM considers project-level relationships.</p>\n<p>The good news is that there‚Äôs no reason why MACI and either COCM or Pairwise can‚Äôt be combined. MACI isn‚Äôt a voting mechanism in and of itself ‚Äì it‚Äôs more like a wrapper around a mechanism that adds extra security. Right now, standard QF is inside that wrapper, but one could theoretically put COCM or Pairwise inside instead. This has never been done before (to our knowledge) and would likely pose a significant technical challenge but should still be possible.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"impact-of-cocm-and-pairwise-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-of-cocm-and-pairwise-9\"></a>Impact of COCM and Pairwise</h3>\n<p>When it comes to the funding differences between QF and COCM or Pairwise, we should examine both the direction and magnitude of the potential change. To understand ‚Äúdirection‚Äù, we can look at whether a project‚Äôs funding would increase or decrease. To understand ‚Äúmagnitude‚Äù, we look at by how much.</p>\n<p>One natural question to start with is: did COCM and Pairwise shift funding amounts in the same direction?</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_361x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gjs7GbrOVhgGV5y9QmOwVshZRpH\" width=\"361\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_361x500.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_541x750.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_722x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D8CDC0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In Q2, Pairwise and COCM agreed significantly more than Q1 on the direction to shift a project‚Äôs funding (93.8% vs 41.7%). This means that if used in conjunction with MACI during Q2, either of these mechanisms would have tended to move results in the same direction. One potential cause behind the large increase is the switch to MACI: if MACI successfully reduced technically-driven collusion, then all that remains would be social collusion. This is where mechanisms like COCM and Pairwise are designed to work. In other words, Pairwise and COCM may respond differently to technical collusion (hence the larger disagreement in Q1), but similarly to social collusion (hence the smaller disagreement in Q2).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_361x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gjs7GbrOVhgGV5y9QmOwVshZRpH\" width=\"361\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_361x500.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_541x750.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_722x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D8CDC0\"></a></div><br>\nAcross both Q1 and Q2, COCM tends to redistribute much more funding among projects than Pairwise (57.8% vs 24.8%).

We want to note that the exact implementation of QF used here and that the actual matching was paid under was CQF (Capital-constrained QF as defined on page 17 of <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hitzig/files/buterin_hitzig_weyl_draft.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this paper</a>).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Quadratic funding is meant to help solve coordination failures like the tragedy of the commons, where even though everyone benefits from public goods being funded, they don‚Äôt get funded because no one individually wants to pay the price. In theory, QF incentivizes contributions by promising big subsidies for donations, therefore making it ‚Äúworth it‚Äù for individuals to pay the price. In practice, however, this opens the mechanism up to collusion, which could be expressed in technical terms, but can often be expressed in socio-technical terms as well.</p>\n<p>Using MACI as a wrapper around QF is an excellent solution for preventing technical attacks, but it can‚Äôt prevent attacks with a social component. To tackle that problem, we need to rewrite QF itself to preferentially subsidize the contributions of funders who appear less coordinated, or in other words, who support different projects from each other. This is what COCM and Pairwise do.</p>\n<p>Each of these algorithms promotes a different winning strategy for projects. QF promotes projects to motivate their donors to support them and only them. COCM promotes projects to motivate their donors to also support other projects. QF pushes the winning strategy toward fragmentation while COCM promotes bridging.</p>\n<p>If you have an idea for a collusion-related pattern to look for in the data, please let us know! We can‚Äôt share MACI data publicly but would love to run whatever experiments the community thinks would be useful.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/analyzing-maci-in-zuzalu-s-second-set-of-qf-rounds/19345\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/analyzing-maci-in-zuzalu-s-second-set-of-qf-rounds/19345","pubDate":"Wed, 11 Sep 2024 19:28:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19345"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/analyzing-maci-in-zuzalu-s-second-set-of-qf-rounds/19345.rss","#text":"Analyzing MACI in Zuzalu‚Äôs Second Set of QF Rounds"},"filter":false},{"title":"Grants Lab Monthly Meeting - September 2024","dc:creator":"meglister","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>I‚Äôm sharing our monthly meeting slides here which cover various updates, announcements, and financial reviews related to the operations of the Grants Lab team. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jDEDo1TlVfAXdzZ8waVuDPaEw3--YTWBXTKS2xNdfEI/edit?usp=sharing\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Grants Lab Monthly_September24_Share - Google Slides</a></p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs a summary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Kudos and Recognition</strong>: Shoutout to team members (Huss and Kurt) for their dedication and support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Organizational Updates</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Principal Engineer‚Äôs final decision will be made shortly.</li>\n<li>New Social Media Manager starts soon.</li>\n<li>Housekeeping updates including use of Notion Dashboard and internal communication setups.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DevCon Update</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DevCon will take place from October 23 - November 6, focusing on community strengthening, builder engagement, and funding through community rounds and easyRPGF rounds.</li>\n<li>Gitcoin presence at events will be limited.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GG22 Update</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on leveraging and growing the Ethereum builder community, aligning with core values of funding public goods, and showcasing Gitcoin technology.</li>\n<li>Retrospective and redesign sessions have been conducted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Leadership Insights</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meg</strong> highlights concerns about missing GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) targets and decisions around custom builds and monetization efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Owocki</strong> discusses the need for scale, remaining runway in stablecoins, and product and engineering rebuild efforts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>August Financial Review</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actual operating expenses were slightly under budget, though some overspending is expected due to investments in Allo 2.1 and the Indexer.</li>\n<li>Treasury currently has $6.5M in stablecoins, which provides 15 months of runway, plus additional GTC funds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GMV Update</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As of September 11, 2024, GMV totals surpassed $7M, but are ~$1.3M behind the mid-September target due to various challenges, including market corrections.</li>\n<li>Completion of payouts for GG21/Name and EasyRF rounds, as well as submission of a new RFP for Name.</li>\n<li>Progress on service offerings and increased engineering focus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>September GMV Focus</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running rounds for multiple projects (Metis, Lukso, Polygon, Avalanche, Octant).</li>\n<li>Aiming to push more payouts and close significant opportunities in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Q3 Goals Review</strong>: The team reviewed progress against Q3 goals, summarized here: <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Grants-Labs-Q3-24-Goals-f6d8494782b1443f8420057861447b58\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Grants-Labs-Q3-24-Goals-f6d8494782b1443f8420057861447b58</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Product Roadmap Updates</strong>: Briefly reviewed updates to the product roadmap ‚Äì forum post coming soon</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Welcome thoughts &amp;

Here is a summary of the key changes:</p>\n<p><strong>Revised Eligibility Criteria:</strong> We rewrote the <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/datatabase/climate-round-portal/round-eligibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GG21 Eligibility Criteria</a> to specifically outline what grantees needed to include in their applications as well as what would disqualify them from participating (even if they had previously participated in the round). See revised <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/datatabase/climate-round-portal/round-eligibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Eligibility Criteria here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Karma GAP Requirement</strong>: Applicants who participated in GG20 were required to post at least 2 milestones and updates in their<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/f95dd8c7212e4dfcb2ee32fee1d6f70c?sid=f8f140d2-6bc1-4a9d-9020-57763f330769\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> GG20 KarmaGap profile</a>. After GG20 we encouraged projects to set milestones based on the funding they received.</p>\n<p><strong>Round Limit</strong>: The Climate Solutions round was limited to 70 grantees as determined by a ranking of project review scores. Note we ended up with 71, but more on that in the challenges section.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Review Process</strong>: The new review process was more detailed and specific compared to previous rounds. Reviewers scored projects in 8 categories on a scale from 1 to 5 based on their application, Karma GAP milestones and updates and impact metrics. Each project was reviewed by 2 reviewers. Read the detailed <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/climate-coordination-network/CCN-Grant-Review-Process-91011e6c9d3d4d43a8b4a4b3eebaf122\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CCN Grant Review Process document here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Application Period</strong>: Applications closed before the round so that the impact ranking could be finalized. This is the first time we have closed the application period before the round started.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-climate-solutions-round-global-collaborative-unique-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#the-climate-solutions-round-global-collaborative-unique-4\"></a>The Climate Solutions Round: Global, Collaborative &amp; Unique</h2>\n<p>What makes the CCN Climate Solutions Round unique? The Climate Solutions Round‚Äôs unique feature/approach is that we cultivate a supportive community that results in ongoing productive relationships and collaborations. During our review of grant proposals from projects that have been in multiple rounds, we found clear examples of grantees supporting each other and collaborating to accomplish goals and address challenges.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"round-matching-results-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-matching-results-5\"></a>Round Matching Results</h2>\n<p>As planned and communicated from the beginning of GG21, the CCN team utilized a combination of QF + COCM (Connection Oriented Cluster Matching) to calculate the matching pool results for the Climate Solutions Round. In the past two rounds (GG19/GG20), we tested and compared COCM and QF allocation mechanisms. As noted in previous posts, the Climate Solutions round is a closely connected community. Because of this COCM tends to flatten the results and disincentivizes projects that have worked hard to market their projects during the donation period. We have also heard much criticism that the standard QF distribution is just a popularity contest that disincentivizes projects with smaller communities and less marketing capacity.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we tested a hybrid model that allocates 50% of the funds using COCM and 50% using QF in GG21. We are proud of the coordination we see within the community, and for our round and our community, using QF + COCM (50-50 each) to calculate the matching funds provides the best outcome and incentives for our participants. In the future, we may explore different percentages for QF/COCM and we are also exploring tunable QF.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impact-assessment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-6\"></a>Impact Assessment</h2>\n<p>In sum, the GG21 CCN Climate Solutions round impacted 71 Climate Solutions projects worldwide, reducing GHGe, building core infrastructure and‚Äîperhaps most importantly‚Äîfacilitating cooperation and coordination to accelerate climate action. This round, we continued to encourage grantees to provide specific metrics utilizing ideas from the <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/climate-solutions-metrics-garden-1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Climate Solution Metrics Garden</a> and we required all returning grantees to include their KarmaGAP milestones and updates. We are working with Karma on ways we can generate a more comprehensive round impact report. It is currently difficult to summarize the 71 KarmaGAP pages.</p>\n<p>To amplify our climate impact, the CCN team also decided to pay out matching funds in USDGLO. By using Glo Dollars for payouts, we increase our impact by joining the Glo Consortium and selecting to combat climate change with the revenue generated from our Glo Dollar holdings. Over $10,000 of additional funding was generated by swapping our matching funds to USDGLO. These additional funds are distributed by GLO Dollar to climate initiatives. We also encouraged our Climate grantees on this opportunity to allocate their yield from matching funds to climate action. We would encourage Gitcoin and other rounds to consider using USDGLO for matching payouts.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"participant-feedback-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#participant-feedback-7\"></a>Participant Feedback</h2>\n<p>For GG21, we created a more specific and comprehensive feedback form here is some of the Initial results:</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/a/a0809a6a56be2052465cb28bd4d2b811480e3457.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/a0809a6a56be2052465cb28bd4d2b811480e3457\" title=\"Pre-round support, including resources provided by CCN, spaces, open office hours\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a0809a6a56be2052465cb28bd4d2b811480e3457_2_624x297.png\" alt=\"Forms response chart.

A few grantees missed communications and/or were confused by the new process.</p>\n<p><strong>Review Process</strong>: While we found the new review process to be an improvement, we were building the plane as we were flying and had to make some adjustments along the way. We were not specific enough about one of the eligibility criteria, which was ‚Äúif they are primarily a token launch or NFT project to raise money for a liquidity pool.‚Äù We made exceptions for projects with tokens that planned to use the funds for operations or other costs outside of directly providing token liquidity. We mistakenly identified one project, $Earth, as primarily a token launch for a liquidity pool. Because of this error, we re-evaluated all the other projects that had not met the eligibility requirements and found no further errors in our reviews. Due to our mistake, we decided the fairest course of action was to add $Earth to the round as the 71st project.</p>\n<p><strong>Checker</strong>: All community rounds were required to use Checker, but Checker has not received any updates or improvements since before GG20. The AI is still not useful for our round and our new review process could not be accommodated in the product. We had hoped to see Karma GAP milestones/updates pulled into Checker, but this feature has not yet been added. We took the time to provide feedback on the product after GG20 and were disappointed to see none of the feedback was utilized to improve the product.</p>\n<p><strong>Grants Stack Product Support</strong>: We had several issues during this round and the last round, which we reported to support at Gitcoin. Responses from the support team were slow, and many of these issues were not resolved. In most cases, we found our own workarounds for these issues. These issues include downtime with the indexer, inability to download CSV from the Manager and issues checking out and making donations. The last issue particularly concerns me as I could not donate to the round and did not receive support before the round ended. If this is the support a round manager receives, I worry that our grantees and donors may also suffer from a lack of product support.</p>\n<p><strong>Donor turnout</strong>: We saw a significant decline in the number of unique contributors and the total amount crowdfunded. We suspect this was a combination of no OSS round, summertime and general market conditions.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Round</th>\n<th>Total Amount Crowdfunded</th>\n<th>Number of Unique Contributors</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>GG20</td>\n<td>$58,000</td>\n<td>2,262</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GG21</td>\n<td>$22,050</td>\n<td>794</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Incentives for Round Managers</strong>: While we appreciate Gitcoin supporting our community the past 3 rounds by adding to our matching pool, we, along with all other round managers, have not received any compensation for our work. Gitcoin appears to be receiving many different benefits from the community rounds, and I think they should compensate round managers for bringing value to Gitcoin through our work.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"lessons-learned-and-areas-for-improvements-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#lessons-learned-and-areas-for-improvements-9\"></a>Lessons Learned and Areas for Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We need a better way to review our grantees.

One core mechanism that supports this decentralization is the governance over the matching pool funds held within the gitcoin.eth multisig.</p>\n<p>Currently, it‚Äôs procedure to include two community members as signers on this multisig, chosen by Gitcoin to act as trusted community stewards for the matching pool funds.

It streamlines comparing COCM and traditional QF results, allowing for easy download, review, and granular customization of round results.</li>\n<li>The add members functionality is available for both programs and rounds. This allows admins to add team members easily at the program and round levels. I hopped in for another community round and assisted with payouts, and this functionality made it reasonably easy to get in and help that round operator.</li>\n<li>More networks! We added Celo and had a few rounds running for GG21.

Allo Focus:</h3>\n<p>We funded projects both building on top of Allo (Grant Ships, Gardens, Karma, Endaoment, ggframe, Funding the Commons), experienced Allo Builder Teams (RaidGuild, viaprize, Scaffold), and analytics and impact measurement tools that tap into Allo‚Äôs registry (OpenSourceObserver, Gitcoin Grants Data Portal, GrantsScope). We will continue to focus here for these reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It strengthens infrastructure that the entire grants ecosystem relies on</li>\n<li>It encourages innovation in capital allocation mechanisms</li>\n<li>It aligns with the objectives of Gitcoin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By supporting Allo-based projects, we‚Äôre not just funding individual initiatives; we‚Äôre helping to build the foundation and expand the design space for capital allocation mechanisms.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-grants-infrastructure-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-2-grants-infrastructure-6\"></a>2. Grants Infrastructure:</h3>\n<p>Our round supported several infrastructure projects that are advancing our vision to map all grants and incentives across Web3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On-chain grant registry: We‚Äôve continued to develop and expand the first on-chain grant registry on Arbitrum using Allo Protocol. This registry is a foundation for increasing grant discoverability and transparency across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Trustful: We have partnered with Blockful to develop a grants reputation system that will help build accountability in the grants ecosystem. This system aligns with our mission to explore and chart grants by providing context and credibility metrics for grant programs (a space we believe is lacking in systems today).</li>\n<li>Ecosystem.Vision &amp; WelcomeOnchain: Showcasing how third-party tools can leverage our open registry. These platforms offer views into the Web3 ecosystem. They can now provide their user base current with grant program data without the overhead of curation.</li>\n<li>x23: We‚Äôve supported the creation of a grants news aggregator to keep the community informed and engaged. This tool builds upon <a href=\"https://t.me/cryptograntwire\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Crypto Grant Wire</a> by offering enhanced features and functionality, including automated program updates and the ability for other community members to contribute to the feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These projects aren‚Äôt just isolated tools but interconnected components of a broader infrastructure, making the entire grants and incentives ecosystem more transparent and accessible.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-quality-applicants-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-3-quality-applicants-7\"></a>3. Quality Applicants:</h3>\n<p>Many well-known projects and communities have contributed over time to the Web3 Grants space, including Giveth, Metrics Garden Labs, Public Nouns, Hypercerts, DAO Drops, and many others that are proven builders and thought leaders in the space. Their participation brings credibility to our round and demonstrates the high caliber of projects we‚Äôre attracting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It validates our approach and selection process</li>\n<li>It attracts more high-quality projects and teams to the Cartographers</li>\n<li>It increases the likelihood of funded projects delivering real value to the ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"h-4-community-growth-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-4-community-growth-8\"></a>4.

The increase is primarily due to investments in product development (Wonderland) and costs related to the restructuring of the Ecosystem Collective team</p>\n<p>This report provides a detailed analysis of our financial performance for July 2024, highlighting key metrics and budgetary insights.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overviewhttpsdunecomumarkhanethgitcoin-treasury-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overviewhttpsdunecomumarkhanethgitcoin-treasury-1\"></a><a href=\"https://dune.com/umarkhaneth/gitcoin-treasury\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Overview</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Last Month‚Äôs Treasury Holdings</strong>: $31,765,250</li>\n<li><strong>Current Month Treasury Holdings</strong>: $28,588,135</li>\n<li><strong>Variance</strong> (-$3,177,115), 10.00%): This change was mainly due to fluctuations in token prices, which fell last month. Additionally, our operating expenses across all workstreams totaled $926,051, which further influenced this variance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"runway-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#runway-2\"></a>Runway</h2>\n<p>The recent decline in the value of our GTC holdings has affected our Runway projection. Currently, our runway is estimated at 30 months (3 years). However, due to the spin-off of Passport and the restructuring of the DAO (formerly Ecosystem Collective), along with a monthly budget of approximately $496,777, our Runway extends to 58 months (5 years). This projection considers an anticipated expenditure of $496,777 across Grants Lab and the DAO - Ecosystem Collective.</p>\n<p>Our DAO‚Äôs treasury currently holds $20,440,249 in GTC tokens, with each token valued at an average of $0.70. GTC tokens now represent 71.5% of our treasury, underscoring the significant impact of GTC‚Äôs performance on our financial stability. To mitigate risks from market fluctuations and enhance financial resilience, it is essential to monitor this closely and explore strategies for diversifying our treasury holdings.</p>\n<p>Last Month‚Äôs Expenditure: Total expenditure for the month was $926,051, marking a substantial increase of 14.79% or $119,306 compared to the previous month‚Äôs total of $806,745. This overspend indicates challenges in resource allocation. To address this, we need to reassess our budgeting strategies to ensure more prudent spending and maintain sustainable financial health moving forward.</p>\n<p>July*</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/3/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a_2_288x243.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"7kU9WhLX1HCHwlSgVRAPufBp55U\" width=\"288\" height=\"243\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a_2_288x243.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a_2_432x364.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a_2_576x486.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEC5BC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Figures ran on August 27, 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<p>June*</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/b/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda_2_288x244.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"qI6bC29fRngkZuWffhbGYEyRXiq\" width=\"288\" height=\"244\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda_2_288x244.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda_2_432x366.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda_2_576x488.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEC5BC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Figures ran on July 15 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"token-spend-in-july-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#token-spend-in-july-3\"></a>Token spend in July</h3>\n<p>During July, our total expenditure in USD reached $926,051.

Although this complexity could be reduced slightly with a better configuration of the round, or even reduced significantly with a UI tailored for the thresholds mechanism, it remains an important concern (see below)</p>\n<p>Cultural assumptions</p>\n<p>The mechanism was designed under the assumption that teams would apply for a specific, bound project. However, the applications show that most teams that applied use Gitcoin rounds to ‚Äútop up‚Äù their funding. As such, there was a mismatch between the regular usage of Gitcoin rounds and the threshold mechanism.</p>\n<p>Assessment requirements</p>\n<p>Due to cultural assumptions about what Gitcoin rounds are for, most teams devised a threshold as an afterthought. This was somewhat discernible in the applications but effective policing would have required managerial resources the team didn‚Äôt have (i.e. would have required operating like a grant committee with significant due diligence capabilities ). We have the impression that most thresholds were at best inaccurate representations of the reality of the projects and, at worst, complete fabrications with no connection to the actual use of funds, but we can‚Äôt know.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusions-and-recommendations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusions-and-recommendations-5\"></a>Conclusions and recommendations</h1>\n<p>We‚Äôre excited to see reflected in the data the redistribution of funds in a way that could increase the effectiveness of capital allocation by ecosystems. Showing 16% of funds reallocated, and 3% of funds reallocated having a transformative effect (from allocated to insufficiently funded projects to allocated to now sufficiently funded ones).<br>\nHowever, the qualitative challenges encountered are significant and put into question the validity of the quantitative insights.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, we see promise in the use of thresholds as a mechanism if significant resources can be dedicated to both storytelling (i.e. education) and product. As such, we could expect rounds with Thresholds to become a separate product from Gitcoin rounds, both in brand and functionality.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôd love to know whether the Gitcoin community would like to see us, RnDAO, carry further R&amp;D on this concept.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-collabtech-round-by-rndao/19317\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-collabtech-round-by-rndao/19317","pubDate":"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 18:27:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19317"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-collabtech-round-by-rndao/19317.rss","#text":"[GG21 Retrospective} CollabTech Round by RnDAO"},"filter":false},{"title":"[GG21 Retrospective] OpenCivics Collaborative Research Round","dc:creator":"omniharmonic","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<h1><a name=\"collaborative-research-grant-round-03-insights-learning-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#collaborative-research-grant-round-03-insights-learning-1\"></a>Collaborative Research Grant Round 03 Insights &amp; Learning</h1>\n<p>The OpenCivics Collaborative Research Round 03 generated valuable insights into the evolving landscape of on-chain quadratic funding for public goods.

This reduction might be partially attributed to the broader market downturn, but it is more likely linked to the absence of an open-source software round that typically runs concurrently with key community rounds.</p>\n<p>A critical lesson from this experience is the need for the impact-focused segment of the Gitcoin community to extend its outreach beyond the existing web3 space. We see a significant opportunity to engage with other communities that are interested in funding social impact projects but are not currently involved in the space. This challenge could be addressed by coordinating efforts to bring traditional nonprofit ecosystems and climate organizations into the quadratic funding ecosystem.</p>\n<p>One of the main barriers to this type of expansion has been the lack of web3 knowledge within these communities. However, the introduction of a fiat PayPal donation option in this round has proven to be a significant step forward. This innovation, made possible through a partnership with viaPrize, allowed us to create a seamless donation process for those unfamiliar with web3, while still ensuring that donations were eligible for matching funds. The success of this experiment suggests that we can now onboard non-web3 participants using traditional payment methods, allowing them to engage in the ecosystem without the steep learning curve associated with purchasing and bridging different cryptocurrencies on different blockchains. For a full retrospective on the viaPrize payment system experiment in GG21, please review founder Noah Chon Lee‚Äôs post on the <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/we-donated-to-gitcoin-projects-with-credit-card-review-of-paypal-fiat-payments-in-gg21/19287\">Gitcoin Governance Forum</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-in-matching-calculations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#challenges-in-matching-calculations-7\"></a>Challenges in Matching Calculations</h3>\n<p>Another key learning from the round was the complexity involved in calculating matching amounts using cluster matching, minimum matching amounts, changes in matching pool size, and whitelisted wallets.</p>\n<p>Upon reviewing the cluster matching results, we observed discrepancies between the expected matching results and the actual outcomes. This discrepancy was traced back to a parameter within cluster matching that reduces the matching for wallets that only donate to a single project. While this serves as a useful Sybil protection mechanism, it also unintentionally penalized grantees with unique donor bases mobilized specifically for their projects. To address this issue, we employed a 50/50 split between cluster matching results and quadratic funding results.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we had to adjust the results due to a reduction in the matching pool‚Äôs size, caused by holding a portion of the pool in ETH rather than USDC. While we immediately swapped ETH for USDC as the market turned, but still lost about $4,000, which we corrected for after the round by manually modifying the matching results to reflect the correct matching pool size.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we deployed an experimental $1,000 minimum matching to ensure that all projects selected for the round would receive at least enough grant funds to complete a portion of their research inquiry. Round results were modified by filling the gap in matching for projects that fell below the $1,000 threshold by redistributing matching funds proportional to the amount that each project over $1,000 received.</p>\n<p>All of these modifications, the calculations used to derive them, and the original figures are listed on our <a href=\"https://opencivics.notion.site/Collaborative-Research-Round-03-Analytics-5014eb48f1b048dc97c679e55f2aae49?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">wiki</a> and can be audited by anyone to determine how those choices were made. In the future, we would appreciate features within Gitcoin Manager that would allow us to reduce the matching pool size, set minimum matching amounts, and modify sybil parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"sybil-protection-and-model-transparency-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#sybil-protection-and-model-transparency-8\"></a>Sybil Protection and Model Transparency</h3>\n<p>While the cluster matching results in our previous round were intuitively smoother and generally more equitable, cluster matching results in this round were vastly different than the traditional quadratic funding results. Given the large difference, we began to look deeper into what was driving the changes in the underlying model, something we had not thought to inquire into prior. Given what we learned, we want to instantiate a larger public conversation around sybil protection, the tradeoffs between transparency and opaqueness for model-based sybil detection, and other ways we might be able to rethink matching mechanisms.</p>\n<p>While the Passport team‚Äôs decision to reduce matching for single-project donors is well-intentioned, it highlighted the importance of donors understanding the evaluation metrics of cluster matching. Without this understanding, the algorithm‚Äôs outputs may lead to unintended consequences. We believe it is crucial for donors to be informed about the factors influencing their matching scores upfront, enabling them to consciously adjust their behavior. Of course, this transparency could also be used to game the system, but we felt concerned about the unintended negative consequences for some grantees who could have otherwise informed their donors that they would need to also donate to other projects in order for their donations to be eligible for matching. We feel that this kind of information could actually generate positive effects for rounds by encouraging donors to consider all the projects for donation instead of just the projects of their friends. In the future, we may tell our donors something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your donation is a <em>weighted preference vote</em> for which projects should be funded. In order to know how much you value a project, we need to understand your preferences in relationship to at least one other project. If you do find that your preferences are nearly 100% aligned with <em>only</em> one project in the round, please make at least one other small donation to another project to ensure your primary donation is eligible for matching.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We recognize that the previous stamp-based Passport system is cumbersome for most users and were very excited for the new donor UX made possible by cluster matching, but we believe that greater transparency is needed regarding how cluster matching scores are determined. The lack of transparency, which makes sense from the perspective of sybil protection, puts us as round operators in a difficult position, as we must justify round results that stem from an algorithm we do not fully understand.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, upon understanding more clearly how the cluster matching method does reflect a set of values and perspectives (ie what behaviors are encouraged or penalized), we believe that such value judgements should not only be made transparent but should also be composable by communities to reflect their values and needs. Moving forward, we aim to make this value judgment more transparent while also exploring the possibility of new features and approaches that empower communities to customize matching parameters. This customization could include incentives and rewards for specific behaviors, creating a more pluralistic approach to sybil resistance and community participation. For example, we are interested in exploring ‚Äútunable QF,‚Äù an approach to matching that modifies matching amounts based on the particular token holdings of any given address. We would be interested in experimenting with a pluralistic approach to matching modifiers and would love to beta test tooling that enables us to link various ERC-20 and ERC-721 contract addresses as matching criteria, enabling us to increase the matching signal from OpenCivics Network members with membership NFTs, $REGEN token holders, or staked GTC, as a few examples.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"round-innovations-and-feedback-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-innovations-and-feedback-9\"></a>Round Innovations and Feedback</h3>\n<p>One piece of feedback that emerged early on in our application for matching funds was the ease and clarity of attestations in a research-focused round. The binary nature of research publication‚Äîeither a project publishes its research or it does not‚Äîmakes impact attestations straightforward to document. This simplicity may make research-based quadratic funding rounds more attractive and easier to manage. We‚Äôre incredibly happy with the grantees in this round which demonstrated a wide diversity of inspired, useful, and forward reaching research inquiries into a wide range of domains within the field of web3 civics or DeCiv. To hear from just a few of the amazing grantees in this round, head over to our <a href=\"https://x.com/i/spaces/1YqxovqEEnbJv\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Round Showcase Space on X</a>. We look forward to sharing the research that‚Äôs produced through the funding of this round!</p>\n<p>We consider our PayPal fiat experiment with viaPrize to have been a massive success. Thanks to the amazing work of Noah and his team, combined with efforts from the Gitcoin Grants Labs team to enable a feature for white listing the addresses generated by viaPrize, we were able to process fiat donations for the first time while addressing sybil protection. We encourage folks to read more about Noah‚Äôs method and results in his retrospective post to learn more about how it works and to decide for themselves if they want to deploy it for their own rounds in the future.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we experimented with implementing a minimum matching amount to ensure that all grantees received enough funding to impact their proposed research meaningfully. We set a minimum of $1,000, redistributing matching amounts proportionally from grantees who received a larger percentage of the pool. Given the circumstances we‚Äôve encountered in both of our previous rounds in which some grantees do not receive enough funds to take meaningful action on their grant project, we feel that the additional redistributive burden on the higher performing grantees, as well as the burden on round operators who must review applications much more carefully given the cost of minimum matching per project, is ultimately worth the tradeoffs and we look forward to experimenting with matching minimums again in future rounds, perhaps with different approaches to the threshold and the threshold qualifications.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Overall, this round provided critical insights and valuable lessons that we‚Äôre already beginning to build upon for next round. We are committed to continuing our partnership with Gitcoin and the entire Community Round Operator ecosystem, and we‚Äôre grateful for the incredible support we‚Äôve received from the Gitcoin and Passport teams as well as other round operators. We look forward to building upon these experiences, refining our processes, and exploring new possibilities for fostering impactful, transparent, and equitable public goods funding.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"feature-requests-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#feature-requests-11\"></a>Feature Requests</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum Matching Setting: Allo Protocol</li>\n<li>Modifiable Parameters For Matching Results: Passport\n<ul>\n<li>ERC-20 and ERC-721 parameters and weights</li>\n<li>Slider for weight between COCM and QF results</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Modifying Matching Pool Size (lower) During Round: Allo Protocol</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a deep dive in matching pool calculations, graphs, and further analysis, visit our <a href=\"https://opencivics.notion.site/Collaborative-Research-Round-03-Analytics-5014eb48f1b048dc97c679e55f2aae49?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">wiki</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19313\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19313","pubDate":"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 22:34:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19313"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19313.rss","#text":"[GG21 Retrospective] OpenCivics Collaborative Research Round"},"filter":false},{"title":"Projects for At-Risk Kids Community Round Proposal","dc:creator":"noahchonlee","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<p>What if we made a community round for GG22 supporting projects for at-risk kids?</p>\n<p><strong>Potential projects:</strong><br>\n-Ava‚Äôs House Kids Shelter in Chiang Mai, Thailand with Deng Arjaw that I know of through <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viviantp6\">@viviantp6</a> of G0V/DA0.

This round was the first of its kind, bringing together the GreenPill Network, ReFi DAO, and Celo Public Goods under a unified mission. Inviting applications from ReFi DAO Local Nodes, GreenPill Local Chapters, and Celo Regional DAOs, this Genesis Round marked the official launch of The Regen Coordi-Nation program and the first step in a more extensive plan to measure, monitor, and amplify the impact of these initiatives through follow-up support and a planned retroactive funding round later in the year. Thanks to the generous support of Gitcoin, Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO, and GreenPill Network, we have successfully raised $110,000 for this program, with $50,000 going towards this initial GG21 matching pool. Gitcoin‚Äôs support was instrumental in making this program possible, providing the foundational funding and tooling necessary to kickstart the initiative and drive the impact we aim to achieve in the subsequent stages of the program.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"round-purpose-and-goals-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-purpose-and-goals-3\"></a>Round Purpose <strong>and Goals</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Catalyze Regenerative Communities and Collaboration</strong>: Unite GreenPill Network, ReFi DAO, and Celo Public Goods under a shared mission and seek to foster positive-sum synergies. By enhancing alignment and collaboration across our networks, we aim to amplify financial resources, strategic support, shared knowledge and other resources that can grow our collective impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Serve as the First Phase of a Broader Program</strong>: Initiate the Regen Coordi-Nation program with the GG21 Genesis Round, followed by ongoing impact tracking and a planned retroactive funding round, ensuring that support continues to foster meaningful outcomes beyond the initial funding.</li>\n<li><strong>Drive Community Engagement &amp; Collaboration</strong>: Focus on fostering active community engagement, collaboration, and strategic marketing for the networks and individual projects in the round. This is a core strength and value proposition of Gitcoin Rounds and the Quadratic Funding mechanism.</li>\n<li><strong>Innovate and Develop New Systems for Impact</strong>: Learn, experiment, and develop new systems to enhance the Regen Coordi-Nation and the broader Web3 Grants Ecosystem. This includes implementing and testing cutting-edge mechanisms like Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF), Common Approach, Karma GAP integration, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) to drive more effective and transparent impact measurement and Web3 capital allocation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#implementation-4\"></a><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"setup-and-management-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#setup-and-management-5\"></a><strong>Setup and Management</strong></h3>\n<p>The setup and management of the GG21 Regen Coordi-Nation Genesis Round involved extensive coordination between GreenPill Network, ReFi DAO, and Celo Public Goods. We utilized the <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/2bfc9ecc725743878491812edccf4430?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Regen Coordi-Nation Portal</a> and <a href=\"https://t.me/+dfOMYhMROdU5YzY0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dedicated Telegram group</a> as the central hub for guiding participants through the eligibility criteria, timelines, and application process. A key aspect of our approach was devolving the responsibility for nominating projects to each of the respective networks‚ÄîGreenPill, ReFi DAO, and Celo Public Goods. While this added an extra layer of steps for grantees, it was crucial in ensuring that the quality of applications remained high and that the unique context and methodologies of each network were respected and prioritized. The management team, consisting of core stewards from each network, oversaw the review process, provided feedback, and ensured that all selected projects aligned with our mission.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-and-solutions-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#challenges-and-solutions-6\"></a><strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Timing and Application Process</strong>: The short turnaround time between the community round approval and the round going live created challenges, particularly with our slightly longer application process, which prevented some grantees from applying in time. <strong>Solution</strong>: In the future, allowing more time for communications and preparations before the round begins would benefit all participants and ensure smoother operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Bridging Funds and Accessing Gas Tokens</strong>: There was some confusion and difficulty for participants in bridging funds and accessing the necessary gas tokens on the Celo network. <strong>Solution</strong>: We addressed this by providing <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/2bfc9ecc725743878491812edccf4430?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">additional support resources</a>, including updated documentation and direct assistance through the Telegram group. In the future, there is much that could be done by Celo, Gitcoin and the wider Web3 ecosystem to improve and simplify these experiences.</li>\n<li><strong>cUSD Donation Issues</strong>: A critical issue arose when cUSD donations were not functioning due to a bug. <strong>Solution</strong>: This was resolved before the end of the round through collaboration with Gitcoin‚Äôs technical team.</li>\n<li><strong>Gitcoin Downtime and Communication</strong>: Gitcoin experienced downtime during the round, which affected grantee participation and contributions. <strong>Solution</strong>: Improved communication with grantees about potential downtime, bugs, and other technical issues is necessary to ensure that participants are well-informed and can plan accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"unique-features-or-approaches-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#unique-features-or-approaches-7\"></a><strong>Unique Features or Approaches</strong></h3>\n<p>The GG21 Regen Coordi-Nation Genesis Round introduced several innovative elements designed to drive engagement, boost impact, and experiment with cutting-edge funding mechanisms.</p>\n<p>One of the most significant experiments involved <strong>Regen Tips</strong>. In partnership with Regen Tips, we incentivized participation by offering $REGEN token allocations to contributors, with a tiered rewards system based on donation amounts. For example, every $1 USDGLO donated was rewarded with 10,000 $REGEN, and donations over 10 USDGLO or 69 USDGLO received 10x or 100x tipping boosts, respectively.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/6/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45\" title=\"Reegn Tips x Celo GG21\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/6/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45_2_250x250.png\" alt=\"Reegn Tips x Celo GG21\" data-base62-sha1=\"es829HMbx4m6RSj4YYFV2V1GaXP\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/6/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45_2_250x250.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/6/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45_2_375x375.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/6/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45_2_500x500.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DADA9E\"></a></div> |<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/3/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6\" title=\"Regen Quadratic Multiplier\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6_2_252x250.jpeg\" alt=\"Regen Quadratic Multiplier\" data-base62-sha1=\"90Ix51luU26dnebLVJkIeTpAoPI\" width=\"252\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6_2_252x250.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6_2_378x375.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6_2_504x500.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECE9C9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Additionally, we trialed a ‚Äò<strong>Proof-of-Regen Quadratic Multiplier</strong>,‚Äô where donors could receive up to double the matching power of their contributions based on their <a href=\"https://www.regen.tips/score\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Proof of Regen score</a>. This mechanism, developed by the Token Engineering Commons (TEC), allowed us to experiment with TQF as a way to fine-tune quadratic funding models. However, technical challenges meant this would have delayed results release and payouts. Furthermore, from some of the preliminary results we got back it was not clear that this broad signal actually optimised or boosted the results in a desired way. As such, this led us to ultimately exclude this mechanism from the final results. Despite this, the experiment yielded valuable insights, and in collaboration with Gitcoin, TEC is exploring the development of a self-serve TQF tool that would give us more control and customisability in future rounds.</p>\n<p>Another unique feature of the round was the <strong>Celo Public Goods (CeloPG) Signal Boosting</strong> initiative. Celo Public Goods provided seven stewards with 500 cUSD each to distribute across both rounds. Projects that demonstrated strong alignment with Celo ecosystem metrics, such as increasing Total Value Locked (TVL), transaction volume, and overall ecosystem engagement, received higher donations from these stewards. Each steward followed specific guidelines, such as a max donation of $50 per project and avoiding donations to projects with direct affiliations. This approach incentivized projects to align more closely with Celo‚Äôs mission while boosting their visibility and support within the round.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"outcomes-and-statistics-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outcomes-and-statistics-8\"></a>Outcomes and Statistics</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"funding-and-contributions-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-and-contributions-9\"></a>Funding and Contributions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Total Projects</strong>: 62 applications and 46 being accepted into the round.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Matching Pool</strong>: $50,000 USDGLO</li>\n<li><strong>Total Crowdfunded Contributions</strong>: $8,449.42 (16.71% of the matching pool)</li>\n<li><strong>Total Donations</strong>: 1,472</li>\n<li><strong>Total Donors</strong>: 276</li>\n<li><strong>Passport Usage</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>95 users (34.4%) received full matching (passport model score over 50)</li>\n<li>38 users (13.8%) received partial matching (passport model score between 25 and 50)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/b/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0\" title=\"Regen Coordi-Nation GG21 Matching Results\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0_2_690x431.png\" alt=\"Regen Coordi-Nation GG21 Matching Results\" data-base62-sha1=\"ph9FCG1v8ixSzBQuD9srS8KBRde\" width=\"690\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0_2_690x431.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0_2_1035x646.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0_2_1380x862.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5EDD3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>For the full results and matching calculations, you can check out: <a href=\"https://qf-calculator.fly.dev/?round_id=14&amp;chain_id=42220\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Streamlit</a></p>\n<p>To protect against sybil attacks and airdrop farmers, we utilized Gitcoin‚Äôs passport model-based detection system. While this system worked well to prevent sybil attacks, one drawback was that legitimate donors without a robust Web3 history will receive lower matching rates or none at all. Still, we recognize the tradeoffs and commend Gitcoin for their ongoing innovation in sybil protection strategies.</p>\n<p>Overall, we were happy with the results of the round, both in terms of donations into the round and the results of matching fund calculations. We were also pleased with how Gitcoin‚Äôs Connection-oriented cluster-matching (COCM) worked in rebalancing results to reduce the impact of coordinated clusters and single project donors in the round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"participant-feedback-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#participant-feedback-10\"></a>Participant Feedback</h3>\n<p>We collected feedback from participants in the round and received the following from 11 responses.</p>\n<p><strong>Average Ratings (out of 5)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Application Process: 4.38</li>\n<li>Fairness of Outcome: 4.29</li>\n<li>Communication and Support: 4.25</li>\n<li>Overall Program: 4.14</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Overall, participants had a positive experience with the GG21 Regen Coordi-Nation Genesis Round, rating various aspects of the process favorably. The communication and support throughout the round was well-received, with particular appreciation for the responsiveness of the support teams. The program as a whole was viewed positively, with participants noting the collaborative spirit and the effective guidance provided by the networks involved.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‚ÄúGreat support and process was very smooth and quick. Also loved the opportunity to link with other coordinators.‚Äù</li>\n<li>‚ÄúThis was our first time and I think it was guided very well‚Äù</li>\n<li>‚ÄúThe operators were incredibly helpful not only in providing all instructions necessary but also in ensuring the project has the highest quality possible.‚Äù</li>\n<li>‚ÄúMonty has been great about staying in constant communication and the Celo team has been really wonderful to work with.‚Äù</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, several participants highlighted issues such as technical bugs, including difficulties with bridging funds, accessing gas tokens, and experiencing downtime on the Gitcoin platform. There were also requests for additional features, such as better communication during technical issues and enhanced transparency in the outcome distribution process. Most of these concerns have already been addressed in the Challenges and Solutions section.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‚ÄúWould be great to be able to swap or bridge Celo or into the Celo network easier across platforms.‚Äù</li>\n<li>Would like there to be ‚ÄúExact clarification on gitcoin passport scores and eligibility for match funding‚Äù</li>\n<li>‚ÄúDuring the round there where some bugs. cUSD donations kept failing in our round during 3-4 days of the round.

Beyond the financial impact, the round has also significantly <strong>strengthened the collaboration between ReFi DAO, GreenPill Network, and Celo Public Goods</strong>. From my POV there feels a new sense of togetherness and a collaborative sprit, with each network gaining a deeper understanding of each other and working more closely together. This feels like just the beginning, with more opportunities for collaboration and impact ahead, particularly with the upcoming retroactive funding round and the development of a common approach to impact tracking.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"lessons-learned-and-improvements-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#lessons-learned-and-improvements-12\"></a><strong>Lessons Learned and Improvements</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"feature-requests-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#feature-requests-13\"></a>Feature Requests</h3>\n<p>While the round was largely successful, some ideas &amp; suggestions for additional Gitcoin Grants Stack functionality that could be helpful for future rounds also surfaced:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Revise Application Process</strong>: Providing the ability for program managers to offer feedback on submissions and allowing grantees to edit their applications with version history would improve the application process.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-Chain Donations</strong>: Implementing backend bridging that allows donations to be made from any chain, regardless of where the donor holds their tokens, would greatly enhance the flexibility and accessibility of the funding process.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated Communication Tools</strong>: Developing tools for automated emails and other communications would streamline the process of updating grantees, reducing the communication burden on organizers and ensuring timely information delivery.</li>\n<li><strong>Grantee Feedback Mechanism</strong>: Introducing a feature that allows grantees to submit comments with their donations could foster greater community engagement and provide a fun way to give public feedback and support for projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) Tool</strong>: Creating a self-serve TQF tool built on the Allo platform would empower round operators to analyze the impact of different signals more effectively. This would reduce the bottleneck in experimentation and customization, allowing for more dynamic and responsive funding rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated Payout Address Verification</strong>: Ability to scan the payout wallet addresses provided to make sure they all are chain compatible. e.g. no one has provided a multi-sig on the wrong chain. We checked this manually but would be cool if Gitcoin could do it automatically.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"overall-reflection-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overall-reflection-14\"></a><strong>Overall</strong> Reflection</h3>\n<p>My overall key takeaway from this round and the wider GG21 is that we are continuing to learn, evolve and progress in a positive direction but there is still much work to do. The Gitcoin stack continues to improve and the overall space is evolving rapidly. However, there is still some way to go in making Web3 and ReFi truly accessible to a broader audience, going beyond the current bubbles of adopters and enthusiasts, and attracting greater participation and capital from outside the space. I hope this round, and the Regen Coordi-Nation as a whole, can continue to support continuous learning, adaptation, and innovation to ensure that these technologies can achieve their full potential in driving ecological, economic, and social regeneration at scale.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"next-steps-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#next-steps-15\"></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>As we look forward to the next phases of the Regen Coordi-Nation program, our focus will shift to building upon the foundations laid during the GG21 Genesis Round.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact Measurement and Tracking</strong>: We are seeking to implement the <a href=\"https://www.commonapproach.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Common Approach</a>  impact measurement system, ensuring that our local communities activities can be better monitored, understood, and communicated. This system will help us better capture the real-world impact of the projects we support, providing a clearer picture of the outcomes achieved by ReFi DAO Local Nodes, GreenPill Local Chapters, and Celo Regional DAOs. By developing a robust version of our collective impact measurement, reporting, and verification system, we aim to establish a more transparent and accountable framework that will benefit all stakeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF)</strong>: Following the completion of impact tracking, we will prepare for the retroactive funding round planned for later this year. This round will reward projects based on their demonstrated impact, encouraging continuous engagement and delivering on our commitment to support ongoing regenerative efforts. The RPGF round will also serve as an opportunity to test, refine and reflect on the systems and processes we‚Äôve developed, ensuring they are scalable and effective for future rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Strengthening Collaboration and Learning</strong>: The collaborative spirit fostered during the GG21 Genesis Round has set the stage for even deeper partnerships. We will continue to encourage cross-network collaboration, focusing on shared learning and resource pooling to maximize our collective impact. By hosting workshops, webinars, and other community-building events, we aim to create more opportunities for knowledge exchange and joint initiatives.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing Innovation and Experimentation</strong>: Finally, we remain committed to experimenting with new ideas and technologies that can enhance the Regen Coordi-Nation and the broader Web3 Grants Ecosystem. By continuously iterating on our approaches and staying open to new possibilities, we aim to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in regenerative finance and community coordination, ultimately driving more significant and lasting impacts.</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.commonapproach.org/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/2e7524149ca4f58522bc940e62d8856e98a52e9d.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"D7DFE5\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.commonapproach.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Common Approach to Impact Measurement</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:600/338;\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/9/9a6b966fa9a587c75a59e0909470946ecb91af95.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"FFFFFF\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.commonapproach.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Common Approach to Impact Measurement</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Impact measurement can be better!

Gitcoin is known for its transparency and community-focused approach, but as someone new to the process, I found myself wondering about a few things‚Ä¶ below is a critical review of the experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Observations on Gitcoin‚Äôs Processes</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Segregation of Duties (SoD): During my time in GG21, I often heard people say that it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe same crypto bros in rotation‚Äù handling different parts of the grant process. This made me wonder how well Gitcoin is implementing Segregation of Duties. Ideally, SoD should ensure that no single group or individual has too much control over the entire process. However, if it‚Äôs just the same folks rotating through, it might be worth considering how to diversify these roles to bring in fresh perspectives and ensure fair decision-making. From the outside, it isn‚Äôt clear how these things operate internally at Gitcoin, and this may in fact be well thought out and implemented, yet I could not find anything that points to this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SOX-Type Controls: Beyond SoD, other controls like audit trails, regular reconciliation, and independent reviews are essential for maintaining trust in any system that manages significant funds. Gitcoin has made some strides here, but I think there‚Äôs still room to grow. For example, bringing in more external audits could help ensure everything aligns with best practices, and formalizing whistleblower protections would encourage people to speak up if something doesn‚Äôt seem right. Some of these controls may even entice bigger investors to join in‚Ä¶ ISO standards may also help.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Regen.tips mechanisms: they create a strong incentive for individuals to donate from multiple accounts simply to accumulate more points, which can be exchanged for rewards (later on?) or recognition within the platform, acting as an engagement farming tool for partners like Celo and USDGLO. This practice may facilitate Sybil attacks on Gitcoin by allowing these multiple, often fake, identities to falsely boost the visibility and perceived support of certain projects. Surprise!, because it‚Äôs in a decentralized system, it can‚Äôt even be proven with ease. When these Sybil identities coordinate their donations, they manipulate Gitcoin‚Äôs Quadratic Funding (QF) system, leading to an unfair distribution of funds. Instead of fostering genuine community-driven impact, this shifts the focus towards gaming the system for personal gain. The result is a distorted funding landscape where authentic projects are overshadowed by those artificially inflated through such exploitative tactics, ultimately harming the integrity of the platform and disadvantaging legitimate participants‚Ä¶</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Rethinking Quadratic Funding (QF)</strong></p>\n<p>In the paper ‚ÄúA Flexible Design for Funding Public Goods‚Äù by Buterin, Hitzig, and Weyl, quadratic funding (QF) is largely described as a mechanism that aims to achieve near-optimal public goods provision by subsidizing smaller contributions more heavily than larger ones, thereby encouraging a broad base of contributors.</p>\n<p>However, if the mechanism disproportionately favours projects with founders that have established networks, it would fail to allocate resources efficiently across all potential public goods based on potential impact in start-up cases, and scalable impact for established ones.</p>\n<p>This leads to suboptimal outcomes where only the most established or popular projects receive adequate funding, while potentially valuable but lesser-known or new initiatives remain underfunded. Thus, defeating the stated purpose of QF ‚Äì near-optimal funding allocation.</p>\n<p>Startups are typically looking for initial funding to prove their concept, while established projects are focused on scaling. Since these two groups have such different goals, it doesn‚Äôt seem fair to review them using the same criteria.</p>\n<p>Quadratic Funding (QF) is a big part of how Gitcoin distributes funds, aiming to make the process more democratic by boosting smaller contributions. But after seeing it in action thrice, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that it actually ends up being more of a ‚Äúself-congratulatory circle-jerk‚Äù (pardon my bluntness!). The focus seems to shift from making a real impact to a sort of inward praise among participants, which doesn‚Äôt always foster true innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>A Friendly Suggestion</strong></p>\n<p>QF should perhaps be limited to no more than a third of the weight in the final allocation, with the rest being decided by multiple groups:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Peer Review Group: This group would consist of project leaders who are asked to distribute points (say, 100 points) across other projects based on their perceived impact. They wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to vote for their own projects. To encourage thoughtful participation, there could be penalties for not distributing points fairly, such as reducing their grant by 20%. Conversely, those who take the time to distribute their points across multiple projects could be rewarded. This would promote a more honest and impactful assessment from peers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specialized Expert Group: This group could include experts who focus on evaluating the potential impact of startups and the scalable impact of established projects. By applying criteria tailored to each project‚Äôs stage, this group could ensure that funding goes to those with the highest potential for real-world impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Community Advisory Group: This could be a group of community members or stakeholders who have a vested interest in the outcomes of the projects but are not directly involved in them. Their role would be to offer perspectives on how projects align with broader community needs and values. Because this group would not require deep technical expertise, it could be a low-cost but high-impact way to incorporate diverse views into the decision-making process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Low-Cost Review Panels: Gitcoin could also introduce low-cost review panels, made up of volunteers or part-time reviewers from within the community. These panels would focus on specific aspects such as ethical considerations, environmental impact, or inclusivity. By decentralizing this aspect of the review, Gitcoin can tap into a wider pool of knowledge without significantly increasing costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pitch Panels: Another idea could be a panel where each project pitches their ideas, similar to how athletes are scored in the Olympics. Each project would present its case for why it deserves funding, and the panel would score them based on factors like innovation, potential impact, and scalability. This not only makes the review process more interactive but also ensures that projects are evaluated based on a comprehensive understanding of their value.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One additional benefit of giving QF a lower weight in the final allocation is that it would make the system less attractive for Sybil attacks and other types of gaming. When QF determines a smaller portion of the overall funding, it becomes less worthwhile for bad actors to try and manipulate the system. This would help make the grant rounds more equitable, as fewer resources would be needed for defending against these types of attacks, allowing more funds to be directed toward creating diverse and effective review groups that enhance the overall decision-making process.</p>\n<p><strong>Making Everything Public and Transparent</strong></p>\n<p>Since QF is public and you can see who votes for which project, it makes sense that the decisions of these other groups should also be made public. Transparency should be a core value across the board, ensuring that every aspect of the grant process is open for review.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Specialized Expert Groups: These groups could publish reports detailing the rationale behind their votes. By explaining why they supported certain projects, they could help the community understand the thought process behind the funding decisions, making the whole process more transparent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Community Advisory Groups: Similarly, these groups could share their decision-making process with the public. They could explain how they assessed the alignment of projects with community values and broader societal needs, helping to build trust in the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Low-Cost Review Panels: Even though these panels might be composed of volunteers or part-time reviewers, they could still post their findings and decisions. By making their evaluations public, they would contribute to the overall transparency and fairness of the process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pitch Panels: For the pitch panels, the process could be even more interactive. Hosting these pitches on platforms like Twitter Spaces or other live-streaming services would allow the community to listen in and see how projects are being scored in real-time. A one-minute pitch format could be used, where the jury votes based on the pitch‚Äôs clarity, innovation, and potential impact. This would make the process not only transparent but also engaging for the wider community.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Learning from Public Tenders</strong></p>\n<p>There‚Äôs a lot that Gitcoin could learn from how public tenders are conducted, especially when it comes to transparency and fairness:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Open Submission and Review Processes: In public tenders, all submissions are reviewed publicly, and the criteria for selection are clearly defined beforehand. Gitcoin could adopt this model by ensuring that every project submission is visible to the community and that the criteria used by different review panels are shared upfront. This transparency would help avoid any perception of bias or favoritism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Detailed Evaluation Reports: Just as public tenders often require detailed evaluation reports that explain why certain bids were successful, Gitcoin could ensure that all review groups publish comprehensive reports that detail the reasoning behind their decisions. These reports would be invaluable for projects that were not selected, providing them with the feedback needed to improve and succeed in future rounds.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Public Feedback Loops: Public tenders often include a feedback loop where participants can ask for clarifications or contest decisions. Gitcoin could implement a similar process, allowing project teams to receive constructive feedback and, if necessary, request further explanation of the decisions. This would enhance transparency and promote a more collaborative environment where projects can grow and evolve.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clear Conflict of Interest Policies: Public tenders typically have strict rules to prevent conflicts of interest. Gitcoin could further strengthen its processes by implementing and enforcing clear conflict-of-interest policies for all review groups. Ensuring that reviewers do not have a vested interest in the projects they evaluate would help maintain the integrity of the grant process.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, tools like the ReFi Scorecard could be useful in structuring this assessment, and it can serve as a point of reference. The tool illustrates how different criteria should be applied depending on a project‚Äôs stage of development. Startups and established projects can‚Äôt be reviewed under the same lens because they are at different stages and have different objectives. Startups should be evaluated based on their potential impact, aiming to prove their concept and gain initial traction, while established projects should be assessed based on their scalable impact, focusing on how they can grow and sustain their influence.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://anuinitiative.org/refiscorecard/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/f/fb41a00ef9e302ac3ebf3ec8aa3750e82984540d.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"3E464F\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://anuinitiative.org/refiscorecard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" title=\"09:08PM - 28 August 2024\">Anu Initiative - Trusty Tech in service of Mother Nature - SOLVING THE PROBLEMS... ‚Äì 28 Aug 24</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/8/85674f38c30702b9d806b058114807fed61d96a4_2_500x500.png\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"77787E\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://anuinitiative.org/refiscorecard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ReFi Scorecard - Anu Initiative - Trusty Tech in service of Mother Nature</a></h3>\n\n  <p>A simple tool designed to evaluate Regenerative Finance (ReFi) projects.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/thoughts-on-gg20-and-gg21/19304\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/thoughts-on-gg20-and-gg21/19304","pubDate":"Sun, 01 Sep 2024 13:16:43 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19304"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/thoughts-on-gg20-and-gg21/19304.rss","#text":"Thoughts on GG20 and GG21"},"filter":false},{"title":"We Donated to Gitcoin Projects with Credit Card! - Review of PayPal Fiat Payments in GG21","dc:creator":"noahchonlee","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>We put credit card payments on-chain!!!<br>\nPEW PEW PEW PEW (As <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/m0nkeyfl0wer\">@M0nkeyFl0wer</a> would say) <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12\" title=\":raised_hands:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":raised_hands:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/partying_face.png?v=12\" title=\":partying_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":partying_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/tada.png?v=12\" title=\":tada:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":tada:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>See how the <a href=\"http://viaPrize.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">viaPrize.org</a> team built that for our platform here - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/19LFDAIDsB0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/19LFDAIDsB0</a></p>\n<p>We are a full-time team of 5 with our only funding as of now by Gitcoin donations from &gt;2,000 people and a couple thousand dollars in revenue (See our gratitude post and story here - <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-appreciations-thread/18332\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Gitcoin Appreciations Thread</a>)</p>\n<p>So once we built this, we asked how we could build this for the Gitcoin community and you can see this thread as we request a grant for this: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/10-000-donated-to-gitcoin-zuzalu-round-with-credit-card-pilot-project-proposal/18827\">https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/10-000-donated-to-gitcoin-zuzalu-round-with-credit-card-pilot-project-proposal/18827</a></p>\n<p><strong>Demo</strong><br>\nSo yeah, we built fiat donations to Gitcoin projects!

Both can learn from data, but biological networks do so through experience and evolution, while AI networks require structured training.</p>\n<p>In AI, a neuron is a computational unit that takes input, performs a mathematical operation (such as a weighted sum), and produces an output that is passed to the next layer of neurons.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/273e81c41675a56db8f187c3c72a097436ad8b25.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/273e81c41675a56db8f187c3c72a097436ad8b25\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-08-26 at 10.11.11 AM\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/273e81c41675a56db8f187c3c72a097436ad8b25_2_690x275.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-26 at 10.11.11 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"5BaxAwsyUianppb2ezSAJe7r9g9\" width=\"690\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/273e81c41675a56db8f187c3c72a097436ad8b25_2_690x275.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/273e81c41675a56db8f187c3c72a097436ad8b25_2_1035x412.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/273e81c41675a56db8f187c3c72a097436ad8b25_2_1380x550.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F5F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>These neurons are organized into layers, with the input layer receiving data, the hidden layers performing intermediate computations, and the output layer generating the final result, often leading to action.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/292c12ec1ded743b5cd4a98965d481e08263bb39.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/292c12ec1ded743b5cd4a98965d481e08263bb39\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-08-26 at 10.11.42 AM\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/292c12ec1ded743b5cd4a98965d481e08263bb39_2_690x271.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-26 at 10.11.42 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"5Se0gcVr9itAi9IMRdbLBv48jt7\" width=\"690\" height=\"271\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/292c12ec1ded743b5cd4a98965d481e08263bb39_2_690x271.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/292c12ec1ded743b5cd4a98965d481e08263bb39_2_1035x406.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/292c12ec1ded743b5cd4a98965d481e08263bb39_2_1380x542.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F2F2F2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The strength of AI neural networks lies in their ability to process vast amounts of data and identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent to human observers.</p>\n<p>Through training techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent, AI neural networks can learn from data, adjust their internal parameters, and improve their performance over time.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/4/4c818b0c7c45e456140482f893e2f2d6b86347c1.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/4c818b0c7c45e456140482f893e2f2d6b86347c1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/4/4c818b0c7c45e456140482f893e2f2d6b86347c1_2_511x253.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"aUNPCS0XPHBQmXO9QZWigIKVVpT\" width=\"511\" height=\"253\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/4/4c818b0c7c45e456140482f893e2f2d6b86347c1_2_511x253.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/4/4c818b0c7c45e456140482f893e2f2d6b86347c1_2_766x379.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/4/4c818b0c7c45e456140482f893e2f2d6b86347c1_2_1022x506.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C3C4C6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In both biological and AI neural networks, information processing occurs in layers, where each layer extracts increasingly complex features from the input data. In biological systems, sensory inputs like visual or auditory signals are processed through layers of neurons, with early layers detecting simple features (e.g., edges or tones) and deeper layers integrating these into more complex perceptions (e.g., shapes or melodies). Similarly, in AI neural networks, initial layers identify basic patterns in data, while subsequent layers combine these patterns into higher-level abstractions, enabling tasks like image recognition or language processing. This layered approach allows both systems to efficiently process complex information by breaking it down into simpler components.</p>\n<p>This architecture has led to remarkable achievements in fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of AI neural networks is their ability to solve complex problems by stacking multiple layers of neurons together, forming what is known as a deep neural network. These deep networks are capable of modeling highly nonlinear relationships and capturing intricate patterns in data, making them well-suited for tasks that require sophisticated decision-making and prediction.</p>\n<p>AI systems, through layered neural networks, aim to replicate the adaptive intelligence of biological networks by mimicking the way these natural systems process, learn, and interpret information. While AI is inspired by the structured, layered approach of biological networks, allowing for task-specific pattern recognition and data analysis, it remains a simplified and less flexible counterpart. A goal of AI research is to bridge this gap, striving to create systems that not only perform specific tasks efficiently but also adapt and learn in a manner akin to the dynamic, generalized intelligence found in biological organisms.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-allonets-the-emergence-of-a-new-paradigm-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-3-allonets-the-emergence-of-a-new-paradigm-10\"></a>3.

AlloNets: The Potential</h1>\n<p>The potential benefits of AlloNets are significant. By combining complementary properties of blockchains and neural networks, we have a novel but solid foundation for solving complex 21st century problems.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Blockchains</th>\n<th>Neural Networks</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Good at</td>\n<td>Global, transparent, incorruptible, programmable, stateful, consensus</td>\n<td>recognizing patterns in complex data</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>As more money is routed through AlloNets, it is likely that AlloNets will continue to spin off more data. Neural networks are particularly effective in solving problems in domains where there is a lot of data and where patterns or relationships can be learned from that data.</p>\n<p>The density of data emitted by blockchain networks will give AlloNet a significant tailwind. AlloNet will evolve based on this data, but also learn from the careful stewardship of the onchain neurons by their maintainers. They will also be guided by market pressures and advancements in technologies.</p>\n<p>It is likely that these networks will become more sophisticated and capable of handling increasingly complex tasks. This could lead to a new era of capital allocation, where resources are elegantly distributed in a more efficient, transparent, and effective manner.</p>\n<p>The potential applications of AlloNets are vast and varied. As more data is brought onchain, AlloNets can be used to solve complex socio political problems ranging from fueling public goods funding, collective action, and/or ecosystem growth.</p>\n<p>One of the most promising use cases is the optimization of capital distribution within, and between, DAOs‚Ä¶ especially in the following domains:</p>\n<p><strong>Public Goods Funding:</strong> In traditional economic systems, funding for public goods (such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare) is typically managed by centralized authorities, such as governments or large corporations. However, these centralized systems often suffer from inefficiencies, lack of transparency or interoperability, and misallocation of resources. AlloNet offer an elegant alternative, where funding decisions are made by a network of smart contracts based on predefined criteria and community input. This approach has the potential to improve transparency, reduce inefficiencies, and ensure that resources are precisely allocated to projects that truly benefit the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecosystem Growth</strong>: In the context of blockchain ecosystems, capital allocation is a critical factor in driving growth and innovation. AlloNet can be used to incentivize the development of new projects, reward contributors, and ensure that resources are distributed in a way that aligns with the long-term goals of the ecosystem. By leveraging the programmability of smart contracts, these networks can dynamically adjust capital allocation based on feedback from the community, ensuring that resources are allocated to the most promising and impactful initiatives at scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized Governance:</strong> Decentralized governance is a key feature of many blockchain-based ecosystems, where decisions are made collectively by the community rather than by a centralized authority. AlloNet can play a crucial role in enabling decentralized governance by segmenting, defining, and executing the allocation of resources based on the outcome and processes of those communities‚Ä¶ This can help streamline decision-making processes, reduce the risk of manipulation, and ensure that resources are allocated in a way that reflects the will of the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Solving Coordination Failures</strong> - Coordination failure occurs when individuals or groups are unable to align their actions or decisions, leading to suboptimal outcomes despite the potential for mutual benefit. AlloNet creates new foundations for solving coordination failures by combining the powerful properties of blockchains + neural networks. This approach could minimize the impact of individual biases and central points of failure, fostering better coordination and resource allocation across decentralized networks‚Äã.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating Collective Action</strong> - Collective action is the coordinated effort of a group to achieve a common goal or address a shared problem, often overcoming individual self-interest to benefit the group as a whole. AlloNet can create collective action by aligning participants‚Äô incentives and ensuring that contributions are rewarded fairly and transparently. AlloNets enable a group of individuals or entities to pool resources and make decisions collaboratively, with the assurance that funds will be allocated according to predefined rules without the need for centralized control. This reduces the risk of free-riding and encourages active participation, as the system automatically enforces agreed-upon outcomes, making collective action more attractive, feasible, and scalable.</p>\n<p><strong>Resilience and Adaptability:</strong> One of the key advantages of AlloNet is their ability to adapt to changing conditions and evolve over time. Just as AI neural networks can learn from data and improve their performance, AlloNet can be programmed to respond to changes in market conditions, user behavior, and other external factors. This adaptability makes them well-suited for dynamic and rapidly evolving environments, where traditional capital allocation methods may struggle to keep pace.</p>\n<p>A key opportunity as AlloNets grow is in <strong>economies of scale</strong>. The opportunity for an individual project to be influenced or funded by many different ‚Äúneurons‚Äù will grow as more data and value flows through these networks. There is a network effect at work here. As more contributors contribute, more projects get funded. As more projects get funded, more contributors are drawn. This virtuous, positive-sum cycle repeats ad infinitum.</p>\n<p>An early example of this is Protocol guild. Protocol guild has been funded by multiple neurons (Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap, ENS (Ethereum Name Service), Optimism, Balancer)</p>\n<p>As more and more projects begin allocating capitalfor their own ecosystem public goods, there will be opportunities to pinch off 1-10% of funding here and there for upstream public goods funding. While these amounts may be negligible to each individual contributor, through the economy of scale, they may become significant to the receivers.</p>\n<p>While the potential for AlloNets are immense, we are still a long way from realizing these benefits. The examples above are currently a very small share of the actual allocation work happening on Ethereum. We also don‚Äôt have good abilities for measuring the quality or outcome achieved by AlloNets. Instead, we put capital in and see what comes out the other side. It‚Äôs still early days!</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-6-conclusion-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-6-conclusion-16\"></a>6. Conclusion</h1>\n<p>By drawing upon lessons from AI neural networks, we can begin to envision a future where decentralized networks optimize capital distribution in complex sociopolitical ecosystems. The concept of AlloNets represent a promising convergence of ideas from biology, AI, and blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>These networks have the potential to solve complex problems, upgrade public goods funding, drive ecosystem growth, create collective action, and enable decentralized governance, all while adapting to changing conditions and evolving (as biological systems do) over time.</p>\n<p>However, realizing this vision will require overcoming significant challenges related to complexity, security, scalability, fragmentation, governance, and ethics‚Äîchallenges we cover in the appendix below. If we solve these problems, we can unlock new opportunities for decentralized finance and governance, and pave the way for a more coordinated, egalitarian future.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/110dc756d2673a219696b6ccb4f4e1d77c4512ab.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/110dc756d2673a219696b6ccb4f4e1d77c4512ab\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/110dc756d2673a219696b6ccb4f4e1d77c4512ab_2_526x375.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"2qRDx9Xo1I4EVxCsaXRbX04MHVN\" width=\"526\" height=\"375\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/110dc756d2673a219696b6ccb4f4e1d77c4512ab_2_526x375.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/110dc756d2673a219696b6ccb4f4e1d77c4512ab.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/110dc756d2673a219696b6ccb4f4e1d77c4512ab.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E4E4E6\"></a></div><p></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allonets-a-powerful-approach-to-manfesting-collective-action-in-an-onchain-world/19284\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allonets-a-powerful-approach-to-manfesting-collective-action-in-an-onchain-world/19284","pubDate":"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 16:24:18 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19284"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allonets-a-powerful-approach-to-manfesting-collective-action-in-an-onchain-world/19284.rss","#text":"AlloNets - A Powerful Approach to Manfesting Collective Action in an Onchain World"},"filter":false},{"title":"State of Gitcoin/Grants Lab Q3 2024","dc:creator":"owocki","category":"ü§ñ DAO Governance and Vision","description":"<p>[NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE - this post is made on a best-effort basis as is the opinion of one contributor, and should not be relied upon to make any financial decisions. ]</p>\n<h1><a name=\"state-of-gitcoingrants-lab-q3-2024-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#state-of-gitcoingrants-lab-q3-2024-1\"></a>State of Gitcoin/Grants Lab Q3 2024</h1>\n<p><em>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call it a comeback, I‚Äôve been here for years!‚Äù ‚Äì LL Cool J</em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"asks-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#asks-2\"></a>Asks</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>If you‚Äôre building an ecosystem, consider adding the powerful capital allocation tools built by Gitcoin to the mix.</li>\n<li>We offer the following types of campaigns for growth-oriented ecosystems: Quadratic Funding, Retroactive Funding, Conviction Voting, Grants Ships.
