Over the past two months, we‚Äôve been focused on incorporating the prototype into the live product for GG20.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"cross-chain-widget-for-gg20-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#cross-chain-widget-for-gg20-3\"></a>Cross-chain widget for GG20</h2>\n<p>Today, we‚Äôre happy to share that the cross-chain component powered by <a href=\"https://across.to/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Across Protocol</a> is live, together with the the start of GG20. Watch the demo below, or check out the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IDriss_xyz/status/1782779173196701708\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">announcement thread</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKo4-tp5aE0\">Gitcoin cross-chain donation widget for Twitter by IDriss</a></p>\n\n<p>Specification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We support donations in ETH on 6 major EVM chains: Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, Linea, Optimism, zkSync Era.</li>\n<li>The test round in the demo above is deployed on Optimism, so what you‚Äôre seeing is an Arbitrum to Optimism cross-chain donation.</li>\n<li>The $0.24 you see on the demo is a fee necessary to perform the bridging operation. This fee varies, and it‚Äôs often as low as $0.05. You can find more information about the bridge fees in the <a href=\"https://docs.across.to/reference/fees-in-the-system#relayer-fees\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Across Protocol‚Äôs documentation</a>.</li>\n<li>We didn‚Äôt have to compromise on speed; it‚Äôs comparable to regular transfers. Across has consistently maintained its reputation as the fastest and lowest-cost bridge for end-users. Their recent milestone of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocol/status/1778770155218370694\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">crossing $7B in all-time volume</a> attests to its reliability.</li>\n<li>We set a minimum donation amount of $1. This ensures that bridging relayers can process transactions smoothly, without significantly limiting donors (usually $1 was the minimum amount eligible for matching).</li>\n<li>If for any reason the bridge transaction cannot be processed (e.g. donation is sent just before the round end), the donor receives back their funds after 6 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the code is open-source and can be verified here: <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/browser-extensions\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">browser extension</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/contracts/blob/DonationWrapper/src/contracts/DonationWrapper.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">smart contract</a>.  No user funds are stored, and there are no token approvals. The contract code has undergone a sanity check by an independent smart contract developer.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"matching-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#matching-4\"></a>Matching</h2>\n<p>The question that naturally comes to mind is: will these donations be matched?</p>\n<p>Unlike the same-chain donations we built for GG18, where all the donations fell into the Gitcoin indexer pipeline and were therefore automatically included for matching and showed up in the history page, the cross-chain donation component required us to introduce a wrapper smart contract, consequently obfuscating the original donor.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôve developed and proposed a non-invasive solution for including these donations in the matching calculations with minimal effort and no changes to the Allo protocol. Donations made through our extension issue onchain attestations via the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eas_eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ethereum Attestation Service</a>. These attestations are issued in a decentralized manner, making them immune to spoofing or alteration. You can read the complete technical explanation of the solution <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/browser-extensions/blob/master/CONTRACTS.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Knowing about the plans to make Allo the ultimate composable funding allocation protocol, we think this is something worth solving not only for GG20 but also for any future dev teams building independent frontends.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"about-us-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#about-us-5\"></a>About Us</h2>\n<p>For those of you who don‚Äôt know us yet, you can follow our work on the channels listed below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.idriss.xyz/gitcoin\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin Grant</a>  - <a href=\"https://www.idriss.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Website</a>  -  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IDriss_xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a>  -  <a href=\"https://warpcast.com/idriss\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Farcaster</a>  -  <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RJhJKamjw5\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Discord</a>  -  <a href=\"https://idriss.mirror.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mirror Blog</a>  -  <a href=\"https://docs.idriss.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Docs</a>  -  <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p>Feedback and ideas are very welcome.

Stay tuned for more takeaways and follow ups, including a S21 wrapup/Q2 lookahead from Grants Lab and our $50M GMV strategy.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"day-1-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#day-1-1\"></a>Day 1:</h1>\n<p>We kicked off with a joint session across Passport, Grants Lab, and Ecosystem Collective. <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle\">@kyle</a> led a welcome session and a preview of the days ahead. We played a fun game of Human Bingo as an icebreaker ‚Äì kudos <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan\">@CoachJonathan</a> for organizing. I‚Äôd be remiss not to note that the Grants Lab product team ( <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/melissa\">@melissa</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/michelle_ma\">@michelle_ma</a> and yours truly) brought home the proverbial bingo trophies.</p>\n<p>We also held a Q&amp;A where the team was invited to send anonymous questions answered by leaders across the DAO. We received over 20 questions that led to a great discussion. We should do this format more often ‚Äì I will plan to roll it out for GL Monthly Meetings. <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet\">@deltajuliet</a> is leading a summary of the Q&amp;A that will be posted to the governance forum, and raw questions can be found here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iwrEctEaW7gKYTkOCy_NkK1WxLb_YfT9exfDE_lhhd8/edit?usp=sharing\">Lisbon Q&amp;A</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, we held a presentation by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> and myself on the <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/whitepaper\">Gitcoin 2.0 Whitepaper</a>. This was a great review and deep engagement and discussion from the team.</p>\n<p>Many of the Q&amp;A questions centered around Gitcoin‚Äôs financial strategy, which myself, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet\">@deltajuliet</a> , and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> spent time at the offsite talking about. You‚Äôre already seeing posts from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet\">@deltajuliet</a> roll out (<a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-sgtm-001-converting-5m-gtc-to-stables/18583/13\">link</a> and <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/temp-check-sgtm-000-treasury-management-strategy-for-gitcoin-v1/18564/6\">link</a>) in executing our 18-month financial strategy. We‚Äôre focused on using our existing treasury and current bull market conditions to buy ourselves time and stability. This may include diversification of GTC into stablecoins, investigating yield generation efforts, and more.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, the Grants Lab team is focused on building network effects for eventual financial sustainability. The most important thing is to build Allo GMV growth and widespread Allo adoption (including, but not limited to Grants Stack adoption.) While we are focused on adoption, we will trial value capture mechanisms to validate that value capture can work at scale. After network effects are achieved, we will focus on scaling value capture mechanisms with the goal of financial upside and eventual financial sustainability.</p>\n<p>We will provide regular updates and revisit these goals in 12-18 months!</p>\n<h1><a name=\"day-2-3-grants-lab-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#day-2-3-grants-lab-2\"></a>Day 2 &amp; 3 (Grants Lab)</h1>\n<p>The Grants Lab + RPP teams spent the bulk of the retreat talking about how to increase Allo GMV. We have a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù goal of $15M in 2024. This is based on our $5M GMV achieved in 2023 and feels like an achievable, business-as-usual goal for this year and we‚Äôre tracking this publicly. We also have a stretch goal of $50M in 2024. This is our BHAG ‚Äì we think it is totally achievable if we get creative and push ourselves to think outside the box.</p>\n<p>We spent a lot of time building context on the market, our pipeline, and our competitors. This info can be found here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Htik9cxGWNLO0hBgE-7NF5CMJ4bBX6LAkRKeGmK314w/edit#slide=id.g2c7116ea714_0_43\">Day 2 - Allo GMV 2024</a>. We identified a number of areas that we need to focus on or improve in order to hit our goals. These include optimizing our sales cycle &amp; time to close, expanding our partnerships with current clients, and opening up more opportunities with organizations that are primed for growth this cycle.</p>\n<p>We explored and brainstormed different ways to hit $50M GMV this year and took bets on where they might come from: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18g5YuBU2DJOGTEbtWupZhrdBEraqQ1c-dXq-JiYI0CU/edit#heading=h.q58f0nx5vrm9\">$50gmv betting exercise</a>. We have a clear focus on selling into large treasuries as well as a number of bets we can place in innovative product and GTM strategies.</p>\n<p>With that innovation in mind, we also talked about where opportunities lie across different mechanisms. QF is our bread and butter, and we will continue to invest in making this an excellent product. Easy RPGF could be big ‚Äì or not! We‚Äôll be able to tell after the pilot program, which is currently running. We also believe that there is still lots of potential for Direct Grants, but we need to improve the product &amp; marketing for this to be successful.</p>\n<p>We were lucky to welcome the Rapid Prototyping Pod into Grants Lab meetings during the offsite and really enjoyed this collaboration. There‚Äôs been discussions about the future home of RPP now that <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> is taking on the CTO role in Grants Lab. We will evaluate this quarter on where this should live in the future.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"day-2-3-ecosystem-collective-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#day-2-3-ecosystem-collective-3\"></a>Day 2 &amp; 3 (Ecosystem Collective)</h1>\n<p>Thanks <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan\">@CoachJonathan</a> for these notes!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day 1 - Personal Development\n<ul>\n<li>Improvisation workshop\n<ul>\n<li>The team took an hour out of their afternoon to do a series of activities meant to spur creativity and encourage being OK with making mistakes &amp; the discomfort that comes with that</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://treehouseinnovation.com/innovation-impact-assessments/innovation-impact-assessment/\">Design Thinking Test</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Design Thinking is an incredibly powerful methodology that forces implementers to tap into their emotional intelligence to design better for their users</li>\n<li>This assessment provided the team a look at what skills and behaviors that have &amp; are lacking in order to bolster their design thinking chops</li>\n<li>Results were discussed, recorded and input into a personal development implementation plan that will be reviewed every 4-6 weeks to ensure that is gradual progress and mastery in this domain</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Peer Review Disucssion\n<ul>\n<li>Ahead of the retreat, each team member provided &amp; received feedback from fellow team members to give them a sense of where their strengths &amp; areas of improvement are</li>\n<li>An open discussion provided an opportunity for team members to provide more context and for individuals to come up with plans/strategies to capitalize on areas of improvement</li>\n<li>Everything was recorded and input into a personal development implementation plan that will be reviewed every 4-6 weeks to ensure that is gradual progress toward identified areas of improvement</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Day 2 &amp; 3 - Coworkiung\n<ul>\n<li>Community-facing OKRs\n<ul>\n<li>Reviewing the OKRs set in our budget renewed our focus on aligning our work to accomplish what we set out to do at the beginning of the season</li>\n<li>We looked not just at ‚Äúwhere are we now and where are we going‚Äù but also from the perspective of ‚Äúhow do we bring the community along with us?‚Äù</li>\n<li>What opened up was a broader conversation about our ‚ÄúInnovation‚Äù focus area and new ideas on how to loop in Citizens</li>\n<li>More will be shared on this initiative at the start of S22 at our mid-term budget review</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Brand Narrative Building\n<ul>\n<li>Gitcoin has long struggled to land firmly between its Regen narrative &amp; credibly neutral protocols - credibly neutral &amp; Regens (who are not credibly neutral) are naturally misaligned</li>\n<li>Discussion about how to bridge this gap was the main focus of several conversations</li>\n<li>Another challenge was trying to weave in all the other narratives that we‚Äôve once taken up around Quadratic Lands, Green Pill, Public Goods, etc. all while staying 100% committed to seeing Gitcoin find financial long-term sustainability</li>\n<li>We landed in a really great spot and the community can expect to see posts about this in our governance forum and later manifested in the form of events and inspiring &amp; exciting online community activaitons</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Coworking\n<ul>\n<li>The team took the opportunity to move forward on a number of projects including:\n<ul>\n<li>EthCC planning</li>\n<li>Future collaborations with CrowdMuse</li>\n<li>Roadmapping and project management</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-4\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to spend time with the full team ‚Äì this only happens once a year and I truly appreciate the time people take away from their busy schedules.

Here is the question I am interested in getting feedback on - <strong>Is it okay for Gitcoin‚Äôs dApps (like Passport, or Grants Stack) to create projects and apply to participate in GG20 as other grantees/projects normally would?</strong></p>\n<p>Gitcoin has been given a large amount of matching pool funds to be distributed using the QF mechanism with the intention of funding Ethereum‚Äôs Public Goods. To date, Gitcoin has distributed a large amount of this funding to a variety of projects across a number of categories (DeFi, Climate, NFTs, OSS, Community, etc.). Gitcoin facilitates the grants rounds using our credibly neutral QF mechanism and we have been responsible for driving user participation in those rounds and drawing in community donations to support future rounds.</p>\n<p>I want to better understand if the community has concerns with Gitcoin participating in these rounds as projects/grantees as well. No special treatment in Grants Stack would be provided to the Gitcoin Projects, but because the funds were earmarked for funding Ethereum‚Äôs public goods, it would be great to have Gitcoin‚Äôs dApps participate in that funding. Ultimately donors will decide if they want to donate, but allowing access/inclusion in the round would be valuable.</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts? Would you donate to a Gitcoin project?

Differentiate between proposals based on how they are enforced.</strong></p>\n<p>Currently there are 4 types of proposals: funding, ratification, governance and reallocation and no difference between regular proposals and community proposals. However there is some overlap between the four categories and some proposals which do not fall in any of the other three categories are posted as governance proposals by default.</p>\n<p>In order to provide a clear distinction as well as guidelines for future proposers the following changes are suggested.</p>\n<p>Implement two master categories: Onchain and Offchain and two sub categories for each. The proposer can follow this flowchart to identify which type of proposal they are making irrespective of where they lie in the ecosystem orbit</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/a/ada36bc4facbc311b91355ac12dbd8130f4fd6ce.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/ada36bc4facbc311b91355ac12dbd8130f4fd6ce\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 15.32.02\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/ada36bc4facbc311b91355ac12dbd8130f4fd6ce_2_690x220.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 15.32.02\" data-base62-sha1=\"oM4JgVDltjYv32CTDlxmmyWt9Qq\" width=\"690\" height=\"220\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/ada36bc4facbc311b91355ac12dbd8130f4fd6ce_2_690x220.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/ada36bc4facbc311b91355ac12dbd8130f4fd6ce_2_1035x330.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/ada36bc4facbc311b91355ac12dbd8130f4fd6ce_2_1380x440.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E9E9E9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"definations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#definations-4\"></a>Definations</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Offchain</th>\n<th>Offchain</th>\n<th>Onchain</th>\n<th>Onchain</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Social</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Legal</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Admin</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Token</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Agreements enforceable by peer pressure which do not require changes to any contracts.</td>\n<td>Agreements enforced by the legal system and which involve updating the legal setup</td>\n<td>Agreements enforced by the blockchain which involves Making changes onchain without changing token balance</td>\n<td>Agreements enforced by the blockchain which requires changing token balance</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Examples:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Social</th>\n<th>Legal</th>\n<th>Admin</th>\n<th>Token</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Establishing/modifying DAO cadence</td>\n<td>Electing/removing foundation director</td>\n<td>Updating governor contracts</td>\n<td>Sending/receiving/depositing/withdrawing/staking/lending/borrowing tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modifying essential intents</td>\n<td>Establishing/disbanding legal entities such as Grant Lab</td>\n<td>Forming/disbanding multi-sigs</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modifying/electing council members (CSDO/Grants council)</td>\n<td>Dissolving the foundation</td>\n<td>Adding/removing members to any multi-sig</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modifying program or product policies</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Delegating tokens</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adding/removing partners</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Adding/removing Hats to a member or a multi-sig</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Establishing/modifying constitution</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Changing Governance policies, tooling or other mechanics</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Based on what a proposal finally aims to achieve, the proposer can decide on a category and subcategory and proceed with the governance flow.

Create a DAO constitution</strong></p>\n<p>In order to solidify the core principles of the DAO, a constitution which captures high level goals of the DAO should be created.

This also includes removing older unexisting structure such as Workstreams</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recategorise and organise governance roles from various types to three main types: Multi-sig signer, Pod Member and Governooor. Each of these categories can then include subcatgories to signal specific subroles such as matching pool guardian or CSDO member as MS signer. WS lead, Ecosystem contributor, core contributor as a pod member. Steward, delegator and governance coordinator as governooor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delegate the responsibility for updating the manual to the governance coordinator: Since the manual only reflects changes made by gitcoin governance, updating it should not require a DAO vote.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#next-steps-5\"></a>Next Steps:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Collect feedback from the community</li>\n<li>Submit a formal proposal</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-addressing-immediate-gaps-in-dao-governance/18620\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-addressing-immediate-gaps-in-dao-governance/18620","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 09:33:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18620"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-addressing-immediate-gaps-in-dao-governance/18620.rss","#text":"[Discussion] Addressing immediate gaps in DAO governance"},"filter":false},{"title":"[Proposal] Gitcoin (Grants Lab) x Wonderland Partnership","dc:creator":"deltajuliet","category":"üìú Proposals","description":"<h2><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR:</h2>\n<p>We‚Äôre asking for 31.25k GTC /mo for a 4-year engagement (1.5M GTC total) with Wonderland to Build Allo Protocol.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wonderland\">@Wonderland</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/meglister\">@meglister</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> for co-creating this proposal. <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12\" title=\":pray:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":pray:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Wonderland (<a href=\"https://defi.sucks/\">defi.sucks</a>) is a team of developers, researchers, and creators who love building innovative solutions.

They will act as embedded strategic partners, deeply integrated into our development processes, providing comprehensive evaluations and actionable insights to refine our offerings.

This engagement with Wonderland will ensure that Allo protocol is a world class protocol + eventually ecosystem.</p>\n<p>By leveraging Wonderland‚Äôs expertise in protocol development we can ensure the right architecture, implementation, and velocity to pursue the highest potential outlined in the Whitepaper and Rainbow Paper.</p>\n<p>The Gitcoin Protocol has been reinvented 4 times already (dgrants in 2021, 2022 era development, Allo v1 in 2023, Allo v2 in 2024).

This will be reflected in future budget requests.</p>\n<p>A vesting schedule after a successful initial 2 month engagement to Wonderland at 1.5 million GTC tokens, vesting over 48 months and managed transparently on-chain. This proposal is requesting these funds from Gitcoin‚Äôs treasury.</p>\n<p>Gitcoin will create a four-year vesting schedule for 1.5 million GTC tokens. The tokens will begin to vest linearly from their starting date (TBC based on this proposal‚Äôs reception). Additionally, there is a two-month cliff; should Wonderland‚Äôs contract be terminated before the 2-month trial period ends, Gitcoin has the ability to activate the clawback function and reclaim 100% of the tokens. After the two-month mark, Gitcoin retains the right to retrieve all unvested tokens if the agreement is terminated. Both parties may terminate this agreement at any time effective immediately upon 15-days prior written notice to the other party due to any failure of either party‚Äôs obligations under what‚Äôs stated in this proposal.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the two-month trial, the Grants Lab team, led by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/meglister\">@meglister</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> , will assess Wonderland‚Äôs contributions and update this forum with their findings and guidance on continuing this partnership.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"wonderlands-partner-feedback-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#wonderlands-partner-feedback-7\"></a>Wonderland‚Äôs Partner Feedback</h2>\n<p>From <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wonderland\">@Wonderland</a> : Don‚Äôt trust, verify.

It emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extendable code that accomplishes a single task well. This philosophy is foundational to the development and design of Unix and its various offspring, including Linux. Key tenets of the Unix philosophy include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make each program do one thing well: Instead of creating complex programs that attempt to do many tasks, Unix encourages developers to build simple programs focused on one task. This makes the programs easier to develop, understand, and maintain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program: This encourages the design of programs that can work together, using pipelines and filters to pass data from one utility to another.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks: This principle emphasizes the importance of quick prototyping and iterative development.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build a prototype as soon as possible: Similar to ‚Äútry early‚Äù, this principle pushes for a working model that can be tested and improved upon, rather than trying to make it perfect the first time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use software leverage to your advantage: Reuse code when possible instead of reinventing the wheel, benefiting from the collective effort of the developer community.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Unix philosophy has influenced not only the development of Unix and Linux but also the design of software and operating systems across the computing landscape. It emphasizes efficiency, simplicity, and the importance of open standards and interoperability.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"why-is-the-unix-philosophy-powerful-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#why-is-the-unix-philosophy-powerful-4\"></a>Why is the Unix Philosophy powerful?</h2>\n<p>The Unix philosophy‚Äôs power lies in its emphasis on simplicity, modularity, and composability, principles that make software development more efficient and maintainable. By advocating for programs that do one thing well and work together seamlessly, it ensures systems are both robust and adaptable. This approach reduces complexity, making software easier to understand, debug, and enhance over time. Additionally, the focus on a universal interface and the encouragement of rapid prototyping and tool reuse accelerates development and fosters innovation, allowing developers to quickly iterate on ideas and leverage existing solutions.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Unix philosophy‚Äôs emphasis on portability and open standards has broadened software‚Äôs utility and longevity, ensuring applications can run across different environments and evolve alongside technological advances. This has not only democratized access to technology but also cultivated an ecosystem where interoperability and collaboration are foundational . As a result, the Unix philosophy has had a profound and lasting impact on software engineering, influencing not just Unix-derived systems but the broader landscape of computing and development practices.</p>\n<p>The modular approach supports the dynamic, distributed nature of DAOs like Gitcoin‚Äôs. The unix philosophy enables continuous integration, development, and community-driven innovation, making it a fitting philosophy for this new era of software development.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"monolithic-software-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#monolithic-software-5\"></a>Monolithic software</h2>\n<p>Monolithic software contrasts sharply with the Unix philosophy through its approach to design and functionality. Where the Unix philosophy advocates for simplicity, modularity, and the development of small, interoperable programs that each perform one task well, monolithic software typically bundles a wide range of functionalities within a single codebase. This integration means that tasks and features in monolithic applications are deeply entwined, making it challenging to modify, update, or scale individual components without affecting the entire system. As a result, monolithic systems can become complex and cumbersome, hindering rapid development and adaptability.</p>\n<p>While monolithic applications may initially be simpler to deploy and manage, the Unix philosophy‚Äôs approach typically offers greater efficiency, adaptability, and resilience over the software‚Äôs lifecycle.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"modular-software-gitcoin-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#modular-software-gitcoin-6\"></a>Modular software @ Gitcoin</h2>\n<p>Having built Gitcoin 1.0 the wrong way (cGrants was a monolith that was expensive and slow to maintain)‚Ä¶ I believe that Gitcoin should fully adopt the unix philosophy in its software development.</p>\n<p>This is already partially true.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our software is built upon modular blockchains.</li>\n<li>Allo protocol contains several different strategies: QF, RetroPGF.</li>\n<li>Grants stack contains several small applications:\n<ol>\n<li>Explorer - for browsing grants</li>\n<li>Builder - for building grants</li>\n<li>Manager - for making QF rounds</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But it is also partially false</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Allo strategies are all in the same repository.</li>\n<li>Allo strategies do not have corresponding webapps.</li>\n<li>Grants Stack‚Äôs modular apps are bundled into one repository and for many intents and purposes, one monolithic app.</li>\n<li>We are beginning to develop monolithic tendencies as a team (merging modular tools.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"modular-software-gitcoin-would-enable-bottoms-up-innovation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#modular-software-gitcoin-would-enable-bottoms-up-innovation-7\"></a>Modular software @ Gitcoin would enable bottoms up innovation</h2>\n<p>Right now the core apps at Gitcoin are</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explorer - for browsing grants</li>\n<li>Builder - for building grants</li>\n<li>Manager - for making QF rounds</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These apps work pretty well for what they do‚Ä¶ But let‚Äôs explore things they don‚Äôt do.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explorer is a plain vanilla way of exploring grants.

These incentives will include both ARB tokens and Thrive Points (which will be redeemable at the launch of Thrive DAO this summer). We have tried to strategically target this to drive meaningful participation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These additional bonuses will be available via Thrive Protocol working on behalf of Arbitrum DAO who is a sponsor of the OSS Rounds, the community rounds and other rounds that have applied for funding and fit within certain criteria. See below for more on matching funds below.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>During GG20</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>During the round grantees and community members will be able to claim rewards for posting about the projects they have supported and why they supported them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There will be bonuses for the most popular posts (based on reviewers‚Äô assessments and social media metrics).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There will be token rewards for hosting twitter spaces with other grantees.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There will be rewards for producing content that helps support or onboard new community members.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>After GG20</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Round operators will have incentives for how well they run rounds including paying funds out on time and the assessment of participants.

They do that with a strategically customized mix of incentives and feedback loops tailor made for each community they serve. What that looks like in practice is the assessment of the work of both grantees and grants program operators which is done by sets of reviewers using the same rubric.</p>\n<p>Key considerations of the Rubric we will use: timely execution of milestones, expert review of code, community adoption/ use (if applicable), and a overall assessment of quality from expert and general community reviewers. We will share more on the rubric and opportunities to weigh soon.</p>\n<p>A big thank you to Sejal, Sov, Mathilda, Meg, Laura, and everyone else at Gitcoin. I am so grateful for the thoughtful partnership and graceful brilliance of everyone on both of these teams, as well as all the community members, grantees, and partners who have helped shape this plan. It genuinely feels to me like a win-win-win-win scenario that can generate exponential growth for everyone involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>\n<p>Drive up community participation, project quality and verified impact.

Our plan is based on three lines of thought:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you can only look at donation data, complete Sybil Resistance is impossible in any QF mechanism, no matter how fancy.</li>\n<li>That being said, COCM has a large (though not complete) sybil-reducing effect.</li>\n<li>The passport team has recently introduced a new verification procedure called Passport model based detection, which reduces user burden and appears to be quite effective when combined with COCM.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore, the strategy is clear: use COCM and Passport‚Äôs model based detection for GG20, which will yield a smoother user experience and more sybil resistance.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"wait-whats-cocm-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#wait-whats-cocm-2\"></a>Wait, what‚Äôs COCM?</h1>\n<p>You can think of COCM (Connection-Oriented Cluster Match) as a tweak to the Pairwise Match algorithm suggested by Vitalik. Like Pairwise Match, COCM is based on standard QF and attenuates a project‚Äôs funding if many of its donors have similar donation patterns. However, COCM calculates similarity differently. See <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/wtf-is-cluster-matching-qf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this blog post</a> for a full explanation.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"sybil-resistance-is-at-odds-with-what-we-like-about-qf-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#sybil-resistance-is-at-odds-with-what-we-like-about-qf-3\"></a>Sybil resistance is at odds with what we like about QF</h1>\n<p>QF is commonly understood as a fairly democratic mechanism, in the sense that many small donors can out-class one large donor. It turns out that sybil resistance is at odds with this property.</p>\n<p>The community uses the term ‚Äúsybil‚Äù in many ways, so let‚Äôs clarify what we mean. Imagine a person about to donate to Gitcoin Grants ‚Äì say, $10 to project X, and $4 to project Y. Before checking out, they pause and ask, ‚Äúwhat if I actually split my donations among two separate wallets? I could donate, say, $5 to X and $2 to Y from both wallets, instead of making one big donation.‚Äù If that person wouldn‚Äôt be better off splitting up their donation (regardless of the original donation amounts or the way they split it up), then I‚Äôll say the QF mechanism is sybil resistant, since people are incentivized just to make their whole donation from one account.</p>\n<p>The problem is that any mechanism with this sybil resistance property degenerates into a direct donation mechanism where no matching funds are added. This is because you can apply the logic of the definition in reverse. Imagine that Alice and Bob are two donors to a QF round. Even if Alice and Bob are real people, a mechanism has no way of knowing that their donations aren‚Äôt really two sybil donations from a real user named Charlie, whose cart originally held all of Alice‚Äôs donations plus all of Bob‚Äôs.</p>\n<p>In fact, we could replace Alice and Bob‚Äôs donations with the donations from our hypothetical Charlie ‚Äì and because of our Sybil resistance property, we still get the exact same funding results as before. But now our list of donors is one shorter. So what if we do the same thing again? We can pick two random users, combine their donations, and have a guarantee that our mechanism does the same thing before and after we squish them together.</p>\n<p>Now we‚Äôre in trouble, because we can keep ‚Äúsquishing‚Äù users together until our algorithm is just running on one donor who gave the sum of everybody‚Äôs individual donations. But we already know what QF mechanisms do when there‚Äôs only one donor ‚Äì they don‚Äôt add any matching funds! So our sybil resistant ‚ÄúQF‚Äù mechanism is really just a plain old direct donation mechanism.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"in-experiments-cocm-is-much-less-vulnerable-to-sybil-attacks-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#in-experiments-cocm-is-much-less-vulnerable-to-sybil-attacks-4\"></a>In experiments, COCM is much less vulnerable to Sybil attacks</h1>\n<p>Given that sybil attacks are inevitable in any variation of QF (including COCM), the next step is to see how bad they get. To figure this out, we simulated a bunch of sybil attacks in the donation data for the Zuzalu tech round, which had just over 4,000 donors.</p>\n<p>For each project, we had the top 10 donors to that project make some number of sybils (5, 25, 75, or 100) each. We created these sybils by splitting up the real donations among the appropriate number of new wallets ‚Äì so, no new money was added to the system. Then re-ran QF (or COCM) and saw how much the funding to that project changed. For each amount of sybils per user, we measured the average funding gain across all projects, and the maximum funding gain that any project got. Results are below:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/e/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1_2_475x355.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"x5C85qHCOEzyy0aPIiNVxw3u8vL\" width=\"475\" height=\"355\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1_2_475x355.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1_2_712x532.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/e7ea3acc324bd89a8102da3ba004c08b721aedd1_2_950x710.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This chart makes it pretty clear that COCM is much more resilient to sybil attacks than standard QF.

It may be difficult to generate a large number of sybil accounts that look different enough to get past the attenuation imposed by COCM.</p>\n<p>But this leads to a caveat: there are many, many strategies for generating sybil accounts. I tried many of them, but we didn‚Äôt try all of them, and we certainly don‚Äôt consider ourselves better sybil attack strategists than every other person in the web3 ecosystem. Some attack strategies may be more effective than what we tried.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, these experiments suggest that Gitcoin‚Äôs sybil resistance strategy can be adjusted to have a lighter burden on the user. Next, we‚Äôll describe a new approach to Passport that does just that.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"passports-model-based-detection-provides-lower-user-friction-and-greater-effectiveness-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#passports-model-based-detection-provides-lower-user-friction-and-greater-effectiveness-5\"></a>Passport‚Äôs Model-Based Detection Provides Lower User Friction and Greater Effectiveness</h1>\n<p>The Gitcoin Passport team has recently introduced a Model-Based Detection System. This system analyzes the on-chain history of addresses and compares it to the historical data of known human and sybil addresses. Based on this comparison, the model assigns each address a score ranging from 0 to 100, where a score closer to 0 indicates a higher likelihood of the address being a sybil, and a score closer to 100 suggests a higher probability of the address belonging to a genuine human user.</p>\n<p>This is a very different approach from the Stamp-Based System, in which users are prompted to connect with different identity providers to prove their personhood. In past rounds, we‚Äôve heard many complaints that people find this manual system too difficult to achieve a high enough score for maximum matching.</p>\n<p>One of the advantages of the Model-Based system is that it requires minimum user interaction and could greatly reduce user frustration. The new user experience would be mostly hands-free. Users‚Äô wallets will be automatically scanned in the background and assigned a score based on their history.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we‚Äôre keen to understand if this newer system can provide a level of sybil defense that is at least as effective as Passport Stamps in GG19. We‚Äôll investigate how it would have impacted the results if it had been used instead.</p>\n<p>One of the difficulties with the sybil resistance problem is that there is no answer sheet: we don‚Äôt have a list of confirmed humans and sybils and have to move forward with our best guesses.</p>\n<p>To determine if our solutions are protecting the matching pool from bad actors, we gut-check how our solutions affect which projects get funded. After investigating the projects in the round, a member of our team assigns each project a ‚ÄòLegitimacy Score,‚Äô which is just a hand-wavey approximation. 5 means more legitimate, and 1 means less. When comparing COCM to normal QF, we‚Äôve seen it take matching funds away from projects that have less legitimacy and shift them toward projects that have more.</p>\n<p>If we were to use Model-Based Detection instead of Stamp-Based, we‚Äôd want to see the matching going to the scammy projects be even less while there is an uptick in the matching going to legitimate projects. This is exactly what we see:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184_2_624x323.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"n67rnr4Mv2gtJ5BIeuJF2xCw2E\" width=\"624\" height=\"323\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184_2_624x323.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184_2_936x484.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/029c6fea2db536ae4411bed5ce4884e87849a184_2_1248x646.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EFEFE4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>1 and 2 scoring projects all see a slightly greater reduction in matching funding when switching from Stamps to the Model. This is a positive sign because it means the Model is removing voters from matching who are giving to these scammy projects. At the same time, we see a big increase in matching going to more legitimate projects indicating that the Model predicts most of their voters are human and should stay in the dataset. This is also a great sign!</p>\n<p>COCM alone redistributes 180,233.84 DAI of the matching fund compared to using normal quadratic funding and Gitcoin Passport. When combined with the Model, the redistribution increases to 227,453.29 DAI, representing a 20% increase in redistributed funds.</p>\n<p>Evaluating the impact of the Model without COCM, we find that it still redistributes 82,356.04 DAI. The redistribution shows a moderate to strong positive correlation (0.66) between the effects of COCM and Model on the results. This indicates that both strategies move results in the same direction and provide benefits when used separately. However, the strongest outcome is achieved by using them together.</p>\n<p>In GG19, Gitcoin Passport alone, without COCM, would have redistributed 9,643.46 DAI compared to not using Passport at all. The results show a weak negative correlation (-0.13) with COCM results.</p>\n<p>It is noteworthy that using the Model would lead to significantly improved funding outcomes, representing a substantial change in the effectiveness of sybil detection. Moreover, this can be achieved without requiring the voter to interact beyond sharing their wallet address, greatly reducing user friction.</p>\n<p>The Passport team has done an outstanding job with this model and we‚Äôre very happy to be working with them.</p>\n<p>However, we should make a caveat: the Model-Based system may look more effective today because no attacker has yet had a chance to game this system. On the other hand, people have had many rounds to try and game stamps. We‚Äôll have to reevaluate our strategy as the attackers evolve continuously.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"path-forward-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#path-forward-6\"></a>Path Forward</h1>\n<p>Given these lines of analysis, we are planning for Gitcoin to use COCM and Passport Model-Based Detection as its sybil resistance tools for GG20. We believe this strategy will result in better funding outcomes for grantees and simultaneously reduce donor frustration.</p>\n<p>We also used COCM in GG19 and have since offered it in an extremely limited-beta to select partners. We‚Äôre happy to share that we‚Äôll soon be rolling COCM out as an option for all our partners.</p>\n<p>As we‚Äôve mentioned above, no sybil resistance strategy will be foolproof. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is clearly the best path forward with our current available tools.</p>\n            <p><small>12 posts - 8 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524","pubDate":"Thu, 04 Apr 2024 10:50:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18524"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524.rss","#text":"Our Sybil Resistance Strategy for GG20"},"filter":false},{"title":"[PASSED]Climate Coordination Network: Funding Proposal","dc:creator":"jon-spark-eco","category":"üßô üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/c/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59\" title=\"CCN Logo Draft\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/c/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59_2_517x258.jpeg\" alt=\"CCN Logo Draft\" data-base62-sha1=\"s9Xjn3t90d09HuaQsClPTmxpDF7\" width=\"517\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/c/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59_2_517x258.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/c/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59_2_775x387.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/c/c55cffe7391daba16a521758389afc4481609a59_2_1034x516.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CAD3D4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR</h1>\n<p>In October, the Climate Round ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù from the Gitcoin Grants Program and has since been managed by CCN.

With a primary focus on assisting smallholder farmers, Shamba advocates for sustainable agriculture and employs blockchain for access to emerging financial landscapes, such as climate insurance and carbon markets.</p>\n<p>Through the implementation of ecological data oracles and smart contracts, Shamba streamlines processes related to climate insurance, leading to large cost reductions. The initiative collaborates with various Web 3 climate solutions to establish a more extensive ecosystem and is actively striving to empower smallholder farming communities to issue their own carbon credits. Shamba adopts a comprehensive strategy to mitigate financial risks associated with climate change, foster sustainable practices, and address environmental concerns. Notably, the project has aided over 10,000 farmers in Kenya, with the majority of their funding to date coming from Gitcoin Grants.</p>\n<p><strong>Senken</strong></p>\n<p>Senken‚Äôs aim was to build a regenerative finance marketplace that allowed companies to easily invest in carbon offsets and enter the voluntary carbon markets in the most frictionless way possible. It wasn‚Äôt an easy road but from a mere idea, that was in part fueled by Gitcoin grants, to, in 2023, helping 367 companies invest in climate projects, Senken is now a prominent expert in the field and trusted by world leading companies.</p>\n<p>Senken has created an easy-to-use platform to access the largest selection of climate assets for transparent climate actions and finance. To ensure the quality and integrity of each project, Senken provides additional security and transparency at the data level for verifiable climate impact, purchase, trade and carbon credit retirement to meet the company‚Äôs emission offset needs.</p>\n<p><strong>ReFi DAO</strong></p>\n<p>Regenerative Finance is a field of finance that seeks to create economic systems, practices, and strategies that support regenerative and restorative outcomes in ecological and social systems. ReFi DAO‚Äôs mission is to be a pivotal catalyst in the widespread implementation and adoption of ReFi through a combination of movement-wide, knowledge sharing, opportunity development, fundraising support, onboarding and community empowerment. Aiming to show the power of mission-driven communities, distributed technology and regenerative economics to solve the most pressing challenges of our time.</p>\n<p>ReFi DAO has now supported over 300 founders, held 27 events across the globe, reached 50k downloads on the ReFi Podcast, and grown their online community to thousands of members.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"gitcoin-essential-intents-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#gitcoin-essential-intents-4\"></a>Gitcoin Essential Intents</h2>\n<p>We recognize that these Essential Intents guide Gitcoin. Our work is aligned and will help drive these Essential Intents.</p>\n<p><strong>Network Effects - Maximizing the network effects of our ecosystem to grow product adoption</strong></p>\n<p>The climate round has built a vibrant community of grantees and supporters. As some grantees have begun to graduate from the round, some have already expressed interest in running their own grant rounds for their specific communities. By funding CCN and the Climate program, we will continue to grow our community and grow usage and adoption of Gitcoin‚Äôs products.</p>\n<p><strong>Community First - Cultivating a community that thrives on providing positive change and meaningful engagement</strong></p>\n<p>While Gitcoin ran the Climate program, this essential intent has always been one of our north stars. We have cultivated a rich community of builders and educators all with a mission of making the world a better place through the fight against climate change. These grantees are all making positive changes in the world and engaging with the broader Gitcoin community. CCN is aligned with this, and building and cultivating our community will always be one of the drivers of how we operate.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Longevity - Ensuring the economic health and vitality of Gitcoin</strong></p>\n<p>While we recognize that this proposal requests funds, we hope to be one of the many community rounds paying fees to Gitcoin to run our rounds on the GS platform. In addition, as noted above, we also anticipate grantee communities within the round to begin running their own rounds, which will also produce fees back to Gitcoin.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ccn-mission-and-values-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#ccn-mission-and-values-5\"></a>CCN Mission and Values</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"mission-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#mission-6\"></a>Mission</h3>\n<p>To accelerate climate solutions on a global scale, catalyzing diverse forms of climate action in order to create a sustainable and equitable future for all.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"vision-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#vision-7\"></a>Vision</h3>\n<p>Through strategic grant distribution coupled with support, we empower projects that are dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and serving as essential core infrastructure for web3 climate solutions.

This platform aims to build a registry atop Allo that will bring together details on the broad scope of grant programs within the EVM ecosystem, enabling grant program discovery and improving the application process for grantees and management for grantors while embodying Gitcoin‚Äôs open-source ethos.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#abstract-2\"></a><strong>Abstract:</strong></h3>\n<p>This project is designed to establish a comprehensive and accessible registry of EVM-compatible grant programs, capitalizing on the strengths of the Grantee Accountability Protocol (GAP).</p>\n<p>By developing an on-chain platform built atop Allo Protocol, we aim to streamline the discovery and management of grant programs, making it simpler for grantees to find relevant opportunities and for grantors to maintain up-to-date program information. The initiative focuses on delivering a user-centric interface for exploring grant listings integrated directly with GAP to ensure a seamless, transparent, and efficient process for all stakeholders.</p>\n<p>We are excited to collaborate with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov\">@Sov</a> for this project. Sov has vast experience collaborating with various grant programs and has managed grants program data in the past. His expertise will be crucial in driving the success of this project.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"benefits-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#benefits-motivation-3\"></a><strong>Benefits &amp; Motivation:</strong></h3>\n<p>Grants are crucial for ecosystem development, offering essential funding for projects and initiatives. However, the current grant landscape needs to be more cohesive and clear, which poses challenges. This platform addresses these by simplifying discovery, application, and management processes, fostering ecosystem growth, enhancing transparency, and encouraging community participation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"scope-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#scope-4\"></a><strong>Scope:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An onchain registry of EVM-aligned grant programs built on top of Allo Protocol</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration with Karma GAP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open-source development and community collaboration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"strategic-fit-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#strategic-fit-5\"></a><strong>Strategic Fit:</strong></h3>\n<p>The opportunity presented by this project is multifaceted and deeply aligned with Gitcoin‚Äôs overarching goals. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind its potential impact and value:</p>\n<p><strong>Aligns with Open-Source Development Goals</strong></p>\n<p>Gitcoin has long championed open-source development, recognizing it as a cornerstone of progress within Web3. The platform‚Äôs open-source nature ensures that the community can continuously improve, audit, and extend it, fostering a collective development and learning culture.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhances Transparency Across EVM Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>The project‚Äôs core objective is to create a transparent overview of EVM-aligned grant programs. In the current landscape, finding and applying to these programs can be opaque, with information scattered and processes varying significantly between programs. This platform centralizes and clarifies the available opportunities, making it easier for potential grantees to find relevant programs and for grantors to attract suitable applicants. Such transparency is crucial in building trust and accountability within the ecosystem, encouraging more participation and engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Facilitates Accessibility and Management</strong></p>\n<p>Grantors are empowered to keep their information up-to-date and reflect current opportunities and requirements by enabling the claiming and proactive management of program profiles on the platform. This feature benefits the grantors by ensuring that programs are represented and aids grantees in accessing the most relevant and current opportunities. The ease of access and the ability to directly manage these profiles democratize the grant application process, making it more inclusive and efficient for all parties involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Leverages the Allo Protocol</strong></p>\n<p>Allo‚Äôs design for facilitating on-chain actions and interactions makes it an ideal foundation for this aggregator platform. It offers scalability, security, and integration capabilities with existing Web3 infrastructure. This alignment with Allo harnesses its technical strengths and signifies a strategic collaboration within the Gitcoin ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Presents Broad EVM Ecosystem Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>While the immediate benefits to Gitcoin and its community are clear, this project also presents significant opportunities for the broader EVM ecosystem. By streamlining access to grant programs, the platform can stimulate more active participation across different projects, leading to increased innovation, collaboration, and growth. It catalyzes ecosystem-wide development, supporting projects at various stages and fostering a more interconnected and supportive Web3 community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"risk-assessment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#risk-assessment-6\"></a>Risk Assessment</h3>\n<p>The primary risks involve adoption by grant programs and applicants and the technical challenges of integration. To address these, we will leverage the relationships already built with existing programs along with our in-house development expertise. The work we have already done with Karma GAP demonstrates our ability to execute in both of these areas.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"budget-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#budget-7\"></a>Budget</h3>\n<p>The projected budget for developing and implementing Karma‚Äôs On-Chain Grant Aggregator platform is $40,000. This budget encompasses work across seven key phases, ranging from website design to automating program data aggregation. A high-level breakdown of the phases and estimated LOE is as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>Task</th>\n<th>Resource</th>\n<th>Level of Effort</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Website Design</td>\n<td>Design</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Design Data Model</td>\n<td>Developer</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Frontend Implementation + Allo Registry Integration</td>\n<td>Developer</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Indexer</td>\n<td>Developer</td>\n<td>24</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Backend Work</td>\n<td>Developer</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Populate Registry</td>\n<td>Analyst</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Jobs to Auto Pull Programs</td>\n<td>Developer</td>\n<td>24</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>230</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"project-breakdown-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#project-breakdown-8\"></a>Project breakdown</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"high-level-architecture-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#high-level-architecture-9\"></a>High-Level Architecture</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/1337987ecb5396858c280df7b1029a20655abcd1.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/1337987ecb5396858c280df7b1029a20655abcd1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/1337987ecb5396858c280df7b1029a20655abcd1_2_624x436.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"2K0btGVJzTid7GQnI2s90ndLkv7\" width=\"624\" height=\"436\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/1337987ecb5396858c280df7b1029a20655abcd1_2_624x436.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/1337987ecb5396858c280df7b1029a20655abcd1.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/1337987ecb5396858c280df7b1029a20655abcd1.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F1F3F1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"website-design-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#website-design-10\"></a>Website Design</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Create intuitive, user-friendly Figma designs for the GrantHub website, enabling users to efficiently browse, navigate, and interact with grant program listings. Build a program manager interface to manage their grant program information.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"design-data-model-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#design-data-model-11\"></a>Design Data Model</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Identify all grant program data and design a schema to store it in the Allo registry. Also, design the data models for offchain storage of data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"frontend-implementation-allo-registry-integration-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#frontend-implementation-allo-registry-integration-12\"></a>Frontend Implementation + Allo Registry Integration</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Construct the frontend application based on the Figma designs and seamlessly integrate it with the Allo registry smart contract. This integration will enable program managers to manage their grant programs on-chain effectively. A specific program manager interface will be implemented to facilitate these on-chain management activities. The frontend will be developed as an extension of the existing GAP front end, utilizing React/NestJS frameworks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This integration aims to maintain consistency with the Allo registry by using the same identifiers for projects as found in the registry, ensuring a unified source of truth across the platform.</p>\n<p>In addition to leveraging data directly from the Allo v2 registry, the platform is designed to import and incorporate project data from sources outside of Allo v2. Projects ingested from external sources will be integrated into the Allo v2 registry, providing a comprehensive view of grant programs across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the multi-chain nature of projects within the Web3 space, our platform supports the management of program data across multiple chains. Program managers can select a preferred chain for maintaining their program data, accommodating grant programs‚Äô diverse operational needs. This approach ensures that the GAP architecture includes the multi-chain landscape, offering program managers a tailored and efficient management experience.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"indexer-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#indexer-13\"></a>Indexer</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop dynamic scripts and services designed to continuously monitor and respond to blockchain events associated with grant programs. This includes capturing essential actions such as program creation, updates, and other modifications. The goal is to ensure the Allo registry is always current and the definitive source of truth. Indexed data will be systematically stored, facilitating efficient retrieval and allowing for real-time adjustments to the registry entries (e.g., adding, editing, or removing entries) to maintain their accuracy and relevance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"backend-work-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#backend-work-14\"></a>Backend Work</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a robust backend infrastructure to support frontend operations, data management, and integrations. Design and implement RESTful APIs to serve data to the front end, including lists of grant programs, detailed program information, and submission endpoints.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"populate-registry-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#populate-registry-15\"></a>Populate Registry</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Leverage an existing database containing information on EVM-compatible grant programs as the foundational dataset for creating the new on-chain registry. This process involves extracting and transferring relevant data from Airtable to populate the registry, ensuring an extensive and accurate listing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"jobs-to-auto-pull-programs-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#jobs-to-auto-pull-programs-16\"></a>Jobs to Auto Pull Programs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective:</strong> After initial import, we will develop a continuous automation process for aggregating grant program data from various platforms to ensure the registry remains comprehensive and up-to-date. This will facilitate the integration of new grant programs into the Allo registry via an ongoing job that extracts data from diverse platforms and consolidates it within Allo. The process is designed to leverage both on-chain data directly from the blockchain and off-chain data through our sophisticated Indexer, ensuring a thorough and dynamic update mechanism for the registry.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"ongoing-analytics-and-reporting-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#ongoing-analytics-and-reporting-17\"></a>Ongoing Analytics and Reporting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Integrate analytics tools for tracking user interactions and engagement, providing insights for continuous improvement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong> and <strong>Relevant Metrics</strong>, expanding them can help ensure a comprehensive assessment of the platform‚Äôs success and impact. Here are some ideas:</p>\n<h2><a name=\"milestones-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#milestones-18\"></a>Milestones</h2>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1</strong>: MVP website with read only program data<br>\n<strong>Details</strong>: We will build a basic program registry page that will let anyone browse programs. This will be a barebones website without any bells and whistles like filtering, sorting etc.<br>\n<strong>Timeline</strong>: 2 weeks (will update this to exact date if/when proposal passes)<br>\n<strong>Budget</strong>: $10k</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2</strong>: Implement Program manager functionality<br>\n<strong>Details</strong>: Upon completion of this milestone, program manager will be able to login to the website, fill in program details and write to the Allo registry. The program data will be displayed in the registry page to the public.<br>\n<strong>Timeline</strong>: 1 weeks (we‚Äôll update this to exact date if/when proposal passes)<br>\n<strong>Budget</strong>: $10k</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3</strong>: Aggregate and load program data to registry<br>\n<strong>Details</strong>: Work with analyst to aggregate program data from across the EVM ecosystem and load it into the registry. Come up with a clean process to easily upload program data to the registry. Anyone will be able to view all program info on the website once this milestone is complete.<br>\n<strong>Timeline</strong>: 1 weeks  (we‚Äôll update this to exact date if/when proposal passes)<br>\n<strong>Budget</strong>: $5k</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 4</strong>: Launch fully featured registry with program data<br>\n<strong>Details</strong>: Launch the registry feature with atleast 25 programs listed in the registry. Upon completion of this milestone, anyone will be able to visit the registry page, browse the programs and find all the program details. Program managers will be able to login and add their program details.<br>\n<strong>Timeline</strong>: 2 weeks  (we‚Äôll update this to exact date if/when proposal passes)<br>\n<strong>Budget</strong>: $15k</p>\n<h2><a name=\"acceptance-criteria-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#acceptance-criteria-19\"></a>Acceptance Criteria</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Successful Integration with Karma GAP and Allo v2:</strong> The platform must seamlessly integrate the Grantee Accountability Protocol (GAP) functionalities and leverage Allo v2‚Äôs capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User-friendly Interface for Grantees and Grantors:</strong> The platform should have an intuitive, easy-to-navigate interface that simplifies finding, applying, and managing grants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>** Listing Accuracy:** The information about each grant program must be accurate and up-to-date.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"relevant-metrics-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#relevant-metrics-20\"></a>Relevant Metrics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of Grant Programs Listed (target 100+):</strong> Track the total number of grant programs available on the platform to ensure a broad and diverse range of opportunities for grantees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of Profiles Claimed in First Month (target 10+):</strong> Monitor grant programs‚Äô engagement with the platform, as indicated by the number of programs that claim and manage their profiles. For the initial version (v1), we will implement a manual process for profile claiming. This will involve a simple form on the platform where grant programs can submit requests to claim ownership. Once a claim is verified, the Allo contract‚Äôs ownership transfer feature will manually assign ownership. This approach allows us to carefully verify each claim to ensure legitimacy before considering automation for future iterations. We will develop a structured verification process to confirm the authenticity of claims, learning from these interactions to streamline and automate this process in subsequent versions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User Engagement Rate:</strong> Measure the frequency and duration of user interactions with the platform to gauge its attractiveness and usefulness to the community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interaction with each program page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No. of program filter and search interactions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No. of redirects to the program site</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"team-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#team-21\"></a>Team</h2>\n<p>We are team of developers who have been building <a href=\"https://www.karmahq.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">contributor reputation tools</a> for the past two years.

The selected grantees each demonstrated a unique approach to leveraging their expertise and resources for the community and public good Their applications stood out due to their clear impact, established track records, and thoughtful project objectives. What made these projects stand out was how they‚Äôre not just about new ideas but also about making sure these ideas last and really make a difference.

I loved the diversity of approaches toward their goals. It‚Äôs really important to keep improving impact verification in a way that is standardized across the board when it comes to several data verticals, which could allow communities to be future-proof and resilient to the ever-changing web3 landscape. - Wasabi</p>\n<p>First off, thank you to everyone who applied, it‚Äôs amazing to see so many different corners of our ecosystem working to help fund their communities. We saw 14 strong applications, yet in the end could only select 5 to move forward with receiving matching funds from Gitcoin. For myself, the perspective I used to rank the applications was as follows:</p>\n<p>I tried my best to use only the information provided in the application, however, I knew more about some communities than others, so took a bit of time to explore what I could for those that I did not have any previous touchpoints and felt I needed more context.</p>\n<p>When ranking impact I looked to evaluate both the impact in the specific community round they are looking to run, as well as the ripple impact the round could have on the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p>For experience, I looked at if they had run rounds before from a logistics perspective but if the operators/team/project executing this were capable of bringing in even more funding via donations. Again thinking of the ripple effects outside of the round, based on what I can see, how strongly can they activate their communities?</p>\n<p>Leverage was assessed considering the goals, number of projects expected, operator experience, and current matching fund amount, recognizing the potential impact even with small matching pools if communities can effectively engage larger networks.</p>\n<p>Despite limitations, the rubric used for the round was a practical choice due to time constraints, with plans for future expansion and refinement based on feedback from this round within the Council.</p>\n<p>My tips for those looking to apply in the next round: Write your application as if everyone reading it has absolutely no idea who you are, what your round is about, who is in your community or how much impact you‚Äôve had in the past. When including your past rounds, link to the Gitcoin report cards (or other summaries if they weren‚Äôt Gitocin rounds) and give context and other metrics points if it is relevant. Explain what kind of projects will be in your round and how many, what kind of impact they will have/have already had, why that impact is important, and how this round will be a net positive for them and the broader community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Lana Dingwall</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you all for applying. I have provided feedback for each of you, independent of how well-known some applications were. I believe that I reviewed each application based on what was written and the applicants‚Äô previous track records within the Gitcoin ecosystem, and also examined the impact they would have on the overall Ethereum community. I also evaluated how well applications considered eligibility criteria, objectives, and the leverage of matching rounds (how projects could benefit from being accepted).</p>\n<p>I think a point for reflection would be to add more requirements to the eligibility criteria that match the rubric we were given (impact, experience, leverage), as these are significant factors in the selection process. It would be easier to make them a requirement (e.g., must have run a Gitcoin round, matching should be comparable to the number of applicants accepted).</p>\n<p>For those applying, having a well-thought-out application is crucial. Think about your round objectives, clearly define how your project‚Äôs eligibility criteria play into that, and show a clearly defined impact assessment and reflection plan. Many missed this, which was one of the less detailed areas. If this is your first round, consider how your previous experience can lead to success as a Gitcoin Grants round operator. Another aspect I looked at was the selection of projects by round operators in previous rounds, something for future applicants to consider.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great experience, and I am looking forward to discussing it further with the council to make improvements. Thank you to all who voted for me. I evaluated each application fairly and to the best of my ability.</p>\n<p><em><strong>‚Äî Feems</strong></em></p>\n<p>We would like to give each round some direct feedback. You will hear from MathildaDV over the course of this week (please check gov forum DM‚Äôs if I‚Äôm not connected to you elsewhere) for some feedback on your applications.

I ate Acai in Copacabana beach to my heart‚Äôs content, went hanggliding with a German friend, and raved in a discoteca out in a favela. People warned us we might get stabbed or robbed or drugged there, but that we had to visit because people in that area were the best dancers who knew how to have a good time.</p>\n<p>Then the next day, I walked through downtown and found the most extreme financial inequality I had ever witnessed. I had seen waves of tent encampments and shared meals under crowded bridges in the USA which is where I had seen the most inequality before this. The homeless in the USA are mostly immigrants saving up to send more funds to their kids back home, elderly who pushed away or were abandoned by their families, and drug addicts and the mentally ill. In Rio as I walked amongst the shining skyscrapers of the financial district, I saw families.</p>\n<p>I remember standing at one intersection and watching as waves of men in suits holding a phone to their ear with one hand and a laptop bag in the other rushed the marble floors lined with cardboard. On one patch of cardboard, a young mother and father were playing with their toddlers.</p>\n<p>I knew right then that I would relentlessly pursue every opportunity that I had the good fortune to come across. Now I run a tech company that provides an economic mechanism that I believe can empower people to support their families and one another and that this can scale up to neighborhoods, nations, and civilizations. Not only that, I have a network of friends who also are working for the same goals with their platforms.<br>\nLet‚Äôs test it and see if we can really make a difference.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf.webp\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf\" title=\"0d4508_c938af9808d94f0b8cad1851832c42da~mv2\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf_2_666x500.webp\" alt=\"0d4508_c938af9808d94f0b8cad1851832c42da~mv2\" data-base62-sha1=\"uJvs8523G7F9eOOkZTpJNWMNuub\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf_2_666x500.webp, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf_2_999x750.webp 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d7661f7e76dc854c966fbcea98a7adbcc2c113bf_2_1332x1000.webp 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"8A7566\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>I would like to dedicate this idea in memory of my friend Antonio, who‚Äôs gentle smile and raucous laughter made my first time in Brazil a wonderful experience.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think I have some messages to send to see if there are people who wish to work together and help lead this initiative.

Gitcoin being able to move in a similar direction would be valid and beneficial.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/whitepaper/read\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin Whitepaper Launch</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This announcement and launch has shown the direction forward for Gitcoin as a growth driver for Ethereum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gitcoin Grants Stack / <a href=\"https://dune.com/ivanmolto/allo-protocol-multichain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Allo Adoption Increasing</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Gitcoin has continued seeing higher adoption from many different projects across the ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the wake of these recent developments, we think the time is right to start thinking about GTC sustainability for Gitcoin - building more clear value accrual and sustainability to GTC.</p>\n<p><strong>We‚Äôll focus on what we believe to be the three most impactful ways GTC can accrue value:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Allo Fee Switch</li>\n<li>Passport Staking</li>\n<li>GTC Venture Fund</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this post, we will dive into the merits of each; hopefully beginning to drive discussion and eventually consensus about which should be pursued by the DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-1-allo-fee-switch-staking-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-1-allo-fee-switch-staking-1\"></a>1 -  Allo Fee Switch &amp; Staking</h2>\n<p>Allo protocol in its current version has had $60m in volume. One very easy and clear change we could make is to introduce a fee switch to Allo protocol, allowing Gitcoin to take a percentage of that volume into its treasury.</p>\n<p>Uniswaps recent discussion on the <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">activation</a> of their fee switch provides some guidance about how this could happen, and the benefits of doing so.</p>\n<p>Although Gitcoin is a different protocol to uniswap, the foundation of these decisions should be same. Protocols cannot sustain being public goods indefinitely and leaning into value accrual as a protocol is important. There are however reasonable discussion points that this type of fee switch could damage Gitcoins public goods reputation, here‚Äôs how we feel that we can mitigate this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with making the checkout process have an <strong>optional</strong> donation/fee to Gitcoin DAO.</li>\n<li>Only enact the fee switch on the official Gitcoin frontend, and let others deploy their own frontends without fee switches.</li>\n<li>Provide ways to route around the fee switch through holding / staking GTC?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Allo has established itself as a credible tool for capital allocation, projects with large sums of capital have two incentives to use Allo with a fee switch.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It has pre-existing infrastructure which is easy to use, making the fee worthwhile.</li>\n<li>Using Allo (with a fee) also means that you also contributing to public goods inherently by contributing to the sustainability of public goods infrastructure.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2-passport-staking-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-2-passport-staking-2\"></a>2. Passport Staking</h2>\n<p>Gitcoin Passport has staked 1.5m of GTC so far <a href=\"https://dune.com/ivanmolto/gitcoin-identity-staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">(source)</a>.  This is roughly 1.5% of the total supply staked within Passport within the first 18 months of launch <strong>during a bear market.</strong></p>\n<p>Sybil resistance has continued to be at the forefront of protocol and airdrop design, with projects like Worldcoin having significant valuations solving the same problem in a different way. Being able to capture some of this value for GTC via Passport presents like an achievable and impactful goal.</p>\n<p>We encourage Gitcoin to continue to focus on identity staking and build more sybil resistance mechanisms into the Passport ecosystem, as well as more aggressively propagating passport throughout the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Ensuring GTC is the primary mechanism for passport staking and security longterm is also a high priority for the protocol.</p>\n<p>We see a possible next step of crafting a DAO wide strategy to further adoption of Gitcoin passport across the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-3-gtc-venture-fund-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-3-gtc-venture-fund-3\"></a>3. GTC Venture Fund</h2>\n<p>Gitcoin has delivered $60m value to over 3700 different grants over the past 5 years, a key contributor to Ethereum‚Äôs growth and success.</p>\n<p>These grant rounds have supported countless teams and projects from their earliest stages, with GTC being the key mechanism to enable this support through governance and infrastructure development.</p>\n<p>Gitcoin has an extensive track record of projects funded: Uniswap, WalletConnect, Yearn Finance, etc. If Gitcoin and GTC could have been distributed even a small fraction of ownership from these protocols to reinvest Gitcoin‚Äôs future it would have been immensely valuable.</p>\n<p>The main reason to create a ‚ÄúGitcoin venture matching‚Äù fund is the dealflow that Gitcoin has access to, since many of these projects come to Gitcoin at inception it allows for the projects to be sufficiently supported, whilst allowing Gitcoin to share in their future upside.</p>\n<p>In practice this is likely a GTC matching pool managed by a <a href=\"https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hats</a> structure where an elected ‚ÄòGTC venture committee‚Äô distributes additional GTC incentives to projects that are willing to share future ownership / token allocation back to the GTC DAO.</p>\n<p>Where a grants matching funds are doubled* (*open for discussion on this exact number) by the GTC venture committee in exchange for a future commitment of sharing any tokens, revenue or upside the project ends up accruing.</p>\n<p><strong>This effectively makes Gitcoin into an ‚ÄúEthereum Emerging Market Fund‚Äù that has upside in each of the up &amp; coming projects coming through the grants funnel.</strong></p>\n<p>The ask behind this would be community feedback on how to best structure a ‚ÄòGTC Venture Committee‚Äô, create a new treasury for the venture arm and possible deal term templates to create efficiency in this area. <strong>We do not want Gitcoin to focus too hard on capturing the most value out of seeding projects but rather have some exposure to be able to reinvest in public goods longterm.</strong></p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-4\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>As Gitcoin grows, there will be a handful of different directions through which GTC value could accrue.  We welcome feedback from the Gitcoin community as to which directions we think could be most fruitful.</p>\n<p>We think the first step should be setting up a GTC Venture Committee because this is the most time sensitive value add and potentially holds the largest upside for GitcoinDAO.</p>\n<p>Allo and Passport are also high impact value adds, but would benefit from taking more time for the community to build out and iterate on the mechanisms and structure involved.</p>\n<p>We at FireEyes deeply believe in Gitcoin‚Äôs mission of expanding Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem in a virtuous way, but we also want to be sensitive towards the sustainability of GTC and Gitcoin itself.</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback from the community would be very helpful, specifically on each of the three core proposals and how to best roll them out.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380","pubDate":"Wed, 20 Mar 2024 21:46:26 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18380"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380.rss","#text":"GTC Value Accrual Intro"},"filter":false}]}}}
