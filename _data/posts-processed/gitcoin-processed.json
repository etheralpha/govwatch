If you’ve ever paid bills, taxes, or repaid friends for a meal, you’ve allocated capital.</p>\n<p>Capital allocation can become a full time job: governments and grant-making organi- zations spend vast amounts of time and money figuring out the process, logistics, and decision-making involved in allocating capital. At scale, capital allocation inevitably be- comes mired in gatekeeping, rivalrous decision making, and lack of transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>Crypto with its programmable smart contracts, present incredible advantages towards allocating capital in an efficient, effective, and transparent manner.</p>\n<p>The internet revolutionized how information was distributed in society. If crypto succeeds in revolutionizing how society distributes scarce resources, it follows that it will upend, and improve, how we do capital allocation.</p>\n<p>What if we could solve coordination failures with capital allocation? What if we could create better, more sovereign, collective action? How might we bring centuries old capital allocation strategies onchain? Can we invent new onchain capital allocation strategies that were not possible before Ethereum?</p>\n<p>The next horizon is hard to see alone, but by exploring it together, we can grasp it.</p>\n<p>This book is a celebration of the design space, and your no-hype resource to understand- ing the emergent pluralistic ecology of capital allocation developing in the web3 space. I’ve enjoyed putting together this handbook of the latest and greatest in what’s possible. It is my great pleasure to have a front row seat to this movement as a member of Gitcoin. My hope for this book is that I can pay it forward to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/onchain-capital-allocation-handbook/19041\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/onchain-capital-allocation-handbook/19041","pubDate":"Tue, 25 Jun 2024 19:58:35 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19041"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/onchain-capital-allocation-handbook/19041.rss","#text":"Onchain Capital Allocation Handbook"},"filter":false},{"title":"The Grants Program Canvas + Playbook: An open source tool for easy grant-making","dc:creator":"Viriya","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>Yesterday we launched the Grants Program Canvas and Playbook! This is a set of open-source (creative commons) resources designed to empower growth leaders to create and manage high-impact grants programs within the web3 space.</p>\n<p>The project was birthed out of a question that we kept getting asked: “How do I launch a grants program? Where do I even start?”</p>\n<p>So we went to work building a simple design tool that breaks down each step into manageable pieces that makes it easy for the most novice of grants operators to launch a program.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"streamlined-grantmaking-with-the-grants-program-canvas-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#streamlined-grantmaking-with-the-grants-program-canvas-1\"></a>Streamlined Grantmaking with the Grants Program Canvas</h3>\n<p>Our launch is mainly focused on introducing and driving adoption for the Grants Program Canvas — which is a tool that visualizes the different elements of a grants program in phases (Define, Design, Execute and Learn), each with specific quadrants leading users through a complete process for program design.</p>\n<p>Taking inspo from the <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-business-model-canvas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">business model canvas</a>, we believe that this framework could become a standard for more comprehensive and streamlined grantmaking that has been a major gap for web3 ecosystems.</p>\n<p>The exciting part about this tool is that it can be used for both grants program creation AND evaluation and elevation of existing programs.</p>\n<p>We are already using this too internally to evaluate the Citizens Retro and are incorporating the tool in our grants services offerings as well.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://grantscanvas.gitcoin.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">download the canvas here</a> and upload it into any whiteboard tool to get started with it.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921\" title=\"Screenshot_2024-06-25_at_15.16.11\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921_2_618x500.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_2024-06-25_at_15.16.11\" data-base62-sha1=\"uYJya7Qd99dWhnxydRviyEm971L\" width=\"618\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921_2_618x500.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921_2_927x750.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d91ec6f93e86fe8685dbf1f9b2a2d33be7559921.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"BECAD4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"dive-deeper-with-the-grants-program-design-playbook-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#dive-deeper-with-the-grants-program-design-playbook-2\"></a>Dive Deeper with the Grants Program Design Playbook</h2>\n<p>The comprehensive 100+ page guide dives deeper into each quadrant of the Canvas, offering invaluable tools insights.

We are driving towards $50M in GMV this year and a north star of $1B in GMV through Allo over the next several years.</p>\n<p>To hit these goals, we need best-in-class contributor talent that is motivated and aligned with our mission and ambition.</p>\n<p>Token grants are a key tool we have to create those alignments. After all – the idea that we can program our values into money to ensure alignment is central to <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/whitepaper/read\">our vision for capital allocation</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"structure-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#structure-2\"></a>Structure</h1>\n<p>I propose that every contributor to Grants Lab is eligible for a 4-year token grant. These grants will be subject to linear vesting schedules and a 1-year cliff. Contributors who have been at Gitcoin for over a year and have not previously received a token grant will be eligible for an accelerated 6-month cliff, instead of 1 year.</p>\n<p>This proposal covers all current contributors to Grants Labs as well as an option pool for future contributors. In total, 3M GTC is requested. This represents 3% of the supply of GTC and is aligned with (or below) industry standards for team allocations. Though team allocations are typically only done at launch, Gitcoin has evolved substantially since the token launch in 2021. Most of the team that was present in 2021 are no longer active contributors, and the vast majority (80%) of current contributors do not have any token grants.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"potential-risks-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#potential-risks-3\"></a>Potential Risks</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Operational overhead\n<ul>\n<li>This will be part of the Grants Lab budgeting process and we will use available tools on the market (Liquifi or Hedgey or Gnosis Safe) to minimize overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How can we avoid negative impacts to the organization?\n<ul>\n<li>Tokens, once earned (including vesting), are wholly owned by the contributor and they have the freedom to do whatever they want with them. This autonomy and ownership are core to the culture we want to build.</li>\n<li>Additionally, unlocks will occur over a long period of time (4 years) to minimize potential disruption.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why now / how is this fiscally responsible?\n<ul>\n<li>As mentioned above, we’re at a critical juncture in Gitcoin’s ambition. Token grants are a tool we are deploying to ensure the success of our organization through creating a talented and aligned contributor base. (In fact, we believe it’s irresponsible to have a bunch of contributors who are NOT aligned with the long term org!)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>COI?\n<ul>\n<li>The proposer of this plan (Owocki) will not be a beneficiary of it. Owocki will not be requesting token grants through this program.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What about individuals who have current token grants?\n<ul>\n<li>These will be negotiated on an individual basis and may be transitioned to the new structure if the individual consents.

We have some exciting updates to share regarding the evolution of our organization as we transition into Gitcoin 2.1 and what that means right now, and for the future we’re creating.The following message has been shared with our core DAO contributors and I wanted to extend context to the broader community on some of the recent developments we’re making to our org.

This mission requires improved execution and sharper focus to navigate the fluctuations of the market—through bull runs, bear markets, and beyond.</p>\n<p>To align our strategic goals with the evolving demands of our industry, we are making some significant changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dissolving the Ecosystem Collective: We will concentrate our efforts where they count the most.</li>\n<li>Focusing solely on our Grants Program and Product: Levelling up our leadership in grant-making technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The primary goals of these decisions are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus our energy on the initiatives that will keep us at the forefront of the Grants and Grant tech ecosystem, increase GMV, and position ourselves as thought leaders.</li>\n<li>Work towards financial sustainability and extend our operational runway beyond current projections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The competitive landscape has evolved, with multiple new players entering the market. To remain at the forefront, we must adapt and innovate rapidly. This means developing highly configurable, custom solutions that cater to the specific needs of our community and partners. We are dedicating more energy to these key areas and focusing our resources on onboarding every web3 grants program into Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>In line with our proactive approach, we are hyperfocused on making adjustments that concentrate us on the greatest impact and alignment for our mission. As Passport spins out and we streamline the Grants Lab and Ecosystem Collective teams, we aim continue to strengthen  and position ourselves for future success. We intend to move more work into the community, leveraging their expertise and enthusiasm to deliver updates across Gitcoin more efficiently.</p>\n<p>We understand that these changes come with their challenges and will impact some of our valued contributors. We are committed to providing financial support and assistance to those affected during this transition, helping them find new roles within the industry or beyond.</p>\n<p>We want to assure all community members, stewards, and token holders that these changes have been taken very seriously and carefully considered. Our intention is to make Gitcoin as operationally efficient as possible while continuously bolstering our efforts to grow adoption for our suite of products, and knowledge base, further ensuring their longevity.</p>\n<p>I want to thank and show my genuine gratitude for the work that the Ecosystem Collective team has poured into the heart and soul of Gitcoin, and I’m optimistic that we’ll have further opportunities to work together again in the future.

We will continue to apply these learnings in what’s next.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s dive in.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-we-know-so-far-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-we-know-so-far-1\"></a>What we know so far:</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"timing-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#timing-2\"></a>Timing</h3>\n<p>Deviating from what was announced <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-proposed-updates/17649\">previously</a>,  <strong>we are now planning to run Citizens Retro <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2024-strategy-outline/18991\">after GG21</a>,</strong> which will allow us to reward Citizens for work done over the two preceding rounds, increase the available funding, and focus on some internal reorganization (more on this below), which will ideally lead to more impact, both for Gitcoin and for all Citizens.</p>\n<p>We are planning to run <strong>Citizens Retro <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> from September 24 to October 8, with applications opening up on August 27</strong>. This timing will be confirmed once we have secured the full budget.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"budget-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#budget-3\"></a>Budget</h3>\n<p>We have funding available for one more round through the current GCP. However, we plan to request an additional budget to bring <strong>the total sum of matching funding to 100K GTC</strong> ($125.000 at time of writing). We are announcing this well in advance, to invite Citizens to start working today towards earning their fair share of this budget tomorrow.</p>\n<p>This is the largest amount we’ve allocated to Citizens to date, effectively doubling the matching. Our previous rounds had matching funds of 20K, 22K and 50K GTC respectively, not counting donations. Additionally, <strong>we hope to secure extra funding</strong> through external support, as we did in the past with the help of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a> (respectively 4.20 eth + 10K GTC in the last two rounds) and Arbitrum (who doubled our matching for Retro <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span>).</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to get to work right now, you can and should</strong>: <a href=\"https://gitcoin.notion.site/Discord-Access-Guide-for-Citizens-5a91a307428b43c6966a5466438ff9fd\">join our Discord</a>,<a href=\"https://lu.ma/calendar/cal-yYcYQVROlvvWseF\"> attend Citizen office hours</a>, <a href=\"https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Idea-Board-3d839ea2b299495d9e4a6268cf1e0f9e\">dive into our idea board, propose your own ideas</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/GitcoinCitizens\">and follow us on X for inspiration</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-we-would-love-feedback-on-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-we-would-love-feedback-on-4\"></a>What we would love feedback on:</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"engage-builder-citizens-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#engage-builder-citizens-5\"></a>Engage Builder Citizens</h3>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoin-s-ratified-essential-intents-2023-2024-and-a-recap-of-our-successes/16818\">updated essential intents</a>, the focus of the Gitcoin team is more than ever on increasing <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2024-gmv-strategy-overview-grants-lab/18805\">Allo’s GMV</a>. Citizens contribute to our ‘Gross Merchandise Value’ in so many ways, as explained <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-citizens-rounds-value-generation-opportunities/18727\">here</a>. However, technical submissions have been mostly limited to (epic!) dashboards, and we want to take this a step further.</p>\n<p><strong>For our next round we would love to see more technical applications: not just submissions for standalone work, but deep integrations with Allo Protocol and Grants Stack</strong>, which we can provide support for. We would love to know: how do you think we can ensure deep integrations with Grants Lab and how can we better encourage Citizens to submit more technical work?</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Idea-Board-3d839ea2b299495d9e4a6268cf1e0f9e\">some ideas already popping up</a>, and feel free to submit yours!

After an entirely retroactive round, one mixed, and another retroactive one, each on a different network, <strong>we are now planning to run our next round as <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack/rpgf\">a fully retroactive funding round, with badgeholders (RetroPGF).</a></strong> We have a lot of in-house experience with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki\">@owocki</a>’s team, who built one of the two frontends for <a href=\"https://round3.optimism.io/projects?after=undefined&amp;display=grid&amp;sort=mostAwarded&amp;search=&amp;seed=1718378572712&amp;categories=\">Optimism RPGF Round 3</a>, and Gitcoin is now also offering this <a href=\"https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack/rpgf\">as a service</a>.</p>\n<p>Next to our enthusiasm about <strong>dogfooding all things Gitcoin</strong>, we also have noticed how it is very often the same limited group of warm-hearted people donating to these public greats. We want to address <strong>potential donor fatigue,</strong> and see how only working with voting could influence the results of our next round. Next to this, it will allow us to work with <strong>categories of submitted work</strong>, which will make it easier to evaluate submissions, and potentially allocate funds in a different way.</p>\n<p>Switching to RPGF will be our biggest experiment yet, and we have a lot of things to figure out by then. <strong>We feel very inspired, and would like to use this opportunity to ask for your input on organizing this round.</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the questions that have come up for us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who should be the <strong>badgeholders</strong>, the voters for our round? Should it be all GG grantees? All donors? Should it only be participants of previous Citizens rounds?</li>\n<li>Should <strong>GTC holders</strong> be voters for this round, and if so, how do we set this up? Do we use simple voting, quadratic voting, conviction voting, …? Should we mix grantees and GTC holders? Or try something else?</li>\n<li>Do we keep our successful <strong><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/signal-boosting-for-gitcoin-citizens-retro-3/18518\">signal boosting experiment</a></strong> in the mix, and how do we make this work with badgeholders? Do they have double or quadratic voting power, versus badgeholders just having one vote?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have so many questions (and a few potential answers) but first of all: we want to hear your thoughts. Let us know in the comments!</p>\n<h3><a name=\"one-more-thing-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#one-more-thing-7\"></a>One more thing</h3>\n<p>Lastly, <strong>I’ve decided to step down as the main round operator for the Gitcoin Citizens Retro rounds, so we are looking for someone new</strong>. It has been a true honor and a tremendous, heart-warming, inspiring pleasure to interact with our community of passionate Citizens on a daily basis. Over the  3 past rounds I continued working with the core team, building on strong foundations, after two years of running DAO Ops before this. For me, it is time to explore new horizons (<a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co\">dms open</a>), and for Citizens, this is an opportunity to step up! <strong>If you are interested in this role, or know someone qualified, please <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1U6MzjkPC6Z6tfxYU6cEyoT2AATvDUwAG0-FkC8PS04g/edit\">dive in and reach out!</a></strong></p>\n<p>I’d like to specifically thank <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a>, the instigator of the Citizens rounds, my rock and partner in crime, it truly was an honor, ser.

This year’s approach builds upon the valuable insights gained from previous rounds, ensuring that we continue to evolve and improve and serve the community’s best interests.</p>\n<p>Our strategy for Gitcoin Grants across the remainder of 2024 centers on three core pillars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inclusivity: Broaden participation by reaching diverse communities and supporting various projects across different sectors</li>\n<li>Transparency: Clear communication and open processes to maintain trust and engagement</li>\n<li>Sustainability: Ensuring long-term growth and impact through strategic funding and resource allocation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov\">@sov</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth\">@umarkhaneth</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sejalrekhan\">@sejalrekhan</a> for your thought partnership in baking out this strategy for 2024 and beyond.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overall-strategy-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overall-strategy-2\"></a><strong>Overall Strategy</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"oss-program-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#oss-program-3\"></a>OSS Program</h3>\n<p>Since its inception, Gitcoin Grants has been committed to furthering the ethos of OSS/Digital Public Goods while fostering project growth and sustainability through novel funding mechanisms. GG supports both early-stage and more mature builders across the wider Ethereum ecosystem and  is run by Gitcoin core contributors. <strong><em>These rounds run twice annually.</em></strong></p>\n<p>With Gitcoin Grants 20, we refocused on our core mission of supporting open-source software and digital public goods and started on a journey to redefine how we continually fund and sustain the digital infrastructure that underpins our modern world.</p>\n<p><em>You have our commitment that we will work tirelessly to continue to create a more resilient, inclusive, and thriving future.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-rounds-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-rounds-4\"></a>Community Rounds</h3>\n<p>GG20 was the first iteration of a new Community Round structure: we created a dedicated pool of funds (up to $125K quarterly) available to support “matching on matching” pools and highlighting them alongside the Program rounds. Communities with any amount raised for matching and meeting the round criteria could apply for up to $25K in funding from Gitcoin to go toward their matching pool. The Community Council (a Gitcoin DAO-elected external council) reviews applications and votes on which communities to fund and accept into the round.

Note that due to time constraints, we will only run three GG rounds in 2024:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GG20:</strong> April 23 - May 7th [COMPLETED]\n<ul>\n<li><em>OSS Program (4 rounds) $1M Matching Pool</em></li>\n<li><em>5+ Community Rounds</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GG21:</strong> August 7 - 21\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ecosystem ‘Spotlight’ Rounds</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ecosystem Rounds will now have the opportunity to share the stage alongside the community rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>10 Community Rounds</em></li>\n<li><em>$125k allocated towards matching for top 5 Community Rounds</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GG22:</strong> End of October (exact dates announced in the coming weeks)\n<ul>\n<li><em>OSS Program (4 rounds) $1M Matching Pool</em></li>\n<li><em>8 Community Rounds</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>During OSS rounds, our internal resources will likely be more constrained and due to this, we will only be able to support 8. (Subject to change).</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>$125k allocated towards matching for top 5 Community Rounds</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>One key difference</strong> to note is that our OSS Program will only run again in GG22, sticking to the twice annual  cadence that was first <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-proposed-updates/17649\">announced and outlined in this post</a>. Because the Gitcoin Grants matching pool are funds that were entrusted to us by the community (separate from our treasury), it’s important that we run a program that is sustainable for the long term, which will create a runway for our builders well into the future beyond the next few years. To fund what matters to us, we realize we have to take steps to ensure financial sustainability, but still serve our community and builders in a foundational way.  Additionally, as Gitcoin grows its presence and product stack to the wider Web3 Ecosystem we want to allow these groups to be able to run during GG.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"learnings-from-past-rounds-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#learnings-from-past-rounds-6\"></a><strong>Learnings from Past Rounds</strong></h2>\n<p>Reflecting on past rounds, we’ve gleaned several critical learnings that have shaped our 2024 strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Matching Algorithms:</strong> We’ve improved our Quadratic Funding algorithms to better match contributions with projects, ensuring a more equitable distribution of funds. This has been done through the use of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/nerd-post-updates-to-cluster-mapping-matching/18705&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1718383498828793&amp;usg=AOvVaw3zm5wpN0R4XtOjQ6nZhIGs\">COCM</a> and Passport’s Model Based Detection: a <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524\">two-pronged sybil resistance strategy</a> that we rolled out in GG20, which proved to be incredibly successful.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Feedback:</strong> Incorporating feedback from participants has been invaluable. We’ve streamlined the application process and introduced more robust support systems to assist grantees. GG20 saw an 80% grantee satisfaction rate, the highest we’ve seen in at least the past year. <em>This was measured through a GG20 grantee survey conducted, where we received more than 70 detailed responses.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Operations:</strong> We saw the need for improving our operations for an enhanced user experience, and in GG20 we introduced Checker and ‘Team Tiger’ which helped expedite grantee applications reviews.<br>\nBy integrating these learnings, we aim to create a more effective and rewarding experience for everyone involved.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"new-updates-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#new-updates-7\"></a><strong>New Updates</strong></h2>\n<p>We plan to release dates of GG rounds further in advance than we have historically. This will allow Community Rounds and grantees to prepare for the rounds ahead of time adequately, and will enable us to better plan internally. Within the following weeks, we will release a 12-18 month roadmap for GG that will flow over into rough dates for next year. From 2025 onwards, we will return to <strong>4 rounds per year.</strong></p>\n<p>Builder engagement in between GG rounds is top of mind for the Gitcoin team, and we are proactively working on how to set up stronger 1) support systems 2) education funnels 3) active community spaces 4) builder care that fosters innovation and collaboration not only during a GG round but also during the periods outside of the rounds. <strong>No one knows what developers need more than developers.</strong></p>\n<p>We are exploring ways to introduce new funding mechanisms into the grants program. This could include ways to adapt our QF mechanism even more, such as introducing MACI, <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/signal-boosting-for-gitcoin-citizens-retro-3/18518\">continuing signal boosting</a>, <a href=\"https://easyretropgf.xyz/\">easyRPGF</a>, and more. <em>More about how this might unfold is coming soon.</em></p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates and get ready to contribute to the future of open-source innovation with Gitcoin Grants 2024!</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2024-strategy-outline/18991\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2024-strategy-outline/18991","pubDate":"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 16:26:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18991"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2024-strategy-outline/18991.rss","#text":"Gitcoin Grants 2024 Strategy Outline"},"filter":false},{"title":"DAO Financial Report - May 2024","dc:creator":"Sor03","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>In the past month, operational expenses amounted to $633,758, marking a decrease of $109,585 compared to the previous month.

The setup involved careful planning, including defining criteria, selecting and onboarding token engineers as advisors, and implementing a robust application and review system to ensure transparency and fairness. Key partners and stakeholders were engaged early in the process to align goals and expectations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"grant-round-objectives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#grant-round-objectives-2\"></a>Grant Round Objectives</h2>\n<p>The primary objectives of this grant round were to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support and accelerate public good projects that align with token engineering principles</li>\n<li>Encourage new ideas and solutions that will advance the token engineering field</li>\n<li>Build a stronger community by fostering connections between token engineering innovators and the broader public goods ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The grant round was specifically designed to engage and support projects and individuals advancing the field of token engineering, an area encompassing economics, system design with crypto, and the design and analysis of cryptoeconomic systems. The round targeted academics, researchers, educators, and developers focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Token engineering research</li>\n<li>Events, seminars, and papers educating the community about token engineering</li>\n<li>Software development for token engineering tools</li>\n<li>Building or enhancing social infrastructure related to token engineering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#implementation-3\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"setup-and-management-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#setup-and-management-4\"></a>Setup and Management</h3>\n<p>This being our 4th grant round, the setup process was streamlined based on previous experiences. We maintained the matching cap at 15% to allow up to 5-6 bigger projects to receive a substantial matching amount, optimizing the distribution of funds to drive meaningful impact. The eligibility criteria were improved with a list of project types perfectly aligned with the identified needs within the token engineering community, as informed by a TEC-sponsored <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xw48b/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Engineering Stakeholder Study</a>.</p>\n<p>We also implemented a new communication strategy that involved promptly notifying applicants of their acceptance or rejection, followed by a structured appeal process. This approach ensured clear and timely communication throughout the grant round, maintaining transparency and managing expectations effectively.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-and-solutions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#challenges-and-solutions-5\"></a>Challenges and Solutions</h3>\n<p>One ongoing challenge has been defining project qualifications clearly—distinguishing between projects that genuinely advance token engineering as a discipline versus those that merely apply token engineering elements, such as launching a token or incorporating a token economy. To address this, we focused on enhancing the review process by involving advisors who are experts in token engineering. The involvement of 9 seasoned advisors enriched the evaluation process. Their insights were crucial in accurately assessing the true impact and relevance of each project to the field of token engineering. Additionally, we recognized the need to provide clearer feedback on application rejections, helping applicants understand exactly why they did not meet the criteria and how they might improve for future submissions.</p>\n<p>During this grant round, managing the simultaneous processes of late applications, appeals, and the donation period also proved challenging. The need to address late submissions and appeals while simultaneously driving the donation campaign stretched our resources. To streamline future rounds, we hope to establish a more definitive schedule that separates the closing of applications from the start of the donation period. This will allow dedicated attention to appeals and ensure all applications are considered without compromising our donation campaign efforts. Assigning specific team roles for managing appeals and rejections will further prevent operational overlap, maintaining our focus on effective campaigning and meticulous evaluation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"unique-features-or-approaches-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#unique-features-or-approaches-6\"></a>Unique Features or Approaches</h3>\n<p>Continuing from a previous round, we employed the <a href=\"https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF)</a> Matching Boost, a strategic enhancement to the Quadratic Funding allocation process that leverages token engineering expertise. TQF works by analyzing token-based signals of token engineering expertise in the wallets of donors participating in our Token Engineering Grants Round. When such signals are detected, we apply a ‘boost’ to the donations, thereby increasing the funding received by projects that attract support from well-regarded members of the token engineering community. This approach not only incentivizes quality contributions but also ensures that funding is aligned with genuine expertise in the field.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"outcomes-and-statistics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outcomes-and-statistics-7\"></a>Outcomes and Statistics</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"funding-and-contributions-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-and-contributions-8\"></a>Funding and Contributions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Total funding: $9,365</li>\n<li>Number of contributions: 1,619</li>\n<li>Average contribution: $16.90</li>\n<li>Unique donors: 554</li>\n<li>Participating projects: 32</li>\n<li>Average grant size: $TEC 2,975.88</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"participant-feedback-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#participant-feedback-9\"></a>Participant Feedback</h3>\n<p>Every round, we gather open and honest feedback from our grantees using an anonymous feedback form.

We were honored to be selected as one of Gitcoin’s sponsored community rounds, which significantly amplified our reach. The support from Gitcoin not only helped us attract a wider array of projects but also expanded our circle of grantees beyond the familiar faces from previous rounds. These new ideas and perspectives have been refreshing for our community.</p>\n<p>One critical insight from this round was the absolute necessity of crystal-clear criteria. We realized that to truly achieve our objectives, we must sharpen our ability to distinguish between projects that are simply using token engineering and those that are pushing the boundaries of the field. This clarity is crucial for steering our efforts towards projects that promise genuine advancement in token engineering.</p>\n<p>Another major takeaway involved the importance of supporting impactful initiatives. The round reaffirmed our commitment to not just funding projects but also measuring their long-term impact. This means developing robust metrics to assess both the potential and the realized impact of projects, ensuring that our investments continue to bear fruit long after the funding has been disbursed.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"areas-for-improvement-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#areas-for-improvement-15\"></a>Areas for Improvement</h3>\n<p>We discovered that many of our grantees were not maximizing opportunities to promote their projects. In future rounds, we need to provide more support for grantee marketing and engagement. Whether through resources, training, or incentives, we must empower our grantees to champion their projects effectively, to better boost their visibility and impact.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in future grant rounds, we plan to introduce detailed metrics and evaluation tools specifically designed to assess the direct impact of our funding on the supported projects. This initiative will allow us to track how our contributions aid in advancing each project’s goals and development within the field of token engineering. By refining our evaluation framework, we aim to ensure that our funding not only supports worthy projects but also maximizes their potential for success and growth.</p>\n<p>One logistical improvement from this round we would suggest is having earlier clarification of grant round dates. Knowing these dates in advance would significantly enhance our planning and coordination. This advance notice is crucial for ensuring that all aspects of the grant round—from application deadlines to project evaluation and donation campaigns—are better organized and clearly communicated.</p>\n<p>As we reflect on these lessons, we are inspired to refine our processes and approaches for future rounds. Each grant round is an opportunity to learn, adapt, and enhance the transformative potential of our funding. The insights gained from this round will undoubtedly influence our strategies moving forward, making each successive round more impactful than the last.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"closing-thoughts-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#closing-thoughts-16\"></a>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Reflecting on this grant round, several key learnings stand out as crucial for our growth and future planning. The importance of setting clearer criteria and an evaluation matrix cannot be overstated—it is essential for guiding both applicants and reviewers, ensuring that projects align with the true spirit of token engineering. This round has reinforced the necessity of planning ahead and meticulous time management, especially when aligning with Gitcoin’s timeline and balancing multiple processes such as appeals, late applications, and active donation campaigns.</p>\n<p>Constant and clear communication has been an essential component in running our round. Maintaining open channels with grantees, our community, and partners like Gitcoin has helped keep the process transparent and inclusive, fostering a trusting and engaged community environment.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, we are excited to continue refining these processes. Each round brings new opportunities to enhance our approach, deepen our impact, and expand our community’s engagement with token engineering. We encourage everyone—projects/grantees, donors, and partners—to share their feedback on this round. Your insights are invaluable as they help us improve and innovate for future rounds.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/token-engineering-qf-grants-round-spring-2024-gg20-round-retro/18978\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/token-engineering-qf-grants-round-spring-2024-gg20-round-retro/18978","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 15:53:09 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18978"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/token-engineering-qf-grants-round-spring-2024-gg20-round-retro/18978.rss","#text":"Token Engineering QF Grants Round: Spring 2024 GG20 Round Retro"},"filter":false},{"title":"[Discussion] Allo Fee Switch Proposal","dc:creator":"James","category":"🤖 DAO Governance and Vision","description":"<h1><a name=\"allo-fee-switch-proposal-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#allo-fee-switch-proposal-1\"></a>Allo Fee Switch Proposal</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#abstract-background-2\"></a>Abstract &amp; Background</h2>\n<p>Fire Eyes DAO has been working towards creating a roadmap for <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380\">GTC Value Accrual</a>  as well as driving more clear sustainability and value to the GitcoinDAO.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-value-accrual-intro/18380\">GTC Value Accrual Intro</a> forum post, introducing a fee switch to the Allo Protocol is a straightforward decision that can allow us to begin this journey.</p>\n<p><strong>This forum post aims to ignite initial discussion on an Allo fee switch, not be a ‘ready to vote’ proposal.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Allo protocol v2 (and its predecessors) have had $60m+ in combined volume. The introduction of a fee to Allo would create a new revenue stream which would be passed back into the DAO treasury.</p>\n<p>Uniswaps previous discussion on the activation of their fee switch provides some guidance around the process involved in making this change, and valuable insight into the wider community response to such a change.</p>\n<p>Although Gitcoin is a different protocol to Uniswap, the foundation of these decisions should follow the same logical course. <strong>Protocols cannot sustain being public goods indefinitely and leaning into value accrual as a protocol is important.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#specification-4\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>This initial pre-proposal discussion centres around two decisions that need to be made before we move forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly (1.) if the fee is added to Gitcoin’s deployment of Allo protocol <strong>or</strong> (2.) to all deployments of Allo protocol.</li>\n<li>Secondly if this fee was to be added, what percentage of volume the fee would take.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Firstly:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The fee switch could added to the Allo Protocol but only be enacted via the official Gitcoin deployment, not at the overall contract level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This allows others to fork the contracts and deploy their own instance without the fee if they wish to.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The fee switch could be implemented at the contract level, meaning that all deployments would include the switch unless it was removed from the contract itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This more strongly encourages anyone using the allo contracts to contribute to the funding of public goods via GitcoinDAO.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Secondly:</strong> The fee level is an open question - we invite community feedback and discussion but envision the fee sitting at one of the following levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5%</li>\n<li>1%</li>\n<li>3%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For context, looking at these fee levels retroactively gives us an idea of how impactful a fee could be over time:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"gg20-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#gg20-5\"></a>GG20:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5% of total GG20 donations = $3165</li>\n<li>1% of total GG20 donations = $6330</li>\n<li>3% of total GG20 donations = $18,990</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"all-time-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#all-time-6\"></a>All time:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>0.5% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$300k</li>\n<li>1% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$600k</li>\n<li>3% of total Grants distributions to date = ~$1.8m</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These numbers show value flows that could be directed towards sustainability.</p>\n<p><strong>It is important to note that the proceeds of this fee will be deposited back into the Gitcoin DAO treasury,</strong> to be directed into funding both the development of Gitcoin infrastructure, and the commons more broadly. As such, it makes sense for the fee to be higher than average and that most users would be accepting of this given that the fee exists purely to sustain the provision of Allo and related public goods.</p>\n<p><em>FireEyes would recommend that the switch be implemented at the Allo contract level with a fee of 1%. This is because it provides a clear value proposition to GitcoinDAO’s sustainability whilst remaining reasonably unobtrusive to users donating via the Allo protocol. It is obviously still possible to remove or reduce this fee switch, but this would need to be an explicit decision to exclude by anyone deploying.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"drawbacks-risks-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#drawbacks-risks-7\"></a>Drawbacks / Risks</h2>\n<p>There are reasonable discussion points that this type of fee switch could damage Gitcoin’s public goods reputation, here’s how we feel that we could mitigate this if deemed necessary by the community:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with the checkout process having an optional donation/fee to Gitcoin DAO.</li>\n<li>Only enact the fee switch on the official Gitcoin frontend, and let others deploy their own frontends without fee switches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Allo has established itself as a credible tool for capital allocation, projects with large sums of capital have two incentives to use Allo with a fee switch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has pre-existing infrastructure which is easy to use, making the fee worthwhile.</li>\n<li>Using Allo (with a fee) also means that you are also contributing to public goods inherently by contributing to the sustainability of public goods infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We hope to foster community discussion around both the introduction of this mechanism and its finer details, as well as more broadly around sustainability for the GitcoinDAO and it’s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We realise this is a controversial topic to introduce to a public goods focused community like Gitcoin however starting this conversation is an important step towards ensuring that we can continue sustainably building public goods infrastructure for years to come!</p>\n<p>Please share your thoughts and feedback in this forum post <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/robot.png?v=12\" title=\":robot:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":robot:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974","pubDate":"Mon, 10 Jun 2024 22:27:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18974"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-allo-fee-switch-proposal/18974.rss","#text":"[Discussion] Allo Fee Switch Proposal"},"filter":false},{"title":"Dark Matter, coin voting, bribes, transferable stake, etc","dc:creator":"skilesare","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>Hey all…I’ve started a bit of discussion over on the DFINITY forums(i know, i know) about some issues we’re running into.

It has been a goal of mine and others on the team to graduate Passport from Gitcoin as Gitcoin has been focused on Grants and growing GMV for a while now. At the same time, the Passport team has been focused on identity and the emerging world of onchain reputation, with some support for Gitcoin, but largely prioritizing the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Creating separation from the two entities ensures Passport’s actions across the space are no longer associated with the Gitcoin brand, and while Gitcoin continues to focus on capital allocation, there will no longer be questions on why we have an identity solution in the portfolio.</p>\n<p>This budget request seeks funding to enable the spin out of Passport and fund the business for its initial six months. Here is what we are thinking. Passport has generated revenue on OP and Linea (by enabling onchain attestations of one’s unique humanity, and OP RPGF3). Together with this funding, and a six month budget, we would like to formally request a vote to spin out of Gitcoin DAO. In return for bootstrapping the business unit, we will ensure Gitcoin has equity ownership in the new entity, a token allocation if/when we launch a token and a board seat in the new entity. The details on how a DAO may participate are a little murky (ie, have equity, and a board seat) and so we will be working with the Gitcoin Foundation to formalize the ownership and board seat appointment.</p>\n<p>Passport currently drives the majority utility use case for GTC and we plan to keep GTC utility in the product for the foreseeable future. We do not have details on if/when Passport has its own token, but we want to ensure as Gitcoin will likely be a large token holder in Passport, there will be token use cases that extend utility for other ERC-20 (like GTC).</p>\n<p>We are aiming to have this spinout complete in July, and would expect the Passport team to start to use its own properties (ie, Passport.xyz for the website and app, its own discord server, its own email, etc.) on July 1. While Passport will be an independent entity, there will still be lots of areas of collaboration as those running grants programs often need Sybil protection (and those doing airdrops often want to seed a Grants program after TGE).</p>\n<p>As for the progress the team has been making, updates below outline both progress and the roadmap we have ahead.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tldr-on-the-next-6mos-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-on-the-next-6mos-1\"></a>TL;DR on the next 6mos</h2>\n<p>Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity and reputation management. We are continuing to focus on ways to build a reputational substrate that can be leveraged permissionlessly onchain:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Adoption</strong> - Continue to expand the number of real humans with a passport</li>\n<li><strong>Growth</strong> - Grow the number of onchain attestations</li>\n<li><strong>Sustainability</strong> - Ensure continued runway extension</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"outline-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outline-2\"></a>Outline</h2>\n<p>Passport is the premier web3 native offering that enables ecosystems to protect, understand and organically grow what matters most – their communities. We see Passport at the confluence of a best in class identity solution, backed by the most relevant and comprehensive data analysis toolset that also offers communities the ability to ascribe reputation.</p>\n<p>Objectives for Seasons 23: This table lists the milestones and deliverables we plan to tackle.

We now have a total of 1.4M unique all time passports. We also continued to drive strongly against our targets in GTC staking, hitting over 1.75M GTC staked.</p>\n<p>With a focus on onchain attestations, we have launched two new networks where Passport holders can attest to their unique humanity. This means, we now support attestations on Arbitrum, Optimism, Linea, and zkSync. Onchain attestations have started to unlock novel use cases where smartcontract interactions can now directly confirm a wallet’s humanity score, enabling truly permissionless and decentralized humanity confirmation.</p>\n<p>We have also done a lot of work to revamp the GTC staking experience to make the process more intuitive and informative. This has brought the creation of privacy policy details and user terms as the GTC staked can be slashed when users are acting in bad faith.</p>\n<p>And finally, our new Model Based Detection endpoint, and L2 coverage has continued to expand. We now can review wallets using our models across ARB, OP, zkSync, Polygon, Eth Mainnet, and NFT communities. This capability is incredibly helpful when engaging with other communities (new L2s) to help them understand who is likely a sybil actor and who is likely human on their network.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"milestone-report-for-past-season-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#milestone-report-for-past-season-4\"></a>Milestone Report for Past Season</h3>\n<p><strong>Legend:</strong> <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/green_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":green_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":green_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Success/Completed/Shipped <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">Incomplete, but partial success <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":red_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":red_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">Incomplete, Will Not Hit Goal <br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/black_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":black_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":black_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Canceled</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n   <td><strong>Initiative/Project</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Key Results</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Value Delivered</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Ease\n   </td>\n   <td>🟢Simplified Passport user experience\n   </td>\n   <td>Revamped Passport with fewer stamps, credentials, and simplified path to 20 score.\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Effectiveness\n   </td>\n   <td>🟡Updated score weights for all Passports based on previous 6 months of data\n<p>\n🟢Aggregate L2 Models\n   </p></td>\n   <td>In addition the revamp of Passpot and the addition of the new models we’ve made significant progress dropping the False positive rate under 16%, did not hit the target of &lt;10%.\n<p>\nWe’ll have a working model by June 30th..\n   </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Adoption\n   </td>\n   <td>🟢1.4M Passports\n<p>\n🟢Scored 400k addresses with MDB \n   </p></td>\n   <td>Continued to drive top line growth of unique Passports by adding 255k new Passports exceeding our target of 1.3M driven by new partners Initia and zkLink.

We propose a Gitcoin DAO managed investment in revenue yielding real estate such as a working Eco-resort, or co-working residence, where accommodation provides recurring revenue.</p>\n<p>The equally pragmatic reasoning behind this proposal is to provide the wider Gitcoin community/ecosystem anchor <em><strong>‘Schelling Points’</strong></em> that foster relationship building, work retreats and work-life balance. The property could also include a winery or agricultural holdings enhancing the resort’s self-sustainability and providing on-site community building diversions during staycations and work retreats.</p>\n<p>The fundamental model here is less one of ‘Wooffing’ and more one of Jimmy Buffett’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Buffett%27s_Margaritaville\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Margaritaville</a> style resorts (currently<a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/jimmy-buffett-death-margaritaville-net-worth-9d7b825c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> valued </a>at well over $1B)</p>\n<p><em>I</em>mportantly, property management and upkeep will be governed on-chain using a bespoke governance platform in order to decentralize property management and facilitate remote stewardship of logistics, staff, maintenance and upkeep.*</p>\n<p>The ownership of the RWA will be held by the GitcoinDAO and/or Gitcoin Foundation. The fractional Property Use Rights will be shared among the wider Gitcoin community with the <em>sole qualification for fractional property purchase</em> being that the purchaser must be a current or past Gitcoin grantee or matching funder.</p>\n<p>This basic model is built upon a synthesis of <a href=\"https://www.homebasedao.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">HomebaseDAO</a> and<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HCay0WwpWtpSSlKHI7kWBaf5WhxwlzHK/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> ChateauDAO</a> with advisory by Homebase.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>  <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/arrow_down.png?v=12\" title=\":arrow_down:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":arrow_down:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>RWA (real property) as Treasury Diversification</li>\n<li>RWA (real property) for co-working and remote site team building</li>\n<li>RWA as simplified, more accessible property accrual for wider Gitcoin Ecosystem orgs and QF Round participants</li>\n<li>Travel &amp; Luxury: an industry that will not be displaced by AI</li>\n<li>EcoResort / Remote Work &amp; Co-working Residency (more in the style of Buffett’s Margaritaville franchise, less in the style of Wooffing)</li>\n<li>Sustainable energy integration</li>\n<li>Historical Building Renovation in France - 40% subsidy provided by French government for qualifying properties</li>\n<li>DAO (or Gitcoin Foundation) retains Property Deed</li>\n<li>Property Rights Users - own, are free to sell or keep, their Property Use Rights</li>\n<li>Revenue generation model based on accommodation use and fractional, tokenized lease purchase</li>\n<li>Native dApp for calendar booking, property maintenance and property management governance</li>\n<li>Low cost SBA loans available for such purchases</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We propose that the property deed be held by the Gitcoin Foundation (or DAO) as a hard asset used for treasury diversification, fiscal conservation and as a potential revenue stream for the foundation and the DAO.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/seedling.png?v=12\" title=\":seedling:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":seedling:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">The Fractional Use shares that are offered for purchase to the wider community will be for designated time use. <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/seedling.png?v=12\" title=\":seedling:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":seedling:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>For example, in the case of an Eco-Resort that can accommodate up to 100 guests at a time in 50 double-occupancy rooms, the fractional shares will be made available in increments of <strong>2-weeks per year use time for a 5 year block</strong>. This means that a purchaser can pay $XX to use the property two weeks per year for a consecutive 5 year period.</p>\n<p>We propose that these Property Use Rights be represented by RWA digital asset (NFT) holdership. We propose that Property Use Rights have a 5-year duration before mandatory renewal or re-selling. We also suggest that each fractional Property Use Right ‘owner’ must hold the access token (RWA digital asset) for at least 12 months (to prevent flipping) prior to selling on the secondary market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/house_with_garden.png?v=12\" title=\":house_with_garden:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":house_with_garden:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sunflower.png?v=12\" title=\":sunflower:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":sunflower:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\nAn example of how this could break down for a 35 Room B/BA former 4-star resort in the South of France surrounded by 3 hectares of property, a small lake, a river.

This means that partners and contributors can earn and receive a Property Use Right RWA digital asset for their consistency in providing matching funds for QF rounds or other contributions. The Property Use Right RWA digital asset does not confer title to property or property ownership rights but does allow for 2 weeks annually of fractional property use rights (TUP = Time Unit Purchase) per RWA held for 5 years (total use per RWA token is 10 weeks over the course of 5 years).</p>\n<p><strong>2nd USE Case - Co-Working Residency</strong></p>\n<p>Property Example A</p>\n<p>Biarritz, France.</p>\n<p>€2,550,000 9 BD/BA Pool &amp; Pool House, 3 hectares, stables, private pontoon</p>\n<p>*Biarritz is a Web3 hub in France, is a beautiful coastal town on the Atlantic, just on the border of Spain.

The country has a wealth of chateaux that are withering in neglect.</p>\n<p>With astute curation, a property can be purchased, restored with the help of the French government’s subsidies, thus providing needed work for regional artisans and craftsmen.  The final result is that of cultural preservation and public goods longevity while enhancing the personal wealth of the property owner.</p>\n<p><strong>USE CASE Example (Already Exists in Market)</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sushi.png?v=12\" title=\":sushi:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":sushi:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><em>Chateaushi</em> - This is an historical property development consortium that is crypto friendly. They offer fractional ownership of properties using a membership model. Their approach is one of luxury with strategic partnerships now in place with the former editor of the Michelin Guide, several celebrity chefs and other luxury travel tie-ins.</p>\n<p><strong>Tokenized Property As A Public Good</strong></p>\n<p>Here in this proposal, we seek to honor the Gitcoin Community’s dedication to public goods, ecosystem cultivation and growth, and shared, enriching experiences that offer sustainable outcomes.</p>\n<p>In this regard, we propose that we entertain strategic partnerships with Solar Punk, ReGen, Kundalini Yoga and clean energy communities and more like minded tribes…</p>\n<p>Clean Energy Hubs: The really long vision is to build these RWA communities into clean energy hubs where solar energy, and one day, fusion energy, is farmed for our own use and the use of the surrounding communities. (More on that to come…).</p>\n<p><strong>Business Model</strong></p>\n<p>We are considering two business models, with an emphasis on the first:</p>\n<p>An <strong>EcoResort &amp;/or Co-Working Residence</strong> with suitable accommodations for multiples of groups, can be purchased outright by GitcoinDAO or the Gitcoin Foundation or a partnership between the two. The RWA is held in trust and maintained in the Treasury portfolio as a valuable, tradeable hard asset.</p>\n<p>This approach works for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>2024 is the \"year of RWAs’ (BlockWorks)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gitcoin DAO is looking to be a ‘product/ protocol’ DAO with diverse offerings to the community</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Diversifying treasury holdings into something tangible and substantive such as real estate further strengthens the responsible fiscal position of the DAO</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Offering fractional Property Use Rights into RWA holdings for the larger Gitcoin community means that the community members can begin their own real estate fractional use  journey ( such as like Pacaso, Homebase, traditional timeshares);</p>\n<p>Community members and the different grantee orgs can continue building community and relationships within and among the Gitcoin Grantee ecosystems; Depending on the strategic property investments - agriculture yielding / winery/ EcoResort - the property could be self-sustaining and,  eventually, show revenue from local production in addition to revenue generated by accommodations use and appreciation of real value in real estate ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>Business Model <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span></strong></p>\n<p>Launch on Grant Stack as a funding round.  We approach capital investors who would then take the position of the holder of the RWA asset. In return, they would match fund in a QF round the Property Use Right fractional ownership purchases that the individual Gitcoin grantee community members and orgs raise.</p>\n<p>This would function as a traditional QF Round, except in this case the match funders would retain the deed to the property that is purchased using their capital. But they would share their capital investment by match funding using the QF formula. Each amount raised by community members, who seek to become fractional owners in the property by purchasing Property Use Rights as outlined above, would be match funded by said benefactor/ capital investor.</p>\n<p><strong>Monetization Models  -  Gitcoin Foundation Retains Property Deed, Fractionalizes Time Unit Purchases (TUP - see monetization break down above)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Property Example B:</strong></p>\n<p>Eco-Resort -  Former 4-star hotel property near Sarlat, Dordogne, France</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully Furnished, recently renovated</li>\n<li>Restaurant</li>\n<li>Lounge</li>\n<li>Reception</li>\n<li>Staff Accommodations (Four Bedroom/ Four Living Room Stone House)</li>\n<li>Barns and Outbuildings</li>\n<li>Suitable for Horses</li>\n<li>Guesthouse/Gite</li>\n<li>Swimming Pool</li>\n<li>Two estuaries</li>\n<li>Wooded Park, hundred year old trees</li>\n<li>Lake</li>\n<li>Wheelchair accessible</li>\n<li>Outdoor Terrace and Lounge</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd\" title=\"EcoResort Property Images 39 room 4 Star Resort\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd_2_690x473.jpeg\" alt=\"EcoResort Property Images 39 room 4 Star Resort\" data-base62-sha1=\"1GofNj5wX4Tm7k7z6lVBqAiJCBn\" width=\"690\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd_2_690x473.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/0bcce7290490375bc483fbe2f15abe450fae68dd.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"556541\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e\" title=\"EcoResort Property Images Table 2\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e_2_690x240.jpeg\" alt=\"EcoResort Property Images Table 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"u5pZYq1TzG7LmLq9bpucUZujv0G\" width=\"690\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e_2_690x240.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d2de0bb5553d2f09f8f1f724eb3ae2056114504e.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CAD1C7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>**35 Rooms - Time Unit 2 weeks =  Total  875 Units **</p>\n<p>**Each Unit sells for EURO 8000  =    EURO  7 Million **</p>\n<p>**Time Unit Purchase (TUP) entitles owner to: **</p>\n<p><strong>Use of 2 consecutive weeks of double occupancy room during the calendar year (of the 50 available weeks)</strong></p>\n<p>Duration of use is 5 years (i.e. 2 weeks per year for 5 years) at which time the holder has the option to renew at a highly favorable market price or to ‘sell’ back to the foundation or on the second market within the Gitcoin ecosystem.

To qualify, investors must have good credit and put down at least 10 percent of the property’s purchase price. The term of the loan can be up to 25 years, and interest rates can vary based on current market conditions and the applicant’s qualifications.</p>\n<p><strong>SBA 504</strong> loans are similar to their 7(a) counterparts; however, there is no limit to how much an investor can borrow. Investors must have good credit and provide a down payment of 10 percent of the purchase price. The term of the loan is typically 20 years, and the investor must occupy at least 51 percent of the property. Unlike SBA 7(a) loans, these mortgages are not funded entirely through a private lender. Instead, they are made available through Certified Development Companies (CDCs), nonprofit entities that promote economic development within their communities. Typically, a commercial lender funds 50 percent of the project, and a CDC finances up to 40 percent.</p>\n<p>Please post your thoughts, suggestions, feedback here <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pray/4.png?v=12\" title=\":pray:t4:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":pray:t4:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">.</p>\n<p>And feel free to reach out to Paige &amp;/or Alex on Telegram:<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/paigedao\">@PaigeDAO</a><br>\n<span class=\"mention\">@akim0x</span></p>\n            <p><small>13 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/community-owned-eco-resort-through-fractional-property-use-rights/18957\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/community-owned-eco-resort-through-fractional-property-use-rights/18957","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Jun 2024 17:40:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18957"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/community-owned-eco-resort-through-fractional-property-use-rights/18957.rss","#text":"Community Owned Eco-Resort Through Fractional Property Use Rights"},"filter":false},{"title":"CCN Climate Solutions Round Retro","dc:creator":"jon-spark-eco","category":"🌱 Gitcoin Grants","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa\" title=\"CCN Logo 2.0 Banner\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_345x153.png\" alt=\"CCN Logo 2.0 Banner\" data-base62-sha1=\"4Jwd2PiKluUHLVe83VyT9c4OOpQ\" width=\"345\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_345x153.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_517x229.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/212df3f905d9d4f5233db7ac3e68c0e66dc59afa_2_690x306.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D1DADD\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"round-description-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-description-1\"></a>Round Description</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Climate Coordination Network</a> believes that Climate Action is the ultimate public good. Why? Because climate change increasingly impacts everyone worldwide. Our mission is to accelerate community-supported climate solutions on a global scale, catalyzing diverse forms of climate action to create a sustainable and equitable future for all.</p>\n<p>The GG20 Climate Solutions Round provides strategic grant distribution to support global climate solutions projects.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"round-objectives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-objectives-2\"></a>Round Objectives</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>To empower climate projects that are dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and serve as core infrastructure for Web3 climate solutions.</li>\n<li>To build community and accelerate coordination to help grow the greater public goods for climate solutions worldwide.</li>\n<li>To test and improve impact metrics tools that enable climate projects to showcase their real-world impact for more effective and streamlined measurement and evaluation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"target-audience-and-participation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#target-audience-and-participation-3\"></a>Target Audience and Participation</h2>\n<p>The Climate Solutions Round focuses on supporting early-stage projects within the following 9 categories of climate solutions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Renewable Energy</li>\n<li>Oracles &amp; dMRV</li>\n<li>Carbon Accounting</li>\n<li>Climate Activism/Education</li>\n<li>Nature-Based Solutions</li>\n<li>Ocean-Based Solutions</li>\n<li>Climate Adaptation/Climate Resilience</li>\n<li>Supply Chain Solutions</li>\n<li>Built Environment/Transportation</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"climate-solution-round-implementation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#climate-solution-round-implementation-4\"></a>Climate Solution Round Implementation</h2>\n<p>The Climate Coordination Network (CCN) is a dedicated team of six people from around the world who have served for the past two years on the Gitcoin Climate Advisory team and have managed the decentralized climate round since GG19. The team is familiar with Gitcoin Grants round setup and management, and we divide up the many tasks based on skill set and availability. To set up the GG20 Climate Solutions round, we reviewed the <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/climate-solutions-round-eligibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">eligibility criteria</a>, updated the <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CCN Climate Solutions Portal</a>, started communications and outreach, created the new Climate Solutions Metrics Garden and updated grantee resources such as onboarding videos and review process documentation.</p>\n<p>Our main challenges for GG20 involved our Climate Grantee review process. Most of our projects are making IRL impact, which is difficult to evaluate as it tends to be qualitative vs. quantitative. We strive to improve this process each round and for GG20, we utilized Checker (<a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-checker/17292\">a new tool built by Gitcoin</a>) to help with the lengthy process of reviewing 173 diverse grantee applications. Unlike OSS rounds, Checkers AI features didn’t really help us review climate projects. In the future, the AI model could be trained to provide useful feedback but for now, it was not effective. In past rounds, we used spreadsheet tools for the evaluation process. Checker provided a nice interface that gathered the information needed to complete our reviews. We hope to see something like Checker integrated into Grants Stack, as the approvals and rejections are still manual. We experienced technical issues with Grants Stack which did not allow us to export our grantee contact information, which caused a breakdown in communication with our grantees for most of the round.</p>\n<p>Going forward, we are discussing a new process that will streamline, simplify, and clarify climate reviews by requiring dMRV for certain types of projects and impact reporting using tools such as Hypercerts and KarmaGAP. We will require all of our grantees to use KarmaGAP to provide 2-3 milestones they will accomplish with the funding received during GG20. This requirement will enable grantees to showcase their impact and significantly reduce our time during the review process in future rounds.</p>\n<p>The Climate Solutions Round’s unique feature/approach is that we cultivate a supportive community that results in ongoing productive relationships and collaborations. During our review of grant proposals from projects that have been in multiple rounds, we found clear examples of grantees helping each other and working together to accomplish goals and address challenges. For example, as we transition to clearer requirements for impact metrics, many grantees are working with a Silvi Protocol, a long-time trusted dMRV project with an amazing web3 tech stack. Another example of climate grantees supporting each other is Helpers Social Development Foundation, a community-led NGO in Nigeria that is developing solar-powered community centers in partnership with The Solar Foundation and is also working to pilot a IoT smart metering device built by Switch Electric (also a grantee based in Nigeria).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"outcomes-and-statistics-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outcomes-and-statistics-5\"></a>Outcomes and Statistics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/42161/29\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Report card</a></li>\n<li>129 Climate Solutions Grantees</li>\n<li>Total crowdfunding: $58k</li>\n<li>9,314 contributions</li>\n<li>2,262 unique donors</li>\n<li>Average contribution: $4.08</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Summary of the past three rounds shows growth round over round.<br>\n<img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/714564dcaaeddfc1458f3be061ee1c51aeaeabe1.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ga2D47egHIife87SZQMWa5ES4xz\" width=\"572\" height=\"163\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"round-matching-results-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-matching-results-6\"></a>Round Matching Results</h2>\n<p>After the round, we evaluated the matching estimates using several different methods: COCM, QF, and Pairwise. We then had a long internal debate about the best way to calculate the results. While most, if not all, other rounds followed Gitcoins’ lead and used COCM, we found it was not a good fit for our community. COCM looks at the interconnection between donors and their donation behavior and rewards projects with diverse donors who contribute to a variety of other projects and penalizes those that have donors who only contributed to one project. COCM produces a fairer outcome in many rounds and helps with sybil defense.</p>\n<p>The issue we found is that the climate round is a closely connected community. Most donors contribute to many projects in the round which we love to see. We are proud of the coordination we see within the community, but the issue we saw was the round results were flattened when using the COCM calculations. The projects that had received the most support and signal from the community would not receive a fair share of the matching pool. In some cases this was 60-70% less than they would receive using the QF calculations.</p>\n<p>If we had moved forward with COCM, we would have disincentivized some of our top grantees who had worked so hard in marketing during the round. Because of this, we decided to use the standard QF calculations.</p>\n<p>The round results can be found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n9N9hKp4S4M3DgSblEOuCAexjwl5xzTkdNq2cHdMJk4/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impact-assessment-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-7\"></a>Impact Assessment</h2>\n<p>In sum, the GG20 CCN Climate Solutions round impacted 129 climate solutions worldwide (see Climate Impact Map) reducing GHGe, building core infrastructure and—perhaps most importantly—facilitating cooperation and coordination to accelerate climate action.

Sharing here in case it is helpful for anyone else and so the Gitcoin community who has helped make Zuzalu possible can be included.</p>\n<p><strong>Process for choosing the manager for Continuous Innovation:</strong><br>\nBasically Janine called me up and asked if I wanted to do it and offered me $35/hr in pay and I tracked my time in ClickUp.</p>\n<p><strong>Process for choosing the manager for the Q1 rounds:</strong><br>\nI think a few people including Vitalik, Janine, Nicole etc. reached out to Chance who managed the round as a volunteer (Huge kudos for that and I wish I was working with him on the upcoming round.)</p>\n<p><strong>Process for choosing the managers/stewards for Q2 rounds</strong> (one event and one tech round):<br>\nSejal posted in the Zuzalu forum that people could self-nominate to be a steward, and voting was held where three stewards would be chosen for each round. Voters could choose their top three choices for each round and whichever 3 at the end who had the most were chosen yesterday. I’m one of the tech round stewards.<br>\n<strong>I think people should be able to form parties</strong> and have 3 people apply together. The reason is because otherwise individuals might end up being chosen who do not want to work together. (I’m happy with the people I’m working with in the tech round luckily but I see how this can go wrong) This should avoid getting locked into a 2-party system if we are using approval voting instead of first pas the post.</p>\n<p><strong>What I did for the first round:</strong><br>\n-Announcements about the round reminding people to apply<br>\n-DMing Zuzaluans with projects we thought should be included<br>\n-Messaging and calling with some applicants who I didn’t know to see if they were ligit<br>\n-Co-writing video calls during which people wrote up their projects and sharing tips on how to write it or use markdown such as how to include pictures<br>\nAnswering a bunch of community questions, mostly when people were having difficulty donating.</p>\n<p>Then for choosing which projects to accept in the end, there were a couple calls with Marine, Janine, and Nicole where we looked through the applicants, their twitters, websites, if we knew them, and if they matched the criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Donations:</strong><br>\nDuring donations, we received a lot of feedback that adding enough stamps to Gitcoin passport for many people was impossible for achieving a matching score and that the process was excruciating. I am very glad we have other options now.</p>\n<p>For the Q1 rounds, we ended up saying if anyone has a Zupass they would receive full matching, and after some discussion with Umar and others matching funds were disbursed half according to what Zupass holders donated to and half according to what others donated to.</p>\n<p>For these Q2 rounds, I made this <strong>suggestion of adding someone’s legal name as a proof of personhood</strong> deciding whether to match a donor’s contributions. That can be obtained with a credit card payment: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/10-000-donated-to-gitcoin-zuzalu-round-with-credit-card-pilot-project-proposal/18827\" class=\"inline-onebox\">$10,000 Donated to Gitcoin Zuzalu Round with Credit Card Pilot Project Proposal</a><br>\nConsidering someone could get matching with on-chain history using model based detection and/or this method, that means they could donate two times total using each method once and get more matching. This would allow a sort of 2x Sybil, but may also encourage more total donations and could allow donations for billions of non-crypto users. With that trade-off in mind, it depends on if the current Zuzalu round stewards decide to also accept this proof of personhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria:</strong><br>\n<strong>For the Continuous Innovation Round</strong> it was super broad basically saying if it supports the Zuzalu mission and values it can qualify (plus looking ligit), it’s open source, and noting that if you are a Zuzaluan then you are more likely to have the project accepted.<br>\nZuzalu mission (from a workshop I and Rachel and Dimi held during Zuzalu where we broke participants into small groups to answer a form with 10 questions, then a smaller team reviewed those answers and refined it into this) - to foster a global network of communities to advance humanity by creating playgrounds at the intersection of free and open technology, health, science and social innovation<br>\nValues: Authentic Kindness, Mutual Respect, Personal Growth, Freedom</p>\n<p><strong>For the Q1 rounds the criteria was:</strong><br>\n“Technology projects must be fully open-source, relevant to the needs of in-person Zuzalu events, and blockchain components must be maximally compatible with applicable Ethereum ecosystem standards.<br>\nEvents projects must be what is reasonably understood as a “Zuzalu event”: roughly, a long-duration in-person gathering whose goal is to experiment with open frontier digital and social technologies.<br>\nContributions may be retroactive in intent, supporting events that have already happened! So eg. an event that takes place in Q1 is eligible for funding in both Q1 and Q2, just as an event that takes place in Q2 would be.”</p>\n<p>In the end, the events round was somewhat controversial considering it featured everything from a small retreat of several friends living together to hackerhouses to a single person’s efforts supporting an event to an entire team with a full on 8 week pop up village with 200 people.</p>\n<p>I am not an events round steward but made this suggestion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is at least 2 weeks in duration</li>\n<li>Has a topic focused on at least one of the original Zuzalu tracks</li>\n<li>Core team includes at least one resident of Zuzalu or participant in ZuConnect</li>\n<li>Includes aspects of co-living</li>\n<li>Includes a co-created schedule</li>\n<li>Includes coworking on meaningful projects</li>\n<li>Between 50-300 residents anticipated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There won’t be any perfect criteria but since we need to pick something it might be nice to add some minimum numbers for residents and how long it has to be. I figure if it is longer than 2 weeks without any limit for how long it can be maybe that even incentivizes some long-term projects, permanent village projects, etc. (without it just being another grouphouse, hackerhouse, or paid for vacation of friends) Also maybe it’s worth adding a cap to how many residents it can be (somewhere 150-300.) I think a lot of the magic of the original Zuzalu is that it was close to a Dunbar sized number and I wonder if it would lose that if it got too big</p>\n<p>For tech round I think there has not been much controversy, so perhaps we can stick to similar criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Matches the Zuzalu mission and values</li>\n<li>Open source</li>\n<li>Fits into one of the original Zuzalu topic tracks</li>\n<li>More likely to be chosen if there are Zuzalu or Zuconnect residents as team members</li>\n<li>Blockchain components must be maximally compatible with applicable Ethereum ecosystem standards</li>\n<li>Relevant to the needs of in-person Zuzalu events</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For what a Zuzalu event is, here’s the best I can think of on that: <a href=\"https://www.noahchonlee.com/post/what-is-a-zuzalu-style-event\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.noahchonlee.com/post/what-is-a-zuzalu-style-event</a></p>\n<p>I am writing this while in Zanzalu in Zanzibar. It’s funny that one year ago as I was managing the first Zuzalu round I was also in Zanzibar and there had only been Zuzalu event and now there has been around 7ish (see here: <a href=\"https://nsforum.net/post/kjzl6cwe1jw149zs6m44uatxf7329r981pm9zb21fm87co39vl5igm0xnuezp5d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://nsforum.net/post/kjzl6cwe1jw149zs6m44uatxf7329r981pm9zb21fm87co39vl5igm0xnuezp5d</a>)<br>\nI am very grateful to Vitalik and Gitcoin for all their support and it makes the work I am doing today possible (I ran out of funds last time I was in Africa until Gitcoin saved my ass, see here: <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-appreciations-thread/18332/2\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Gitcoin Appreciations Thread - #2 by Sov</a>)</p>\n<p>I’m sure we will make plenty more mistakes along the way but it’s great to see this progress and I’m glad for this whole community!

Overall, donors generated a <strong>7.4X multiplier</strong> of their donations in matching funds.</p>\n<p>Compared with our last round, the second iteration of OpenCivics Grants was the most successful round we’ve run so far with <strong>40% more donors</strong>, <strong>20% more crowdfunding donations</strong>, and <strong>200% larger matching grants</strong> for the top grantees.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/42161/31\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Click here to view the automatically generated Gitcoin Report Card for the round.</a></p>\n<p><strong>For a detailed data analysis of the grant round results, check out <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Consortium-Grant-Round-02-Analytics-9f206f580d93462d80a55c3132a7c829?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Consortium Grant Round 02 Analytics</a> on our wiki.</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 2.49.58 PM\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888_2_511x499.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 2.49.58 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"2jCKprPC5rBsExEx4I3zcKOHRd6\" width=\"511\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888_2_511x499.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888_2_766x748.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/103c42de19a00ebe488096e266429e10de009888_2_1022x998.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F0F0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"overall-data-insights-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overall-data-insights-2\"></a>Overall Data Insights</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Significant Matching Contributions</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereal Forest</strong>, <strong>Urbánika’s bus</strong>, and <strong>Metagov</strong> received substantial matching funds. This indicates that these projects were able to leverage their donor base effectively to secure matching contributions. It suggests a high confidence level from matching funders in these projects’ potential impact.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Top Fundraisers</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereal Forest</strong> stands out with the highest total amount received ($14,227.02). This project not only received the most substantial total funds but also had the highest number of donations (165), reflecting both broad and deep support. The high number of donations and matching funds indicates effective fundraising strategies and strong donor engagement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Potential for Increased Engagement</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects like <strong>Mycelial Civic Knowledge Networks</strong> and <strong>Exploring Post-Capitalist Crypto Pathways</strong> have moderate total funds and a relatively high number of donations. These projects could potentially increase their total funds by focusing on increasing the size of individual donations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Low Engagement with High Potential</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>VoiceDeck: A Marketplace for Journalism Impact Certificates</strong> and <strong>Moos: A Berlin hub for reimagining our cities</strong> received substantial total funds but have relatively low ratios of donations to total funds. This suggests that these projects received significant donations from fewer contributors. They may benefit from strategies aimed at broadening their donor base to enhance sustainability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Diverse Fundraising Success</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The diversity in donation patterns and matching fund success across projects indicates varied effectiveness in fundraising strategies. Projects with lower total amounts but high donation counts might explore methods to increase individual donation amounts. Conversely, projects with high total amounts but fewer donations could focus on broadening their engagement strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"round-operator-insights-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-operator-insights-3\"></a>Round Operator Insights</h1>\n<p>Overall, we learned that Quadratic Funding is unpredictable and, even by constraining some variables, the outcomes are very hard to sculpt or shape. We failed in our goal of ensuring each project walked away from the round with at least $3,000 - $5,000 USD, a goal driven by our first hand experience as grantees of extremely low returns of grant funding when compared with the time it takes grantees to promote their grants.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"limiting-grantees-hypothesis-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#limiting-grantees-hypothesis-4\"></a>Limiting Grantees Hypothesis</h2>\n<p>This round, we were experimenting with the hypothesis that reducing the total number of projects while increasing the matching pool would ensure that the minimum grant allocation would be large enough for all projects to create meaningful, documentable impacts created through the grant funding. We calculated the range of matching pool distributions based on our Genesis Round which reflected a 2-3x spread between the smallest matching amount and the largest. To achieve our goal of significant funding for each project, we chose to restrict the total number of projects to 16, a number derived from our analysis of the previous round’s outcomes and the volume of matching funds available for our second round.</p>\n<p>Our insights from this aspect of the round were twofold. First, the matching distribution for this round was far more extreme than anticipated. The range from the lowest matching amount to the highest amount was closer to 10x, a significant increase from our previous round. In one sense, this is a positive discovery because it shows that the Quadratic Funding mechanism is successfully allocating funds based on the preferences of the collective intelligence of donors. On the other hand, it means that the hypothesis we were testing failed to achieve our desired goals. Rather than seeing this as a failure, we see it as a learning opportunity that reveals the high variability of matching amounts and the impossibility of using the variables that <em>are</em> within our control to influence the outcome, even if our desired influence on the outcome is holistically considered and well intentioned. This feeds into the second insight from this aspect of the round. As round operators, we struggled to limit participation in the round to only 16 projects. There were many deserving projects who submitted applications whom we rejected simply based on the premise that we had an obligation to test our hypothesis that a smaller number of projects would yield significant funding for each project. Filling the final spots in the round was a painful process that required over a week of deliberation, weighing a number of variables like use of funds, project history and track record, and available grant size vs scope of the project.</p>\n<p>Based on the feedback and data generated by this round, we are unlikely to limit the number of projects in future rounds in the same way. This doesn’t solve the issue of unpredictable results and the potential for grantees to spend 10s or 100s of hours on project promotion only to receive a few hundred or a thousand dollars in matching funds, but it does embrace the philosophy of quadratic funding which places the entire allocation process in the hands of donors. Accepting and acknowledging this as a fundamental limitation and benefit of Quadratic Funding, we will encourage grantees to consider allocating only the number of hours they are willing to lose (without a guarantee of earning the value of that time back in donations) for their grant promotion.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"updates-to-gitcoin-passport-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#updates-to-gitcoin-passport-5\"></a>Updates To Gitcoin Passport</h2>\n<p>For those not familiar, Gitcoin Passport is a sybil resistance mechanism for Quadratic Funding rounds that attempts to ensure donors are unique human individuals and not bots or scammers attempting to rig the system for their benefit. Prior to this round, the Gitcoin Passport was based on Stamps, attestations of identity that included a number of different identity verification mechanisms like Google and GitHub accounts. This round, Gitcoin introduced Cluster Matching, an AI-enabled system that autonomously reviewed the on-chain transaction history of each donor to verify their “proof of humanity.”</p>\n<p>Comparing the Gitcoin Passport Stamp-based matching results with the newly created Cluster Matching-based results, we were pleased to discover that the new Cluster Matching approach generated a more equitable and holistic distribution of funds. We believe this occurred because the Stamps system was an unwieldy user experience that took tremendous time and effort to reach a “passport score” that made a user eligible for matching funds. Even as web3 experts, it took us extensive time and energy to achieve a passing score and we imagine that the user experience was so challenging for most ordinary donors that they were discouraged from completing their passport or perhaps even donating to projects. Cluster matching reduces friction for donors and empowers non-web3 savvy individuals to make donations that qualify for matching funds.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"arbitrum-x-gitcoin-user-experience-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#arbitrum-x-gitcoin-user-experience-6\"></a>Arbitrum x Gitcoin User Experience</h2>\n<p>This was also our first round using Arbitrum, having run our previous round on a more obscure Layer 2 blockchain, the Public Goods Network. Overall, this was an incredibly positive experience. While the user interface for program managers is almost entirely the same other than a slightly different process for bridging and adding funds to the smart contract, as a donor, the experience of donating across multiple rounds on the same chain was incredibly streamlined and supported the cross-promotion of projects with grants in multiple rounds. Gas fees on Arbitrum are incredibly low which was another massive benefit for our grantees, donors and the round overall.</p>\n<p>With that said, many of our donors still expressed challenges with bridging funds from Ethereum mainnet to a Layer 2 blockchain. We look forward to a future in which the donor experience on Gitcoin can include fiat donations as well as some kind of inter-chain mechanism that makes it irrelevant to the front end donors which chain the rounds themselves choose to operate. These challenges are persistent across the web3 ecosystem and are not unique to Arbitrum or Gitcoin, but we look forward to collaborating with both teams to co-develop the underlying infrastructures that help Quadratic Funding enter the mainstream, a path that serves the entire public goods ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"looking-forward-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#looking-forward-7\"></a>Looking Forward</h1>\n<p>We’re excited to continue offering Gitcoin Grants rounds as a service to our members. We are well positioned to advocate on behalf of the entire Consortium of civic innovators we serve to raise matching funds and provide the support structures for funding rounds. We are currently exploring a large grant from ThankArb to develop a new funding mechanism for our members that distributes drips of funding to each project on an ongoing basis. This method, Streaming Quadratic Funding, will be developed by a new initiative called <em>Flow State</em> and we’re excited to collaborate with them to explore adding specific functionality that is custom-made for the OpenCivics Consortium. The platform will offer a token-gated environment where OpenCivics members can use Quadratic Voting to express their preferences on where the continuous drips of grant funding are allocated. This mechanism breaks fund allocation out of the time-locked grant round context into an ongoing stream of funding that supports the sustainability of projects over time.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we forged lasting bonds with the other community grant round operators who all expressed an interest in co-hosting a collaborative round in the future. As ever, Gitcoin is all about relationships and this round deeply strengthened the relationships between community round operators. There seemed to be a universal sentiment that the entire public goods funding space could benefit from a funding round tailored to synergistic collaboration between different impact sectors, working together as ephemeral DAOs to generate outputs based on the unique contributions of multiple projects. We’re excited to explore this possibility and to work with other community round operators to continue serving our grantees in innovative ways.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>We believe Quadratic Funding for public goods funding allocations is one of the most promising and useful contributions of web3 infrastructure to the social impact space. This round taught us an immense amount about the limitations and benefits of Quadratic Funding related to ways we can improve the donor experience, grantee experience, and overall impact of the grants themselves. We are currently engaging our grantees in a participatory process to identify and report on the milestones they achieve with the funds they’ve received from our Consortium Round 02 which we will share with you here in a few months. Our grantees have already started to identify pathways to synergize their project efforts within the context of emerging collaborative initiatives within the Consortium and we can’t wait to see what we’re able to create together.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our donors, grantees, and members for supporting public goods and for funding the critical work of civic innovation.</p>\n<p>In Us We Trust,</p>\n<p>OpenCivics Stewards</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opencivics-consortium-round-02-insights-learnings/18879\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opencivics-consortium-round-02-insights-learnings/18879","pubDate":"Tue, 28 May 2024 21:24:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-18879"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opencivics-consortium-round-02-insights-learnings/18879.rss","#text":"OpenCivics Consortium Round 02 Insights & Learnings"},"filter":false},{"title":"Beyond QF quadratic funding: comments, suggestions, ideas 💡","dc:creator":"mars","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<h1><a name=\"beyond-qf-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#beyond-qf-1\"></a>Beyond QF</h1>\n<p>My personal view, exhibit <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/zero.png?v=12\" title=\":zero:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":zero:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s not the broader Web3 community vote.

While smart contracts ideally enforce these principles, our current industry limitations mean we can’t codify everything.

Introducing Minimum Steward Approval Thresholds</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure higher quality proposals &amp; reduce spam, we propose implementing minimum voting power thresholds for steward approval based on proposal type. This approach requires stewards to have more significant investment in each proposal type, thereby improving the signal from the community.

We put up a matching pool of 35 ETH for 23 Regenerative Land Projects. This was our first time hosting a Gitcoin round.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Overall, the experience was great. The tools you’ve created are impressive, and I think they are really important and impactful. And they keep getting better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I went through the “Round Managers Training Program” last year, which helped prepare me for operating the round. The training program was difficult to fully engage with from New Zealand timezones (recordings were crucial), but it successfully got me more confident with the Grants Manager interface. <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=12\" title=\":+1:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":+1:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having a consistent person from the Gitcoin community to communicate with during GG20 was super helpful. At first I was reaching out to different folks for support, but it wasn’t clear who was best for what, and response times varied. Once I locked in with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mathildadv\">@MathildaDV</a> things became a lot easier. It would be helpful for round operators to have clearer expectations upfront about how to get assistance from Gitcoin along the way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We applied to be a community round, but weren’t chosen this time. The transparency of the process and thoughtful feedback afterwards was really top-notch. Importantly, it supported us in thinking through how to structure the application and communication process for our own applicants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Over a third of the projects in Ma Earth’s round were completely new to web3. And given our focus on land projects, many of the donors were new to crypto as well. So we spent a lot of our time and energy around tutorials, tech support, walking people through wallets and bridging, etc. This was very much intentional and anticipated, as we believe/hope these communities will benefit from getting onchain.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I observed during these onboarding processes is simply how difficult the wallet UX still is for most people. Especially anything related to layer 2’s (some common issues: not understanding bridging to begin with, confusing USDC.e with USDC, struggling to bridge out of Base, and confusing ARB with Arbitrum). These UX challenges seem well recognized in the crypto community, and are mostly outside of Gitcoin’s control. I’m optimistic things like smart wallets and fiat payment flows will make things smoother in the future. But clearly, Ethereum is not ready for mainstream adoption with the current wallets and L2 UX.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Another adoption issue is getting organizations (not just individuals) onboarded into exchanges. It seems easier to get individuals signed up on Coinbase and Kraken, but there are more AML/KYC hurdles for organizations, at least outside the US.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We set a $5 minimum for matching threshold, and decided to use the new COCM model as our strategy for sybil resistance. We disabled Passport, out of fear of creating additional hurdles for our non-web3 audience. The $5 minimum skewed our results more than I expected, as we still received a lot of ~$1 donations during the round. Presumably this has become a learned behavior from the Gitcoin donor community who are used to making ‘vonations’ of ~$1. I felt like the COCM model improved results effectively, though it felt a bit black box. Generally speaking, COCM made the outcomes better for our grantees newer to web3, and it appropriately ticked down the matching for a couple outliers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My understanding is that Gitcoin is spinning out Passport and continuing to evolve these sybil-attack systems. Without knowing many details, this does seem like a good move. In the current GG20 incarnation, it almost feels like there are competing goals on Gitcoin around community crowdfunding versus web3 identity/fraud tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We benefitted from the guidance of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/omniharmonic\">@omniharmonic</a> at OpenCivic and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jon-spark-eco\">@jon-spark-eco</a> at Climate Coordination Network. There is value in linking the round operators together, and I’m grateful for their support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some specific UX suggestions/ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>More prominent indication on checkout if the donor’s contribution won’t unlock matching for some reason.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We had set up our round for 30 ETH matching (~100k USD at the time). Then ETH’s price declined, so we decided to fund the contract with 35 ETH. The Grants Manager interface explicitly said we could add more. What confused/surprised me is that the extra 5 ETH didn’t filter through to the matching pool, and basically all signs of it ‘disappeared’ afterwards in the interface. I’m assuming we’ll be able to reclaim these funds after the waiting period, but would suggest some improved messaging on Grants Manager around this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I understand this was a shared issue, but after the round was over we were stuck for about a week on distributing funds to grantees, as the interface wasn’t responding. More upfront/broadcast communication on this would’ve helped, as we were in the dark on what the issue was, and wasted cycles and nerves trying to get to the bottom of it. <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/grimacing.png?v=12\" title=\":grimacing:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":grimacing:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Gitcoin interface had some slight inconsistencies between the report card versus the “round stats” versus the CSV exports. The discrepancies were small and not enough to cause problems, but it’s just generally not a good feeling when numbers don’t match up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We had non-crypto people helping us field initial applications. It would be great to be able to export these applications from the interface in a cleaner way. As it stands, I could only get the text out in CSV format, so our other panelists weren’t able to see all the images submitted by the applicants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Probably a big ask, but it would be nice to have more real-time visibility into incoming donations in the Grants Manager interface. In particular, I could imagine donors having the optional ability to include their Twitter handles or email addresses with their contributions, and there being an easier way to give thanks/acknowledgements to donors. I think it’d increase sharing overall, and importantly, give projects a better opportunity to express their gratitude to those donors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When projects share their Explorer links on Twitter, the current preview is just a generic thumbnail and text. Given there are already logos/banners added to the project profiles, maybe those graphics could be included in the metadata to make the UX on Twitter more appealing and unique. Same for the round pages.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay those are the main points that come to mind, hope they’re helpful. I’ll do a separate write-up for the Ma Earth community with tips for any other funders who might be considering running a QF round on Gitcoin in the future. I’ll add a link to the comments below when that’s done.</p>\n<p>Also, we’d love to hear your feedback, and suggestions for how we build in the future!
