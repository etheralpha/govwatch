We will be using the Ma Earth Grants Round to advocate and educate people around these tools, and to give them a positive onboarding experience into Web3. We are also cultivating relationships within the traditional philanthropic community to bridge new capital into quadratic funding and place-based approaches.</p>\n<p>We see a natural synergy forming with other Gitcoin Community Rounds, including the Climate Coordination Network, emphasizing tools and enabling infrastructure, and BioFi, focused on bioregional scale financing facilities. We are also friends and fans of the Regen Coordi-Nation, Open Civics, and Giveth rounds. Ma Earth will continue to focus on place-based regeneration projects while simultaneously doing our best to support and amplify other communities.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-8\"></a>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:</h3>\n<p>We have a matching pool of $150,000 provided by Biome Trust. The funding address is: 0x617B7ab789bafF8B7c4d641d18e2fc42d1e1666e</p>\n<p>We warmly welcome additional funds into the matching pool, as we are confident in the impactful work being done by the grantees.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"advisors-for-this-round-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#advisors-for-this-round-9\"></a>Advisors for This Round:</h3>\n<p>We have three round advisors who bring experience and context from other Gitcoin Grants Rounds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Samantha Power, <a href=\"https://www.biofi.earth/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BioFi Project</a></li>\n<li>Holke Brammer, <a href=\"https://hypercerts.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hypercerts Foundation</a></li>\n<li>Jon Ruth, <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Climate Coordination Network</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"funding-mechanism-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-mechanism-10\"></a>Funding Mechanism:</h3>\n<p>We are using quadratic funding because of how it supports resource allocation to communities with democratic participation. We will also use Passport’s Model-Based Detection and COCM for sybil defense and optimization. We will focus on Web3 tutorials and education to help newer grantees and donors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-size-and-engagement-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-11\"></a>Community Size and Engagement:</h3>\n<p>Our first grants round raised ~$60k from 1000+ contributions and 420 contributors for 23 selected land projects. $40k of those funds came from a single anonymous donor. Our matching pool was $100k, provided by Biome Trust.</p>\n<p>We have ~10,000 followers across YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram. We’ve conducted over 100 interviews about regenerative finance in the past year, check them out here: <a href=\"https://maearth.com/episodes\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://maearth.com/episodes</a></p>\n<p>We received over 50 applications for the first round, with very little upfront promotion. Since then we have also received a lot of inbound interest from land projects around the world, who are interested in participating in our second round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"type-of-projects-to-fund-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#type-of-projects-to-fund-12\"></a>Type of Projects to Fund:</h3>\n<p><strong>Place-based projects:</strong> We aim to fund projects that are engaged in place-based regenerative land stewardship. Place-based projects create real-world impact, which we want to support with this Gitcoin Grants Round as an innovative and scalable funding mechanism.</p>\n<p>In general, we’ve identified the following as common features of regenerative land projects.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Soil Health Improvement: Activities such as composting, cover cropping, no-till farming, and rotational grazing are employed to enhance soil fertility, structure, and biodiversity.</li>\n<li>Biodiversity Conservation: Efforts are made to promote biodiversity through practices like planting native species, creating wildlife corridors, and restoring habitats for endangered or threatened species.</li>\n<li>Water Management: Sustainable water management techniques, such as rainwater harvesting, restoring wetlands, and implementing water-efficient irrigation systems, are utilized to conserve and improve water quality.</li>\n<li>Carbon Sequestration: Practices like agroforestry, reforestation, and holistic grazing management are employed to capture and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, mitigating climate change.</li>\n<li>Community Engagement: Regenerative land projects often involve local communities and stakeholders in decision-making processes, education, and awareness campaigns to foster a sense of ownership and stewardship.</li>\n<li>Holistic Management: These projects often take a holistic approach, considering the interconnectedness of various elements within the ecosystem and striving for balance and resilience in the long term.</li>\n<li>Indigenous Land Rights: Recognizing and respecting Indigenous land rights and sovereignty, including Indigenous peoples’ knowledge, practices, and cultural connections to the land.</li>\n<li>Land Governance: Transforming land governance structures to be more inclusive, equitable, and participatory, with a focus on decentralized decision-making and community-led stewardship.</li>\n<li>Environmental Justice: Prioritizing environmental justice by addressing inequalities and disproportionate impacts of environmental degradation on marginalized communities. This includes ensuring that regenerative land projects benefit local communities and contribute to social and economic empowerment.</li>\n<li>Healing and Reconciliation: Acknowledging and addressing intergenerational trauma and healing relationships with the land and among different communities. This involves fostering reconciliation processes, building trust, and promoting dialogue and collaboration between Indigenous peoples, local communities, and other stakeholders involved in regenerative land projects.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"estimated-number-of-eligible-grantees-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#estimated-number-of-eligible-grantees-13\"></a>Estimated Number of Eligible Grantees:</h3>\n<p>We estimate that we’ll receive ~50-100 eligible grantee applications. We intend to choose up to 30 projects.</p>\n<p>We are capping the number for multiple reasons. First, we want to ensure the average grant received by each project is meaningful enough to warrant their fundraising efforts, especially since most of these communities are newer to Web3 and there is a lot of onboarding involved.</p>\n<p>Second, we seek to maintain a high quality bar and rigorous selection process for projects in our grants rounds, in order to instill confidence for matching pool funders. When you contribute to the Ma Earth matching pool, we want you to know your funds are going to high impact projects that have been thoroughly vetted by a panel of experts.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we are setting a cap because it allows us to be in closer relationships with grantees, as we learn more about their needs and experiences. We see this as the beginning of a long-term journey together.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"impact-assessment-plan-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-plan-14\"></a>Impact Assessment Plan:</h3>\n<p>We intend to assess impact primarily through our ongoing relationships and communication with grantees. We are working with Hypercerts Foundation on an integration to specifically recognize and reward environmental impact. We are also cultivating multiple partnerships in the MRV (Measuring, Reporting, and Verification) ecosystem as we anticipate eventual convergence with these tools. It’s still early, and for this second round, we will be asking repeat applicants/grantees to share their progress and impact since the first round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"additional-considerations-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#additional-considerations-15\"></a>Additional Considerations:</h3>\n<p>We have not decided which chain to deploy our round on. We are actively considering Arbitrum (given the network effects with Gitcoin’s OSS round), Celo (given the synergy with other community rounds), and Base (given the UX improvements of Base for newer Web3 users). We welcome any further input.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"potential-conflicts-of-interest-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#potential-conflicts-of-interest-16\"></a>Potential Conflicts of Interest:</h3>\n<p>We will maintain a conflicts of interest register amongst panelists, and they will not judge applicants where they have a potential conflict or embedded interest.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"more-information-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#more-information-17\"></a>More Information:</h3>\n<p>If we do not receive matching funds from Gitcoin, we will still conduct the round.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts -

However, because these incentives are applied equally across all projects, they should not interfere with the QF results.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-top-20-projects-to-redistribute-20-of-their-matching-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-2-top-20-projects-to-redistribute-20-of-their-matching-22\"></a><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/two.png?v=12\" title=\":two:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":two:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Top 20% projects to redistribute 20% of their matching</h4>\n<p>Logic and reasoning: The winners of the QF are reliable and trustworthy, with established trust and reputation. Because of that trustworthiness, I’m suggesting a new model of fund distribution: the top 20% of projects will redistribute 20% of their matching funds as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10% to projects that are good</li>\n<li>10% to projects that are good AND received below the average.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a requirement though: “All payouts must be conducted via Allo, not manually.” We will need to check if Allo allows manual adjustments. If not, it is still possible to implement this method (top 20% to redistribute 20%) manually.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"potential-conflicts-of-interest-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#potential-conflicts-of-interest-23\"></a>Potential Conflicts of Interest:</h3>\n<p>Mars Robertson, as the founder of Planetary Council, is actively involved in several projects that are eligible to apply for funding. To avoid conflicts of interest, the simplest and most common-sense solution is to ensure that people involved in the projects do not evaluate their own proposals. This helps maintain fairness and transparency in the process.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"more-information-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#more-information-24\"></a>More Information:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you do not receive matching funds from Gitcoin, will you still participate in the round?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most likely YES, provided that marketing support is available. The marketing aspect is crucial, as without it, the journey could feel isolated, competing for attention among many other well-positioned rounds. Without that visibility, participation may be significantly less effective.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thank you for reading that far…</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proof-of-humanity-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#proof-of-humanity-25\"></a>Proof of humanity</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"cop26-glasgow-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#cop26-glasgow-26\"></a>COP26 Glasgow</h4>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/21b264fd91117b39b0f070e3afe2027e95e21cc8.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/21b264fd91117b39b0f070e3afe2027e95e21cc8\" title=\"COP26 copy square\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/21b264fd91117b39b0f070e3afe2027e95e21cc8_2_500x500.jpeg\" alt=\"COP26 copy square\" data-base62-sha1=\"4O5XPkm4Y2R1yjMEb79MWrOmkoo\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/21b264fd91117b39b0f070e3afe2027e95e21cc8_2_500x500.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/21b264fd91117b39b0f070e3afe2027e95e21cc8_2_750x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/21b264fd91117b39b0f070e3afe2027e95e21cc8_2_1000x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"406D5B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"davos-2024-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#davos-2024-27\"></a>Davos 2024</h4>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/3/3388c83f40413297957063edc6d0f89396733f10.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/3388c83f40413297957063edc6d0f89396733f10\" title=\"DAVOS\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3388c83f40413297957063edc6d0f89396733f10_2_500x500.jpeg\" alt=\"DAVOS\" data-base62-sha1=\"7lTp8SSZNPrMaUsohhuKejRbGq4\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3388c83f40413297957063edc6d0f89396733f10_2_500x500.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3388c83f40413297957063edc6d0f89396733f10_2_750x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3388c83f40413297957063edc6d0f89396733f10_2_1000x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"6E6556\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Some ideas may initially seem pretentious, big, or even radical, until they are brought to life.

Allo GMV: ENS Ecosystem working group will provide 50k in matching funds (2x) expected award amount. Further by supporting builders building on top of Allo: ENS is the global identity system, and a quadratic funding mechanism needs to name things, as all systems do. Enhanced support for labeling and naming will lead to a better product, not only for Allo and ENS but also for the broader Ethereum community.</p>\n<p>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:<br>\n50,000 USDC<br>\nFunding <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x2686A8919Df194aA7673244549E68D42C1685d03\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Address</a></p>\n<p><strong>Advisors for This Round:</strong><br>\nN/A – having run gitcoin rounds in the past, I have the experience neccesary to run a quality round</p>\n<p><strong>Funding Mechanism:</strong><br>\nOur default plan is to use quadratic funding because it shows that broad based support.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Size and Engagement:</strong><br>\nENS is a significant project, with over 12 million names registered (2 million onchain and 10 million+ offchain). As one of the leading projects in the crypto space, ENS has achieved global adoption with integrations from major platforms such as Coinbase, GoDaddy, PayPal, and Venmo. It’s safe to say that there are millions of people in the ENS community, and we aim to continue growing it even further.</p>\n<p>In our previous rounds, we saw hundreds of builders participate and thousands of distinct donors contribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Type of Projects to Fund:</strong><br>\nWe aim to fund projects that grow the number of folks using ENS. This can be done by intergrating ENS into payment systems, using ENS as the namespace on your app, or building decentralized web tools like eth.limo has done.</p>\n<p>Estimated Number of Eligible Grantees:<br>\nWe believe that 100+ grantees will be eligible to apply for this round.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact Assessment Plan</strong></p>\n<p>We intend to assess grantee impact through estimating the number of users an application, directly or indirectly, has gotten to use ENS.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Conflicts of Interest</strong></p>\n<p>None.

While this is the inaugural round, it is designed with the intent of becoming a recurring event that nurtures the development of bioregional financial systems. BioFi projects from this round will also have the opportunity to join the Regen Coordi-Nation network to participate in their planned upcoming Retro Round, further expanding reach, collaborative potential, and funding to support the development of Bioregional Finance Facilities (BFFs).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"core-team-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#core-team-6\"></a>Core Team</h3>\n<p>The BioFi Pathfinders Round is being operated by a diverse and experienced team, each brining strong respective expertise across regenerative finance, bioregionalism, web3 and community organising:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tyler Wakefield</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-wakefield/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">LinkedIn</a> - Regenerative Culture Facilitator &amp; Community of Practice Steward, BioFi Project.

This will provide a robust foundation for attracting significant donations and expand the round’s visibility across Web3, ReFi, and environmental communities.</p>\n<p>To further ensure the accessibility of donations, we aim to utilize ViaPrize to accept fiat donations through PayPal. This will help attract a broader audience, including those new to the Web3 ecosystem, ensuring high engagement and a diverse donor base. We anticipate that this combination of strong networks, comprehensive outreach, and easy donation access will drive a high volume of contributions, meeting or exceeding the 20% crowdfunding requirement relative to any matching provided by Gitcoin.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"scaling-and-growing-the-ethereum-ecosystem-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#scaling-and-growing-the-ethereum-ecosystem-10\"></a>Scaling and Growing the Ethereum Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>This round will serve to demonstrate Web3’s capacity to support innovative, place-based financial systems and draw attention to how decentralized finance can be used to support bioregional regeneration. This will not only expand Ethereum’s use cases but also introduce new donors and actors from traditional finance, philanthropy, and environmental spaces into the ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"match-funding-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#match-funding-11\"></a>Match Funding</h3>\n<p>The matching pool confirmed commitments for the BioFi Pathfinders Round is currently at <strong>$35,000</strong>, which is being secured through a multisig wallet on Celo. The funds have been raised from the following partners:</p>\n<p>• <strong>$5,000</strong> from The BioFi Project</p>\n<p>• <strong>$10,000</strong> from Ma Earth</p>\n<p>• <strong>$10,000</strong> from Celo Public Goods (CeloPG)</p>\n<p>• <strong>$5,000</strong> from Regen Foundation</p>\n<p>• <strong>$5,000</strong> from Design School for Regenerating Earth</p>\n<p>The funds are being collected in a multisig SAFE at this address:<a href=\"https://app.safe.global/home?safe=celo:0x8769d1A0440E1036099c7926acbE7A0869caA056\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> 0x8769d1A0440E1036099c7926acbE7A0869caA056</a></p>\n<p>We are actively seeking additional matching funds from other partners, with discussions underway to further increase the pool e.g. <a href=\"https://x.com/owocki/status/1835080873961791839\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kevin Owocki</a>. We have a clear plan in motion for future fundraising, with ongoing efforts to bring in further support from aligned partners within the regenerative finance, environmental, and Web3 spaces.</p>\n<p>In addition to GG22, <strong>CeloPG</strong> has pledged an extra <strong>$15,000</strong> to be allocated towards the <strong>Regen Coordi-Nation Retro Round</strong> and opened this up for participants of the BioFi Pathfinders Round. This future round will leverage EasyRPGF, built on the Allo protocol.</p>\n<p>We would also like to utilise <strong>~ 5-10% of the raised matching pool</strong> to support the operations of the round, ensuring smooth execution, marketing efforts, and high-impact outcomes for all stakeholders.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"funding-mechanisms-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-mechanisms-12\"></a>Funding Mechanisms</h3>\n<p>The BioFi Pathfinders Round will primarily leverage <strong>Quadratic Funding</strong> as the core funding mechanism. This approach ensures that smaller individual contributions are amplified, allowing community-driven projects to receive more funding based on broad support rather than just large individual donations. This is critical for ensuring a participatory and decentralized allocation of resources across bioregional projects. Furthermore, to enhance sybil protection and reduce the potential impact of coordinated clusters, we will also implement <strong>Passport’s Model Based Detection</strong> and leverage <strong>Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching (COCM)</strong>. These additional layers will help prevent gaming of the system by ensuring that funding flows are not overly influenced by sybil attacks or tight-knit groups, thus maintaining fairness and transparency throughout the round.</p>\n<p>However, we are also mindful that Quadratic Funding, Passport and COCM, in their current configurations, may favour those with greater Web3 technical literacy and privilege. We recognize this challenge and are actively exploring and seeking to implement additional mechanisms and adjustments to ensure that bioregional regeneration initiatives—especially those from marginalized and less Web3-savvy communities—have equitable access to funding. This includes creating more inclusive participation pathways and possibly adjusting the matching parameters to better serve a diverse range of contributors and grantees.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"type-of-projects-to-fund-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#type-of-projects-to-fund-13\"></a>Type of Projects to Fund</h3>\n<p>We aim to fund <strong>10-20 projects</strong> that demonstrate a strong and coherent bioregional identity, whether through a network of individuals, organizations, or as a keystone organization within their bioregion. Eligible projects will be committed to enhancing their Bioregional Finance (BioFi) systems and capacities, with a clear vision toward developing or refining a Bioregional Finance Facility (BFF).</p>\n<p>The projects we are looking to support must show:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A deep commitment to place-based regeneration, grounded in their bioregion’s ecological, cultural, and community-based realities.</li>\n<li>A coherent and mature identity as a Bioregional Organizing Team – whether that’s as a network of individuals/orgs, or as one “backbone” or “keystone” org with allies, and are working towards the development of a BFF in a participatory and inclusive manner with their community (actively involving local stakeholders, Indigenous peoples, and marginalized communities).</li>\n<li>A readiness and commitment to sharing their journey and learning experiences with the broader bioregional and regenerative finance communities, fostering cross-pollination of ideas and best practices.</li>\n<li>Clear strategies for deploying or experimenting with bioregional financial capital, whether through investing in regeneration projects, organizing community assemblies, supporting legal or governance infrastructure, or developing storytelling and pitch materials to attract further investment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These projects will be diverse in approach but united in their commitment to bioregional regeneration.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"impact-assessment-plan-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-plan-14\"></a>Impact Assessment Plan</h3>\n<p>Our approach to impact assessment for the BioFi Pathfinders Round will focus on both quantitative and qualitative self-assessment, with an emphasis on minimizing potential challenges of Web3-specific requirements for grantees at this stage. We aim to gather deep insights into how the funds distributed through the round are utilized, and what each project learns as they move towards building Bioregional Finance Facilities (BFFs).</p>\n<p>We will work closely alongside grantees, using <strong>surveys</strong>, <strong>interviews</strong>, and other participatory <strong>post-round research</strong> to assess the impact. Our primary focus will be on the learning process, examining how effectively grantees are telling their story and progressing towards their vision. Key questions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are they clearly articulating where they are now and where they want to go?</li>\n<li>Who or what has influenced their vision and values?</li>\n<li>What resources or support do they need to move forward?</li>\n<li>How is their community involved, and what role do investors play?</li>\n<li>What participation and governance structures are in place?</li>\n<li>How would larger sums of money (e.g., $1M or $100M) impact their system or break it?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will also encourage grantees to create flow diagrams or visualizations that map how the funding from this round is moving through their team or network. This will help track:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where funds might have stalled.</li>\n<li>Plans for deploying remaining funds.</li>\n<li>How much has directly impacted regenerative projects, community assemblies, or learning experiences on the ground.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By focusing on this “learning out loud” approach, we can gather meaningful insights into how the round has helped projects move toward building more sophisticated BioFi systems.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"regen-coordi-nation-impact-integration-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#regen-coordi-nation-impact-integration-15\"></a>Regen Coordi-Nation Impact Integration</h3>\n<p>In addition to the above impact assessments, we will offer grantees the opportunity to voluntarily participate in the Regen Coordi-Nation impact assessment and retro program, leveraging the <a href=\"https://www.commonapproach.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Common Approach</a> framework. This system is being designed to track impact across cosmo-local networks of autonomous but interconnected local nodes, creating a flexible yet interoperable impact data standard. It is built around five core practices—describing intended change, using indicators, collecting useful information, gauging performance, and communicating results. Grantees who opt into this system will be able to report on their activities, outcomes, and impact in a way that suits their local context, while also contributing to a global, interoperable layer of impact data.</p>\n<p>Regen Coordi-Nation is working with partners like Karma GAP to integrate these impact reports into their platform using Ethereum attestations (EAS). Furthermore, the use of Hypercerts is being explored to tokenize specific impact claims. This opens the door to retroactive funding opportunities, as participating projects will be eligible for the upcoming Regen Coordi-Nation Retro Round, which will further reward impactful bioregional projects.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"shaping-regenerative-futures-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#shaping-regenerative-futures-16\"></a>Shaping Regenerative Futures</h3>\n<p>The BioFi Pathfinders Round represents a pivotal moment for advancing Bioregional Finance (BioFi) and the development of Bioregional Finance Facilities (BFFs). By connecting the most advanced bioregional teams with innovative Web3 funding mechanisms, this round aims to decentralize economic power and catalyze the transition to regenerative, place-based economies. Through a combination of inclusive funding strategies, collaborative networks, and robust impact assessment &amp; follow up, the BioFi Pathfinders Round will help lay the foundation for a new financial architecture that prioritizes people, planet, and long-term biocultural regeneration.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.biofi.earth/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665d27ae0ecf7d66a9fbca46/665fd3be0f65885e1c083370_favicon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.biofi.earth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">biofi.earth</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/345;\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b09b2d62017f7812ce0316141dc18ba87a4fe346_2_690x345.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"89A275\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.biofi.earth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The BioFi Project: Bioregional Finance for Planetary Regeneration</a></h3>\n\n  <p>The BioFi Project is a collective supporting bioregions to design, build, and implement Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFFs) that connect financial resources with regenerators.

We expect the percentage would be significantly higher if the user experience wasn’t split between two sites, and long-term this opens up the user base to billions of people instead of thousands of L2 users.</p>\n<p>Noah plans to write up a proposal for the viaPrize team to build this into grants stack, taking a fee, and splitting the revenue with Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, we would add fiat donations the same way as during GG21.</p>\n<p>This round would also be new in its focus on social projects, which may open up a new potential user group for Gitcoin.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-8\"></a>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The matching pool is anticipated to be $5,000, fundraised through kind-hearted individuals contacted through Twitter and the Gitcoin forum.</li>\n<li>Funding address: 0x850a146D7478dAAa98Fc26Fd85e6A24e50846A9d</li>\n<li>We have a clear plan in place for future fundraising, including sharing stories from the grantee communities on social networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"advisors-for-this-round-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#advisors-for-this-round-9\"></a>Advisors for This Round:</h3>\n<p>TBD</p>\n<h3><a name=\"funding-mechanism-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-mechanism-10\"></a>Funding Mechanism:</h3>\n<p>Our default plan is to use quadratic funding because it is easier to convince people to donate when they know it will be matched.</p>\n<p>We are also in discussion with Flow State to see if quadratic streaming would make sense for this round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-size-and-engagement-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-11\"></a>Community Size and Engagement:</h3>\n<p>We are planning to include 10-20 projects in the round.</p>\n<p>We believe this is a reasonable number for us to thoroughly review during the application period. We are also learning from how the most recent Open Civics round chose a number of projects in this range to make sure the time spent by grantees fundraising is worthwhile.</p>\n<p>If we count Ava’s House and New Hope Shelter as representative projects, each has around 50 people in the TG group or mailing list and roughly 30 donors. The estimated average monthly donations between the two projects is $600.</p>\n<p>This could mean an estimate of a community size across all projects of 500-1000 with perhaps 300-600 donors giving $6,000-$12,000 if this were a normal fundraiser. We believe that the Gitcoin community, social network, and matching funds will pull in many new donors to these projects, as well.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"type-of-projects-to-fund-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#type-of-projects-to-fund-12\"></a>Type of Projects to Fund:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We aim to fund projects that support youth in need through kids’ shelters and related services, such as safe housing, counseling, and crisis intervention programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"estimated-number-of-eligible-grantees-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#estimated-number-of-eligible-grantees-13\"></a>Estimated Number of Eligible Grantees:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We believe that thousands of grantees will be eligible to apply for this round.

With just three weeks left in Q3 and a pivotal DevCon on the horizon, we’re honing in on our focus to ensure we’re delivering impactful solutions, leading innovation in our space, and of course capturing that all important GMV.</p>\n<p>Here’s the game plan as we finish up September and transition into Q4:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Interim Indexer Solution &amp; High-Priority Builds:</strong> We’ll continue pushing forward with our interim indexer solution to reduce errors and resolve missing data issues quickly until we implement the new indexer in Q4, and also finish up support for the SUNNYs customer build with Optimism. Additionally, we’ll address high-priority customer requests from Filecoin to ensure we’re meeting their needs effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Revamping Checker with Allo Starter Kit:</strong> Our next major task is building with Allo Starter Kit by integrating the Checker experience into the user flow. This enhancement will streamline our offerings and provide a more cohesive experience for our users, while also letting us take ASK for a spin rebuilding a high value feature that we can maintain easily in future.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Rebuilding Direct Grants:</strong> We’re excited to announce that we’ll be revamping our Direct Grants mechanism. This upgrade will include significant improvements to payouts and introduce an impact metrics feature, addressing key areas for enhancement and ensuring we can build with ASK on one of our core mechanisms ahead of DevCon.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Introducing Multichain Checkout Bridging:</strong> For Gitcoin Grants 22, we’re prioritizing the development of a bridging solution for multichain checkout. This feature addresses the biggest pain point from GG21 and will provide a seamless experience for our users. I know this has been a long time customer feature request, so I’m very excited to ship it.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Mint Attestations – A Revenue and Engagement Opportunity:</strong> Given the market downturn, we’ve decided to make a strategic bet with Mint Attestations, allowing users to mint and share their donation during checkout for a small additional fee. This feature aims to create new revenue streams, bring some extra delight to the donation experience and reinforce Gitcoin’s position as a leading attestor in the open-source funding ecosystem. Passport is almost profitable with attestations so I’m excited to see how much revenue we can drive with this bet.</p>\n<p>Our renewed focus reflects our commitment to delivering value and innovation. Each of these initiatives is designed to enhance our platform, future proof our technology, respond to customer needs, and position Gitcoin as a forward-thinking leader in our field.</p>\n<p>I’m incredibly excited about what we’re building and the positive impact it will have. Let’s continue to channel our energy and passion into these efforts, and as always, thank you for your hard work and dedication. Together, we’re driving the future of open-source funding and capital allocation!</p>\n<p>Onward and upward!</p>\n<p>Kat, Head of Product at Gitcoin Grants Lab</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/september-product-memo/19377\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/september-product-memo/19377","pubDate":"Wed, 18 Sep 2024 14:05:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19377"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/september-product-memo/19377.rss","#text":"September Product Memo"},"filter":false},{"title":"[GG21 Retrospective] Token Engineering the Superchain","dc:creator":"Moni_boo","category":"🌱 Gitcoin Grants","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p><strong>Token Engineering the Superchain Grants Round: Summer/Fall 2024</strong> was designed as a <a href=\"https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/token-engineering-the-superchain-8a8acdca826b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dual-phase initiative</a> to advance token engineering within the Optimism and broader Superchain ecosystems. The first phase, completed in August 2024, was a Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) round aimed at funding high-potential projects. The second phase, a Retroactive Funding round, is scheduled for later this year to reward grantees based on completed milestones and demonstrated impact.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"grant-round-objectives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#grant-round-objectives-2\"></a>Grant Round Objectives</h1>\n<p>The primary objectives of this grant round were to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advance Token Engineering field:</strong> support projects that demonstrate potential to advance token engineering field and contribute to the OP and broader Superchain ecosystems.</li>\n<li><strong>Drive Superchain impact:</strong> support initiatives with the potential to create measurable, positive effects within Optimism and its broader ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Prepare for Retroactive funding round:</strong> set the foundation for a follow-up Retro Round using Gitcoin’s RetroPGF platform, which will reward projects based on the milestone achievement and demonstrated impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"grant-round-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#grant-round-overview-3\"></a>Grant Round Overview</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Total donations:</strong> $ 5,792.59</li>\n<li><strong>Number of contributions:</strong> 914</li>\n<li><strong>Average contribution:</strong> $ 16.6</li>\n<li><strong>Unique donors:</strong> 349</li>\n<li><strong>Participating projects:</strong> 18</li>\n<li><strong>Average grant size:</strong> $ 3,333</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The round focused on funding projects with strong alignment to both token engineering and OP ecosystem, selecting projects based on their potential to drive significant impact.</p>\n<p>The grant round targeted projects advancing token engineering through various means, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tooling:</strong> building tools and infrastructure that enhance token engineering practices within the Superchain.</li>\n<li><strong>Research and Education:</strong> conducting research and creating educational resources to expand the understanding and application of token engineering.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Infrastructure and Consulting Services:</strong> developing frameworks and offering services that support the community’s capacity to apply token engineering principles effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"setup-and-management-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#setup-and-management-4\"></a>Setup and Management</h1>\n<p>The TQF round built on the lessons learned from previous rounds, further refining the <a href=\"https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF)</a> approach. This round also introduced new criteria for evaluating the potential impact within the OP ecosystem. By incorporating token engineering expertise signals (TEA NFT credentials, $TEC holdings) and boosting them with Optimism Delegate, Badgeholder and $OP holdings as signals, TQF ensured funding aligned with stakeholders knowledgeable in both token engineering and OP ecosystems.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"challenges-and-solutions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#challenges-and-solutions-5\"></a>Challenges and Solutions</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Volume of applications:</strong> despite a more focused round, the unexpected volume of last-minute applications created challenges in evaluation. To address this, future rounds will consider increasing evaluation capacity by engaging more reviewers to manage the load more effectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Superchain alignment:</strong> many projects struggled to clearly articulate both token engineering relevance and OP ecosystem impact. We supported these grantees through application revisions but recognized that more upfront guidance might be needed in future rounds to help projects fully align with our goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Time management and appeals:</strong> the short timeline between application deadlines and the start of the donation period, combined with managing late appeals, stretched resources thin. Moving forward, we might consider separating the closing of applications from the donation period to better manage both processes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"outcomes-and-statistics-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outcomes-and-statistics-6\"></a>Outcomes and Statistics</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"overall-payouts-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overall-payouts-7\"></a>Overall Payouts</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Grant name</th>\n<th>Total Funding (DAI)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Pairwise: Simplifying Choices, Amplifying Voices</td>\n<td>9000.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inverter Network</td>\n<td>8928.09</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Superchain Innovation and Competition</td>\n<td>8239.55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bonding Curve Research Group (BCRG)</td>\n<td>5227.51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Swaps as a Mechanism for Superchain alignment</td>\n<td>4445.47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Treegens DAO</td>\n<td>3732.94</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Valueverse Labs</td>\n<td>3600.49</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TPRO Network</td>\n<td>3090.28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow State (Streaming Quadratic Funding)</td>\n<td>2963.42</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GovGraph</td>\n<td>2285.61</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EVMcrispr</td>\n<td>2159.55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Breadchain Cooperative</td>\n<td>1749.53</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1Hive Gardens</td>\n<td>1398.04</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Change Code: Permissionless Results-Based Fund</td>\n<td>930.92</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Super DCA: The Time-Weighted Average Market Ma…</td>\n<td>841.54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Simplicity Group</td>\n<td>574.94</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regen Atlas</td>\n<td>501.28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eisodos Multimodal</td>\n<td>330.86</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"tegr4-vs-token-engineering-the-superchain-project-funding-changes-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tegr4-vs-token-engineering-the-superchain-project-funding-changes-8\"></a>TEGR4 vs Token Engineering the Superchain- Project &amp; Funding Changes</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>TEGR4</th>\n<th>Token Engineering the Superchain</th>\n<th>Difference</th>\n<th>% Change</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Total projects</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>-14</td>\n<td>-44%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recurring projects</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>22%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>New projects</td>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>-16</td>\n<td>-70%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unique donors</td>\n<td>554</td>\n<td>349</td>\n<td>-205</td>\n<td>-37%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total crowdfunded</td>\n<td>$9,363.07</td>\n<td>$5,792.59</td>\n<td>-3570.48</td>\n<td>-38%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total contributions</td>\n<td>1,579</td>\n<td>914</td>\n<td>-665</td>\n<td>-42%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Average contribution</td>\n<td>$ 16.9</td>\n<td>$ 16.6</td>\n<td>-0.3</td>\n<td>-2%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li><strong>Total projects</strong>: in the previous round (TEGR4), we had 32 projects, while the current round focused on OP/Superchain had 18 projects, reflecting a more selective approach aligned with OP ecosystem goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Unique donors:</strong> the previous round had 554 donors, whereas this round saw a drop to 349, likely due to the more focused nature of the round.</li>\n<li><strong>Crowdfunding amount:</strong> TEGR4 raised $9,363.07, while the current round raised $5,792.59, reflecting the narrower focus but also the strong support within the OP/Superchain community.</li>\n<li><strong>New projects:</strong> in the previous round, there were 23 new projects, whereas this round saw only 7 new projects, as many returning projects already had ties to the OP/Superchain.</li>\n<li><strong>Average contribution:</strong> both rounds had similar average contributions, around $16.9, indicating stable community engagement per donor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-9\"></a>Conclusion:</h3>\n<p>While participation numbers and funding were lower compared to previous rounds, this was expected due to the more selective approach.

To address this in future rounds, we will:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide more detailed, upfront guidance and templates during the application phase to help grantees align their project goals with both token engineering and Superchain impact.</li>\n<li>Host pre-application workshops or AMAs to clarify expectations and offer Q&amp;A opportunities for prospective applicants.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Managing last-minute applications:</strong> the high volume of last-minute applications created a challenge in ensuring thorough evaluation. In future rounds, we will:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Expand the reviewer pool and ensure more time is allocated between the application deadline and the start of the donation period.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Grantee marketing support</strong>: several grantees did not fully leverage the opportunity to promote their projects and attract contributions. To improve this, we will:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Offer marketing toolkits and resources earlier in the process, including sample social media posts, graphics, and outreach strategies.</li>\n<li>Provide incentives for projects to engage with the community to boost visibility and increase their chances of success.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Refining impact metrics and evaluation criteria</strong>: setting and tracking meaningful metrics has proven to be a challenge in terms of capturing both short-term milestones and long-term impact. To improve this, we will:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement clearer milestone-setting requirements that include both quantitative and qualitative impact metrics (e.g., community engagement, adoption rates, technical milestones).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This focus on refining guidance, streamlining processes, and enhancing grantee support will help us to improve our future rounds and create greater alignment between grantee projects and community priorities.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-successes-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#key-successes-11\"></a>Key Successes</h1>\n<p>Key Successes from the 2024 TQF Round:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strong alignment with Superchain objectives:</strong> despite being a more focused round, the projects selected demonstrated clear potential to impact both token engineering and the broader OP ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimized use of Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF):</strong> this round successfully built upon the TQF model, incorporating expertise signals from Optimism delegates and badge holders. This enhanced the quality of decision-making and ensured funding aligned with community priorities, demonstrating the power of fine-tuned quadratic funding mechanisms.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased returning grantees:</strong> we saw a 22% increase in returning grantees, which indicates that previous participants continue to see value in our rounds. These returning projects showed strong progress and further alignment with OP ecosystem goals, solidifying their role as key contributors to both token engineering and Superchain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-preparing-for-retroactive-funding-round-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#next-steps-preparing-for-retroactive-funding-round-12\"></a>Next Steps: Preparing for Retroactive Funding Round</h1>\n<p>The Retro Round, scheduled for October- December, 2024 will use Gitcoin’s RetroPGF platform to allocate additional funding based on demonstrated impact.

This means there are both opportunities/threats for Gitcoin…</p>\n<p>This post is from Owocki/<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov\">@Sov</a> , and covers different trends that we see in the market, and how they may affect 2025 strategy.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-1-ecosystem-specific-venture-funding-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-1-ecosystem-specific-venture-funding-2\"></a>1. Ecosystem-Specific Venture Funding</h2>\n<p>Convertible grants are a hybrid mechanism bridging the gap between traditional ecosystem grants and VC investments. The most well-known early examples of these <a href=\"https://solana.com/news/solana-foundation-convertible-grants-investments\">come from Solana</a> as non-dilutive grants that can convert to equity investments upon reaching specific milestones, such as raising a priced round or hitting growth targets. Another example is Giveth’s q/acc program with Polygon.</p>\n<p>This model allows grantors to support various projects, including closed-source and potentially commercial initiatives that still deliver ecosystem value. It offers projects the flexibility to build viable businesses without typical grant restrictions while giving foundations a stake in successful ventures.</p>\n<p>We know that many of the longest-running and well-funded grants programs in the Ethereum ecosystem are thinking about this. Optimism, Arbitrum, Aave, Maker, and the Uniswap Foundation have all either announced ecosystem-specific VC programs or stated that they are looking into them. Venture programs are typically well-funded which means that there may be high potential GMV. Since these programs are also typically run off-chain, even in Web3, we would need to come up with a compelling case for running them on-chain.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2-rising-demand-for-verifiable-impact-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-2-rising-demand-for-verifiable-impact-3\"></a>2. Rising demand for verifiable impact</h2>\n<p>Grants are not dying, but they are entering their Reputation era. This means it’s time to reinvent, to be outspoken and advocate for change where it’s needed!</p>\n<p>There is a new category of ecosystem incentives programs that only spend on verifiable impact (eg some action is taken onchain.) This category represents both an evolution of historically hard-to-verify grants programs, as well as a push back against grant farming and even the idea of grants themselves. Some mechanisms in this category may fit more in the “ecosystem growth” bucket than “grants.” The largest and savviest programs are already moving in this direction and we expect that the rest of the market will follow them.</p>\n<p>This category includes things like</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Direct to Contract Incentives from Boost.xyz</li>\n<li>Incentivized Action Market (IAM) from Royco</li>\n<li>Retro Funding (esp Round 4 style Impact Metrics Funding) from Optimism (we built R4 app!)</li>\n<li>The Sunny Awards (funded by Optimism, built by Gitcoin)</li>\n<li>Primitives for proving out impact like Karma/Hypercerts</li>\n<li>Verified Impact using Thrive Protocol</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The rise of verifiable impact is a threat to Gitcoin Grants if other players are able to segment the market into verified impact/unverified impact, and our solutions are cast as unverified impact.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to evolve Gitcoin Grants into including verifiable impact is a great way to counter that threat, and even turn it into a strength.</p>\n<p>Should Gitcoin make a play in verified impact? And if so, what primitive do we bet on? Where do we think we can provide value/win?</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-3-futarchy-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-3-futarchy-4\"></a>3. Futarchy</h2>\n<p>2024 was undeniably the year of the prediction markets, with platforms like Polymarket gaining unprecedented attention and usage. Prediction markets, where users bet on future events and outcomes, surged in popularity as tools for both governance and decision-making. Polymarket, one of the leading platforms in this space, became a central hub for predictions on everything from elections to cryptocurrency trends.</p>\n<p>Futarchy is a governance model proposed by economist Robin Hanson, where decisions are made based on prediction markets. In a futarchy, elected officials (or protocol governors) define national welfare metrics, such as GDP or well-being, while policy choices are determined by markets that predict which policies will most likely improve those metrics. The idea is that by relying on market-driven predictions, it could lead to better decisions than traditional voting, leveraging collective intelligence to forecast outcomes more accurately.</p>\n<p>Endorsed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Polymarket gained credibility and momentum, symbolizing the growing interest in decentralized forecasting. With its rapid expansion, 2024 marked the mainstream emergence of prediction markets as a powerful tool for collective intelligence and economic insights.</p>\n<p>In the past, following Vitalik’s research/thinking has yielded great results (AMMs=&gt; Uniswap, QF =&gt; Gitcoin Grants, RetroPGF on Optimism). It might be a good bet for Gitcoin to get ahead of this one and build futarchy into the allo ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-4-more-ppl-building-on-allo-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-4-more-ppl-building-on-allo-5\"></a>4.

Onchain Social</h2>\n<p>The meta has been around for a while now, but given the large investments by VC in the space, what can we do to make Gitcoin a more social experience? A key principle of onchain social is that Ethereum is a social network. How might we showcase the best of what is being built in the Ethereum ecosystem, by who, and who has supported them? This could be woven throughout the product experience as a light touch, providing users with insights into the network and impact driven by the projects they support. By doing so, we aim to inspire trust, transparency, and a deeper connection between users and the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"ask-get-involved-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#ask-get-involved-7\"></a>ASK: Get involved</h1>\n<p>This is a live conversation.

He bet Noah $1000 that he would fail to make a place where he could simply let an idea go and let it grow.</p>\n<p>Noah and a friend each adding $50 to prize for building a productivity app that asks you why you are opening your phone and adds a time-out feature to make sure you don’t lose hours of your week thoughtlessly. A random developer won this with Intenty which now has 10,000+ downloads.</p>\n<p>During Zuzalu which was funded and partially organized by Gitcoin community members, many people added $20 each to a prize to make an AI voice for a river.

This is partially solved by recurring grant rounds with projects that share their progress, but as a donor contributes they can’t be certain that their funds will result in a successfully created project.</p>\n<p>OP style Retro PGF maximizes funder confidence because they only fund things once they’ve seen an impact, but builders have no guarantees of funds while they are building.</p>\n<p>Crowdfunded prizes find a middle ground where builders know how much money is waiting for them if they succeed and funders know they can be refunded if no one does. In user interviews we have found a segment of previous funders of Gitcoin who would prefer to fund projects in this way. Each has different strengths and weaknesses, and prizes offers a complementary option that will appeal more to certain groups.</p>\n<p>-Crowdfunded prizes allow the best ideas to rise to the top<br>\nAn idea may gain momentum in a crowdfunded prize marketplace as more people contribute. This allows the incentive for building the idea to grow until a builder decides to pursue it.</p>\n<p>-Crowdfunded prizes empower freelancing like an entrepreneur<br>\nBuilders may see which ideas have more proven demand in terms of dollar value and from how many people. We’ve found that crowdfunded prizes are quadratic psychologically because the more funders supported a prize the more motivated the builder is.<br>\nIn this new model for freelancing, prizes don’t pay builders per hour. They pay them for how much demand the builder fulfills, which is closer to how entrepreneurship works.</p>\n<p>-Prizes are an open invitation that welcomes new collaborators<br>\nPrizes fund an idea instead of a particular team.<br>\nMultiple teams may pursue a prize at once, and we ensure that builders are aware of their competition. Builders are self-directed and have fluidity in forming teams.<br>\nA ¼ of the time we’ve found that they enjoy the challenge and compete.<br>\nRoughly ⅜ of the time they talk and decide amongst themselves who will continue because they have the best chance of succeeding.<br>\nAnother ⅜ of the time they decide to work together.</p>\n<p>An RFP process is less open. Builders bid down until the funder chooses one team upfront based on their reputation and their price.<br>\nIn a crowdfunded prize, funders bid up until builders pursue the prize. If there are multiple submissions, judges will choose the best. Choosing who wins is therefore more merit-based than reputation-based. It’s based on any builder who wants to prove themselves showing evidence of their work instead of funders guessing upfront who they think will do the best.<br>\nMore on RFP vs Prizes <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/rfp-allo-yeeter-build/19277/3\">here</a></p>\n<p>-Prizes are hyper-efficient (because they’re fun)<br>\nIn academic literature, prizes are known as inducement prize contests and are labeled a “hyper-efficient” economic system. This basically means that people are more motivated to accomplish something for the same amount of money because it is presented in a way that is more fun. Prizes motivated Charles Lindbergh to cross the ocean (Orteigh Prize), resulted in the first non-government flight to space (Ansari XPrize), and we’ve all seen how hackathon prizes motivate intense effort. Imagine you have $10,000 and one weekend to build something.<br>\nIf you hired programmers in the Bay Area at their usual per hour rate, you might afford 3-10 hackers for a couple days.<br>\nNow add that $10,000 to a prize that brings 100 hackers for a weekend. They will work far harder and be much more motivated.</p>\n<p>-Weaknesses of Prizes</p>\n<p>No upfront funding. If a builder needs a certain amount of capital to even get started on a project, prizes alone will not work.<br>\nWe look forward to seeing a future with multiple funding mechanisms working in conjunction such as a team receiving a QF grant, using the funds to recruit team members through prizes, and receiving retroPGF as their impact is seen.</p>\n<p>Theoretically, upset builders from wasted or duplicated efforts. However, we actually have yet to see any builders who were upset that they did not win or that someone else won. In fact, we’ve found this creates a playful environment where anyone can sharpen their skills by trying to build something helpful and not worry about following through on a hard commitment such as in an RFP.</p>\n<p>Time spent judging and communicating.

This is different from the first Zuzalu round, which was public.</li>\n<li>In this post, we analyze differences between the public (Q1) and private (MACI) Zuzalu rounds to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of this approach at preventing kickbacks. We find mixed results, indicating the difficulty of determining whether this approach was effective.</li>\n<li>We compare different anti-collusion strategies and how they could be combined to achieve results that best aid the community in funding the right projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Last month Gitcoin spearheaded its first successful implementation of MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) in a quadratic funding round for the Zuzalu community.</p>\n<p>MACI ensures private voting to reduce incidences of bribes or kickbacks. It makes it impossible to send or request a transaction receipt to verify that someone voted a particular way. However, vote integrity is still preserved through the use of zero-knowledge proofs and the results are still guaranteed to be correct. However, MACI is not a voting algorithm – instead, it’s a wrapper around another voting algorithm which adds extra security. In this case, MACI was a wrapper around standard Quadratic Funding.</p>\n<p>As data science nerds (Umar) and fairness-obsessed mechanism designers (Joel), we’re constantly looking for ways to improve our mechanisms and spot new issues. However, analyzing the quality of public goods funding results is tricky because there’s no way to tell what the results “should” look like. The best we can do is analyze patterns in the data over time. Luckily, the recent MACI rounds, which focused on Zuzalu-related projects, bear a lot of similarities to the non-MACI Zuzalu rounds that happened in Q1 of this year: both sets of rounds focused on the same community, had the same subdivisions (tech and events), and we can even look at the folks who claimed a ZuPass in Q1 to get a group of users roughly comparable to to the folks on the allowlist for the MACI rounds (all of our experiments on the Q1 rounds are filtered to look at just the ZuPass holders).</p>\n<p>So now, let’s go over some common patterns that can indicate collusion. For each pattern, we’ll first ask how we would expect the MACI data to change if it were reducing kickbacks, and then see what really happened.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pattern-analysis-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#pattern-analysis-3\"></a>Pattern Analysis</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><a name=\"entropy-based-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#entropy-based-4\"></a>Entropy-Based</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One way collusion could kick off is with a message in a private group chat. We would then expect the donations to that project from those group members to be close together in time and/or close together in donation amount.</p>\n<p>Entropy is a measure of unpredictability or randomness. Here we apply it to donation patterns. Higher entropy would suggest more diverse, less coordinated donation behavior, while lower entropy would indicate more predictable or potentially coordinated patterns. We calculate entropy by measuring the diversity of donation amounts for each day, where a wider range of donation amounts results in higher entropy. We would expect a round with kickback-motivated donations to have lower entropy.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d_2_624x340.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"4ErQZB9oYuGhQaPxSpFQ20JgY21\" width=\"624\" height=\"340\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d_2_624x340.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/2/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d_2_936x510.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/209b3a83a53834908e2422a86f3ce77dc48c8d3d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FCFCFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433_2_624x340.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hA8vy6VVWmSwEPsOD4fri1dYssH\" width=\"624\" height=\"340\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433_2_624x340.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433_2_936x510.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/7b3ab517b07ea678ed7c244e64ea0a3d02d9e433.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In the entropy distribution graph, the position along the x-axis indicates the level of entropy (randomness), with higher values suggesting more diverse donation patterns; additionally, curves that are taller and narrower indicate more consistent day-to-day entropy, while wider, flatter curves suggest more variability in daily donation patterns.</p>\n<p>The Q2 Tech round showed higher average daily entropy (1.73) compared to Q1 Tech (1.25) and a slightly wider, flatter curve suggesting more variability. The increase in average entropy from Q1 to Q2, although not statistically significant, suggests MACI might have encouraged more diverse donation patterns.</p>\n<p>In the Events Rounds, Q1 Events surprisingly showed slightly higher average daily entropy (1.87) compared to Q2 Short (1.48) and Long (1.79) Events. On the other hand, Q2 rounds displayed broader entropy distributions, indicating more day-to-day variability.</p>\n<p>Overall, MACI’s impact varies between Tech and Events rounds. While the Tech round shows promising signs of increased donation diversity, the Events rounds had entropy values that were closer together. The results indicate that MACI’s effects might be more nuanced or harder to detect than anticipated, potentially influenced by other factors such as the nature of projects (tech vs events) and changes in the round structure.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3><a name=\"jaccard-indices-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#jaccard-indices-5\"></a>Jaccard Indices</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bribery attacks often result in donation patterns where many voters donate similarly. One popular way of measuring similarity is with the Jaccard index. It’s measured like this: for two voters, first find the set of projects they both donated to. Then their jaccard index is the money they both donated to those “shared” projects, divided by the money they both donated overall. If the two people donated to completely different projects, their Jaccard index is 0. If they only donated to the same projects, their Jaccard index is 1.</p>\n<p>So, if MACI was effective at preventing bribery attacks, one sign might be a more diverse donor base, and accordingly more pairs of voters with very low Jaccard indices (or similarly, fewer pairs of voters with very high Jaccard indices). However, the distributions of Jaccard indices over pairs of voters only partially affirm this pattern:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/1eb82cb674a0f596ef1580a442511ecbc2b8983a.png\" alt=\"|479.55284552845524x360.17479674796743\" data-base62-sha1=\"4nKUP1LwqSYC4d17PgRrgzVKgQy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/8/8db4102ca31cdd7af724b7ce8e7d0d20a041680c.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"kdz6CZWlilxbPPnl2fxbZWcnd9y\" width=\"499\" height=\"375\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p>(By the way– the Q1 events round had ~35 projects, while the two MACI events rounds had 6 and 8 projects. With more projects, there’s naturally more room for donor diversity, so we controlled for this by slimming down the Q1 events round to its 7 most popular projects before running these experiments.)</p>\n<p>These data show that while the MACI tech round had voters around as similar as they were in the Q1 tech round, the MACI long events round had significantly more pairs of very similar voters compared to the Q1 events round.</p>\n<p>To be clear, a high percentage of similar voters isn’t a smoking gun indicating bribery attacks. For example, this donation pattern could be a result of the MACI projects each appealing to very distinct sets of users, which is especially likely where events are concerned. If one project wants to hold an event in Berlin and another project wants to hold an event in Boston, and so on, one might expect voters to be relatively single-issue in their support, only giving to the project holding an event where they live. This would result in some very similar Jaccard indices.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"evaluating-maci-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#evaluating-maci-6\"></a>Evaluating MACI</h2>\n<p>MACI has immense potential as a mechanism for PGF. In the automated world of the blockchain, many types of attacks can be expressed purely in technical terms, and MACI eliminates them. Moreover, it’s also worth noting that there were much fewer accusations of projects promising kickbacks during and after the MACI rounds, compared to Q1. This could be partly attributed to not just MACI but a clearer social agreement on what constitutes appropriate behavior.</p>\n<p>However, it’s also worth noting that we were not able to find any measure that strongly affirmed a reasonable hypothesis about how MACI’s collusion resistance would play out in the data. While entropy was slightly increased moving to MACI, voter similarity stayed the same or increased. Of course, comparing the Q1 ZuZalu rounds to the MACI ZuZalu rounds isn’t a perfect comparison, but there was certainly not a smoking gun showing that collusion was reduced by MACI.</p>\n<p>One reason for this might be that collusion isn’t always expressed in purely technical terms – for example, by a smart contract that scans the blockchain for donations and awards airdrops accordingly. It can also be expressed in social terms – by a group of close friends all voting similarly. While MACI undeniably helps with technically driven collusion, it doesn’t have any guardrails to prevent social collusion.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"a-simple-social-collusion-attack-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#a-simple-social-collusion-attack-7\"></a>A simple social collusion attack</h3>\n<p>Social collusion attacks are possible because social connections govern the actions people take just as much as technical rules do. Anyone who has ever passed the salt to someone they don’t like at a meal knows this – even without any technical or measurable incentive to perform an action (i.e. it’s not like you’re getting paid to pass the salt), social norms can still induce us to behave a certain way.</p>\n<p>In the world of blockchain, social collusion attacks could look like a project owner getting a group of close friends to vote for them. Another attack bridging the social and the technical could look like a project owner bribing people to film themselves donating to their project on MACI in the last thirty minutes before voting closes – here, the attack is not technically sound, since the bribed persons could change their votes at the last minute, but if the attacker thinks that enough people won’t bother to do this, then it could still be profitable.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"plural-approaches-prevent-social-collusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#plural-approaches-prevent-social-collusion-8\"></a>Plural approaches prevent Social Collusion</h2>\n<p>At Gitcoin, we’ve been using <a href=\"https://wtfiscocm.streamlit.app/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">COCM</a> (<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4311507\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Connection Oriented Cluster Match</a>) to address exactly the types of social collusion attacks that are in MACI’s blind spot. COCM is based on the principle of plurality, where proposals generating agreement across differences are preferred over proposals generating agreement within single sections of the population.</p>\n<p>This approach prevents collusion because colluding parties tend to not have much internal diversity, and therefore aren’t rewarded as much. Of course, colluding parties can try to make themselves look more different by spreading out donations to other projects, but that also gives a leg up to the other projects they donate to.</p>\n<p>COCM is one of several approaches to enhance quadratic funding’s resistance against social collusion, building upon Vitalik Buterin’s earlier work on <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pairwise Matching</a>. While both methods aim to reward diversity, they differ in their approach. Pairwise Matching calculates a similarity coefficient for each pair of donors, reducing matching for projects with highly similar donation patterns among their supporters. COCM, on the other hand, examines the relationships between projects based on their shared donors, rewarding projects that attract support from donors who contribute to diverse sets of projects. In essence, Pairwise Matching focuses on individual donor behaviors, while COCM considers project-level relationships.</p>\n<p>The good news is that there’s no reason why MACI and either COCM or Pairwise can’t be combined. MACI isn’t a voting mechanism in and of itself – it’s more like a wrapper around a mechanism that adds extra security. Right now, standard QF is inside that wrapper, but one could theoretically put COCM or Pairwise inside instead. This has never been done before (to our knowledge) and would likely pose a significant technical challenge but should still be possible.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"impact-of-cocm-and-pairwise-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-of-cocm-and-pairwise-9\"></a>Impact of COCM and Pairwise</h3>\n<p>When it comes to the funding differences between QF and COCM or Pairwise, we should examine both the direction and magnitude of the potential change. To understand “direction”, we can look at whether a project’s funding would increase or decrease. To understand “magnitude”, we look at by how much.</p>\n<p>One natural question to start with is: did COCM and Pairwise shift funding amounts in the same direction?</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_361x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gjs7GbrOVhgGV5y9QmOwVshZRpH\" width=\"361\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_361x500.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_541x750.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_722x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D8CDC0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In Q2, Pairwise and COCM agreed significantly more than Q1 on the direction to shift a project’s funding (93.8% vs 41.7%). This means that if used in conjunction with MACI during Q2, either of these mechanisms would have tended to move results in the same direction. One potential cause behind the large increase is the switch to MACI: if MACI successfully reduced technically-driven collusion, then all that remains would be social collusion. This is where mechanisms like COCM and Pairwise are designed to work. In other words, Pairwise and COCM may respond differently to technical collusion (hence the larger disagreement in Q1), but similarly to social collusion (hence the smaller disagreement in Q2).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_361x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gjs7GbrOVhgGV5y9QmOwVshZRpH\" width=\"361\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_361x500.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_541x750.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/7/7255bcdc1528736fd3a9d3f21ef6fac5985a38f5_2_722x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D8CDC0\"></a></div><br>\nAcross both Q1 and Q2, COCM tends to redistribute much more funding among projects than Pairwise (57.8% vs 24.8%). This makes sense because COCM constitutes a broader change to standard QF. It also means that for communities particularly worried about the impact of collusion, COCM is a stronger choice.<p></p>\n<p>Attached <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a5M_cuja7vWqjIYvkIhNDI3S2vR9ZE1mic2JiwKnvt8/edit?gid=1267283963#gid=1267283963\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a> is the project-level matching allocations under each mechanism. We want to note that the exact implementation of QF used here and that the actual matching was paid under was CQF (Capital-constrained QF as defined on page 17 of <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hitzig/files/buterin_hitzig_weyl_draft.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this paper</a>).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Quadratic funding is meant to help solve coordination failures like the tragedy of the commons, where even though everyone benefits from public goods being funded, they don’t get funded because no one individually wants to pay the price. In theory, QF incentivizes contributions by promising big subsidies for donations, therefore making it “worth it” for individuals to pay the price. In practice, however, this opens the mechanism up to collusion, which could be expressed in technical terms, but can often be expressed in socio-technical terms as well.</p>\n<p>Using MACI as a wrapper around QF is an excellent solution for preventing technical attacks, but it can’t prevent attacks with a social component. To tackle that problem, we need to rewrite QF itself to preferentially subsidize the contributions of funders who appear less coordinated, or in other words, who support different projects from each other. This is what COCM and Pairwise do.</p>\n<p>Each of these algorithms promotes a different winning strategy for projects. QF promotes projects to motivate their donors to support them and only them. COCM promotes projects to motivate their donors to also support other projects. QF pushes the winning strategy toward fragmentation while COCM promotes bridging.</p>\n<p>If you have an idea for a collusion-related pattern to look for in the data, please let us know! We can’t share MACI data publicly but would love to run whatever experiments the community thinks would be useful.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/analyzing-maci-in-zuzalu-s-second-set-of-qf-rounds/19345\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/analyzing-maci-in-zuzalu-s-second-set-of-qf-rounds/19345","pubDate":"Wed, 11 Sep 2024 19:28:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19345"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/analyzing-maci-in-zuzalu-s-second-set-of-qf-rounds/19345.rss","#text":"Analyzing MACI in Zuzalu’s Second Set of QF Rounds"},"filter":false},{"title":"Grants Lab Monthly Meeting - September 2024","dc:creator":"meglister","category":"🧙 🧙‍♀️ Ideas and Open Discussion","description":"<p>I’m sharing our monthly meeting slides here which cover various updates, announcements, and financial reviews related to the operations of the Grants Lab team. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jDEDo1TlVfAXdzZ8waVuDPaEw3--YTWBXTKS2xNdfEI/edit?usp=sharing\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Grants Lab Monthly_September24_Share - Google Slides</a></p>\n<p>Here’s a summary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Kudos and Recognition</strong>: Shoutout to team members (Huss and Kurt) for their dedication and support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Organizational Updates</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Principal Engineer’s final decision will be made shortly.</li>\n<li>New Social Media Manager starts soon.</li>\n<li>Housekeeping updates including use of Notion Dashboard and internal communication setups.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DevCon Update</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DevCon will take place from October 23 - November 6, focusing on community strengthening, builder engagement, and funding through community rounds and easyRPGF rounds.</li>\n<li>Gitcoin presence at events will be limited.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GG22 Update</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on leveraging and growing the Ethereum builder community, aligning with core values of funding public goods, and showcasing Gitcoin technology.</li>\n<li>Retrospective and redesign sessions have been conducted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Leadership Insights</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meg</strong> highlights concerns about missing GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) targets and decisions around custom builds and monetization efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Owocki</strong> discusses the need for scale, remaining runway in stablecoins, and product and engineering rebuild efforts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>August Financial Review</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actual operating expenses were slightly under budget, though some overspending is expected due to investments in Allo 2.1 and the Indexer.</li>\n<li>Treasury currently has $6.5M in stablecoins, which provides 15 months of runway, plus additional GTC funds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GMV Update</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As of September 11, 2024, GMV totals surpassed $7M, but are ~$1.3M behind the mid-September target due to various challenges, including market corrections.</li>\n<li>Completion of payouts for GG21/Name and EasyRF rounds, as well as submission of a new RFP for Name.</li>\n<li>Progress on service offerings and increased engineering focus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>September GMV Focus</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running rounds for multiple projects (Metis, Lukso, Polygon, Avalanche, Octant).</li>\n<li>Aiming to push more payouts and close significant opportunities in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Q3 Goals Review</strong>: The team reviewed progress against Q3 goals, summarized here: <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Grants-Labs-Q3-24-Goals-f6d8494782b1443f8420057861447b58\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Grants-Labs-Q3-24-Goals-f6d8494782b1443f8420057861447b58</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Product Roadmap Updates</strong>: Briefly reviewed updates to the product roadmap – forum post coming soon</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Welcome thoughts &amp;

Here is a summary of the key changes:</p>\n<p><strong>Revised Eligibility Criteria:</strong> We rewrote the <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/datatabase/climate-round-portal/round-eligibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GG21 Eligibility Criteria</a> to specifically outline what grantees needed to include in their applications as well as what would disqualify them from participating (even if they had previously participated in the round). See revised <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/datatabase/climate-round-portal/round-eligibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Eligibility Criteria here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Karma GAP Requirement</strong>: Applicants who participated in GG20 were required to post at least 2 milestones and updates in their<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/f95dd8c7212e4dfcb2ee32fee1d6f70c?sid=f8f140d2-6bc1-4a9d-9020-57763f330769\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> GG20 KarmaGap profile</a>. After GG20 we encouraged projects to set milestones based on the funding they received.</p>\n<p><strong>Round Limit</strong>: The Climate Solutions round was limited to 70 grantees as determined by a ranking of project review scores. Note we ended up with 71, but more on that in the challenges section.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Review Process</strong>: The new review process was more detailed and specific compared to previous rounds. Reviewers scored projects in 8 categories on a scale from 1 to 5 based on their application, Karma GAP milestones and updates and impact metrics. Each project was reviewed by 2 reviewers. Read the detailed <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/climate-coordination-network/CCN-Grant-Review-Process-91011e6c9d3d4d43a8b4a4b3eebaf122\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CCN Grant Review Process document here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Application Period</strong>: Applications closed before the round so that the impact ranking could be finalized. This is the first time we have closed the application period before the round started.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-climate-solutions-round-global-collaborative-unique-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#the-climate-solutions-round-global-collaborative-unique-4\"></a>The Climate Solutions Round: Global, Collaborative &amp; Unique</h2>\n<p>What makes the CCN Climate Solutions Round unique? The Climate Solutions Round’s unique feature/approach is that we cultivate a supportive community that results in ongoing productive relationships and collaborations. During our review of grant proposals from projects that have been in multiple rounds, we found clear examples of grantees supporting each other and collaborating to accomplish goals and address challenges.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"round-matching-results-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-matching-results-5\"></a>Round Matching Results</h2>\n<p>As planned and communicated from the beginning of GG21, the CCN team utilized a combination of QF + COCM (Connection Oriented Cluster Matching) to calculate the matching pool results for the Climate Solutions Round. In the past two rounds (GG19/GG20), we tested and compared COCM and QF allocation mechanisms. As noted in previous posts, the Climate Solutions round is a closely connected community. Because of this COCM tends to flatten the results and disincentivizes projects that have worked hard to market their projects during the donation period. We have also heard much criticism that the standard QF distribution is just a popularity contest that disincentivizes projects with smaller communities and less marketing capacity.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we tested a hybrid model that allocates 50% of the funds using COCM and 50% using QF in GG21. We are proud of the coordination we see within the community, and for our round and our community, using QF + COCM (50-50 each) to calculate the matching funds provides the best outcome and incentives for our participants. In the future, we may explore different percentages for QF/COCM and we are also exploring tunable QF.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impact-assessment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-6\"></a>Impact Assessment</h2>\n<p>In sum, the GG21 CCN Climate Solutions round impacted 71 Climate Solutions projects worldwide, reducing GHGe, building core infrastructure and—perhaps most importantly—facilitating cooperation and coordination to accelerate climate action. This round, we continued to encourage grantees to provide specific metrics utilizing ideas from the <a href=\"https://climatecoordination.org/climate-solutions-metrics-garden-1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Climate Solution Metrics Garden</a> and we required all returning grantees to include their KarmaGAP milestones and updates. We are working with Karma on ways we can generate a more comprehensive round impact report. It is currently difficult to summarize the 71 KarmaGAP pages.</p>\n<p>To amplify our climate impact, the CCN team also decided to pay out matching funds in USDGLO. By using Glo Dollars for payouts, we increase our impact by joining the Glo Consortium and selecting to combat climate change with the revenue generated from our Glo Dollar holdings. Over $10,000 of additional funding was generated by swapping our matching funds to USDGLO. These additional funds are distributed by GLO Dollar to climate initiatives. We also encouraged our Climate grantees on this opportunity to allocate their yield from matching funds to climate action. We would encourage Gitcoin and other rounds to consider using USDGLO for matching payouts.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"participant-feedback-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#participant-feedback-7\"></a>Participant Feedback</h2>\n<p>For GG21, we created a more specific and comprehensive feedback form here is some of the Initial results:</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/a/a0809a6a56be2052465cb28bd4d2b811480e3457.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/a0809a6a56be2052465cb28bd4d2b811480e3457\" title=\"Pre-round support, including resources provided by CCN, spaces, open office hours\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a0809a6a56be2052465cb28bd4d2b811480e3457_2_624x297.png\" alt=\"Forms response chart.

A few grantees missed communications and/or were confused by the new process.</p>\n<p><strong>Review Process</strong>: While we found the new review process to be an improvement, we were building the plane as we were flying and had to make some adjustments along the way. We were not specific enough about one of the eligibility criteria, which was “if they are primarily a token launch or NFT project to raise money for a liquidity pool.” We made exceptions for projects with tokens that planned to use the funds for operations or other costs outside of directly providing token liquidity. We mistakenly identified one project, $Earth, as primarily a token launch for a liquidity pool. Because of this error, we re-evaluated all the other projects that had not met the eligibility requirements and found no further errors in our reviews. Due to our mistake, we decided the fairest course of action was to add $Earth to the round as the 71st project.</p>\n<p><strong>Checker</strong>: All community rounds were required to use Checker, but Checker has not received any updates or improvements since before GG20. The AI is still not useful for our round and our new review process could not be accommodated in the product. We had hoped to see Karma GAP milestones/updates pulled into Checker, but this feature has not yet been added. We took the time to provide feedback on the product after GG20 and were disappointed to see none of the feedback was utilized to improve the product.</p>\n<p><strong>Grants Stack Product Support</strong>: We had several issues during this round and the last round, which we reported to support at Gitcoin. Responses from the support team were slow, and many of these issues were not resolved. In most cases, we found our own workarounds for these issues. These issues include downtime with the indexer, inability to download CSV from the Manager and issues checking out and making donations. The last issue particularly concerns me as I could not donate to the round and did not receive support before the round ended. If this is the support a round manager receives, I worry that our grantees and donors may also suffer from a lack of product support.</p>\n<p><strong>Donor turnout</strong>: We saw a significant decline in the number of unique contributors and the total amount crowdfunded. We suspect this was a combination of no OSS round, summertime and general market conditions.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Round</th>\n<th>Total Amount Crowdfunded</th>\n<th>Number of Unique Contributors</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>GG20</td>\n<td>$58,000</td>\n<td>2,262</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GG21</td>\n<td>$22,050</td>\n<td>794</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Incentives for Round Managers</strong>: While we appreciate Gitcoin supporting our community the past 3 rounds by adding to our matching pool, we, along with all other round managers, have not received any compensation for our work. Gitcoin appears to be receiving many different benefits from the community rounds, and I think they should compensate round managers for bringing value to Gitcoin through our work.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"lessons-learned-and-areas-for-improvements-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#lessons-learned-and-areas-for-improvements-9\"></a>Lessons Learned and Areas for Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We need a better way to review our grantees. While the new process we implemented lowered the workload of our review team we still lack tools to make it even more efficient.</li>\n<li>We need to create a code of conduct or more specific guidelines for what qualifies as Sybil attacks. We want to make sure our community is clear on what are acceptable donor behaviors.</li>\n<li>We will continue to work on updating the Eligibility Criteria of the Climate Round to be even more specific based on learning from this round, i.e. clearly defining the difference between tokens for liquidity and tokens for supporting climate action, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"closing-thoughts-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#closing-thoughts-10\"></a>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"a-big-thank-you-goes-out-to-momus-collective-and-gitcoin-for-your-support-funding-our-matching-pool-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#a-big-thank-you-goes-out-to-momus-collective-and-gitcoin-for-your-support-funding-our-matching-pool-11\"></a>A big thank you goes out to Momus Collective and Gitcoin for your support funding our matching pool!</h2>\n<p>The CCN team truly appreciates all of the Climate Solutions grantees, the contributors who supported the round and the opportunity for The Climate Solutions Round to participate as a Gitcoin Community Round for GG21.

One core mechanism that supports this decentralization is the governance over the matching pool funds held within the gitcoin.eth multisig.</p>\n<p>Currently, it’s procedure to include two community members as signers on this multisig, chosen by Gitcoin to act as trusted community stewards for the matching pool funds. However, to maintain transparency, and ensure broad representation, we regularly rotate the signers and bring in new community representatives.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposal-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#proposal-3\"></a>Proposal:</h3>\n<p>We propose to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the current community multisig signers from gitcoin.eth to ensure the periodic rotation of responsibilities and avoid any accumulation of influence by a single group over time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Janine Ledger<br>\nAnnika Lewis</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Appoint two new community members as multisig signers, selected based on their active involvement in the Gitcoin community and commitment to stewarding public goods.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wasabi\">@wasabi</a><br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/zer8\">@ZER8</a></p>\n<p>The new signers are both active longtime members within the Gitcoin community and have served on the GG Community Council since April 2024.

It streamlines comparing COCM and traditional QF results, allowing for easy download, review, and granular customization of round results.</li>\n<li>The add members functionality is available for both programs and rounds. This allows admins to add team members easily at the program and round levels. I hopped in for another community round and assisted with payouts, and this functionality made it reasonably easy to get in and help that round operator.</li>\n<li>More networks!

Allo Focus:</h3>\n<p>We funded projects both building on top of Allo (Grant Ships, Gardens, Karma, Endaoment, ggframe, Funding the Commons), experienced Allo Builder Teams (RaidGuild, viaprize, Scaffold), and analytics and impact measurement tools that tap into Allo’s registry (OpenSourceObserver, Gitcoin Grants Data Portal, GrantsScope). We will continue to focus here for these reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It strengthens infrastructure that the entire grants ecosystem relies on</li>\n<li>It encourages innovation in capital allocation mechanisms</li>\n<li>It aligns with the objectives of Gitcoin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By supporting Allo-based projects, we’re not just funding individual initiatives; we’re helping to build the foundation and expand the design space for capital allocation mechanisms.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-grants-infrastructure-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-2-grants-infrastructure-6\"></a>2. Grants Infrastructure:</h3>\n<p>Our round supported several infrastructure projects that are advancing our vision to map all grants and incentives across Web3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On-chain grant registry: We’ve continued to develop and expand the first on-chain grant registry on Arbitrum using Allo Protocol. This registry is a foundation for increasing grant discoverability and transparency across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Trustful: We have partnered with Blockful to develop a grants reputation system that will help build accountability in the grants ecosystem. This system aligns with our mission to explore and chart grants by providing context and credibility metrics for grant programs (a space we believe is lacking in systems today).</li>\n<li>Ecosystem.Vision &amp; WelcomeOnchain: Showcasing how third-party tools can leverage our open registry. These platforms offer views into the Web3 ecosystem. They can now provide their user base current with grant program data without the overhead of curation.</li>\n<li>x23: We’ve supported the creation of a grants news aggregator to keep the community informed and engaged. This tool builds upon <a href=\"https://t.me/cryptograntwire\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Crypto Grant Wire</a> by offering enhanced features and functionality, including automated program updates and the ability for other community members to contribute to the feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These projects aren’t just isolated tools but interconnected components of a broader infrastructure, making the entire grants and incentives ecosystem more transparent and accessible.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-quality-applicants-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-3-quality-applicants-7\"></a>3.

Their participation brings credibility to our round and demonstrates the high caliber of projects we’re attracting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It validates our approach and selection process</li>\n<li>It attracts more high-quality projects and teams to the Cartographers</li>\n<li>It increases the likelihood of funded projects delivering real value to the ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"h-4-community-growth-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-4-community-growth-8\"></a>4.

This growth is about more than just numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It brings diverse perspectives and expertise to our community</li>\n<li>It increases our capacity as a collective</li>\n<li>It expands our network, allowing us to reach and influence</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This growing community is the engine that drives our mission, helping us explore and chart the grants landscape more effectively.

This rise reflects a temporary deviation from our stability targets. The increase is primarily due to investments in product development (Wonderland) and costs related to the restructuring of the Ecosystem Collective team</p>\n<p>This report provides a detailed analysis of our financial performance for July 2024, highlighting key metrics and budgetary insights.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overviewhttpsdunecomumarkhanethgitcoin-treasury-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overviewhttpsdunecomumarkhanethgitcoin-treasury-1\"></a><a href=\"https://dune.com/umarkhaneth/gitcoin-treasury\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Overview</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Last Month’s Treasury Holdings</strong>: $31,765,250</li>\n<li><strong>Current Month Treasury Holdings</strong>: $28,588,135</li>\n<li><strong>Variance</strong> (-$3,177,115), 10.00%): This change was mainly due to fluctuations in token prices, which fell last month. Additionally, our operating expenses across all workstreams totaled $926,051, which further influenced this variance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"runway-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#runway-2\"></a>Runway</h2>\n<p>The recent decline in the value of our GTC holdings has affected our Runway projection. Currently, our runway is estimated at 30 months (3 years). However, due to the spin-off of Passport and the restructuring of the DAO (formerly Ecosystem Collective), along with a monthly budget of approximately $496,777, our Runway extends to 58 months (5 years). This projection considers an anticipated expenditure of $496,777 across Grants Lab and the DAO - Ecosystem Collective.</p>\n<p>Our DAO’s treasury currently holds $20,440,249 in GTC tokens, with each token valued at an average of $0.70. GTC tokens now represent 71.5% of our treasury, underscoring the significant impact of GTC’s performance on our financial stability. To mitigate risks from market fluctuations and enhance financial resilience, it is essential to monitor this closely and explore strategies for diversifying our treasury holdings.</p>\n<p>Last Month’s Expenditure: Total expenditure for the month was $926,051, marking a substantial increase of 14.79% or $119,306 compared to the previous month’s total of $806,745. This overspend indicates challenges in resource allocation. To address this, we need to reassess our budgeting strategies to ensure more prudent spending and maintain sustainable financial health moving forward.</p>\n<p>July*</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/3/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a_2_288x243.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"7kU9WhLX1HCHwlSgVRAPufBp55U\" width=\"288\" height=\"243\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a_2_288x243.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a_2_432x364.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/336c323b72b8763e90b002ab14f52e781a15f72a_2_576x486.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEC5BC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Figures ran on August 27, 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<p>June*</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/b/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda_2_288x244.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"qI6bC29fRngkZuWffhbGYEyRXiq\" width=\"288\" height=\"244\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda_2_288x244.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda_2_432x366.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/bb34b223496de25943b2c5af6838becc15586bda_2_576x488.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEC5BC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Figures ran on July 15 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"token-spend-in-july-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#token-spend-in-july-3\"></a>Token spend in July</h3>\n<p>During July, our total expenditure in USD reached $926,051.

The decentralization of the program and improvements to our processes were met with positive feedback; the shift towards more community-driven governance is being well-received. However, there were also some hurdles, particularly in education, communication, and the perceived impact of certain rounds. This review will highlight the overall results of GG21, what went well, where we faced difficulties, and the steps we plan to take to improve the program for future rounds.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"gg21-results-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#gg21-results-2\"></a>GG21 Results</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>* Overall Funding: $933k</th>\n<th>* Rounds: 11</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>* Crowdfunding: $190k</td>\n<td>* Donors: 7.7k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>* Matching Funding: $743k</td>\n<td>* Projects: 517</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Matching funds provided by Gitcoin: <strong>$370k</strong> <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-rounds-announced/19168\">See announcement.</a></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Round</th>\n<th>Projects</th>\n<th>Matching Pool</th>\n<th>Donors</th>\n<th>Donated</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Asia Round</td>\n<td>89</td>\n<td>$75,000.00</td>\n<td>3900</td>\n<td>$59,470.74</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GG21: Thriving Arbitrum Summer</td>\n<td>78</td>\n<td>$117,000.00</td>\n<td>3298</td>\n<td>$40,184.18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Climate Solutions Round</td>\n<td>71</td>\n<td>$125,000.00</td>\n<td>794</td>\n<td>$22,050.13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Real World Builders</td>\n<td>56</td>\n<td>$75,000.00</td>\n<td>609</td>\n<td>$13,789.81</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GG21 DeSci Round</td>\n<td>49</td>\n<td>$39,000.00</td>\n<td>390</td>\n<td>$11,425.67</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Web3 Grants Ecosystem Advancement</td>\n<td>57</td>\n<td>$100,000.00</td>\n<td>543</td>\n<td>$10,787.77</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CollabTech Round and Thresholds Experiment</td>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>$30,000.00</td>\n<td>319</td>\n<td>$10,108.09</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regen Coordi-Nation Genesis</td>\n<td>46</td>\n<td>$50,000.00</td>\n<td>276</td>\n<td>$8,449.40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Engineering the Superchain</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>$60,000.00</td>\n<td>350</td>\n<td>$5,822.36</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decentralized Science and Art in Psychedelics</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>$30,000.00</td>\n<td>33</td>\n<td>$3,817.14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OpenCivics Collaborative Research Round</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>$42,000.00</td>\n<td>141</td>\n<td>$3,784.23</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"what-went-well-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-went-well-3\"></a>What Went Well?</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"ratio-of-crowdfunding-to-gitcoineth-spend-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#ratio-of-crowdfunding-to-gitcoineth-spend-4\"></a>Ratio of Crowdfunding to Gitcoin.Eth Spend:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>In GG20, the crowdfunding was 55.36% of the amount pulled from our matching pool.

It’s safe to attribute most of this to not running the OSS program which historically accounts for between 65% and 85% of GG funding.

This will result in stricter eligibility criteria, but this is an important step in ensuring high quality rounds and higher value add to Gitcoin’s overall goals.</li>\n<li>We are implementing a new threshold mechanism for all accepted community rounds applying to run alongside Gitcoin Grants rounds. Gitcoin reserves the right to bar eligibility in future rounds if the ratio of community contributions (crowdfunding) to matching funds given is less than 20% (if gitcoin provides $20k in matching but amount crowdfunded in a round is less than $4k).</li>\n<li>We are re-introducing a minimum matching amount from rounds wishing to participate in GG rounds that run alongside the OSS Program.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These adjustments are aimed at refining the governance structure, ensuring that future rounds are more transparent, fair, and impactful.

While 13 projects received not maching funds.</p>\n<p>3 projects would not have reached their threshold without the redistribution. I.e. 10% more projects were sufficiently funded to deliver value thanks to the mechanism.</p>\n<p>11 projects (37%) would have received matching funds but didn’t as they failed to meet the threshold.</p>\n<p>Out of the 13 projects not receiving any funds, 2 had donations but were ruled out by the gitcoin algorithm.</p>\n<p>$4.856 (16%) of the funds in the matching pool were redistributed from projects that would not have been sufficiently funded to deliver value to projects that were sufficiently funded. Out of which $909 (3%) went to the 3 projects that would otherwise not have met their threshold.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"qualitative-insights-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#qualitative-insights-4\"></a>Qualitative insights</h2>\n<p>We found 3 significant challenges in the model:</p>\n<p>Operational complexity</p>\n<p>The mechanism added complexity to the operation of the round, requiring significant education. Although this complexity could be reduced slightly with a better configuration of the round, or even reduced significantly with a UI tailored for the thresholds mechanism, it remains an important concern (see below)</p>\n<p>Cultural assumptions</p>\n<p>The mechanism was designed under the assumption that teams would apply for a specific, bound project. However, the applications show that most teams that applied use Gitcoin rounds to “top up” their funding. As such, there was a mismatch between the regular usage of Gitcoin rounds and the threshold mechanism.</p>\n<p>Assessment requirements</p>\n<p>Due to cultural assumptions about what Gitcoin rounds are for, most teams devised a threshold as an afterthought. This was somewhat discernible in the applications but effective policing would have required managerial resources the team didn’t have (i.e. would have required operating like a grant committee with significant due diligence capabilities ). We have the impression that most thresholds were at best inaccurate representations of the reality of the projects and, at worst, complete fabrications with no connection to the actual use of funds, but we can’t know.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusions-and-recommendations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusions-and-recommendations-5\"></a>Conclusions and recommendations</h1>\n<p>We’re excited to see reflected in the data the redistribution of funds in a way that could increase the effectiveness of capital allocation by ecosystems. Showing 16% of funds reallocated, and 3% of funds reallocated having a transformative effect (from allocated to insufficiently funded projects to allocated to now sufficiently funded ones).<br>\nHowever, the qualitative challenges encountered are significant and put into question the validity of the quantitative insights.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, we see promise in the use of thresholds as a mechanism if significant resources can be dedicated to both storytelling (i.e. education) and product. As such, we could expect rounds with Thresholds to become a separate product from Gitcoin rounds, both in brand and functionality.</p>\n<p>We’d love to know whether the Gitcoin community would like to see us, RnDAO, carry further R&amp;D on this concept.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-collabtech-round-by-rndao/19317\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-collabtech-round-by-rndao/19317","pubDate":"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 18:27:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19317"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-collabtech-round-by-rndao/19317.rss","#text":"[GG21 Retrospective} CollabTech Round by RnDAO"},"filter":false},{"title":"[GG21 Retrospective] OpenCivics Collaborative Research Round","dc:creator":"omniharmonic","category":"🌱 Gitcoin Grants","description":"<h1><a name=\"collaborative-research-grant-round-03-insights-learning-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#collaborative-research-grant-round-03-insights-learning-1\"></a>Collaborative Research Grant Round 03 Insights &amp; Learning</h1>\n<p>The OpenCivics Collaborative Research Round 03 generated valuable insights into the evolving landscape of on-chain quadratic funding for public goods.

This reduction might be partially attributed to the broader market downturn, but it is more likely linked to the absence of an open-source software round that typically runs concurrently with key community rounds.</p>\n<p>A critical lesson from this experience is the need for the impact-focused segment of the Gitcoin community to extend its outreach beyond the existing web3 space. We see a significant opportunity to engage with other communities that are interested in funding social impact projects but are not currently involved in the space. This challenge could be addressed by coordinating efforts to bring traditional nonprofit ecosystems and climate organizations into the quadratic funding ecosystem.</p>\n<p>One of the main barriers to this type of expansion has been the lack of web3 knowledge within these communities. However, the introduction of a fiat PayPal donation option in this round has proven to be a significant step forward. This innovation, made possible through a partnership with viaPrize, allowed us to create a seamless donation process for those unfamiliar with web3, while still ensuring that donations were eligible for matching funds. The success of this experiment suggests that we can now onboard non-web3 participants using traditional payment methods, allowing them to engage in the ecosystem without the steep learning curve associated with purchasing and bridging different cryptocurrencies on different blockchains. For a full retrospective on the viaPrize payment system experiment in GG21, please review founder Noah Chon Lee’s post on the <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/we-donated-to-gitcoin-projects-with-credit-card-review-of-paypal-fiat-payments-in-gg21/19287\">Gitcoin Governance Forum</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-in-matching-calculations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#challenges-in-matching-calculations-7\"></a>Challenges in Matching Calculations</h3>\n<p>Another key learning from the round was the complexity involved in calculating matching amounts using cluster matching, minimum matching amounts, changes in matching pool size, and whitelisted wallets.</p>\n<p>Upon reviewing the cluster matching results, we observed discrepancies between the expected matching results and the actual outcomes. This discrepancy was traced back to a parameter within cluster matching that reduces the matching for wallets that only donate to a single project. While this serves as a useful Sybil protection mechanism, it also unintentionally penalized grantees with unique donor bases mobilized specifically for their projects. To address this issue, we employed a 50/50 split between cluster matching results and quadratic funding results.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we had to adjust the results due to a reduction in the matching pool’s size, caused by holding a portion of the pool in ETH rather than USDC. While we immediately swapped ETH for USDC as the market turned, but still lost about $4,000, which we corrected for after the round by manually modifying the matching results to reflect the correct matching pool size.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we deployed an experimental $1,000 minimum matching to ensure that all projects selected for the round would receive at least enough grant funds to complete a portion of their research inquiry. Round results were modified by filling the gap in matching for projects that fell below the $1,000 threshold by redistributing matching funds proportional to the amount that each project over $1,000 received.</p>\n<p>All of these modifications, the calculations used to derive them, and the original figures are listed on our <a href=\"https://opencivics.notion.site/Collaborative-Research-Round-03-Analytics-5014eb48f1b048dc97c679e55f2aae49?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">wiki</a> and can be audited by anyone to determine how those choices were made. In the future, we would appreciate features within Gitcoin Manager that would allow us to reduce the matching pool size, set minimum matching amounts, and modify sybil parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"sybil-protection-and-model-transparency-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#sybil-protection-and-model-transparency-8\"></a>Sybil Protection and Model Transparency</h3>\n<p>While the cluster matching results in our previous round were intuitively smoother and generally more equitable, cluster matching results in this round were vastly different than the traditional quadratic funding results. Given the large difference, we began to look deeper into what was driving the changes in the underlying model, something we had not thought to inquire into prior. Given what we learned, we want to instantiate a larger public conversation around sybil protection, the tradeoffs between transparency and opaqueness for model-based sybil detection, and other ways we might be able to rethink matching mechanisms.</p>\n<p>While the Passport team’s decision to reduce matching for single-project donors is well-intentioned, it highlighted the importance of donors understanding the evaluation metrics of cluster matching. Without this understanding, the algorithm’s outputs may lead to unintended consequences. We believe it is crucial for donors to be informed about the factors influencing their matching scores upfront, enabling them to consciously adjust their behavior. Of course, this transparency could also be used to game the system, but we felt concerned about the unintended negative consequences for some grantees who could have otherwise informed their donors that they would need to also donate to other projects in order for their donations to be eligible for matching. We feel that this kind of information could actually generate positive effects for rounds by encouraging donors to consider all the projects for donation instead of just the projects of their friends. In the future, we may tell our donors something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your donation is a <em>weighted preference vote</em> for which projects should be funded. In order to know how much you value a project, we need to understand your preferences in relationship to at least one other project. If you do find that your preferences are nearly 100% aligned with <em>only</em> one project in the round, please make at least one other small donation to another project to ensure your primary donation is eligible for matching.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We recognize that the previous stamp-based Passport system is cumbersome for most users and were very excited for the new donor UX made possible by cluster matching, but we believe that greater transparency is needed regarding how cluster matching scores are determined. The lack of transparency, which makes sense from the perspective of sybil protection, puts us as round operators in a difficult position, as we must justify round results that stem from an algorithm we do not fully understand.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, upon understanding more clearly how the cluster matching method does reflect a set of values and perspectives (ie what behaviors are encouraged or penalized), we believe that such value judgements should not only be made transparent but should also be composable by communities to reflect their values and needs. Moving forward, we aim to make this value judgment more transparent while also exploring the possibility of new features and approaches that empower communities to customize matching parameters. This customization could include incentives and rewards for specific behaviors, creating a more pluralistic approach to sybil resistance and community participation. For example, we are interested in exploring “tunable QF,” an approach to matching that modifies matching amounts based on the particular token holdings of any given address. We would be interested in experimenting with a pluralistic approach to matching modifiers and would love to beta test tooling that enables us to link various ERC-20 and ERC-721 contract addresses as matching criteria, enabling us to increase the matching signal from OpenCivics Network members with membership NFTs, $REGEN token holders, or staked GTC, as a few examples.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"round-innovations-and-feedback-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-innovations-and-feedback-9\"></a>Round Innovations and Feedback</h3>\n<p>One piece of feedback that emerged early on in our application for matching funds was the ease and clarity of attestations in a research-focused round. The binary nature of research publication—either a project publishes its research or it does not—makes impact attestations straightforward to document. This simplicity may make research-based quadratic funding rounds more attractive and easier to manage. We’re incredibly happy with the grantees in this round which demonstrated a wide diversity of inspired, useful, and forward reaching research inquiries into a wide range of domains within the field of web3 civics or DeCiv. To hear from just a few of the amazing grantees in this round, head over to our <a href=\"https://x.com/i/spaces/1YqxovqEEnbJv\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Round Showcase Space on X</a>. We look forward to sharing the research that’s produced through the funding of this round!</p>\n<p>We consider our PayPal fiat experiment with viaPrize to have been a massive success. Thanks to the amazing work of Noah and his team, combined with efforts from the Gitcoin Grants Labs team to enable a feature for white listing the addresses generated by viaPrize, we were able to process fiat donations for the first time while addressing sybil protection. We encourage folks to read more about Noah’s method and results in his retrospective post to learn more about how it works and to decide for themselves if they want to deploy it for their own rounds in the future.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we experimented with implementing a minimum matching amount to ensure that all grantees received enough funding to impact their proposed research meaningfully. We set a minimum of $1,000, redistributing matching amounts proportionally from grantees who received a larger percentage of the pool. Given the circumstances we’ve encountered in both of our previous rounds in which some grantees do not receive enough funds to take meaningful action on their grant project, we feel that the additional redistributive burden on the higher performing grantees, as well as the burden on round operators who must review applications much more carefully given the cost of minimum matching per project, is ultimately worth the tradeoffs and we look forward to experimenting with matching minimums again in future rounds, perhaps with different approaches to the threshold and the threshold qualifications.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Overall, this round provided critical insights and valuable lessons that we’re already beginning to build upon for next round. We are committed to continuing our partnership with Gitcoin and the entire Community Round Operator ecosystem, and we’re grateful for the incredible support we’ve received from the Gitcoin and Passport teams as well as other round operators. We look forward to building upon these experiences, refining our processes, and exploring new possibilities for fostering impactful, transparent, and equitable public goods funding.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"feature-requests-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#feature-requests-11\"></a>Feature Requests</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum Matching Setting: Allo Protocol</li>\n<li>Modifiable Parameters For Matching Results: Passport\n<ul>\n<li>ERC-20 and ERC-721 parameters and weights</li>\n<li>Slider for weight between COCM and QF results</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Modifying Matching Pool Size (lower) During Round: Allo Protocol</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a deep dive in matching pool calculations, graphs, and further analysis, visit our <a href=\"https://opencivics.notion.site/Collaborative-Research-Round-03-Analytics-5014eb48f1b048dc97c679e55f2aae49?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">wiki</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19313\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19313","pubDate":"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 22:34:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19313"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19313.rss","#text":"[GG21 Retrospective] OpenCivics Collaborative Research Round"},"filter":false},{"title":"Projects for At-Risk Kids Community Round Proposal","dc:creator":"noahchonlee","category":"🌱 Gitcoin Grants","description":"<p>What if we made a community round for GG22 supporting projects for at-risk kids?</p>\n<p><strong>Potential projects:</strong><br>\n-Ava’s House Kids Shelter in Chiang Mai, Thailand with Deng Arjaw that I know of through <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viviantp6\">@viviantp6</a> of G0V/DA0.

Inviting applications from ReFi DAO Local Nodes, GreenPill Local Chapters, and Celo Regional DAOs, this Genesis Round marked the official launch of The Regen Coordi-Nation program and the first step in a more extensive plan to measure, monitor, and amplify the impact of these initiatives through follow-up support and a planned retroactive funding round later in the year. Thanks to the generous support of Gitcoin, Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO, and GreenPill Network, we have successfully raised $110,000 for this program, with $50,000 going towards this initial GG21 matching pool. Gitcoin’s support was instrumental in making this program possible, providing the foundational funding and tooling necessary to kickstart the initiative and drive the impact we aim to achieve in the subsequent stages of the program.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"round-purpose-and-goals-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-purpose-and-goals-3\"></a>Round Purpose <strong>and Goals</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Catalyze Regenerative Communities and Collaboration</strong>: Unite GreenPill Network, ReFi DAO, and Celo Public Goods under a shared mission and seek to foster positive-sum synergies. By enhancing alignment and collaboration across our networks, we aim to amplify financial resources, strategic support, shared knowledge and other resources that can grow our collective impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Serve as the First Phase of a Broader Program</strong>: Initiate the Regen Coordi-Nation program with the GG21 Genesis Round, followed by ongoing impact tracking and a planned retroactive funding round, ensuring that support continues to foster meaningful outcomes beyond the initial funding.</li>\n<li><strong>Drive Community Engagement &amp; Collaboration</strong>: Focus on fostering active community engagement, collaboration, and strategic marketing for the networks and individual projects in the round. This is a core strength and value proposition of Gitcoin Rounds and the Quadratic Funding mechanism.</li>\n<li><strong>Innovate and Develop New Systems for Impact</strong>: Learn, experiment, and develop new systems to enhance the Regen Coordi-Nation and the broader Web3 Grants Ecosystem. This includes implementing and testing cutting-edge mechanisms like Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF), Common Approach, Karma GAP integration, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) to drive more effective and transparent impact measurement and Web3 capital allocation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#implementation-4\"></a><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"setup-and-management-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#setup-and-management-5\"></a><strong>Setup and Management</strong></h3>\n<p>The setup and management of the GG21 Regen Coordi-Nation Genesis Round involved extensive coordination between GreenPill Network, ReFi DAO, and Celo Public Goods. We utilized the <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/2bfc9ecc725743878491812edccf4430?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Regen Coordi-Nation Portal</a> and <a href=\"https://t.me/+dfOMYhMROdU5YzY0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dedicated Telegram group</a> as the central hub for guiding participants through the eligibility criteria, timelines, and application process. A key aspect of our approach was devolving the responsibility for nominating projects to each of the respective networks—GreenPill, ReFi DAO, and Celo Public Goods. While this added an extra layer of steps for grantees, it was crucial in ensuring that the quality of applications remained high and that the unique context and methodologies of each network were respected and prioritized. The management team, consisting of core stewards from each network, oversaw the review process, provided feedback, and ensured that all selected projects aligned with our mission.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-and-solutions-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#challenges-and-solutions-6\"></a><strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Timing and Application Process</strong>: The short turnaround time between the community round approval and the round going live created challenges, particularly with our slightly longer application process, which prevented some grantees from applying in time. <strong>Solution</strong>: In the future, allowing more time for communications and preparations before the round begins would benefit all participants and ensure smoother operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Bridging Funds and Accessing Gas Tokens</strong>: There was some confusion and difficulty for participants in bridging funds and accessing the necessary gas tokens on the Celo network. <strong>Solution</strong>: We addressed this by providing <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/2bfc9ecc725743878491812edccf4430?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">additional support resources</a>, including updated documentation and direct assistance through the Telegram group. In the future, there is much that could be done by Celo, Gitcoin and the wider Web3 ecosystem to improve and simplify these experiences.</li>\n<li><strong>cUSD Donation Issues</strong>: A critical issue arose when cUSD donations were not functioning due to a bug. <strong>Solution</strong>: This was resolved before the end of the round through collaboration with Gitcoin’s technical team.</li>\n<li><strong>Gitcoin Downtime and Communication</strong>: Gitcoin experienced downtime during the round, which affected grantee participation and contributions. <strong>Solution</strong>: Improved communication with grantees about potential downtime, bugs, and other technical issues is necessary to ensure that participants are well-informed and can plan accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"unique-features-or-approaches-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#unique-features-or-approaches-7\"></a><strong>Unique Features or Approaches</strong></h3>\n<p>The GG21 Regen Coordi-Nation Genesis Round introduced several innovative elements designed to drive engagement, boost impact, and experiment with cutting-edge funding mechanisms.</p>\n<p>One of the most significant experiments involved <strong>Regen Tips</strong>. In partnership with Regen Tips, we incentivized participation by offering $REGEN token allocations to contributors, with a tiered rewards system based on donation amounts. For example, every $1 USDGLO donated was rewarded with 10,000 $REGEN, and donations over 10 USDGLO or 69 USDGLO received 10x or 100x tipping boosts, respectively.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/6/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45\" title=\"Reegn Tips x Celo GG21\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/6/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45_2_250x250.png\" alt=\"Reegn Tips x Celo GG21\" data-base62-sha1=\"es829HMbx4m6RSj4YYFV2V1GaXP\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/6/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45_2_250x250.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/6/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45_2_375x375.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/6/654c753817663bcdad20028aba47f8633febeb45_2_500x500.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DADA9E\"></a></div> |<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/3/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6\" title=\"Regen Quadratic Multiplier\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6_2_252x250.jpeg\" alt=\"Regen Quadratic Multiplier\" data-base62-sha1=\"90Ix51luU26dnebLVJkIeTpAoPI\" width=\"252\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6_2_252x250.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6_2_378x375.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/3f285a0320671501ff6f59142f3403091cdd81f6_2_504x500.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECE9C9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Additionally, we trialed a ‘<strong>Proof-of-Regen Quadratic Multiplier</strong>,’ where donors could receive up to double the matching power of their contributions based on their <a href=\"https://www.regen.tips/score\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Proof of Regen score</a>. This mechanism, developed by the Token Engineering Commons (TEC), allowed us to experiment with TQF as a way to fine-tune quadratic funding models. However, technical challenges meant this would have delayed results release and payouts. Furthermore, from some of the preliminary results we got back it was not clear that this broad signal actually optimised or boosted the results in a desired way. As such, this led us to ultimately exclude this mechanism from the final results. Despite this, the experiment yielded valuable insights, and in collaboration with Gitcoin, TEC is exploring the development of a self-serve TQF tool that would give us more control and customisability in future rounds.</p>\n<p>Another unique feature of the round was the <strong>Celo Public Goods (CeloPG) Signal Boosting</strong> initiative. Celo Public Goods provided seven stewards with 500 cUSD each to distribute across both rounds. Projects that demonstrated strong alignment with Celo ecosystem metrics, such as increasing Total Value Locked (TVL), transaction volume, and overall ecosystem engagement, received higher donations from these stewards. Each steward followed specific guidelines, such as a max donation of $50 per project and avoiding donations to projects with direct affiliations. This approach incentivized projects to align more closely with Celo’s mission while boosting their visibility and support within the round.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"outcomes-and-statistics-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#outcomes-and-statistics-8\"></a>Outcomes and Statistics</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"funding-and-contributions-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-and-contributions-9\"></a>Funding and Contributions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Total Projects</strong>: 62 applications and 46 being accepted into the round.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Matching Pool</strong>: $50,000 USDGLO</li>\n<li><strong>Total Crowdfunded Contributions</strong>: $8,449.42 (16.71% of the matching pool)</li>\n<li><strong>Total Donations</strong>: 1,472</li>\n<li><strong>Total Donors</strong>: 276</li>\n<li><strong>Passport Usage</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>95 users (34.4%) received full matching (passport model score over 50)</li>\n<li>38 users (13.8%) received partial matching (passport model score between 25 and 50)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/b/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0.png\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0\" title=\"Regen Coordi-Nation GG21 Matching Results\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0_2_690x431.png\" alt=\"Regen Coordi-Nation GG21 Matching Results\" data-base62-sha1=\"ph9FCG1v8ixSzBQuD9srS8KBRde\" width=\"690\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0_2_690x431.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0_2_1035x646.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b126d070b7e159dfcfe95492e568d8968b47e4c0_2_1380x862.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5EDD3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>For the full results and matching calculations, you can check out: <a href=\"https://qf-calculator.fly.dev/?round_id=14&amp;chain_id=42220\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Streamlit</a></p>\n<p>To protect against sybil attacks and airdrop farmers, we utilized Gitcoin’s passport model-based detection system. While this system worked well to prevent sybil attacks, one drawback was that legitimate donors without a robust Web3 history will receive lower matching rates or none at all. Still, we recognize the tradeoffs and commend Gitcoin for their ongoing innovation in sybil protection strategies.</p>\n<p>Overall, we were happy with the results of the round, both in terms of donations into the round and the results of matching fund calculations. We were also pleased with how Gitcoin’s Connection-oriented cluster-matching (COCM) worked in rebalancing results to reduce the impact of coordinated clusters and single project donors in the round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"participant-feedback-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#participant-feedback-10\"></a>Participant Feedback</h3>\n<p>We collected feedback from participants in the round and received the following from 11 responses.</p>\n<p><strong>Average Ratings (out of 5)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Application Process: 4.38</li>\n<li>Fairness of Outcome: 4.29</li>\n<li>Communication and Support: 4.25</li>\n<li>Overall Program: 4.14</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Overall, participants had a positive experience with the GG21 Regen Coordi-Nation Genesis Round, rating various aspects of the process favorably. The communication and support throughout the round was well-received, with particular appreciation for the responsiveness of the support teams. The program as a whole was viewed positively, with participants noting the collaborative spirit and the effective guidance provided by the networks involved.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Great support and process was very smooth and quick. Also loved the opportunity to link with other coordinators.”</li>\n<li>“This was our first time and I think it was guided very well”</li>\n<li>“The operators were incredibly helpful not only in providing all instructions necessary but also in ensuring the project has the highest quality possible.”</li>\n<li>“Monty has been great about staying in constant communication and the Celo team has been really wonderful to work with.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, several participants highlighted issues such as technical bugs, including difficulties with bridging funds, accessing gas tokens, and experiencing downtime on the Gitcoin platform. There were also requests for additional features, such as better communication during technical issues and enhanced transparency in the outcome distribution process. Most of these concerns have already been addressed in the Challenges and Solutions section.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Would be great to be able to swap or bridge Celo or into the Celo network easier across platforms.”</li>\n<li>Would like there to be “Exact clarification on gitcoin passport scores and eligibility for match funding”</li>\n<li>“During the round there where some bugs. cUSD donations kept failing in our round during 3-4 days of the round. It took some days to fix the issue”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"impact-assessment-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-11\"></a><strong>Impact Assessment</strong></h3>\n<p>The impact of the GG21 Regen Coordi-Nation Genesis Round has been significant. Beyond the financial impact, the round has also significantly <strong>strengthened the collaboration between ReFi DAO, GreenPill Network, and Celo Public Goods</strong>. From my POV there feels a new sense of togetherness and a collaborative sprit, with each network gaining a deeper understanding of each other and working more closely together. This feels like just the beginning, with more opportunities for collaboration and impact ahead, particularly with the upcoming retroactive funding round and the development of a common approach to impact tracking.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"lessons-learned-and-improvements-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#lessons-learned-and-improvements-12\"></a><strong>Lessons Learned and Improvements</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"feature-requests-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#feature-requests-13\"></a>Feature Requests</h3>\n<p>While the round was largely successful, some ideas &amp; suggestions for additional Gitcoin Grants Stack functionality that could be helpful for future rounds also surfaced:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Revise Application Process</strong>: Providing the ability for program managers to offer feedback on submissions and allowing grantees to edit their applications with version history would improve the application process.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-Chain Donations</strong>: Implementing backend bridging that allows donations to be made from any chain, regardless of where the donor holds their tokens, would greatly enhance the flexibility and accessibility of the funding process.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated Communication Tools</strong>: Developing tools for automated emails and other communications would streamline the process of updating grantees, reducing the communication burden on organizers and ensuring timely information delivery.</li>\n<li><strong>Grantee Feedback Mechanism</strong>: Introducing a feature that allows grantees to submit comments with their donations could foster greater community engagement and provide a fun way to give public feedback and support for projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) Tool</strong>: Creating a self-serve TQF tool built on the Allo platform would empower round operators to analyze the impact of different signals more effectively. This would reduce the bottleneck in experimentation and customization, allowing for more dynamic and responsive funding rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated Payout Address Verification</strong>: Ability to scan the payout wallet addresses provided to make sure they all are chain compatible. e.g. no one has provided a multi-sig on the wrong chain. We checked this manually but would be cool if Gitcoin could do it automatically.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"overall-reflection-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#overall-reflection-14\"></a><strong>Overall</strong> Reflection</h3>\n<p>My overall key takeaway from this round and the wider GG21 is that we are continuing to learn, evolve and progress in a positive direction but there is still much work to do. The Gitcoin stack continues to improve and the overall space is evolving rapidly. However, there is still some way to go in making Web3 and ReFi truly accessible to a broader audience, going beyond the current bubbles of adopters and enthusiasts, and attracting greater participation and capital from outside the space. I hope this round, and the Regen Coordi-Nation as a whole, can continue to support continuous learning, adaptation, and innovation to ensure that these technologies can achieve their full potential in driving ecological, economic, and social regeneration at scale.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"next-steps-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#next-steps-15\"></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>As we look forward to the next phases of the Regen Coordi-Nation program, our focus will shift to building upon the foundations laid during the GG21 Genesis Round.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact Measurement and Tracking</strong>: We are seeking to implement the <a href=\"https://www.commonapproach.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Common Approach</a>  impact measurement system, ensuring that our local communities activities can be better monitored, understood, and communicated. This system will help us better capture the real-world impact of the projects we support, providing a clearer picture of the outcomes achieved by ReFi DAO Local Nodes, GreenPill Local Chapters, and Celo Regional DAOs. By developing a robust version of our collective impact measurement, reporting, and verification system, we aim to establish a more transparent and accountable framework that will benefit all stakeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF)</strong>: Following the completion of impact tracking, we will prepare for the retroactive funding round planned for later this year. This round will reward projects based on their demonstrated impact, encouraging continuous engagement and delivering on our commitment to support ongoing regenerative efforts. The RPGF round will also serve as an opportunity to test, refine and reflect on the systems and processes we’ve developed, ensuring they are scalable and effective for future rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Strengthening Collaboration and Learning</strong>: The collaborative spirit fostered during the GG21 Genesis Round has set the stage for even deeper partnerships. We will continue to encourage cross-network collaboration, focusing on shared learning and resource pooling to maximize our collective impact. By hosting workshops, webinars, and other community-building events, we aim to create more opportunities for knowledge exchange and joint initiatives.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing Innovation and Experimentation</strong>: Finally, we remain committed to experimenting with new ideas and technologies that can enhance the Regen Coordi-Nation and the broader Web3 Grants Ecosystem. By continuously iterating on our approaches and staying open to new possibilities, we aim to push the boundaries of what’s possible in regenerative finance and community coordination, ultimately driving more significant and lasting impacts.</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.commonapproach.org/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/2e7524149ca4f58522bc940e62d8856e98a52e9d.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"D7DFE5\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.commonapproach.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Common Approach to Impact Measurement</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:600/338;\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/9/9a6b966fa9a587c75a59e0909470946ecb91af95.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"FFFFFF\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.commonapproach.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Common Approach to Impact Measurement</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Impact measurement can be better!
