We want to be lean, but not hungry, with our overall budget. We have trimmed down expectations for travel and miscellaneous expenses for H2 2024. We only have two anticipated new hires, a Principal Engineer and a Social Media Manager. We expect to cease hiring for the next 6+ months after the positions are filled ‚Äì we have put a huge effort into filling key leadership roles at the start of this year, exiting folks who are not aligned with our talent bar or mission, and now have the resources we need to succeed.</p>\n<p><strong>Headcount</strong>:</p>\n<p>With the winddown of the Ecosystem Collective, we are moving RPP (Owocki, two engineers, and EA) into Grants Lab to create more coordination between engineering, embrace our multi-mechanism future, and more holistically resource our bets. We are also retaining a Brand Manager on the marketing team and filling the needed social role above which is left vacant with the ECC spindown. This accounts for the headcount budget increase of ~$85k/mo.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you‚Äôll see a severance line item for July. As part of our ongoing efforts in building the right team this year, we gave all Grants Lab contributors the opportunity to opt into the next chapter or choose a severance package and opt out. This is a common tactic at organizations that are undergoing cultural or strategic shifts like we have. Two of our 18 contributors opted out; we‚Äôre grateful for their contributions and wish them the best.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/f/f3f5089f0c461656898d3f320eb18e492d399323.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"yO90t1wOdQ72KThSCrUgfT5b7px\" width=\"328\" height=\"125\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p><strong>Consultants</strong>:</p>\n<p>This line item will rise substantially for Q3 and remain higher in Q4. The primary driver of this is our retention of Wonderland at $40k/mo for engineering and protocol leadership. We‚Äôre really excited about the quality of talent that they bring to our protocol and dev tools effort. Additionally, working with Wonderland provides us flexible engineering capacity, which we plan to exercise with an additional engineer during Q3 to lead an indexer improvement effort. We are also transferring some legacy RPP costs into Grants Lab in this bucket, in particular a monthly $20k contract with Raid Guild. Raid Guild works on projects that have high GMV potential but represent one-off builds that are not part of our core stack.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/7/71e376e50b17520280084cb691414f5e6a57451d.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gfvifTYj1tmw3zWluUCtfSJXQ7z\" width=\"327\" height=\"102\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p><strong>Software</strong>:</p>\n<p>This line item remains mostly flat for H2. We are taking on some costs from the EC, including website hosting, Figma, and KYC tooling which accounts for a slight increase.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/5/505beca81591fe138ca4ef54709e601bcf584c94.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"bsT8YLnBUBKttniBFTIUzFb7skQ\" width=\"323\" height=\"101\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p><strong>Travel</strong>:</p>\n<p>This line item should also remain flat for H2. We are decreasing our regular travel budget as we don‚Äôt use it as much outside of popular events (EthCC, EthDenver, and Dev Con.) The $15,000 spend in November represents DevCon costs, which are particularly high given that many leaders are traveling from North America and Europe.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/6/60abea0797684d404180613d20e0d1d5da5b940a.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"dNca19MiFc190uc6aV62PfirjeO\" width=\"322\" height=\"95\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p><strong>G&amp;A and Miscellaneous</strong>:</p>\n<p>G&amp;A was a catch-all bucket that we have deprecated now that we have better tracking of individual line items. We are opting for better tracking and tighter budgets over the traditionally requested safety net of funds.</p>\n<p>The biggest line item in the miscellaneous bucket is audits ‚Äì we plan to spend $75k on the Allo 2.1 audit in Q4, and likely $15-25k on an audit for new mechanisms before the end of the year. The cost of that new mechanism is distributed across various months.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/d/d83b5b653ec4d122a49949054b30e0a6efc3afb9.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uQSiW52B2xdzdyCmJoPTSsCYKcp\" width=\"326\" height=\"101\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<h1><a name=\"budget-request-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#budget-request-1\"></a>Budget Request</h1>\n<p>The total budget requested is $2,646,608 for July - December 2024.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/f/f37b449c4e18bbc2e49f09356493416212708394.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"yJW7NCEZd67f4lnVbss2zlHUjhq\" width=\"326\" height=\"206\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p>This budget was requested in late July because Grants Lab was anticipated to have sufficient remaining funds from the Q4 2024 funding cycle (across PGF, GSD, GS, and Allo) to cover July expenses.

Notably, almost $5m in GMV in 2024 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtc_goaltracker\">[source]</a>. I want to thank everyone who has supported that success so far. At the same time, I want to recognize that what got us here will not get us there.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"where-is-there-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#where-is-there-3\"></a>Where is ‚Äúthere‚Äù?</h2>\n<p>That opportunity ahead of is<a href=\"http://allobook.gitcoin.co\"> capital allocation</a>, starting with <a href=\"http://gitcoin.co/whitepaper\">grants</a>. As the EVM eats the world, $trillions will become tokenized. This will create enormous opportunities for Gitcoin to deploy flavors of Quadratic Funding, Retroactive Funding, and other capital allocation strategies to everyday communities. A core human need in the 21st century is Funding What Matters. The TAM for this is all of humanity.</p>\n<p>The moment is now. As more &amp; more communities go onchain in the coming decade, we will upgrade the way these communities coordinate. We will empower them to allocate capital in a more scalable, precise, decentralized, and effective manner. This will enable them to work together bottoms-up to address 2030-era coordination failures.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR - We want to be the Allocation layer of the post-tokenization internet.</strong></p>\n<p>I believe that this trillion $$$ opportunity can not be attained with the current operating model, which relies too heavily on Grants Lab. Grants Lab is doing a good job, but I think that by activating the power of citizens, Gitcoin (including Grants Lab AND citizens) can do a great job. There is asymmetric upside in disrupting our operating current model and seizing the enormously wide opportunity ahead.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-do-we-do-this-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#how-do-we-do-this-4\"></a>How do we do this?</h2>\n<p>If you‚Äôve read my <a href=\"http://allobook.gitcoin.co\">latest book</a>, the ‚ÄúExploring the design space‚Äù section, you know that I am bullish on relying on the broader Ethereum community to explore the design space with us.

We‚Äôve received great feedback to our new direction and focus in the market and it‚Äôs directly impacted our ability to bring larger grants programs on board. We‚Äôve made great progress on the Gitcoin Grants program after a smoothly run GG20. Grants Labs and Gitcoin have greater organizational alignment, leadership depth, and clarity on our visual and value proposition than ever before.</p>\n<p>That said, like any growing startup, we‚Äôre not without our pains! Our pains are largely operational (how we do it) vs existential (what we do). Despite positive feedback on our new focus and direction, the impact radius of that remains small, and the brand narrative of Gitcoin is lagging. We haven‚Äôt achieved our goal of being a lean and agile organization yet, and this is our quarter to double down on execution and operational excellence. We‚Äôve also seen the impact of our year of big changes in contributor churn and culture, and we‚Äôre critically focused on building the right culture for the next stage of our organization.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"q3-goals-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#q3-goals-6\"></a>Q3 goals</h2>\n<p><strong>North Star: $10M in Cumulative GMV</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Double GMV w Whale Hunting</strong></p>\n<p>We have confidence that our offering is resonating with our target audience and now is the time to execute with more confidence and urgency. We are empowered to chase bigger deals and commits, as well as build on the strength of our existing partnerships.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>KPI: Increase the size of average partner grants round of $200k to $400k</li>\n<li>KPI: Activate $4m in existing delivery pipeline</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Position our technology stack for our future</strong></p>\n<p>We‚Äôve spent this quarter building &amp; validating our product strategy, and now is the time to lay the technical foundation in order to scale it. By the end of the quarter, we‚Äôve articulated and executed on technical and product strategy to accomplish the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have defined a technical strategy to accomplish the requirements for our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLQhJZl4VVdfCOL5SrjledbMptCUVz9wqrhQpLckJ68/edit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Multi-Mechanism Future </a></li>\n<li>We have built or rebuilt 1 mechanism + 1 tool using this strategy\n<ul>\n<li>Checker is likely the best tool candidate</li>\n<li>Mechanism: likely direct grants or ERF</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Every partner can successfully distribute their grants funds, with zero or very minimal issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Roll out refreshed brand narrative + positioning</strong></p>\n<p>We‚Äôve learned through our sales motion this quarter that the market‚Äôs perception of Gitcoin is outdated ‚Äì too frequently, we‚Äôre perceived as ‚Äújust QF‚Äù or ‚Äújust public goods‚Äù and we‚Äôre spending time arguing against this or missing deal flow entirely because of it. This quarter, we will articulate refreshed brand messaging and gain buy-in from internal contributors &amp; community. Additionally, we will formulate an H2 plan to promote brand messaging in the market and start executing. You can expect the H2 plan to contain the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finalize brand messaging &amp; positioning\n<ul>\n<li>Deliverables: Messaging doc, boilerplate, team training, channel-level strategy, marketecture &amp; naming conventions</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Website redesign (kind of fits into brand but chunky piece so I‚Äôm fleshing it out)\n<ul>\n<li>Deliverables: Finalize agency, all content and design done for early Q4 launch</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Build-out sales process &amp; collateral (ongoing):\n<ul>\n<li>Deliverables: pitch deck, product-level content, one-pagers, develop services menu, co-marketing tiering &amp; process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Flesh out lead-gen channels:\n<ul>\n<li>Deliverables: Refresh lead capture, routing &amp; follow-ups; set up referral program, launch ABM motion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>New processes around marketing channels:\n<ul>\n<li>Deliverables: New strategy around socials, content and email (&amp; Youtube if time); select &amp; integrate new social listening tool; establish reporting &amp; share-out process</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-7\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>It‚Äôs been a huge year so far for Gitcoin, and we‚Äôve invested much of our efforts in the first half in rebuilding the right team and org for our ambitions.

If we have not reached our goal and have bulldozed past opposition, the system may swing back toward the other pole, stuck in oscillation rather than advancing.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"grassroots-change-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#grassroots-change-5\"></a>Grassroots Change</h2>\n<p>By contrast, with Grassroots Change, we think of change occurring through ‚Äúripple effects.‚Äù It relies on many small-scale efforts, gradually winning converts until the new way replaces the old.</p>\n<p>This approach allows for creative emergence, yet can fail to take off if it does not engage structural barriers that limit progress or if local efforts do not build on each other. If our experiments run out of energy, or if we have excluded important opposition, the system can swing back again toward the other pole.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"upward-spiral-approach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#upward-spiral-approach-6\"></a>Upward Spiral Approach</h2>\n<p>The upward spiral approach enables us to bootstrap change out of many small efforts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Center on the Asset</li>\n<li>Prime for Potential</li>\n<li>Invest in Increments</li>\n<li>Approach at the Right Angle</li>\n<li>Signal Through Action</li>\n<li>Listen and Amplify</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"center-on-the-asset-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#center-on-the-asset-7\"></a>Center on the Asset</h3>\n<p>The first step in building an upward spiral is to ask, What do we want to grow? The answer is usually some kind of asset that enables us to generate the results we want. (An asset refers to any enabling resource, infrastructure, or stock ‚Äì physical or intangible.)</p>\n<p><em>Application at Gitcoin: The key enabling resource/infrastructure Gitcoin is building is Allo. Allo becomes more valuable the more people use it for capital allocation. Capital Allocation as a market has trillion $$ TAM, so there is 10^7x upside here!.

What are we truly capable of? A fresh look provides the inspiration to invest new energy in a situation with negative history.</p>\n<p><em>Application at Gitcoin: We need to build a culture (both in citizens and Grants Lab) that primes for potential.

Where do we need to say ‚Äúno‚Äù?</p>\n<p><em>Application at Gitcoin: The only thing we need to reinvent is Capital Allocation. This is our central aim.

A clearer and less vague approach to measurement, as well as more detailed reports and audits of past rounds is highly encouraged in future rounds.</p>\n<p>Equally, we are planning on hosting training sessions, workshopping through the recently-launched <a href=\"https://grantscanvas.gitcoin.co/\">Gitcoin Grants Canvas</a> with all rounds applying to GG22, and included in that training will be on how to use impact tools (hosted by a council member). We believe that this will enable rounds to set themselves up for even more success and will equal stronger proposals.</p>\n<p><em>We would like to give each round some direct feedback. You will hear from MathildaDV over the course of this week (please check gov forum DM‚Äôs if I‚Äôm not connected to you elsewhere) for some feedback on your applications.

The Q3 goals were reviewed, focusing on seizing opportunities and meeting targets, particularly in the innovation pipeline. The importance of supporting partners during the donation period was underscored, along with the need to invest in culture and foundational tech for Q3. The Q3 strategy and goals were discussed, with the aim of reaching 10 million in cumulative GMV and specific focus areas such as doubling down on GMV with whale hunting and positioning the tech stack for the future.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/grants-lab-monthly-meeting-july-2024/19160\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/grants-lab-monthly-meeting-july-2024/19160","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 22:37:01 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19160"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/grants-lab-monthly-meeting-july-2024/19160.rss","#text":"Grants Lab Monthly Meeting - July 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"[PROPOSAL] Allocate Increased Funding to Community Rounds in GG21","dc:creator":"MathildaDV","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<h1><a name=\"proposal-allocate-increased-funding-to-community-rounds-in-gg21-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#proposal-allocate-increased-funding-to-community-rounds-in-gg21-1\"></a>[PROPOSAL] Allocate Increased Funding to Community Rounds in GG21</h1>\n<p>This proposal is to request an additional $150k of funds from the Gitcoin matching pool for the upcoming GG21 round.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tldr-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-2\"></a>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>Proposal to increase funding for Gitcoin Grants 21 (GG21) Community Rounds by $150k, bringing the total to $400k.</p>\n<p>This would allow funding for the top 10 selected rounds instead of just the top 5, aiming to empower more communities and drive ecosystem growth.

We refer to this minimum amount for the project to become viable as the ‚ÄúThreshold‚Äù. The program we‚Äôre proposing will incorporate the use of self-declared Thresholds (reviewed and approved by our grant committee) so that projects only receive funding if the donations+matching pool amount would be sufficient to meet the threshold. This ensures the program is only awarding projects that, funding-wise, have a real chance of delivering a valuable output. The donations to projects that fail to meet the Threshold are returned to the donors and the matching pool is re-allocated to others. This mechanism has the advantage of nudging projects towards minimum viable products and of reducing wastage in capital allocation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-size-and-engagement-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-10\"></a>Community Size and Engagement:</h3>\n<p>For the past 2 years, RnDAO has positioned itself as a thought leader and go-to community for CollabTech.

These funds have been used to fund two positions in our organization, put on a live film festival in NYC, create a DAO blueprint, and connect with dozens of creatives globally.</p>\n<p>We aim to fund projects that align with two core areas development:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decentralized Science</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Artistic Creations</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are committed to funding 6-8 outstanding projects that promise sustainable growth and long-term benefits for our organization and community. With five core contributors currently driving our vision forward, we are keen to welcome additional individuals and organizations. Their fresh perspectives and innovative approaches will undoubtedly enrich and expand our capabilities beyond what we could achieve independently. We are enthusiastic about the prospect of incorporating new voices into our project, enhancing its diversity and impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact Assessment Plan:</strong></p>\n<p>In collaboration with Shawn Anderson from Longtail Financial, we will explore the potential of Hypercerts and DeReSy to enhance our grant assessment process. Hypercerts could be used to create a transparent, verifiable record of a project‚Äôs impact, allowing us to track and reward achievements effectively. These tokens would enable us to retrospectively fund projects based on their proven impact, fostering a more dynamic and responsive funding model.</p>\n<p>With DeReSy, we could implement a robust system for on-chain project reviews, providing clear, immutable assessments of each project‚Äôs progress and outcomes. This would allow for transparent and objective evaluations, facilitating better decision-making for future grant allocations.</p>\n<p>By working with Longtail Financial, we aim to integrate these technologies into our grant-making process, ensuring that we fund projects that offer significant, verifiable impact. This strategic collaboration will help us leverage cutting-edge blockchain technology to make more informed and impactful funding decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\n<p>Our organization, dedicated to promoting public good, believes in the transformative power of psychedelics and the arts towards making a better world. We view artists as essential in shaping public perception and preparing society for the changes psychedelics can bring. Recognizing the value of their work, we advocate for fair compensation for artists. Through this funding round, we aim to support projects that establish enduring, sustainable contributions to our organization and vision, empowering artists to create and disseminate their work, thereby influencing global consciousness positively.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Conflicts of Interest:</strong></p>\n<p>Not that we are aware of.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-decentralized-science-and-art-in-psychedelics/19127\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-decentralized-science-and-art-in-psychedelics/19127","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 23:22:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19127"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-decentralized-science-and-art-in-psychedelics/19127.rss","#text":"[GG21 Community Round Proposal] Decentralized Science and Art in Psychedelics"},"filter":false},{"title":"[GG21 Community Round Proposal] LUKSO Community Grants","dc:creator":"clara","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/a/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c\" title=\"LGP_Gitcoin\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c_2_690x345.jpeg\" alt=\"LGP_Gitcoin\" data-base62-sha1=\"nzmgN78c9emv4UT13cNXV0KmPN2\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c_2_690x345.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c_2_1035x517.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/a/a5313c7c0dba9199dbd9558c38c6fdaa2ec8bb9c_2_1380x690.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DB7ABB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"we-are-excited-to-share-our-proposal-for-the-gg21-community-round-our-goal-is-to-empower-builders-and-community-led-projects-to-foster-a-vibrant-ecosystem-of-social-creative-and-cultural-projects-through-decentralised-funding-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#we-are-excited-to-share-our-proposal-for-the-gg21-community-round-our-goal-is-to-empower-builders-and-community-led-projects-to-foster-a-vibrant-ecosystem-of-social-creative-and-cultural-projects-through-decentralised-funding-1\"></a><em>We are excited to share our proposal for the GG21 Community Round.

By utilising quadratic funding, we aim to create a decentralised funding mechanism that empowers our community to propose and support impactful projects. This mirrors Gitcoin‚Äôs commitment to cultivating a vibrant, engaged community and ensuring the economic health and vitality of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>On a higher level, the LUKSO ecosystem is social and reputation-based by default, led by our core product <a href=\"https://universalprofile.cloud\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Universal Profiles</a>. These smart contract accounts unlock account abstraction from the start, enabling a user-friendly and feature-rich ecosystem built on social, creative, and cultural use cases. This alignment with Gitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúcommunity-first‚Äù approach is likely one of the reasons why our previous collaborations within the ‚ÄúGitcoin-Verse‚Äù have always been extremely positive.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-8\"></a>ANTICIPATED SIZE OF THE MATCHING POOL</h2>\n<p>The matching pool is anticipated to be $50,000 in LYX, funded by the Foundation for the New Creative Economies.</p>\n<p>Funding address: Please find the publicly disclosed Genesis Address for the Foundation for the New Creative Economies in this <a href=\"https://medium.com/lukso/its-happening-the-genesis-validators-are-coming-ce5e07935df6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Medium Article</a> under ‚ÄúThe Genesis Addresses‚Äù.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"advisors-for-this-round-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#advisors-for-this-round-9\"></a>ADVISORS FOR THIS ROUND</h2>\n<p>Our team has been in close contact with Sov from the Gitcoin team, who has been immensely helpful in patiently answering all our questions.

They bring valuable experience from supporting our direct grants rounds and hackathons.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"funding-mechanism-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-mechanism-10\"></a>FUNDING MECHANISM</h2>\n<p>We aim to complement our <a href=\"https://lukso.network/grants\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">centralised grants program</a> with periodic quadratic funding rounds on Gitcoin, establishing a decentralised counterpart called ‚ÄúLUKSO Community Grants.‚Äù This initiative seeks to create a reliable funding mechanism driven by community proposals and contributions. Given our community‚Äôs strong engagement in building on LUKSO and advocating for ecosystem projects, we are confident in the success of this funding approach.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"community-size-and-engagement-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-11\"></a>COMMUNITY SIZE AND ENGAGEMENT</h2>\n<p>Our community is highly active and continuously engaged in driving both the education and adoption of LUKSO‚Äôs technology stack within the EVM builder community. On <a href=\"https://x.com/lukso_io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a>, we have 64k organic followers, and our <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/lukso\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Discord</a> server hosts 18.5k members. <a href=\"https://www.commonground.cg/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CommonGround</a>, a web3 alternative to Discord, hosts its most active ecosystem server with LUKSO. During the BuildUP! 1 hackathon in 2022, nearly 200 individual community members participated in the quadratic voting community awards, with <a href=\"https://l14.universalprofile.cloud/asset/0xE951ACAf8D0502276279783D4390f4bbcf757F6B\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">participation NFTs</a> still on our testnet and set to be migrated soon.</p>\n<p>For the GG21 LUKSO Community Grants, we will closely track engagement and feedback on our social media channels.

After consulting with Sov, we will set the matching pool limit to 10%.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impact-assessment-plan-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-plan-14\"></a>IMPACT ASSESSMENT PLAN</h2>\n<p>For the GG21 LUKSO Community Grants, we will closely track engagement on Twitter, the number of submitted versus eligible projects, the number of contributors, and financial contributions (total, average, median, etc.). We will also analyse the distribution of matched funds to evaluate the signalled preferences by our community and identify potential biases in our ecosystem. Tracking these metrics both across Gitcoin grant rounds and contrasting them with the funding decisions of our centralised program will provide our team with meaningful insights and feedback.</p>\n<p>Our team is currently working on integrating both on- and off-chain analysis tools. These integrations aim to track the impact of grantee projects within our ecosystem and to provide these analysis tools to the projects themselves, enabling them to gain valuable insights into their user base.

Five out of the six team members have experience running Gitcoin Grants rounds. We‚Äôll also have a dedicated group of token engineering advisors who will help in reviewing the grantees. Team members include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Round Operator:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/monikajusk/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Monika</a>, [Bio: Round Operator], [Experience: Monika is an experienced program manager with a background in leading technical projects and strategic initiatives. ]</li>\n<li><strong>Programs Lead:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/0xclyne\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Jade</a>, [Bio: TQF Analyst], [Experience: Jade is a seasoned analyst and nonprofit professional with experience in political campaigns and grant management and research, including aiding in Token Engineering Grants Round 5 distributing a $50k matching pool across 32 projects.]</li>\n<li><strong>General Support:</strong> <a href=\"https://gideonro.medium.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gideon</a>, [Bio: Former TEC Steward, Current Advisor], [Experience: Gideon is a seasoned entrepreneur and strategist with a background in marketing and product development at Microsoft and as Executive Director of Groundwire, a nonprofit consulting firm.]</li>\n<li><strong>General Support:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/brunonchain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bear</a></li>\n<li><strong>Events Coordination:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/natesuits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Nate</a></li>\n<li><strong>Social Media Coordination:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/0xEFRA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Efra</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Alignment with Gitcoin‚Äôs Mission and Essential Intents:</strong><br>\nThis round aligns with Gitcoin‚Äôs mission and essential intents by providing critical funding to build, fund, and protect what matters to the TEC community: ensuring the trustworthiness of blockchain systems. Our round helps attract and strengthen Gitcoin‚Äôs ties with the expertise and skills of the token engineering community, contributing to boosting the intent of network effects. The TEC‚Äôs dedication to catalyzing token-engineered public goods aligns with Gitcoin‚Äôs commitment to positive change.</p>\n<p>This round is the first time for the TEC to focus on accelerating the adoption of token engineering in web3 ecosystems, which is where it is needed the most. By choosing this round as a Community Round, Gitcoin would play a critical role in building networks between this new engineering discipline and Optimism and the broader Superchain.</p>\n<p>This round also supports Gitcoin‚Äôs spirit of innovation, by continuing to build on our Tunable Quadratic Funding and by integrating it with a follow-on Retro round as a mechanism for incentivizing actual impact by grantees.</p>\n<p><strong>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have a total of $50K available for both the QF and Retro rounds in this integrated grant-making campaign. Of this, we are currently dedicating $10K to the QF portion in hopes of receiving Gitcoin Community Round matching. If that does not happen, we may reallocate a larger portion of that $50K to the QF round.</li>\n<li>Funding address: <a href=\"https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x690ab933C5082049d20E53B21Dd37F9A346C8B47\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x690ab933C5082049d20E53B21Dd37F9A346C8B47</a></li>\n<li>Although we don‚Äôt expect additional funding from sponsors for the August QF round, we‚Äôre securing alternative funding sources for the retro round through token engineering firm sponsorships and Optimism community partnerships, while also evaluating Superchain, Celo grants, and Ethereum Support Program for sustainable future funding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Advisors for This Round:</strong><br>\nWe‚Äôll invite our previous round advisors to join us again for the upcoming round:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jeff Emmett - Former TEC steward, writer, researcher at BlockScience</li>\n<li>Phil H ‚Äì DAO governance, Mangrove</li>\n<li>Vasily - Ph.D. researcher and token engineer, PowerPool</li>\n<li>YGG Anderson - Former TEC steward, data scientist at BlockScience</li>\n<li>Lisa Tan - Token engineering economist, author at Orus and Economics Design</li>\n<li>Enti - Former TEC round operator, GG17, 18, 19.

This will be complemented by a Retroactive Funding round, using <a href=\"https://easyretropgf.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin‚Äôs EasyRetro on Allo Protocol</a>, in November to reward projects based on their milestone achievements and demonstrated progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Reason:</strong><br>\nTQF leverages community intelligence to efficiently allocate funds, supporting high-potential projects. It incorporates values important to the token engineering community by including signals of token engineering expertise and stake in the Superchain (OP delegates and badge holders). The Retroactive Funding round incentivizes milestone achievement and continuous improvement within the OP ecosystem. This dual-funding approach maximizes the likelihood of success and impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Size and Engagement:</strong><br>\nOur community consists of 795 token holders, 6,183 followers on Twitter, and 2,000 Discord members.</p>\n<p>Tangible metrics from our past round (GG20) indicating the strength of our community include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 60 applications, out of which 32 projects were selected for the round</li>\n<li>1,619 donations</li>\n<li>554 sponsors</li>\n<li>Total of $9,365.14 crowdfunded</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/9\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin | Explorer</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Type of Projects to Fund:</strong><br>\nWe aim to fund projects dedicated to driving the adoption of token engineering within the OP ecosystem. This includes initiatives in education, tooling, research, social infrastructure, and consulting. We are specifically seeking projects that are committed to tracking and reporting their impact in the Superchain. By coupling this QF round with a follow-on Retro round, we provide additional incentives for meaningful participation and impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Estimated Number of Eligible Grantees:</strong><br>\nIn our first three rounds, the number of grantees ranged from 15-20, while last round the number of grantees increased to 32. This round has a more specific focus on Optimism and Superchain ecosystem development through token engineering, therefore we are expecting the number of grantees to be around 5-10.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact Assessment Plan:</strong><br>\nWe plan to run a TEC Retro round, using Gitcoin‚Äôs EasyRetroPGF, open only to previous TQF round grantees who meet a predetermined performance threshold. TEC will work closely with grantees to provide feedback on their milestones and impact goals, ensuring they are meaningful and achievable. Grantees will use Karma to track progress against the milestones and goals included in their application. This impact assessment process will measure and evaluate their success, determining the Retro round awards.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Considerations:</strong><br>\nCommunity members should consider the integration of TE projects with the OP ecosystem and the potential for significant impact on both token engineering and the broader blockchain community. The TEC is committed to innovation and experimentation, being one of the first communities to tie a Quadratic Funding (QF) round with a Retroactive Funding round using Gitcoin‚Äôs tools.</p>\n<p>We are dedicated to evolving the Tunable QF process, building on Gitcoin‚Äôs pioneering work with Quadratic Funding. This approach <a href=\"https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">embeds token engineering expertise</a> into the QF voting signal, extending the impact of Gitcoin‚Äôs Allo Protocol. Additionally, we are focused on exploring the templating of our novel allocation mechanism - TQF to allow for any community running a QF round on Gitcoin to experiment with their own signals.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Conflicts of Interest:</strong><br>\nNo conflicts of interest. All round operations team members will ensure transparency and fairness in the selection and evaluation process.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-token-engineering-the-superchain/19115\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-token-engineering-the-superchain/19115","pubDate":"Sun, 14 Jul 2024 16:11:19 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.gitcoin.co-topic-19115"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-proposal-token-engineering-the-superchain/19115.rss","#text":"[GG21 Community Round Proposal] Token Engineering the Superchain"},"filter":false},{"title":"[GG21 Community Round Proposal] Regen Coordi-NATION üå±","dc:creator":"MontyMerlin","category":"üå± Gitcoin Grants","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/b/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998\" title=\"Regen CoordiNATION Banner\"><img src=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998_2_690x107.jpeg\" alt=\"Regen CoordiNATION Banner\" data-base62-sha1=\"qrGL9zjwdhcev3aBVL0fLxW1N4A\" width=\"690\" height=\"107\" srcset=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998_2_690x107.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998_2_1035x160.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/b/b959d0bb6bb6140ecb5eaa36eab5ca869f402998_2_1380x214.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C8C1AC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-regen-coordi-nation-round-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#the-regen-coordi-nation-round-1\"></a>The Regen Coordi-NATION Round</h2>\n<p>The Regen Coordi-NATION Round is a proposal for a GG21 community round centered on the themes of<a href=\"https://jessykate.medium.com/coordi-nations-a-new-institutional-structure-for-global-cooperation-3ef38d6e2cfa\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Coordi-nations</a>,<a href=\"https://www.thealternative.org.uk/dailyalternative/2019/5/13/what-is-cosmo-localism-and-why-we-think-its-a-game-changer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Cosmo-localism</a>,<a href=\"https://darkmatterlabs.org/Bioregional-Financing-Facilities\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Bio-Regionalism</a>, and<a href=\"https://www.regenerative.fi/insights/what-is-refi-regenerative-finance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Regenerative Finance (ReFi)</a>.

We also plan to combine this with a quadratic signal boosting mechanism.</li>\n<li><strong>Karma GAP for impact tracking and reporting</strong>: All grantees will have their project uploaded into Karma GAP. Furthermore, bespoke development of a contextual schema, documentation guidelines, and hands on support, will facilitate detailed reporting of milestones, updates, and impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Exploration of Hypercerts</strong>: ReFi DAO and GreenPill have both run experiments with local community impact tracking with hypercerts. From these learnings, we have developed some initial visions for how to integrate Karma GAP and Hypercerts, see ‚Ä£ <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/refi-dao/Karma-GAP-x-Hypercerts-x-ReFi-DAO-Brainstorm-fa1713f7d73543928b183d66b11d0986?pvs=4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Karma GAP x Hypercerts x Regen CoordiNATION</a>.

Each community and their members onboarded to Gitcoin during our rounds are likely to be part of Gitcoin for many years to come, or even leverage Gitcoin‚Äôs tools to run their own local or bio-regional rounds (as evidenced by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhanganQF\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ReFi Phangan</a> and others). As a result, we can help to stimulate a reinforcing cycle of adoption and engagement in Gitcoin‚Äôs products and principles, and begin to attract public, private and philanthropic sources of capital in future programs as we prove out the model.</li>\n<li><strong>Innovation &amp; Experimentation</strong>: The program aligns with Gitcoin‚Äôs modular and multi-mechanism approach by integrating QF, Signal Boosting, RPGF, Karma GAP, and Hypercerts. Additionally, by supporting the further development of the tooling, we aim to enhance interoperability, functionality, and contribute to the long-term adoption and effectiveness of the Web3 grant funding ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"potential-conflicts-of-interest-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#potential-conflicts-of-interest-10\"></a>Potential Conflicts of Interest</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lana Dingwall - As well as being an active steward of the GreenPill Network and advisor for this round, Lana also sits on the Gitcoin Community Council.

non-rivalrous network of innovators.</li>\n<li>Our second round offered an experimental context to evaluate impact attestations and a hypothesis that larger grants would support more significant impacts which could be more easily documented and attested.</li>\n<li>Our third round offers a new experimental context to evaluate how grant funding can be utilized to catalyze experimentation in on-chain collaboration and to develop open source civic engagement research that can be compiled and shared as a public good.</li>\n<li>We will continue to iterate based on insights from our last round, including a smaller matching cap and an exploration of solutions to process credit card donations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"team-running-this-round-5\" class=\"anchor\"

However, the maximum matching amount for any single project should not exceed 10% of the total matching pool.</p>\n<p><strong>Signal booster:</strong>  Inspired by the Gitcoin Citizen Round and in order to better combat Sybil attacks and introducing expert opinions, we will allocate $5000 from the matching pool and form a group of 10 people selected from our advisors, sponsors, community partners, and the GCC Standing Voting Committee. Each member will be given $500 to distribute to the Asia round projects and share their allocation strategies publicly. This design, combined with community donations, will determine the final amount of funds each Asia round project will receive from the matching pool based on QF mechanism.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-size-and-engagement-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-10\"></a>Community Size and Engagement:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In this round - we are capturing the network of two major communities 1) GCC and 2) Pagoda.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GCC is short for global Chinese community of Universal Digital Commons.

From multiple meetings with various city officials, collecting the data on city‚Äôs grants programs, analysing it, presenting at <a href=\"https://innovation.eurasia.undp.org/urban-transformation/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UNDP</a> conference for cities, researching the needed tech stacks and potential integrations, to narrowing down the how and where we would use QF.</p>\n<p>Also, I applied for EF Next Billion with this project in mind. Not only the <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/24/next-billion-cohort4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">project was selected</a> as one of the very few, but it got additional funding for the purpose of building the app.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-are-we-building-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-are-we-building-3\"></a>What are we building?</h2>\n<p>Ethereum has a number of protocols and apps that are both mature enough and solve a need a city has. We are building an open-source app customised for cities, which will serve as an interface to the Ethereum ecosystem of apps and protocols. Premier example of these, and the first one we want to offer access to is Gitcoin.</p>\n<p>One of the most important things cities do, is allocating money for public goods. Whether they need direct grants, QF, retro funding or something else, they could and should use Allo protocol. We intend on running our grant programs on Allo protocol.</p>\n<p>Gitcoin has built Grants Stack for the purpose of providing an easy and powerful interface for using Allo protocol. While using Allo protocol is a non-brainer for us, for Grants Stack we have some obstacles to use it as-is. It comes with its own set of features which are not directly usable by cities in their interaction with non-web3-native citizens, while some features which are needed are missing. We want to use as much of Grants stack as possible, but we have yet to look deeper and decide how to do it.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the things we‚Äôll probably need to do differently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we need to offer users an in-app non-custodial wallet with no need to manage private keys (we plan to use Cometh Connect for this)</li>\n<li>we need to offer simple in-app onramp solution which works well with local banks, cards, currencies and KYC requirements.</li>\n<li>we need to abstract away the cryptocurrency used, so that users who top up euros, see euro balance (which means we need to use euro stablecoin)</li>\n<li>we need to make it in local language with local legal documents</li>\n<li>we need to be able to support different types of grants than what is currently supported by Gitcoin. (Eg. citizens propose projects, but the city gets the money and executes)</li>\n<li>we need to use city-specific tools and available data for sybil resistance, and possibly for KYC</li>\n<li>we need to only show the rounds which a citizen can participate in</li>\n<li>we might need to integrate a forum for discussions on the rounds</li>\n<li>we might need to integrate an option for donors to vote on disbursement of funds after the execution</li>\n<li>we might need to allow for documents submission</li>\n<li>we might need to add additional types of fields in the submission forms</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"where-are-we-now-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#where-are-we-now-4\"></a>Where are we now?</h2>\n<p>To advance [or help implement] this project I was recently selected as part of the Ethereum Foundation‚Äôs Next Billion Fellowship Program.  With their advisory and financial support we will build a minimum viable app for the purpose of running one specific QF grant round in Split, Croatia. Unfortunately, this funding is limited and besides building the app for pilot, doesn‚Äôt cover much more.</p>\n<p>Also, there are multiple grant programs with multiple grant rounds which we could run through the app as well. We could just run the pilot, or we could build such an MVP, which would be usable by any city or other institution to run local grant programs on Ethereum and Allo. We have already started talks with UNDP about this possibility. They work directly with more than 100 cities and national governments, and thourgh their network, we could reach more users quickly.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-do-we-expect-from-the-pilot-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-do-we-expect-from-the-pilot-5\"></a>What do we expect from the pilot?</h2>\n<p>The pilot will run in Split in September 2024. with a goal of at least 30 proposals and 1500 citizens donating (1% of population).</p>\n<p>These citizens will be onboarded on Ethereum and Gitcoin.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-do-we-expect-to-achieve-with-additional-funding-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-do-we-expect-to-achieve-with-additional-funding-6\"></a>What do we expect to achieve with additional funding?</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"june-2024-november-2024-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co#june-2024-november-2024-7\"></a>June 2024 - November 2024</h3>\n<p>We will create an app and run a successful pilot in the city of Split during the fellowship ().
