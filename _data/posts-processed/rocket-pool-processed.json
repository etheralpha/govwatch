Additionally, we consider how the current indirect model compares to the proposed direct revenue approach. Next, we analyze the proposed tokenomics rework and assess the risks associated with each component individually and in totality. Lastly, we evaluate the impact of these proposed changes on NodeSet’s work before suggesting an alternative proposal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>The current tokenomics proposal that has received the most attention fundamentally changes the relationship between RPL and the protocol and, therefore, the relationships between stakeholders in the system. Our findings indicate that the proposed new dynamics may be less healthy than existing dynamics because they create a financialized shareholder class that is economically incentivized to exploit the other actors (NOs, rETH holders) who make the system run, necessarily changing the makeup of these groups over time. In turn, this is likely to eventually lead to systemic instability and a transformation of RP into a protocol dominated by ungovernable large actors.</p>\n<p>While RPL exists today as a utility token with an indirect revenue model fundamentally tied to node operation, the new proposals shift it towards an asset that can be priced more concretely by the market through ETH revenue accrual, opening it to increased levels of speculator ownership rather than participant ownership. Although this may make RPL more attractive to some, it does so by taking value from existing and future NOs, and for many scenarios, there is little change in terminal valuation versus existing tokenomics. Potential mitigations are suggested to prevent the optimization of the RPL/ETH ratio from overshadowing these and other serious risks associated with the proposed tokenomics changes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, these changes would significantly impact NodeSet’s ability to grow Rocket Pool with Constellation. Altering tokenomics after the upcoming release of Constellation might, at worst, prevent its operation. At best, these changes would reduce its positive impact and delay future development to focus on complying with new changes to RP. Therefore, we suggest a different path.</p>\n            <p><small>23 posts - 12 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/nodeset-review-of-rpl-tokenomics/2869\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/nodeset-review-of-rpl-tokenomics/2869","pubDate":"Tue, 26 Mar 2024 19:32:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2869"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/nodeset-review-of-rpl-tokenomics/2869.rss","#text":"NodeSet Review of RPL Tokenomics"},"filter":false},{"title":"Adjust terminal user interface size to make it suitable for smartphones","dc:creator":"Dinolawer","category":"Node Operator Experience","description":"<p>This is a rather simple and small request but that would enable safer and easier remote acces.</p>\n<p>I used to be able to open the TUI (terminal user interface) on my phone, but this functionality has been gone since some time.

Discussions have centered around the operational aspects of this integration. While the RP team is supportive of the SSV integration, their focus remains primarily on Houston, Saturn, and megapools.

The estimated costs for this endeavor, including bounty work and audit expenses, stand at approximately $50k.</p>\n<p>Should the protocol seek to integrate SSV?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858/1\">Click to view the poll.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Commitment</strong><br>\nGiven the intricacies and dependencies involved, there is a strong case for having a dedicated party extremely knowledgeable of both RocketPool and SSV to undertake this project. It’s also imperative that the proposed work takes megapools into consideration to the fullest extent possible. Along with gauging overall sentiment, the GMC aims to use this thread to identify any interested parties within the Rocket Pool community willing to lead this initiative. <strong>If you are interested, please provide details in the comments section below.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Implementation</strong><br>\nRight now the <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/round-9-gmc-call-for-bounty-applications-deadline-is-february-11/2635/2\">bounty</a> outlines interested parties bringing a MVP detailing the design of the integration:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The bounty for integrating SSV technology with Rocket Pool will be open for a duration of two months. Within this time frame, we welcome submissions from any number of teams or individuals who are prepared to present an MVP focused on SSV integration. We encourage early submissions to foster a collaborative environment. As soon as we receive the first qualifying MVP submission, a subsequent period of two weeks will commence, during which other participants can still submit their versions of the MVP for consideration. Following this two-week window, one team will be selected and awarded one-third of the total bounty prize. This chosen team will then have the exclusive option to undertake the complete project, thereby claiming the remaining portion of the bounty. This approach ensures a competitive yet collaborative atmosphere, driving innovation while maintaining a focus on delivering a high-quality, functional integration of SSV with Rocket Pool.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does the community see this approach as feasible, or are there any suggestions to make this process more efficient?</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858","pubDate":"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:41:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2858"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858.rss","#text":"SSV Integration"},"filter":false},{"title":"Grant Idea - Rocket Pool Summit Program","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Grants / Bounties","description":"<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>Create a budget for Rocket Pool meetup events where community members can meet in approved locations (cities) twice a year, and be reimbursed up to a certain amount for their expenses.</p>\n<p>Right now ETH Denver is the primary event for the Rocket Pool community.

Sometimes it’s coincentives, sometimes it’s an execution detail, sometimes they’re asking us to try something, sometimes we want to change something in a deployment… it varies a fair amount. This is usually a trickle, but it can ocassionally come in a bunch. It can also sometimes pack some urgency behind it, though we try to avoid that.</li>\n<li><strong>Researching new protocols:</strong> when we want to use a new protocol, we need to learn about it. This includes reading up on their audits, understanding how long they’ve been deployed, understanding who has what administrative powers (which might also entail understanding multisigs or governance), etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Figuring out new transactions:</strong> After we understand a protocol at a high level, we need to understand how to interact with them effectively. This involves documentation, finding on-chain exemplar transactions, and sometimes talking with the protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Budget planning:</strong> this part of <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/imcsheet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">spreadsheeting</a> takes the IMC’s decisions and reduces them to line items. We’ll spend x ETH worth of RPL on blah.</li>\n<li>Building transactions: this is actually putting together the transactions that execute on the budget plan. Usually, we have a very similar set of transactions to build from. This involves carefully checking all addresses, hashes, amounts, etc. This is like the “Review” step, but with a lot more open space to make a mistake. Ofc, you have the safety net of the reviewers.</li>\n<li><strong>Accounting:</strong> this part of <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/imcsheet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">spreadsheeting</a> takes completed transactions and tracks them on the spreadsheet with info that anyone can follow easily to find any transaction if they wish to. It also involves cross-checking totals with reality and tracking down any discrepancies.</li>\n<li><strong>Posting on forums:</strong> the IMC treasurer (currently Val) has a duty to post prospective plans and retrospective reports.

There are a couple of solutions, and none will hinder Rocket Pool’s node operators’ autonomy. In Restaking Cloud, rewards are distributed via points as well as kETH (always redeemable for ETH) and other tokens. All of these are ERC20.

Any network and middleware that wants to access Restaking Cloud does so as a paid for service paying continual interest thus providing restakers with a more stable yield in kETH.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Principle protected restaking deposits</li>\n<li>Yield without running additional services for protocols (there is an option for additional work and additional rewards)</li>\n<li>Baseline yield is in kETH</li>\n<li>Fully compatible with Eigenlayer</li>\n<li>Outsized weightage of points during Private Mainnet</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"risks-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#risks-6\"></a>Risks</h2>\n<p>Restaking Cloud restakers do not encounter the same risks as other restaking protocols. This is because the whole restaked ledger is actively managed by K2 protocol for its slashing and payouts in realtime. All restaked services are monitored via the K2 reporter; It ejects any network when effectiveness causes correlated degradation &gt;30%. This prevents any long range attack and contagion to the principle stake. The maximum downside for a restaker is that they may not yield anything from K2 in the short term until the global yield pool recuperates.</p>\n<p>Mitigation of smart contract risk is addressed by keeping a detached state replicated validator registry of active validator stake balances of those who opted in for restaking from the consensus layer. It stays in an async checkpointed reconciliation for yield claims. Service flow (Restaking Cloud yield) is only claimable for active validators on the consensus layer. If they exit, it will reduce the claim in sync with the Beacon chain&lt;&gt;execution layer clock.</p>\n<p>The concept of reusing a validator’s security while maintaining it as a safe asset was brought to the public eye back in 2022 by Blockswap Labs CEO Matt Shams at an Ethereum Foundation event at Devconnect.</p>\n<p>Matt Shams — ETH as a long term collateral for rollup centric future (ETHconomics @ Devconnect 2022) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6FmiXi1L1Z0?si=932nEfJhPJjV8fwP\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/6FmiXi1L1Z0?si=932nEfJhPJjV8fwP</a></p>\n<p>There is an FAQ on risks that can be found at the link below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.restaking.cloud/the-risks-of-restaking-faq-22a6d8121fed\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://blog.restaking.cloud/the-risks-of-restaking-faq-22a6d8121fed</a></p>\n<p>The module for restaking that needs to be run as an additional client on the validator is called MEV Plus - native delegation module. It is similar to MEVBoost and can not touch the balances of your validator. <a href=\"https://docs.restaking.cloud/middleware/mevPlusModule\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">It is available to view under and open source MIT license</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ongoing-eigenlayer-efforts-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#ongoing-eigenlayer-efforts-7\"></a>Ongoing Eigenlayer Efforts</h2>\n<p>It is understood that the DAO has a potential research grant for a solution for RP built directly on Eignelayer. This document is not intended to derail those efforts as Restaking Cloud is fully compatible with Eigenlayer validators. It could be in the DAOs best interest to pursue multiple restaking protocols wherever possible. Restaking Cloud is designed to be futureproof with compatibility for various restaking protocol designs.</p>\n<p>Many staking validators might be participating in other staking protocols such as Eigenlayer etc, this is 100% compatible with Restaking Cloud. Restaking Cloud is a compliment for all ETH stakers. The only criteria is that the underlying validator has an active status on the consensus layer.</p>\n<p>Articulating a path for the DAO to integrate with Restaking Cloud should be fairly quick.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"two-options-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#two-options-8\"></a>Two Options</h2>\n<p>There are two clear paths available for the Rocket Pool community to consider when Rocket Pool node operators participate in Restaking Cloud. It is possible to start with Option <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> and work towards Option <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span>. Both of these are entirely compatible with all other DAO efforts including working with Eigenlayer.</p>\n<p>Option <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span></p>\n<p>In Rocket Pool there are two withdrawal addresses - Protocol withdrawal credential (smart contract) and user withdrawal address (EOA / smart wallet). Rocket Pool node operators could point all Restaking Cloud yield they earn to the user withdrawal credential.</p>\n<p>Pros</p>\n<p>This is a simple solution and doesn’t require any changes to protocol operations. Rocket Pool node operators who opt in are rewarded, while those who do not will not receive any rewards.</p>\n<p>Cons</p>\n<p>RPL holders would not see points or yield from Restaking Cloud via Native Delegations from Rocket Pool nodes.</p>\n<p>Option <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span></p>\n<p>Rocket Pool DAO provides an EOA or smart wallet address (SAFE) for Rocket Pool node operators to direct all rewards and points to, by setting it as the K2 payout address.</p>\n<p>Pros</p>\n<p>All rewards will be distributed to the set address and can be redistributed as the DAO decides.</p>\n<p>Cons</p>\n<p>Those who do not restake could receive restaking rewards. A fund splitter may be required to reconcile the registered validator BLS Key and operator addresses along with the joining time. The Restaking Cloud team could provide this if there is sufficient demand and interest from the community.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"looking-ahead-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#looking-ahead-9\"></a>Looking Ahead</h2>\n<p>Restaking is becoming a large part of the Ethereum ecosystem and Rocket Pool can utilize both Restaking Cloud and Eigenlayer to generate additional revenue. It is up to the DAO to determine the best path forward. Restaking Cloud is inclusive to all validators on Ethereum that have an active validator status. The Restaking Cloud team is happy to give a technical presentation or provide supplemental materials to the Rocket Pool community.</p>\n            <p><small>13 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/finding-compatability-with-restaking-cloud/2804\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/finding-compatability-with-restaking-cloud/2804","pubDate":"Tue, 12 Mar 2024 18:14:31 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2804"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/finding-compatability-with-restaking-cloud/2804.rss","#text":"Finding Compatability with Restaking Cloud"},"filter":false},{"title":"Vote - Merchandise Store Art Contest","dc:creator":"drdoofus","category":"Community","description":"<h1><a name=\"vote-merchandise-store-art-contest-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#vote-merchandise-store-art-contest-1\"></a>Vote - Merchandise Store Art Contest</h1>\n<p>These entries are from the official thread in <a href=\"https://discord.gg/rocketpool#trading\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">#trading</a></p>\n<p>Vote for up to 10<br>\n<strong>Choose based on what you would actually wear or believe others would wear!</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Top ten vote recipients are the winners - $100 each<br>\n<strong>To claim the prize money, you must provide a graphic in the format stated in the rules: <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/merchandise-store-art-contest/2754\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Merchandise Store Art Contest</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I tried to weed out the joke images, but if yours is not here and was not a joke,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Let me know</li>\n<li>Yikes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Voting ends March 17<br>\nWinners announced March 18<br>\nWinning the contest does NOT guarantee your design will end up in the store</p>\n<p><em><strong>Winning entries are agreeing to the Merchandise Store using their design for swag and advertising for the Store with no expectation of monetary compensation other than the contest award itself.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Vote for up to ten:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/vote-merchandise-store-art-contest/2779/1\">Click to view the poll.</a></p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/vote-merchandise-store-art-contest/2779\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/vote-merchandise-store-art-contest/2779","pubDate":"Mon, 11 Mar 2024 12:45:31 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2779"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/vote-merchandise-store-art-contest/2779.rss","#text":"Vote - Merchandise Store Art Contest"},"filter":true},{"title":"Round 11 - GMC Call for Retrospective Applications - Deadline is April 7","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Grants / Bounties","description":"<p>This thread is for applications for Rocket Pool’s March 10, 2024 - April 7, 2024 retrospective awards.

Shielded Voting is developed by Snapshot and Shutter in tandem. More on the release of the feature here: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SnapshotLabs/status/1580674555710181378\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/SnapshotLabs/status/1580674555710181378</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Shielded voting is live! — Snapshot Labs</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"description-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#description-2\"></a>Description</h2>\n<p>The proposal focuses on the introduction of the Shutter Governance to Rocket Pool. Shutter Governance enables Shielded Voting to be set up when voting on the Snapshot platform. We think shielded/secret ballot voting is superior to open voting in many ways, especially around preventing strategic voting/misbehavior and voter apathy, factors that, in our view, negatively affect the overall voting structure in the DAO environment. Above all, we believe that Shutter Governance will restore awareness in the participation of the individual for the good of the whole and bring positive, democratic values. The use of Shutter Governance is entirely free of charge, and it only takes a couple of clicks from the admin side when setting up the proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"about-shutter-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#about-shutter-3\"></a>About Shutter</h2>\n<p>Shutter promotes base layer neutrality and information symmetry using threshold encryption and a decentralized Keyper set. The protocol has 2 primary applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.shutter.network/announcing-rolling-shutter/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Rolling Shutter</a> prevents malicious MEV (front running, sandwich attacks) and censorship on L1s and Ethereum L2s by encrypting transactions as they are created and then decrypting them after the transaction order in the block has been fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.shutter.network/shutter-brings-shielded-voting-to-snapshot/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Shielded Voting</a> increases the fairness and integrity of votes on Snapshot and other voting platforms by encrypting all votes as they are cast and then decrypting them when the voting period has ended.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MEV and front running are recognized to be among the final unsolved fundamental issues in the blockchain space. Ethereum is vulnerable mainly because of the block producer’s ability to arbitrarily reorder transactions in the blocks they produce.

This is why we developed Shutter Governance, a tool for governance platforms which allows the use of shielded voting for their users.</p>\n<p>We think by default - similarly to how voting works for political elections - all DAO voters for a given DAO vote should be able to access the same information beforehand. Shouldn’t we, who are using crypto governance, also have that option?</p>\n<p>To be more specific, these are some of the benefits that we’re hoping shielded voting adds to the voting process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-voting information symmetry,</li>\n<li>And added layer of censorship resistance,</li>\n<li>Partial privacy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This might sound a little theoretical, so let’s have a look at these two examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Consider a contentious vote in which a minority is pushing the poll early in one direction. Voters that don’t have a strong opinion already formed might see this and think the outcome is already decided. Thus they’ll be discouraged from voting and also from researching/forming an opinion. This could then lead to the vote going in favor of the minority due to voter apathy, which would not be a good outcome, given that the goal of the poll is to represent the majority opinion.</li>\n<li>Consider a whale with malicious intent observing and waiting for a vote to play out. Only to come in at the last minute, borrowing/buying just the right amount of tokens needed to sway the vote, and doing this at a time when there’s no more time for the rest of the community to react.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In both of these scenarios, having the vote shielded could improve the situation massively. The first example covers how this feature can help with incentivizing people to vote, leading to a higher voter turnout. In the second scenario, we show how shielded voting protects the proposal from manipulation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-implementation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#specification-implementation-5\"></a>Specification &amp; Implementation</h2>\n<p>With Shutter Governance, votes are encrypted during the voting period and revealed after the poll closes, similar to secret ballot political elections in which we would not like to reveal the voting results before the polling stations close. To vote on a proposal with Shutter Governance, the user first requests the Eon key with the Keypers signature, there is then a signature check against the Keyper registry to prevent the system operator from giving out a fake key that they control. After this step, the votes get encrypted with the Proposal key, derived from the Eon key and the proposal ID.</p>\n<p>Shutter Governance had its official launch on the Snapshot platform on October 13, 2022. From then on, all Snapshot DAOs have the option to choose Shutter as a voting privacy option in the Snapshot admin settings. With this in mind, the use of Shielded Voting does not require any work or technical input from anyone at DAOs, the entire solution is fully implemented on Snapshot and whether organizations will use it is just a matter of choice.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/switch-snapshot-space-to-shielded-voting-secret-ballots-using-shutter-threshold-encryption/2767\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/switch-snapshot-space-to-shielded-voting-secret-ballots-using-shutter-threshold-encryption/2767","pubDate":"Tue, 05 Mar 2024 21:30:00 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2767"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/switch-snapshot-space-to-shielded-voting-secret-ballots-using-shutter-threshold-encryption/2767.rss","#text":"Switch Snapshot space to shielded voting/secret ballots using Shutter threshold encryption"},"filter":false},{"title":"GMC 2024/02/01 - 2024/02/29 Treasury Report","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Grants / Bounties","description":"<p>Here is a link to the treasury sheet - <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMtHJ4sffBidSN5RphLYC9A5HrsRNqHfqLVn-nJR104/\">GMC Treasury Sheet - Google Sheets </a></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Funds at Start</th>\n<th>Inflows</th>\n<th>Payments</th>\n<th>Diversification (LUSD)</th>\n<th>Outflows (Total)</th>\n<th>Funds at End</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>52,005.27</td>\n<td>7,589.14</td>\n<td>2,758.92</td>\n<td>1,517.83</td>\n<td>4,276.75</td>\n<td>56,282.02</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>LUSD Funds at Start</th>\n<th>LUSD Inflows</th>\n<th>LUSD Payments</th>\n<th>LUSD Funds at End</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>80,124.05</td>\n<td>23,867.55</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>103,991.61</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>In February, the GMC performed 57 payment transfers totaling 3,348.1 RPL, which included compensating committee members for executing payments over the last year.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-2024-02-01-2024-02-29-treasury-report/2766\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-2024-02-01-2024-02-29-treasury-report/2766","pubDate":"Tue, 05 Mar 2024 20:04:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2766"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-2024-02-01-2024-02-29-treasury-report/2766.rss","#text":"GMC 2024/02/01 - 2024/02/29 Treasury Report"},"filter":false},{"title":"Destroyaaa Joins The GMC","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Grants / Bounties","description":"<p>In light of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/u/jcrtp\">@jcrtp</a>’s paternity leave, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/u/destroyaaa\">@Destroyaaa</a> has graciously volunteered to assume Joe’s responsibilities in the development subcommittee for the next few months.

Add additional clarify on GMC members participating in bounties.</p>\n<p>B) <strong>Schedule Adjustment</strong><br>\nMake an adjustment to the application deadline within the schedule.</p>\n<p>C) <strong>Restore Missing Section</strong><br>\nRestore the ‘Selection and Governance’ section that was incorrectly removed in RPIP-26.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>A) <strong>Conflicts Of Interest</strong><br>\nThe conflict of interests section does not allow grant applicants to fulfill their regular duties, and it has been a recurring issue for the GMC.</p>\n<p>This was discussed back in June (<a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-rpip-18-conflict-of-interest-community-feedback/1959\">link</a>), and one of the opposing arguments was that it does not happen enough to warrant changing. Unfortunately, this is still a recurring problem.</p>\n<p>In round 9, there were four conflicts of interest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ShfRyn (POAPs)</li>\n<li>Ken (Denver Lift-Off)</li>\n<li>Waq (The Weekly Orbit)</li>\n<li>Dr Doofus (The Merchandise Store)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The situation was compounded by Joe taking paternity leave, leading to a decrease in staffing across various departments: development lost one member, research lost one member, and marketing lost two members.</p>\n<p>Consequently, subcommittees ceased functioning, placing additional burdens on members who now had to review nearly three times the usual number of applications. Furthermore, arranging calls and discussions became significantly more challenging due to the traditional three members to an application becoming six to nine members.</p>\n<p>While this rule remains intact, the GMC will continually hit these periods where they are forced to emergency shuffle resources and potentially have a less informed / effective decision process as a result.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounty Clarity:</strong> As the GMC has increased its facilitation of bounties, it has recognized the necessity for greater clarity regarding the bounty process. This clarity aims to mitigate potential conflicts of interest among GMC members who are interested in participating in bounty completion.</p>\n<p>B) <strong>Schedule Adjustment</strong><br>\nCurrently, the GMC has between 16 (sixteen) days or 9 (nine) days to research, engage in meetings, negotiate, and deliberate on applications. There has been a strong consensus that 16 days is much more of an optimal timeline.</p>\n<p>C) <strong>Restore Missing Section</strong><br>\nAdding this section back corrects minor errors that happened during the last RPIP writing process where content was not properly migrated.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p><strong>Specification</strong></p>\n<p>A) <strong>Conflicts Of Interest</strong><br>\nRevise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any GMC member who submits a grant application SHALL abstain from scoring, voting on, or participating in GMC discussions about any grants during the application period for which they are an applicant. They may participate in the ratifying snapshot vote. They may also score, vote, and participate in discussions in future rounds during which their grant is ongoing, provided they have not submitted an application during that round for any new grants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any GMC member who submits a grant application SHALL abstain from scoring, voting on, or participating in GMC discussions about any <strong>competing grants during the application period for which they are an applicant. ANY committee member or the GMC administrator may identify a grant as a competing grant. In such cases, committee members who have submitted a grant application for that period cannot vote or discuss that application.</strong> They may participate in the ratifying snapshot vote. They may also score, vote, and participate in discussions in future rounds during which their grant is ongoing, provided they have not submitted an application during that round for any new grants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For <strong>bounty clarity</strong> add to the end of the ‘Conflicts Of Interest’ section:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a GMC member plans to complete a bounty, that SHALL be communicated to the GMC as early in the  process as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>B) <strong>Schedule Adjustment</strong><br>\nRevise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Submissions received before the second Sunday of the month will be reviewed that month; if received after that, they will be queued for next month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Submissions received before the <strong>7th</strong> of the month will be reviewed that month; if received after that, they will be queued for next month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>C) <strong>Restore Missing Section</strong><br>\nAdd the following below the current Conflicts of Interest section:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Selection and Governance</h2>\n<p>In addition to the “Management Committee Governance” and “Management Committee Selection” sections of RPIP-10, the GMC will abide by the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The GMC SHALL contain nine individuals, except in cases of vacancies.</li>\n<li>Upon approval of this RPIP, immediate elections following the guidelines of RPIP-10 SHALL take place for any new or vacant seats. These elections SHALL supercede the rules for filling vacancies in the previous bullet.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>–</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>A) <strong>Conflicts Of Interest</strong><br>\nOther committee members can now label or identify competing grants. This allows any one of the 8 other GMC members or the administrator to act as a safeguard in the possibility of conflicts of interest. The original rule where they cannot vote on their own grant(s) are still intact.</p>\n<p>Additional reasons why the current rule lacks effectiveness include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are currently no funding or allocation limits in place. For instance, if John blocks applicant A, it does not necessarily free up funding for John’s own applications or initiatives.</li>\n<li>Discouraging community members from serving as GMC members does not align with the committee’s goals. Those with conflicts of interest in round 9 bring invaluable insights to the committee, and losing them would significantly impact its effectiveness. Moreover, GMC member recruitment is notoriously challenging. Despite concerted efforts, including my own outreach and Valdorff’s recruitment activities, currently we only have one backup left with approximately nine months remaining in this term. Given that the applications in question relate to crucial products, losing either these members or their associated applications would be highly undesirable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>B) <strong>Schedule Adjustment</strong><br>\nThe GMC can still facilitate the same amount of applications but spend more time discussing and negotiating each one.</p>\n<p>C) <strong>Restore Missing Section</strong><br>\nThis restores data that should have never been removed.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-updates-proposal/2750/1\">Click to view the poll.</a></p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-updates-proposal/2750\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-updates-proposal/2750","pubDate":"Sun, 25 Feb 2024 01:39:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2750"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-updates-proposal/2750.rss","#text":"GMC Updates - Proposal"},"filter":false},{"title":"Rapid Research Reflection","dc:creator":"epineph","category":"Governance","description":"<p>So there’s not going to be any deep introspection or stunning revelations in this post, but I felt I should do some sort of reflection on the Rapid Research Incubator bounty, and also see what others felt about this bounty that completed January 10th.<br>\n<a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/round-7-gmc-call-for-bounty-applications-deadline-is-december-10/2422/2\">https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/round-7-gmc-call-for-bounty-applications-deadline-is-december-10/2422/2</a></p>\n<p><strong>Successes:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Speed:  This DAO will never match the speed of a centralized entity, but this was very quick.  November 19th was the initial call to action; submissions completed Jan 10th; review by Feb 8th.  This timeline could likely be shortened further by having standing guidelines/deadlines in place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quality of submissions:  High quality of submissions; Valdorff is a frequent contributor and we have certain high expectations, but the submissions from community members who had never been awarded by the GMC were tremendous.  This could be further improved by better recruiting of candidates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cooperation between the RP Team and DAO:  I think communication has felt lacking in the last 18 months as the protocol has grown; there is some jurisdictional rivalry and several episodes of waste (in community member time and pDAO money) due to uncertainty about roadmaps and priorities.  However, the Team and DAO are extremely aligned in addressing the concerns of impending competition, and the Team has been extremely supportive of this DAO initiative.  I hope this is a foreshadowing of a closer strategic ties in the future as the relationship between the two entities matures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cost:  In terms of cost/effectiveness, this was excellent value.  I think the submitters should receive more, but it’s hard to predict in advance the value to the protocol; additionally, I felt it was likely that those who had already made significant progress developing top ranked ideas would continue to develop them and get awarded again as we move towards implementation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recruiting new researchers:  Money is fine, but knowing people are interested in your ideas is a powerful motivator.  Rocket Pool has had a fairly narrow group of names that have been responsible for pushing major changes, and I think having a deeper bench of people innovating and reviewing ideas is incredibly important as the protocol grows- hopefully at some point our lead innovators won’t need to be jacks-of-all-trades, and we will be able to sustain the loss of innovators (to burn out, new jobs, etc) without major interruptions of the protocol’s governance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Distribution of awards:  I think this distribution was close to perfect; large enough pots for the best submissions to encourage quality over quantity, but enough total payments so that everyone walked away with something as compensation for their hard work.  I probably would not change this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Community building:  Change has a certain inertia; it takes time for community buy in.  By exposing ideas early in development, and allowing more people to become invested in their success, it will likely contribute to a smoother transition from a political perspective than if ideas were presented in a (semi) final form.  Also, during downtrends, it is helpful to show concerned low-frequency community members that “something” is being done to make the protocol better.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Needs improvement:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Marketing:  Many people, even those who spend a lot of time on trading, did not know this bounty existed; it was largely advertised on the Forum (which has a lower viewership) and in threads (which would only be visible if you had previously seen them).  Next time there should be better advertising on main discord channels, and likely direct recruitment of regulars who we suspect have ideas to contribute if asked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cost of award review:  The review/grading of the submissions is not the point of this exercise, but is necessary to accurately distribute funds and prevent spamming with submissions.  This review process took about 50 hours of time from protocol members chosen for their skills and knowledge.  It would be better to use some of that time in other ways (maybe plotting the way forward) by simplifying the review process (ie, only 3/5 reviewers grade a given project, or better use of community input, or each reviewer only giving detailed criteria on their 5 top picks).  Anything over 25% of funds going towards deciding on distribution of funds seems terminally inefficient to me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Failure to launch next step:  After awards were decided, there is no clear roadmap to get the best ideas from here to implementation.  Currently, it is likely that we will employ a retroactive award for the intellectual ferment that is occurring now in the Options Draft thread.  I think it may be more efficient to have a milestone type bounty where we pay out for the initial submissions, and then choose a handful (small committee, 3?) of researchers to bring the ideas to the point of DAO temperature check.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wide scope:  By necessity, this was a “we want every type of idea” bounty.  I think in the future it could be possible to have a “rapid research bounty of the month”- smaller, more targeted and reliant on a strategic roadmap, so that we could have several areas of research occurring in parallels with different innovators.  For this we will need a strategic roadmap, so that the GMC does not have to assume that role.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-reflection/2738\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-reflection/2738","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Feb 2024 05:35:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2738"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-reflection/2738.rss","#text":"Rapid Research Reflection"},"filter":false},{"title":"Integrating EigenLayer through the Contract Layer","dc:creator":"signalxu","category":"Governance","description":"<h1><a name=\"background-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#background-1\"></a>Background</h1>\n<p>The community previously proposed <a href=\"https://github.com/shfryn/rocketpool-gmc/blob/main/bounties/BA082401.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a bounty for integrating EigenLayer</a> through the hybrid restaking.
