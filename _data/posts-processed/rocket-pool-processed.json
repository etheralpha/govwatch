This allows the team to immediately disable features of the protocol that may protect against loss of funds in the case of a protocol bug or exploit. This proposal removes this safety net.

This Security Council needs to be maintained to always comprise active members who can react to potential threats.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Security Council membership is a serious role and the pDAO SHOULD develop strong entry requirements and processes for routinely flushing stale members.

Q2 2024","dc:creator":"langers","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Hello everyone!</p>\n<p>This is a rather delayed quarterly roadmap update - so deepest apologies for that.</p>\n<p>This is the roadmap update for Q2 2024.</p>\n<p><strong>Houston</strong><br>\nHouston smart contracts have undergone rigorous auditing, and the reports are now live on our website at <a href=\"https://rocketpool.net/protocol/security\">https://rocketpool.net/protocol/security</a>. We’ve also developed and deployed new Houston features on the website. A successful beta testing phase was conducted in collaboration with our community, incorporating valuable feedback and bug fixes into our smart node. Additionally, our team has prioritised and resolved an important bug bounty issue in the Houston code.</p>\n<p>We’re excited that Houston is set to launch on June 17th! For more information, please read Dave’s Medium article at <a href=\"https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-houston-launch-b056ca1a6c10\">https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-houston-launch-b056ca1a6c10</a>. As of now, the smart contracts have been deployed, and we’re in the process of voting on the ODAO upgrade proposal.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we’ve worked to merge our current Snapshot voting system with our new on-chain voting mechanism. This unified approach combines the benefits of gasless voting on Snapshot with the direct power of on-chain voting. A detailed Medium article is coming soon, giving you a heads-up on what to expect.</p>\n<p><strong>RPIP-28 and RPIP-30</strong><br>\nThese RPIPs have been ratified by the pDAO for inclusion in the protocol but unfortunately they were ratified after the Houston feature cutoff.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>RPIP-28 Deposit Under the Minimum</em> - allows creating a new minipool even when under the minimum by supporting an atomic RPL stake and node deposit</li>\n<li><em>RPIP-30 RPL Staking Rework</em> - aligns RPL reward spend with rETH capacity created.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Initially, we planned to roll out an intermediate update between Houston and Saturn to deliver these enhancements. However, our focus on Saturn has intensified, and it now appears more likely that these features will be included in the Saturn release rather than being deployed beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Saturn</strong><br>\nSaturn has come through ideation with the community Rapid Research Incubation process (<a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-incubation-begins/2654\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Rapid Research Incubation Begins!</a>). The community have invested significant time in research and analysis and are drafting Rocket Pool Improvement proposals: <a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-2024\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Tokenomics Rework | Rocket Pool Improvement Proposals</a>. The team have engaged RPIP authors to ensure feasibility and technical considerations.</p>\n<p>The team have been breaking down the draft RPIPs: assessing how they affect technical design; and determining the scope of changes to the protocol.</p>\n<p>From a development perspective we have been focused on Megapools, a crucial component of Saturn. Recently, we’ve had to adapt to the upcoming Ethereum EIP ‘Increased Max Effective Balance (EIP-7251)’. We’ve carefully reviewed how this EIP will impact Rocket Pool overall and specifically if it affects our Megapool implementation. As part of this effort, we’ve provided feedback to Ethereum researchers on EIP-7251. Meanwhile, we’ve been refining our initial Megapool prototype to bring it up to production-ready standards.</p>\n<p><strong>v2 Smart Node</strong><br>\nA notable mention is the Smart Node Version 2, a ground-up redesign aimed at significantly improving performance, maintainability, interoperability, and the overall experience for node operators. The v2 beta testing phase is currently underway, with a formal release planned following the Houston launch.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any question or concerns.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q2-2024/3045\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q2-2024/3045","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Jun 2024 02:25:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-3045"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q2-2024/3045.rss","#text":"Protocol Development - Q2 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"Protocol Development - Q1 2024 Roadmap Update","dc:creator":"langers","category":"Governance","description":"<p>This is a repost of a Discord announcement made back in January - I am reposting it here for ongoing visibility.</p>\n<p>Original post: <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/channels/405159462932971535/405163979141545995/1199934472683008030\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Discord</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Hello everyone!</p>\n<p>The start of 2024 has been quite eventful.

Hello Rocket Poolers&nbsp;:) Today is our… | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium</a></p>\n<p><strong>Houston</strong><br>\nThe Houston upgrade is currently under audit. Our fantastic audit teams, Consensys Diligence and Sigma Prime have been working hard to break Houston. Those audits are now wrapping up. For Houston, we decided to include an additional audit team to give us flexibility and to get fresh eyes on the Rocket Pool codebase. ChainSafe has joined the audit line-up and are almost midway through their audit. As usual, all audit reports will be made publicly available before launch.</p>\n<p>In addition to audits, Houston is also being functionally tested (with the smartnode) on our private devnet. Once this process is complete and the audits are finalised, we will look to deploy Houston to the Holesky testnet so that everyone can give it a try!</p>\n<p><strong>RPIP-28 and RPIP-30</strong><br>\nThese RPIPs have been ratified by the pDAO for inclusion in the protocol. Kane has been working on the RPIP-30 changes so that they can be released in the next audit cycle. We would like to get Houston out the door and then we can lock in a release date.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RPIP-28 Deposit Under the Minimum - allows creating a new minipool even when under the minimum by supporting an atomic RPL stake and node deposit</li>\n<li>RPIP-30 RPL Staking Rework - aligns RPL reward spend with rETH capacity created.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Saturn</strong><br>\nThe Saturn upgrade is in the research and analysis phase. This is exciting because all options are on the table. A Rapid Research Incubation process has began (<a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-incubation-begins/2654\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Rapid Research Incubation Begins!</a>) to review the fantastic ideas submitted by the community. A big thank you to everyone that has submitted. The submissions are of a very high quality and we have no doubt that they will help inform the future of Rocket Pool.</p>\n<p>Once the incubation process has concluded we can start refining the ideas ready for design and implementation. Saturn has a long way to go but we are leveraging the collective knowledge and passion from this amazing community.</p>\n<p>We are looking forward to an exciting 2024.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q1-2024-roadmap-update/3044\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q1-2024-roadmap-update/3044","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Jun 2024 02:23:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-3044"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-q1-2024-roadmap-update/3044.rss","#text":"Protocol Development - Q1 2024 Roadmap Update"},"filter":false},{"title":"Bounties - June 2024","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Grants / Bounties","description":"<p>On April 24, the Rocket Pool protocol DAO passed <a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-39\">RPIP-39</a>, which allow the Grants Management Committee to pay out incentives to community members engaging with the bounty system. This breaks more complex bounties into three distinct parts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Bounty Proposal</strong><br>\nA high-level bounty idea that requires more work before it can be adopted by the GMC. The goal of the bounty proposal is to convince the GMC that this idea is worth the effort and funding to pursue. Proposal requirements are easy to meet to encourage community engagement. Bounty proposals are the ‘quick and dirty’ path for community members to suggest a bounty idea to the GMC.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounty Definition</strong><br>\nA detailed and well-defined bounty specification that can be adopted by the GMC. The goal of the bounty definition is to communicate the content and terms of the bounty to bounty hunters. Community members may provide a bounty definition alongside their bounty proposal, it may be created by the GMC, or submitted by a separate community member. Bounty definitions are the ‘tick all the boxes’ path for community members to get their bounty adopted by the GMC.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounty Support Contact</strong><br>\nAn individual who acts as a supporter and point of contact with bounty hunters for a given bounty. This may be the bounty proposal author, a member of the GMC, or another community member. The bounty support contact’s goal is to support and liaise with bounty hunters so that they are better able to deliver the work specified in the bounty definition. Bounty contacts are listed in bounty definitions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aside from the now streamlined proposal incentive, the GMC is now seeking assistance externally for bounty definitions and bounty supporters.</p>\n<p>On June 4, the GMC approved the following bounty incentives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proposal Incentive</strong> $50</li>\n<li><strong>Definition Incentive</strong> 2%, minimum $75</li>\n<li><strong>Support Incentive</strong> 2%, minimum $50</li>\n</ul>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>Currently the GMC is seeking a definition for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a

At the same time the classifications for critical bugs were changed (see <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231211081935/https://immunefi.com/bounty/rocketpool/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">cached bounty page</a>) and partially downgraded to high based on $-value.  In detail:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Used to be classified as critical ($500k bounty) and was changed to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Direct theft of any user funds (with value &gt; $250,000), whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Still critical ($500k bounty) and:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Direct theft of any user funds (with value &lt; $250,000), whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now high ($25k bounty)</p>\n<p>The same change was made for:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Permanent freezing of funds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My initial impression was that this is about reducing cost, given that the payout either remains the same or is reduced significantly, however langers assured me that this is not the case and the goal was to have more sensible payouts. To check sensibility, I had a quick look at some other staking protocol programs for comparison:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/staderforeth/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stader</a>: Linear scaling (10%) with $100k minimum and $1m maximum for theft or permanent freezing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/stakewise/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stakewise</a>: $200k fixed for loss of user funds, independent of $-impact</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/lido/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido</a>: Linear scaling (1%) for loss of user funds with $100k min and $2m maximum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is worth noting that the bug bounty is fully run by the team and not the pDAO. So these are just my two cents and not meant as a formal proposal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling payout with the potential impact is a fine thing to do, but I believe that a minimum payout of $25k for critical bugs as described here puts Rocket Pool in a comparatively bad position and I would like to see minimum increased significantly.</li>\n<li>Scaling can go both ways. Especially in the context of making a change from fixed to scaled, increasing payout for very high impact at the same time are better optics that make it clear what the change is about.</li>\n<li>Big payout jumps based on impact should be avoided, as they create perverse incentives for whitehats. Impact of a bug can fluctuate over time with ETH value, RPL value or factors like number of minipools in a certain state. Here, the payout would 20x if an impact goes from $240k to $260k, so there is a strong incentive for a potential whitehat to sit on a known issue until the treshold is met. Linear scaling doesn’t produce strong incentives to wait like that, because payouts are kept proportional to impact changes.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/immunefi-bug-bounty-changes/2987\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/immunefi-bug-bounty-changes/2987","pubDate":"Mon, 20 May 2024 11:54:00 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2987"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/immunefi-bug-bounty-changes/2987.rss","#text":"Immunefi Bug Bounty Changes"},"filter":false},{"title":"2024-05 IMC Members Selection","dc:creator":"Valdorff","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Hi All,</p>\n<p>We will be selecting nine IMC members (the full committee) for a 5/9 multisig out of a pool of 12 nominees.</p>\n<p>In order to help inform your choices, please refer to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IMC nominee statements in <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/2024-05-imc-nomination-thread/2959/18\">IMC Nomination Thread </a></li>\n<li>Supplementary hard metrics below</li>\n<li>You may also ask questions of nominees - I suggest doing that in this thread so others can benefit from the discussion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Per RPIP-10, we’re now ready to have the vote go up, and I will request it in the next few days.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For full voting process, see the “Management Committee Selection” section of <a href=\"https://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/blob/main/RPIPs/RPIP-10.md#management-committee-selection\">RPIP-10 </a>.</li>\n<li>Important note: vacancies that occur get filled by going down the list from previous selections.

I will purposely give a broad set here, without presenting my own opinion. For context, IMC’s current spend is ~$350k/period (periods are 28 days). It was somewhat higher when the RPL ratio was higher because we’ve been trying to run lean to preserve runway.
