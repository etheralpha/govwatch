Through NTT, Rocket Pool will be able improve cross-chain user experience, unlock additional growth opportunities, and reduce bridge liquidity cost. By integrating with NTT, the Rocket Pool DAO will future proof itself with cross-chain flexibility for rETH, gaining access to all current and future networks that Wormhole connects to.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-9822-what-is-wormhole-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9822-what-is-wormhole-2\"></a>What is Wormhole</h3>\n<p>Wormhole is an industry leading interoperability protocol that allows for message passing between blockchain networks. Since inception, Wormhole has processed over a billion messages, processing over $46B in total volume. Wormhole enables builders and protocols across the full-stack of interoperability. For example, Circle worked directly with Wormhole to design their Cross Chain Token Protocol, which Wormhole has supported over $500M in total volume on to date.</p>\n<p>Wormhole messaging protocol consists of both onchain and offchain components. These components help to verify and communicate messages across networks. To learn more about the general architecture please visit the wormhole website!</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-9822-guardians-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9822-guardians-3\"></a>Guardians</h3>\n<p>Wormhole relies upon a set of distributed nodes which monitor state on several blockchains. In Wormhole these nodes are referred to as Guardians. The current guardian set can be seen in the <a href=\"https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-dashboard/#/?endpoint=Mainnet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dashboard</a>.</p>\n<p>It is the guardians role to observe messages and sign the corresponding payloads. Each guardian performs this step in isolation, later combining the resulting signatures with other guardians as a final step. The resulting collection of independent observations form a multisig which represents a proof that a state has been observed and agreed upon by a majority of the wormhole network. These multisigs are referred to as VAAs in Wormhole.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-9822-decentralization-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9822-decentralization-4\"></a>Decentralization</h3>\n<p><em>Guardians</em></p>\n<p>Decentralization is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to interoperability. Previous interoperability solutions have largely been entirely centralized, and even newer solutions utilizing things like adversarial relayers still tend to have single points of failure or collusion thresholds as low as 1 or 2.</p>\n<p>Wormhole’s approach to message validation was to initially secure the network by involving robust companies which are heavily invested in the success of De-Fi as a whole, rather than securing the network with tokenomics. The 19 Guardians are not anonymous or small–they are many of the largest and most widely-known validator companies in cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Each Guardian has an equal stake and joined in a purpose-built Proof of Authority consensus mechanism. As threshold signatures become better supported, the Guardian set can expand, and once ZKPs are ubiquitous, the Guardian Network will become fully trustless.</p>\n<p><em>DAO</em></p>\n<p>Wormhole is committed to further decentralization through token governance of the protocol. In accordance with this stance, Wormhole is in the process of setting up DAO governance. The first step to this process has begun, where W token holders are able to stake and delegate their holdings to participate in governance.</p>\n<p>To help the structure and to legitimize the process, Wormhole is partnering with several entities known in the space for DAO governance such as GFXLabs, 404Gov, and L2BEAT.</p>\n<p>You can access the forum via adding ‘forum.’ to the official wormhole website address. (limited by Rocket Pool forum posting)</p>\n<p><em>Future State</em></p>\n<p>Wormhole’s ethos is aligned with Rocket Pool’s. Wormhole code is entirely open-source and primary services, such as NTT, are permissionless. Wormhole is thoroughly committed to pursuing continued decentralization, empowering token holders to help shape the future of the protocol.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-9822-external-assessment-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9822-external-assessment-5\"></a>External Assessment</h3>\n<p>A testament to the robust, trust-minimized design of Wormhole, Uniswap DAO chose Wormhole as the partner for executing the deployment of Uniswap v3 across L2 networks. The committee that assessed various bridge providers based on the following framework.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protocol Architecture Risk:</strong> Encompasses the risks stemming from the design of a protocol, including its primary validation mechanism and other architecturally significant components that impact the fundamental security properties, assumptions, and trust model associated with the protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Protocol Implementation Risk:</strong> Includes the risks associated with the implementation of a protocol’s specification. Building cross-chain protocols involves creating complex on-chain and off-chain components while accounting for the peculiarities and pitfalls of different programming languages, frameworks, and execution environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Protocol Operational Risk:</strong> Refers to the various risks that arise from the operational security and management of different components, often by different actors with different trust assumptions and incentives. This could include upgrading and managing bridge smart contracts, as well as operating off-chain systems such as external validator nodes.</li>\n<li><strong>Network Risks:</strong> Cross-chain protocols rely on certain assumptions about the safety and liveness guarantees of underlying networks. Consequently, these protocols have fundamental limitations in the guarantees they can offer. This category of risk encompasses how cross-chain protocols handle violations to these assumptions in any given network and mitigate the impact on other connected networks and application</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The full Uniswap DAO Bridge Assessment Report can be found <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/0c8477afadce425abac9c0bd175ca382?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-9822-native-token-transfer-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9822-native-token-transfer-6\"></a>Native Token Transfer</h3>\n<p>Wormhole’s Native Token Transfers (NTT) is an open source, flexible, and composable framework for transferring tokens across blockchains. Integrators have full control over how their tokens that use NTT behave on each chain, including the token standard, metadata, ownership, upgradeability, and custom features.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d80839599b19575b242c29ab458d05e93832bb16.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/d80839599b19575b242c29ab458d05e93832bb16\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 4.46.21 AM\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d80839599b19575b242c29ab458d05e93832bb16_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 4.46.21 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"uP6KItBTCZcgX0RLhZGjBM7ArQ2\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d80839599b19575b242c29ab458d05e93832bb16_2_690x388.jpeg, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d80839599b19575b242c29ab458d05e93832bb16_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d80839599b19575b242c29ab458d05e93832bb16_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"080808\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-9822-current-reth-landscape-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9822-current-reth-landscape-7\"></a>Current rETH Landscape</h3>\n<p>rETH is currently live on Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and Polygon outside of mainnet. Rocket Pool had previously assessed interoperability providers and ended up deciding on just leveraging canonical bridges for L2 deployments. Outside of canonical bridges, Rocket Pool is currently funding liquidity pools for Optimism and Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>rETH’s presence on Layer 2’s varies. As seen in the Layer 2 vibe check forum post, participants in Rocket Pool governance have a divided view of value for each chain. Protocols such as Aave and Eigenlayer have created strong demand for rETH. It is expected that with the advent of any-asset restaking and new protocols with fresh token supplies, rETH will have a source of demand. Proliferating rETH into ecosystems such as Scroll, Linea, Monad, and other upcoming chains in combination with tapping into the aforementioned protocols will amplify rETH’s growth in DeFi.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-9822-benefits-of-an-ntt-integration-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9822-benefits-of-an-ntt-integration-8\"></a>Benefits of an NTT Integration</h3>\n<p>The Ethereum Foundation has made the roadmap for Ethereum roll-up centric. Also, with the advent of companies such as Conduit, it has never been easier to launch a new network. It is simply not feasible for Rocket Pool DAO to decide which L2 to focus their efforts on nor assess each bridge. Wormhole can reduce the overhead on the Rocket Pool DAO by enabling the launch of rETH with minimal effort. With NTT, the Rocket Pool DAO can seamless launch rETH across these chains with minimal effort and gain access to key ecosystems and protocols that will want a battle tested asset such as rETH. Lastly, Wormhole can help with growth efforts such as co-marketing, go-to-market strategies, day-1 bridging into upcoming chains, and more.</p>\n<p>Key Benefits</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Unified User Experience:</em> Tokens retain their properties on each chain, remaining completely fungible and ensuring a consistent user experience.</li>\n<li><em>No Liquidity Pools:</em> Transfer tokens without the need for liquidity pools, avoiding fees, slippage, and MEV risk.</li>\n<li><em>Integrator Flexibility:</em> Retained ownership, upgrade authority, and complete customizability over token contracts.</li>\n<li><em>Advanced Rate Limiting:</em> Inbound and outbound rate limits are configurable per chain and over arbitrary time periods, preventing abuse while managing network congestion and allowing for controlled deployments to new chains.</li>\n<li><em>Global Accountant:</em> Ensures accounting integrity across chains by checking that the number of tokens burned and transferred out of a chain never exceeds the number of tokens minted.</li>\n<li><em>Access Control:</em> To prevent unauthorized calls to administrative functions, protocols can choose to assign certain functions, such as the pauser role, to a separate address from the owner.</li>\n<li><em>Maximum Composability:</em> Open-source and extensible for widespread adoption and integration with other protocols.</li>\n<li><em>Custom Attestation:</em> Optionally add external verifiers and configure custom message attestation thresholds.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/reth-ntt-vibe-check/3298\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/reth-ntt-vibe-check/3298","pubDate":"Thu, 26 Sep 2024 09:51:46 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-3298"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/reth-ntt-vibe-check/3298.rss","#text":"rETH NTT Vibe Check"},"filter":false},{"title":"pDAO 2024/08/29-2024/09/26 Treasury Report","dc:creator":"vacalaranja","category":"Governance","description":"<h4><a name=\"p-9811-hello-rocket-pool-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9811-hello-rocket-pool-1\"></a>Hello, Rocket Pool!</h4>\n<p>If you need an intro to how pDAO treasury works, check <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/pdao-2022-9-29-2022-12-22-treasury-report/1314/1\">(this post)</a>.</p>\n<p>This period the pDAO reserve received 6,493.32 RPL from inflation, its balance is now 85,666.40 RPL.

Objectives and Goals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Objectives:\n<ul>\n<li>Launch a website (rocketsplit.xyz) where users can custom-configure and deploy a smart contract (a Rocket Split) that can become a Rocket Pool node’svalidator’s withdrawal address. A Rocket Split will share validator rewards as configured between a maximum of two parties (typically an ETH contributor and an RPL contributor).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Final Outcomes:\n<ul>\n<li>Rocket Split does not have an audit but remains available for use in production.</li>\n<li>Rocket Pool has released the Houston upgrade in June 2024, enabling TWO potential withdrawal addresses, an ETH withdrawal address and an RPL withdrawal address. Rocket Split is designed to work with RPL withdrawal address NOT SET. Website will provide alerts if it recognizes the RPL address set.</li>\n<li>Version 1 deployed December 2023 and a Rocket SplitRocketsplit was used in Main net Ethereum (now exited)</li>\n<li>Version 2 is available for use. There are interested parties but no new Rocket Splits yet created.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-9619-h-3-successes-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9619-h-3-successes-3\"></a>3.

Challenges and Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Major Challenges:\n<ul>\n<li>Funding:\n<ul>\n<li>Difficulty in estimating cost and value: Rocket Split has taken 100s of hours for development, testing, and governance management over the course of 15+ months. If grants are designed to cover a market value, the grant would have cost multiples higher. Contributions from the teams were more altruistic in nature.</li>\n<li>Early-stage decentralized governance: This feature request Grant was denied 3 times. Two times on the initial submission and once for an audit. Full payment not yet received</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Testing:\n<ul>\n<li>Challenging test environment. To test, users need to have an active validator on the Holesky testnet, registered with the Rocket Pool protocol. Users could then either act as both the ETH contributor &amp; the RPL contributor, or find a partner tester.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Changing technical landscape\n<ul>\n<li>The Rocket Pool Houston upgrade introduced an additional withdrawal address, the RPL withdrawal address. This was a fundamental change to how Rocket Split was designed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-9619-h-5-lessons-learned-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9619-h-5-lessons-learned-5\"></a>5. Lessons Learned</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Technical Lessons:\n<ul>\n<li>Nick: From a front end perspective I think taking more time up front to identify all the user personas and respected workflows would have served us better. We originally tried to build the UI off an initial prototype that was pure HTML/JS. This became unwieldy as we were managing different user perspectives and respected workflows of which could be in different states at any given time. We switched gears to using React and the wagmi library. This allowed for improved isolation of concerns within the app. This also allowed for core functionality to work more reliably (ex. Basic wallet connections). During this process much of my time was spent developing hooks into Rocketpools core protocol smart contracts along with Rocket Split. As a result we did not spend as much time as we would have liked on core UX. The result is a working system but in my opinion one that can be greatly improved with improvements in design. Of course time and budget constraints play a role here. If this project does prove to be a valuable component in the RP toolset I would recommend we iterate on this a bit.</li>\n<li>Ramana: The bug that meant exiting the first live validator was not a straightforward process could have been caught with more thorough testing of all pathways through Rocket Split. Our test suite did not have complete coverage of even all the typical uses of Rocket Split. I’m not sure if this is a lesson learned, though, since I know it is possible to miss issues without thorough testing: it’s more a question of us not having time/capacity/budget available for filling out the test suite (let alone an external audit). Perhaps there is a lesson to be gleaned here in what to prioritize under a very limited budget?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Decentralized Governance Community Roles:\n<ul>\n<li>A GMC Admin position was approved in 1H 2023 to be the primary liaison for active projects. If this role were approved prior to the Rocket Split grant approval, there could have been several pitfalls avoided.\n<ul>\n<li>Grant denial <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> (April 2023) was a result of needing to incorporate “Mentors requirements”. Those requirements however were not well understood or documented.</li>\n<li>Grant denial <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span> (July 2023) was a result of a misunderstanding from the GMC team of Rocket Split functionality. GMC team believed Rocket Split was redundant to the Rocket Pool protocol development already underway. It was appealed by Knoshua on the grounds that “the team is not working on things that would make Rocket Split obsolete. It is different than Nodeset”. The grant was approved after a unanimous (30-0) vote to appeal its rejection.</li>\n<li>Grant denial <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span> (January 2024) was a denial of the audit costs. The lesson learned here is that any project that acts as the withdrawal address of a Rocket Pool node, should be expected to have an audit. Clear expectations at the onset will have set the project for greater success.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Team Dynamics:\n<ul>\n<li>Conventional github development operations. Discussions of when to merge or critical needs took place in Discord channels.</li>\n<li>Asynchronous coordination across multiple time zones. Nick’s late night development cycles flowed smoothly into updates for Ramana as he woke up the following day to continue iterating forward.</li>\n<li>An additional front-end developer for future projects would be ideal. Nick and Ramana share similar skillsets. Ramana is brilliant at identifying custom paths to deliver intended functionality. Nick is fantastic at identifying the unique code and proposing structure and optimizations. Taking more time up front designing and prototyping front end workflows would have benefited the UX.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-9619-h-6-conclusion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#p-9619-h-6-conclusion-6\"></a>6. Conclusion</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Summary of Findings:\n<ul>\n<li>Although not audited, there are production users clearly showing a demand for Splitter / “Marriage” functionality</li>\n<li>Rocket Pool Houston upgrade added a new primitive with the RPL withdrawal address separate from the ETH withdrawal address. This does not have any configuration management for the “Marriage”. ETH will go to ETH withdrawal address, RPL will go to RPL withdrawal address. Rocket Split application is designed to operate with RPL withdrawal NOT SET.</li>\n<li>Rocket Split is limited to only 2 partners in a contract. An improved version of Rocket Split that enabled multiple parties in an agreement, each with a custom configuration of rewards, may find better product market fit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/post-mortem-rocket-split-grant/3203\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/post-mortem-rocket-split-grant/3203","pubDate":"Thu, 22 Aug 2024 10:59:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-3203"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/post-mortem-rocket-split-grant/3203.rss","#text":"Post Mortem - Rocket Split Grant"},"filter":false},{"title":"Protocol Development - Roadmap Prioritisation","dc:creator":"langers","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n<p>As per RPIP-37 Protocol Development (<a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-37\" class=\"inline-onebox\">RPIP-37: Protocol Development</a>), the core protocol team will facilitate a prioritisation discussion with the Rocket Pool community.</p>\n<p>With the following RPIPs’ imminent ratification there is a significant amount of work ahead of us.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RPIP-49 Tokenomics Rework\n<ul>\n<li>RPIP-42 Bond Curves</li>\n<li>RPIP-43 Megapools</li>\n<li>RPIP-44 Integrating Execution Layer Triggerable Exits</li>\n<li>RPIP-46 Universal Adjustable Revenue Split</li>\n<li>RPIP-47 Enable Forced Delegate Update</li>\n<li>RPIP-59 Deposit Mechanics</li>\n<li>RPIP-60 Protocol Upgrade Guardrails</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>RPIP-57 Node Distributor User Fund Unbundling</li>\n<li>RPIP-58 MEV Penalty Guardrail</li>\n<li>RPIP-61 Balance Submission Guardrail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These RPIPs and prioritisation generally can be organised around particular themes to help guide what we want to achieve and identify any gaps.

Additionally, a bug bounty was raised, assessed, and it was decided to incorporate a fix into the Houston release.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Houston smart contracts were deployed and verified by the community. Once the ODAO had voted and executed the upgrade proposal, Houston was ready for launch (<a href=\"https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-houston-launch-b056ca1a6c10\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Rocket Pool — Houston Launch. Hello Rocket Poolers! | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium</a>). Houston went live on the 17th June.</p>\n<p>Post Houston launch, the core team had to combine Snapshot and the on-chain voting system to ensure we have a unified governance system. This was a little more involved than we expected, mainly due to Snapshot not having a Holesky deployment, so we were unable to develop or test anything up front. The team successfully integrated Snapshot and the on-chain voting system. Additionally, significant changes needed to be made to the Delegates’ website (<a href=\"https://delegates.rocketpool.net/\">https://delegates.rocketpool.net/</a>) to align it with the new voting system and support current delegates.</p>\n<p>Since launch, the core team have been monitoring the Protocol DAO voting initialisation. Currently the Protocol DAO on-chain voting element is disabled until enough vote power is initialised. We are now have enough vote power to enable the system but please see the Houston Hotfix section below.</p>\n<p>To summarise the current status of governance voting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snapshot will still be used for most governance votes - because it is gas-free.</li>\n<li>The on-chain system will be used when protocol settings or protocol treasury spends are necessary</li>\n<li>Snapshot is integrated into the new voting system so we have a unified governance system - essentially vote power is consistent</li>\n<li>The on-chain system is disabled for now until the Houston hotfix goes live</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information please take a look at the Protocol DAO Governance medium article:</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-protocol-dao-governance-a3c3e92904e0\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e104963df516c38fd2365d242e30375b15c0f91e.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"3B3B3B\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-protocol-dao-governance-a3c3e92904e0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"01:20AM - 08 July 2024\">Medium – 8 Jul 24</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/388;\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f8747e588d2a3276da4ea5c2267113e6293cb576_2_690x388.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"FD9A78\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-protocol-dao-governance-a3c3e92904e0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rocket Pool — Protocol DAO Governance</a></h3>\n\n  <p>At Rocket Pool’s heart is a vibrant community of node operators from across the globe, that care deeply for Ethereum and staking.

A bug introduced with Houston corrupted state when exiting minipools if the node operator had not initialised voting. We announced a smart node release to prevent node operators from experiencing the issue but ultimately a smart contract fix is required.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we have had some interesting Immunefi bug bounties raised about the on-chain voting system. The first was a medium severity protocol griefing vector that did not effect funds but would allow someone to withdraw their RPL collateral when they are not supposed to. Another excellent submission, allowed a challenger to steal a proposer’s bond - the impact was limited but clearly it was a good find. We have developed fixes for these bug bounty submissions.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there were small non-functional changes that we wanted to include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the way a vetod proposer’s bond is burnt - instead of sending to burn address it uses RPL’s burn feature</li>\n<li>Fixed possible error situation if RPL bond amount is set to 0</li>\n<li>Event naming consistency</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, we have been paying attention to the discussions around an interim release before Saturn that would launch ETH-only minipools earlier. One issue with the potential interim release is the scrub check RPL penalty. The penalty is important for security reasons but cannot be enforced if there is no RPL bond. So included in the hotfix is a change to make this an ETH penalty rather than an RPL penalty. We are in discussion about how this is processed through governance.</p>\n<p><strong>RPIP-28 and RPIP-30</strong></p>\n<p>As per RPIP-30, we reduced the RPL withdrawal limit to 60% of node’s bonded ETH.</p>\n<p>RPIP-28 - Implementation needs to be discussed. Depending on the result of the RPIP-49 vote it is not currently in that scope afaik.<br>\nRPIP-30 - Depending on the result of RPIP-49 (which looks certain), RPIP-30 is included in the rework scope so will be included in Saturn.</p>\n<p><strong>Saturn</strong></p>\n<p>Over the last few months, the core team have engaged in discussions on the reworked tokenomics proposal. As the scope has formalised the team have provided feedback, feasibility advice, and conducted multiple full day internal workshops to break down the components.</p>\n<p>The core team have also engaged in discussion on alternative proposals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/1kx-tokenomics-proposal/3119\" class=\"inline-onebox\">1kx Tokenomics Proposal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/an-alternative-and-simple-tokenomics-proposal/3130\" class=\"inline-onebox\">An Alternative (and simple) Tokenomics Proposal</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The core team have kicked off development of the least contested elements of Saturn, namely Megapools. As soon as the RPIP-49 vote is ratified we will continue to break the components down, determine delivery order, and plan key milestones.</p>\n<p>The core team have also been engaged in conversation about the possible interim release that would deliver ETH-only minipools sooner.</p>\n<p><strong>v2 Smart Node</strong></p>\n<p>The smart node devs have been hard at work bringing the v2 Smart Node release up to feature parity with v1. The v2 release now has all new Houston features and continues to be beta tested. We have started the process of feature freezing v1 and will start the transition to v2.</p>\n<p><strong>Node Manager Website</strong></p>\n<p>We have been working on a new user experience for node operators. The node manager website be separate to the staking website and be a consolidated place for managing your node. The new node manager website is very close to launch so look out for that.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any questions!</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-may-june-july-roadmap-update/3197\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-may-june-july-roadmap-update/3197","pubDate":"Tue, 20 Aug 2024 01:45:40 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-3197"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/protocol-development-may-june-july-roadmap-update/3197.rss","#text":"Protocol Development - May, June July Roadmap Update"},"filter":false},{"title":"bloXroute Validator Gateway","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Integration","description":"<p>The GMC recently met with <a href=\"https://bloxroute.com/\">bloXroute</a> to learn about their Validator Gateway product, which has the potential to enhance effectiveness across Rocket Pool validators.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the proposal:</p>\n<p><strong>Vault Setup</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ownership: Establish a new vault owned and controlled by Rocket Pool DAO.</li>\n<li>Access: The vault is accessible only to a single whitelisted address, ensuring security and controlled access. It will not be a public vault.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Program Operations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue Flow: Protocol revenues will be directed into the Enzyme vault in accordance with Rocket Pool’s tokenomics design.</li>\n<li>Allocation: Funds in the vault will be allocated based on the chosen strategy (buyback and liquidity provision, or buyback and burn).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Automation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deposit Handling: Upon receiving deposits, the vault will trigger custom automation scripts:</li>\n<li>RPL Purchase: Acquire RPL on the open market via DEX/DEX aggregators like 1inch, Paraswap, Uniswap, etc.</li>\n<li>Liquidity Provision: Allocate a % of RPL to provide liquidity on platforms like Curve, Balancer, Uni v3, etc.</li>\n<li>RPL Burn: Send a specified percentage of RPL to a burn address to reduce supply.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Security and Verification</strong></p>\n<p>Security is a top priority for Enzyme. Here are some key considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Time-Testing: The protocol has been live on mainnet for about 6 years, demonstrating stability and reliability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Audits: Every adapter/integration is audited by Chain Security, one of the top security firms in the space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bug Bounty: Enzyme has a large bug bounty program on Immunefi, incentivizing the discovery and resolution of potential vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Protocol Upgrades: Enzyme does not force users to upgrade to a new version. Vault owners can review upgrade features and decide not to opt-in to new protocol versions, ensuring control over their operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automations: Use the OpenZeppelin stack for secure and verifiable automation, ensuring no additional trust assumptions are necessary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Regulatory Risk Mitigation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Systematic Automation: By implementing a systematic and automated buyback, Rocket Pool can reduce regulatory risks that may be associated with a discretionary manual process. This ensures that buyback operations are consistent, transparent, and compliant with evolving regulatory standards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Alignment with Tokenomics Rework</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outsourcing RPL Management: This approach is in line with the overall philosophy of the tokenomics rework, which aims to keep the core functions within the Rocket Pool protocol (such as the bonding curve) while outsourcing the management and infrastructure of the RPL token. This strategy creates operational efficiency and allows the Rocket Pool dev team to focus on core protocol development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>White Labelling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Customization: The vault can be white-labelled and accessible via a custom URL, e.g. https: //rocketpool . net / buyback</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Visibility: This enhances transparency and allows the community to track buyback operations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Terms: a unique fee structure can be discussed to ensure a mutually beneficial arrangement for both Rocket Pool and Enzyme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Implementing the RPL Buyback program using an Enzyme vault can be a strategic move that offers automation, security, and transparency. It supports Rocket Pool’s decentralised governance model, mitigates regulatory risks, and requires minimal effort from the Rocket Pool team, allowing you to focus on core development activities. We believe this proposal aligns with the long-term vision of Rocket Pool and enhances its operational efficiency.</p>\n<p>We are excited to hear your feedback and remain available for questions.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rfc-implement-rpl-buyback-using-dao-owned-enzyme-vault/3177\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rfc-implement-rpl-buyback-using-dao-owned-enzyme-vault/3177","pubDate":"Wed, 07 Aug 2024 15:28:18 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-3177"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rfc-implement-rpl-buyback-using-dao-owned-enzyme-vault/3177.rss","#text":"RFC: Implement RPL Buyback Using DAO-owned Enzyme Vault"},"filter":true},{"title":"A poll for node operators to gauge sentiment","dc:creator":"NeverAnIsland","category":"Node Operator Experience","description":"<p>This poll is for node operators and is <em>anonymous</em>.</p>\n<p>At the moment several community members are working on enabling ETH only LEB8 minipools accessible to everyone long ahead of Saturn (next RP release with new tokenomics).
