The marketing has funded YouTube videos such as Rocket Fuel and The Weekly Orbit. The GMC has also invested in educational initiatives such as Rocket School and Rocket Pool University.</p>\n<p>Development - The development category finances projects that have either directly contributed to Rocket Pool Core or have provided valuable tools for the community. Subcategories include community resources, development features, and documentation. Funded development projects include the Rescue Node, RocketScan, Rocket Watch, and others.</p>\n<p>Governance - The governance category includes work on creating RPIPs, conducting protocol research, and producing in-depth papers. Subcategories encompass research, research papers, and governance. Examples include GovAlpha’s efforts in organizing and documenting the Rocket Pool governance process, as well as Valdorff’s administrative management of the Incentives Management Committee, facilitating RPIP-30 and other governance contributions.</p>\n<p>Support - Support primarily involves contributions within the Rocket Pool Discord’s support channel. Some notable support recipients include Patches, [object Object], 0xFornax, haloooloolo, and poupas.</p>\n<p>Public Goods - These are projects that support the greater good of Ethereum. Some examples of these projects include solo support for the Rescue Node and a trustless oracle by DendrETH.</p>\n<p><strong>Allocation History</strong><br>\nThe GMC’s latest report, available <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net\">here</a>, indicates that the first year of funding was well-distributed across different categories.</p>\n<p><strong>Breakdown</strong><br>\nMarketing - 30.7%<br>\nDevelopment - 29.6%<br>\nGovernance - 24.0%<br>\nSupport - 10.4%<br>\nPublic Goods - 5.2%</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/4/40decd4e95466f7449f315432fe8778acf86e7df.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/40decd4e95466f7449f315432fe8778acf86e7df\" title=\"Screen Shot 2024-04-16 at 1.34.06 PM\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/40decd4e95466f7449f315432fe8778acf86e7df_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2024-04-16 at 1.34.06 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"9fRUmLV6KmSfLQjRWrQ3hzj0BIj\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/40decd4e95466f7449f315432fe8778acf86e7df_2_690x388.jpeg, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/40decd4e95466f7449f315432fe8778acf86e7df_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/40decd4e95466f7449f315432fe8778acf86e7df_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEE8E3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-budgeting-allocations/2933/1\">Click to view the poll.</a></p>\n<p>Please share your thoughts and suggestions below on areas where you would like to see the GMC allocate more funding.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-budgeting-allocations/2933\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-budgeting-allocations/2933","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 20:57:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2933"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-budgeting-allocations/2933.rss","#text":"GMC Budgeting Allocations"},"filter":false},{"title":"Rewards Tree Spec v9","dc:creator":"Patches","category":"Governance","description":"<p>I’d like to kick off discussion on Rewards Tree Spec v9.

In earlier experiments I’ve done, binary formats had roughly the same file size as compressed json, or even smaller, which make them a good option. In keeping with ethereum practices, <code>ssz</code> seems like the obvious format choice.</p>\n<p>The process, then, would become:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Serialize the merkle tree ssz file with the same name as the rest of the oDAO</li>\n<li>Compute the CID</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Minipool performance files are not mission-critical and will still be made available, but not necessarily on IPFS.</p>\n<p>Additional tooling will be published to convert ssz trees back into json, and json trees will still be usable to claim rewards.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"process-changes-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#process-changes-2\"></a>Process Changes</h1>\n<p>From v9 and onward, tree specifications, both for the generation of the tree, and the format, name, and ipfs tree of the resulting artifacts will be written as RPIPs.</p>\n<p>Process note: Past rewards tree versions have required a sentiment vote and (somewhat inconsistently) a full pDAO vote to ratify them. Since part of this proposal is to begin codifying the rewards tree specs with RPIPs, I think we should just do a single poll for the RPIP itself, when ready.</p>\n<p>I’m writing this thread now to kick off discussion.

Earlier this year, we <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/completion-of-user-research-report-how-node-operator-experience-insights-can-help-rocket-pool-continue-to-enhance-the-security-of-ethereum/2615/3\">published the full insights including recommendations</a>, produced an explainer video, spoke on a Twitter space to explain the findings, and hosted an AMA with the GMC to discuss possible solutions to put into action.</p>\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/september-1-9-2023-gmc-call-for-grant-applications-deadline-is-september-9/2156/2\">original proposal</a>, we requested a budget of $50,000 to conduct the work, but agreed to deliver it at a reduced rate in order to prove the value to the GMC and wider community, with the option to request retrospective funding later. We agreed to execute the research study for $33,300 including research participant incentives. We now wish to make a request for retrospective funding of $16,700 to bring us up to the original cost for the work.</p>\n<p>Our goal for the research was to improve the experience of node operators, increase the number of people becoming node operators, and therefore increase the security of Ethereum overall. These are bold but achievable end results, however just having the research findings is not enough to make that so; the end users of our research (Rocket Pool core team, GMC and wider community) must be able to adequately action the findings. And due to the nature of user research in large distributed organizations like Rocket Pool, it can time for findings to turn into action, and results.</p>\n<p>As a measure to evidence the effectiveness of our research, we anonymously surveyed GMC recipients to collect feedback on the research. Three people filled out the survey. Specific feedback we received from members of the GMC and community included:</p>\n<p><em>“Very high quality work. In terms of ‘value adding’ to the community, high marks, though in some cases technical realities diminish the low hang of the low hanging fruit.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“This was a positive experience with OpenUX. It will be interesting to see how many of the suggestions can be actioned by the pDAO or GMC.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Very professional and helpful report. The actionable stuff might take some time to massage into something that works for us, but that is not a knock to OpenUX.”</em></p>\n<p>We asked our work to be scored and received the following scoring on 3 measurements: the deliverables being high quality, value-adding, and enabling for the Rocket Pool team.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a9a2a4c5ba15e82b46f1dc4a1a6319145804d989.png\" data-download-href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/a9a2a4c5ba15e82b46f1dc4a1a6319145804d989\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 19.23.38\"><img src=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a9a2a4c5ba15e82b46f1dc4a1a6319145804d989_2_690x222.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 19.23.38\" data-base62-sha1=\"ocF9Brt70jcQDkWL13L4wXxua2B\" width=\"690\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a9a2a4c5ba15e82b46f1dc4a1a6319145804d989_2_690x222.png, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a9a2a4c5ba15e82b46f1dc4a1a6319145804d989_2_1035x333.png 1.5x, https://dao.rocketpool.net/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a9a2a4c5ba15e82b46f1dc4a1a6319145804d989_2_1380x444.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF0EA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Feedback was overall positive.

Additionally, we consider how the current indirect model compares to the proposed direct revenue approach. Next, we analyze the proposed tokenomics rework and assess the risks associated with each component individually and in totality. Lastly, we evaluate the impact of these proposed changes on NodeSet’s work before suggesting an alternative proposal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>The current tokenomics proposal that has received the most attention fundamentally changes the relationship between RPL and the protocol and, therefore, the relationships between stakeholders in the system. Our findings indicate that the proposed new dynamics may be less healthy than existing dynamics because they create a financialized shareholder class that is economically incentivized to exploit the other actors (NOs, rETH holders) who make the system run, necessarily changing the makeup of these groups over time. In turn, this is likely to eventually lead to systemic instability and a transformation of RP into a protocol dominated by ungovernable large actors.</p>\n<p>While RPL exists today as a utility token with an indirect revenue model fundamentally tied to node operation, the new proposals shift it towards an asset that can be priced more concretely by the market through ETH revenue accrual, opening it to increased levels of speculator ownership rather than participant ownership. Although this may make RPL more attractive to some, it does so by taking value from existing and future NOs, and for many scenarios, there is little change in terminal valuation versus existing tokenomics. Potential mitigations are suggested to prevent the optimization of the RPL/ETH ratio from overshadowing these and other serious risks associated with the proposed tokenomics changes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, these changes would significantly impact NodeSet’s ability to grow Rocket Pool with Constellation. Altering tokenomics after the upcoming release of Constellation might, at worst, prevent its operation. At best, these changes would reduce its positive impact and delay future development to focus on complying with new changes to RP. Therefore, we suggest a different path.</p>\n            <p><small>23 posts - 12 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/nodeset-review-of-rpl-tokenomics/2869\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/nodeset-review-of-rpl-tokenomics/2869","pubDate":"Tue, 26 Mar 2024 19:32:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2869"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/nodeset-review-of-rpl-tokenomics/2869.rss","#text":"NodeSet Review of RPL Tokenomics"},"filter":false},{"title":"Adjust terminal user interface size to make it suitable for smartphones","dc:creator":"Dinolawer","category":"Node Operator Experience","description":"<p>This is a rather simple and small request but that would enable safer and easier remote acces.</p>\n<p>I used to be able to open the TUI (terminal user interface) on my phone, but this functionality has been gone since some time.

Within this time frame, we welcome submissions from any number of teams or individuals who are prepared to present an MVP focused on SSV integration. We encourage early submissions to foster a collaborative environment. As soon as we receive the first qualifying MVP submission, a subsequent period of two weeks will commence, during which other participants can still submit their versions of the MVP for consideration. Following this two-week window, one team will be selected and awarded one-third of the total bounty prize. This chosen team will then have the exclusive option to undertake the complete project, thereby claiming the remaining portion of the bounty. This approach ensures a competitive yet collaborative atmosphere, driving innovation while maintaining a focus on delivering a high-quality, functional integration of SSV with Rocket Pool.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does the community see this approach as feasible, or are there any suggestions to make this process more efficient?</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858","pubDate":"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:41:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2858"},"source":{"@url":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/ssv-integration/2858.rss","#text":"SSV Integration"},"filter":false},{"title":"Grant Idea - Rocket Pool Summit Program","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","category":"Grants / Bounties","description":"<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>Create a budget for Rocket Pool meetup events where community members can meet in approved locations (cities) twice a year, and be reimbursed up to a certain amount for their expenses.</p>\n<p>Right now ETH Denver is the primary event for the Rocket Pool community.

In the year since the last selection, we’ve lost some people and some folks are dragging. Good reviewing without nagging would be great in and of itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review + sign: 2 hours every fortnight (2 weeks; we tend to do most of our work in fortnightly batches)\n<ul>\n<li>You can see this work in the <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/405159462932971535/1020537769635872808\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">IMC execute thread</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Discuss strategy: 1-2 hours a week\n<ul>\n<li>This happens on the IMC discord. It covers things like “what L2s should we support”, “how comfortable are we feeling with our runway”, “what concentrated range should we use for our next protocol-owned liquidity”, etc. Often, discussions end in little votes with thumbs up/down or selecting a preference out of a small number of choices.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"beyond-the-baseline-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#beyond-the-baseline-2\"></a>Beyond the baseline</h2>\n<p>Not everyone needs to be doing these things. Of course, “many hands make light work,” so having more folks doing these things would be fabulous. If any of this sounds cool… <em>please</em> come join us.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Partner communication:</strong> in the last 2 weeks I’ve been in touch with 9 partners about something. Sometimes it’s coincentives, sometimes it’s an execution detail, sometimes they’re asking us to try something, sometimes we want to change something in a deployment… it varies a fair amount. This is usually a trickle, but it can ocassionally come in a bunch. It can also sometimes pack some urgency behind it, though we try to avoid that.</li>\n<li><strong>Researching new protocols:</strong> when we want to use a new protocol, we need to learn about it. This includes reading up on their audits, understanding how long they’ve been deployed, understanding who has what administrative powers (which might also entail understanding multisigs or governance), etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Figuring out new transactions:</strong> After we understand a protocol at a high level, we need to understand how to interact with them effectively. This involves documentation, finding on-chain exemplar transactions, and sometimes talking with the protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Budget planning:</strong> this part of <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/imcsheet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">spreadsheeting</a> takes the IMC’s decisions and reduces them to line items. We’ll spend x ETH worth of RPL on blah.</li>\n<li>Building transactions: this is actually putting together the transactions that execute on the budget plan. Usually, we have a very similar set of transactions to build from. This involves carefully checking all addresses, hashes, amounts, etc. This is like the “Review” step, but with a lot more open space to make a mistake. Ofc, you have the safety net of the reviewers.</li>\n<li><strong>Accounting:</strong> this part of <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/imcsheet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">spreadsheeting</a> takes completed transactions and tracks them on the spreadsheet with info that anyone can follow easily to find any transaction if they wish to. It also involves cross-checking totals with reality and tracking down any discrepancies.</li>\n<li><strong>Posting on forums:</strong> the IMC treasurer (currently Val) has a duty to post prospective plans and retrospective reports.

This intuitively includes Rocket Pool validators which are the beacon of decentralization for Ethereum. Restaking with Restaking Cloud will increase rewards for Rocket Pool node operators while not increasing the risk to the underlying principle of the validator.</p>\n<p>There has been considerable outreach from Rocket Pool node operators to the Restaking Cloud team for guidance. This is not something that Restaking Cloud can decide. Due to Restaking Cloud’s compatibility with all validators, nothing is preventing Rocket Pool Node Operators from joining Restaking Cloud today beyond social consensus.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-links-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#key-links-2\"></a>Key Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Native Delegation Tutorial: <a href=\"https://docs.restaking.cloud/middleware/tutorials/install-native-delegation\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Restaking Cloud Docs</a></li>\n<li>Restaking Cloud Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RestakingCloud\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/RestakingCloud</a></li>\n<li>Restaking Cloud Website: <a href=\"https://restaking.cloud/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://restaking.cloud/</a></li>\n<li>Restaking Cloud Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChMmJvszkVzA0vhipvU29Rg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChMmJvszkVzA0vhipvU29Rg</a></li>\n<li>Restaking Cloud Blog: <a href=\"https://blog.restaking.cloud/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://blog.restaking.cloud/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#abstract-3\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This proposal will outline methods and solutions to enable Rocket Pool stakers to restake with Restaking Cloud. There are a couple of solutions, and none will hinder Rocket Pool’s node operators’ autonomy. In Restaking Cloud, rewards are distributed via points as well as kETH (always redeemable for ETH) and other tokens. All of these are ERC20. Because Rocket Pool does not accept ERC20, a DAO consensus is required.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"relevant-restaking-cloud-info-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#relevant-restaking-cloud-info-4\"></a>Relevant Restaking Cloud Info</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>rETH holders can restake their tokens once the LST route becomes available. This post will focus on node operators and RPL holders.</li>\n<li>Restaking Cloud has two protocols K2 and Node Cloud.</li>\n<li>Restaking Cloud has its own K2 payout address.</li>\n<li>To restake, RP operators need to run a lightweight sidecar on their node called MEV Plus with a module called Native Delegation. It takes 10-20 minutes.</li>\n<li>Restaking Cloud is built for compatibility with all Ethereum validators and node operations including Rocket Pool.</li>\n<li>The principal stake of validators is protected in Restaking Cloud via K2 Protocol’s automated stake management for availed restaking markets.</li>\n<li>K2 Protocol is the default route for restaking ETH in Restaking Cloud.</li>\n<li>K2 does not require any additional software because not all networks that require restaked ETH security require a node operator. Node operators are still compensated for providing their ETH at stake.</li>\n<li>Networks that require node operators can use Node Cloud (another protocol within Restaking Cloud). All restaked services and node operations in Node Cloud are actively tracked and reported using a proprietary ZK gadget.</li>\n<li>Restaking Cloud’s K2 Protocol is in a Private Mainnet and Node Cloud is in a private testnet. Both protocols are built and functional.</li>\n<li>Find an FAQ on Restaking Cloud risks here: <a href=\"https://blog.restaking.cloud/the-risks-of-restaking-faq-22a6d8121fed\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://blog.restaking.cloud/the-risks-of-restaking-faq-22a6d8121fed</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"benefits-for-rocket-pool-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#benefits-for-rocket-pool-5\"></a>Benefits for Rocket Pool</h2>\n<p>Restaking Cloud’s K2 protocol tracks all slashings and payouts in realtime. It maintains a full ledger of validator opt-ins and monitors all restaked services. Due to the ability to track all participants in realtime, it can eject networks and middleware for coordinated degradation and keeps validators protected at all times. Any network and middleware that wants to access Restaking Cloud does so as a paid for service paying continual interest thus providing restakers with a more stable yield in kETH.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Principle protected restaking deposits</li>\n<li>Yield without running additional services for protocols (there is an option for additional work and additional rewards)</li>\n<li>Baseline yield is in kETH</li>\n<li>Fully compatible with Eigenlayer</li>\n<li>Outsized weightage of points during Private Mainnet</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"risks-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#risks-6\"></a>Risks</h2>\n<p>Restaking Cloud restakers do not encounter the same risks as other restaking protocols. This is because the whole restaked ledger is actively managed by K2 protocol for its slashing and payouts in realtime. All restaked services are monitored via the K2 reporter; It ejects any network when effectiveness causes correlated degradation &gt;30%. This prevents any long range attack and contagion to the principle stake. The maximum downside for a restaker is that they may not yield anything from K2 in the short term until the global yield pool recuperates.</p>\n<p>Mitigation of smart contract risk is addressed by keeping a detached state replicated validator registry of active validator stake balances of those who opted in for restaking from the consensus layer. It stays in an async checkpointed reconciliation for yield claims. Service flow (Restaking Cloud yield) is only claimable for active validators on the consensus layer. If they exit, it will reduce the claim in sync with the Beacon chain&lt;&gt;execution layer clock.</p>\n<p>The concept of reusing a validator’s security while maintaining it as a safe asset was brought to the public eye back in 2022 by Blockswap Labs CEO Matt Shams at an Ethereum Foundation event at Devconnect.</p>\n<p>Matt Shams — ETH as a long term collateral for rollup centric future (ETHconomics @ Devconnect 2022) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6FmiXi1L1Z0?si=932nEfJhPJjV8fwP\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://youtu.be/6FmiXi1L1Z0?si=932nEfJhPJjV8fwP</a></p>\n<p>There is an FAQ on risks that can be found at the link below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.restaking.cloud/the-risks-of-restaking-faq-22a6d8121fed\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://blog.restaking.cloud/the-risks-of-restaking-faq-22a6d8121fed</a></p>\n<p>The module for restaking that needs to be run as an additional client on the validator is called MEV Plus - native delegation module. It is similar to MEVBoost and can not touch the balances of your validator. <a href=\"https://docs.restaking.cloud/middleware/mevPlusModule\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">It is available to view under and open source MIT license</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ongoing-eigenlayer-efforts-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#ongoing-eigenlayer-efforts-7\"></a>Ongoing Eigenlayer Efforts</h2>\n<p>It is understood that the DAO has a potential research grant for a solution for RP built directly on Eignelayer. This document is not intended to derail those efforts as Restaking Cloud is fully compatible with Eigenlayer validators. It could be in the DAOs best interest to pursue multiple restaking protocols wherever possible. Restaking Cloud is designed to be futureproof with compatibility for various restaking protocol designs.</p>\n<p>Many staking validators might be participating in other staking protocols such as Eigenlayer etc, this is 100% compatible with Restaking Cloud. Restaking Cloud is a compliment for all ETH stakers. The only criteria is that the underlying validator has an active status on the consensus layer.</p>\n<p>Articulating a path for the DAO to integrate with Restaking Cloud should be fairly quick.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"two-options-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#two-options-8\"></a>Two Options</h2>\n<p>There are two clear paths available for the Rocket Pool community to consider when Rocket Pool node operators participate in Restaking Cloud. It is possible to start with Option <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> and work towards Option <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span>. Both of these are entirely compatible with all other DAO efforts including working with Eigenlayer.</p>\n<p>Option <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span></p>\n<p>In Rocket Pool there are two withdrawal addresses - Protocol withdrawal credential (smart contract) and user withdrawal address (EOA / smart wallet). Rocket Pool node operators could point all Restaking Cloud yield they earn to the user withdrawal credential.</p>\n<p>Pros</p>\n<p>This is a simple solution and doesn’t require any changes to protocol operations. Rocket Pool node operators who opt in are rewarded, while those who do not will not receive any rewards.</p>\n<p>Cons</p>\n<p>RPL holders would not see points or yield from Restaking Cloud via Native Delegations from Rocket Pool nodes.</p>\n<p>Option <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span></p>\n<p>Rocket Pool DAO provides an EOA or smart wallet address (SAFE) for Rocket Pool node operators to direct all rewards and points to, by setting it as the K2 payout address.</p>\n<p>Pros</p>\n<p>All rewards will be distributed to the set address and can be redistributed as the DAO decides.</p>\n<p>Cons</p>\n<p>Those who do not restake could receive restaking rewards. A fund splitter may be required to reconcile the registered validator BLS Key and operator addresses along with the joining time.
