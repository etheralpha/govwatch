This document will be continuously updated by Aave DAO contributors. The previous version is available here: <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-finance-governance-process-v0/11402\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Aave Finance Governance Process v0</a></p>\n<p>This document provides an overview of the different roles, flow and pathways for various stakeholders to participate in Aave DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-47048-governance-processes-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-governance-processes-3\"></a><strong>Governance Processes</strong></h1>\n<p>The processes described below are an overview of the official ways to participate in Aave DAO in various parts of the lifecycle as an AAVE, stkAAVE, or aAAVE delegate.</p>\n<p>At a high level the Aave governance process is composed of five stages, from temp check forum dicussion to on-chain votes. The stages are as follows: temp check forum post, temp check snapshot, ARFC forum post, ARFC snapshot, AIP on-chain vote. A standard proposal will take a minimum of 19 days to pass through all of these stages, although it is uncommon that it progresses this quickly as time is needed for writing and reviewing payloads, and there are timelocks and other waiting periods relating to the various voting stages.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47048-proposal-types-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-proposal-types-4\"></a><strong>Proposal types</strong></h2>\n<p>There are generally three main types of proposals in Aave Governance; these three general proposal classifications strictly refer to the maturity of a proposal in the Aave Governance Process. In specific situations, in order to minimise governance burden and increase speed, there are streamlined versions of this process. These situations are described in a later section.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TEMP CHECK: These serve as “temperature checks” to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.</li>\n<li>TEMP CHECK Snapshot: This is an off-chain vote using the Snapshot platform, with voting starting after the TEMP CHECK discussion period has ended.</li>\n<li>ARFC: Aave Request for Comment (ARFCs) are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.</li>\n<li>ARFC Snapshot: This is an off-chain vote using the Snapshot platform, with voting starting after the ARFC discussion period has ended.</li>\n<li>AIP: Aave Improvement Proposal (AIPs) are a formal proposal to improve the Aave Protocol; before submitting an AIP, an ARFC should be submitted to the community to gather feedback. Once the AIP has been written and reviewed, the AIP will be submitted via GitHub to begin the process of putting the AIP on-chain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47048-general-proposal-process-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-general-proposal-process-5\"></a><strong>General proposal process</strong></h2>\n<p>As pictured below, the standard proposal process is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post a Temp Check for 5 days to allow discussion and gauge sentiment.</li>\n<li>Temp Check Snapshot vote for 3 days.</li>\n<li>Post an ARFC for 5 days to allow for closer scrutiny and discussion.</li>\n<li>Post an ARFC Snapshot vote for 3 days.</li>\n<li>Post an AIP vote for 3 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This process takes around 19 days at a minimum, but often takes longer due to backlogs and time taken for writing and reviewing payloads, there are also various timelocks and waiting periods relating to the voting stages which extend this minimum timeframe. It should also be noted that ACI Skyward can help tokenholders to ensure the governance process proceeds smoothly and efficiently.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1168cf645b773ba3b599e64ff1b8e423fabc2b04.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/2u0FDQbIU3H8rtWa2rgE9yC6QoQ.png?dl=1\" title=\"standard governance process\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1168cf645b773ba3b599e64ff1b8e423fabc2b04.png\" alt=\"standard governance process\" data-base62-sha1=\"2u0FDQbIU3H8rtWa2rgE9yC6QoQ\" width=\"1999\" height=\"363\" data-dominant-color=\"EAEAEA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Standard governance process</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Discussion</strong></p>\n<p>As part of the governance process, a discussion must be started on the Aave Governance Forum, as shown in the diagram above there are two rounds of discussion, firstly as a Temp Check, and then as an ARFC if the Temp Check Snapshot passes.</p>\n<p>Once the proposal has been posted on the forum, it must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be available for review and comment for a minimum of five days.</li>\n<li>Contain all relevant information that would be contained in the AIP</li>\n<li>Comply with any relevant templates that apply to the proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposal author may decide to modify the proposal based on feedback during the discussion phases.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47048-moving-to-vote-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-moving-to-vote-6\"></a><strong>Moving to Vote</strong></h3>\n<p>Once a proposal meets the required conditions, it can proceed to the voting stages, which include both off-chain and on-chain voting methods. Voting in the Aave DAO allows AAVE, stkAAVE, and aAAVE holders to participate directly or delegate their voting power to representatives.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Off-chain voting (<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth\">Snapshot</a>):</strong></em> Off-chain votes are used to gauge the sentiment for Temp Checks and ARFCs. The off-chain voting period lasts 3 days for both Temp Check and ARFC votes.</p>\n<p><em><strong>On-chain (<a href=\"https://app.aave.com/governance/\">Native</a>):</strong></em> On-chain voting is required on any Aave Improvement Proposal. Aave on-chain votes will occur on the Aave Governance Portal. The voting period must last for a minimum period of 3 days. With the launch of V3 governance, it is now possible to vote across multiple chains and carry out gasless voting, read more <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/governance/master/aave-governance-v3\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The on-chain voting process is composed of four stages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First of all, the proposal and payload are reviewed by Security Service Providers to ensure that it is not malicious and that it doesn’t contain errors which put the protocol at risk.</li>\n<li>The second stage is entered if no errors or malicious payload are identified, and the proposal is moved on-chain. Once the proposal is on-chain, a voting delay of 1 day must pass before the proposal becomes active.</li>\n<li>In the third stage, once the voting delay has elapsed the proposal becomes active and is available to be voted on. This stage lasts for 3 days.</li>\n<li>In the fourth stage, once the voting period has ended, the proposal will either have SUCCEEDED or FAILED, depending on whether it has passed quorum and has a majority of YAE votes or not. In this stage, if the proposal has passed, the payload is queued with a timelock of 1 day, after this is elapsed the payload may be executed. If the proposal is not executed before the end of a grace period it expires and must be deployed and voted on again from the beginning of the on-chain voting process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A visual representation of this flow is shown in the figure below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/68b1dc5e533ce8b9ee19904b8f07ebf7ec8131ec.png\" alt=\"onchain voting process\" data-base62-sha1=\"eWaILeczaodiYyF5Wzq0lDBKdLm\" width=\"1536\" height=\"513\"></p>\n<p>On-chain voting process</p>\n<p>In both off-chain and on-chain votes, the voting power is directly proportional to the amount of AAVE, stkAAVE or aAAVE a user holds or has delegated to them. For more details, please refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/governance\">official documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47048-quorum-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-quorum-7\"></a><strong>Quorum</strong></h3>\n<p>In order for a proposal to succeed, a minimum of 320,000 AAVE, stkAAVE, or aAAVE must participate in the vote. In addition to this, the winning vote must also have 320,000 votes. For example if a proposal had 320,000 total votes, with less than 320,000 votes for the winning option, this would not meet quorum requirements. Any changes to the quorum requirements must be amended by the community through an AIP.</p>\n<p>Each vote has to reach the minimum quorum, even if it has a majority, for it to be considered an official proposal. It is the responsibility of the proposal author to enlist voting participation from the community in order to reach a quorum.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47048-aci-skyward-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-aci-skyward-8\"></a><strong>ACI Skyward</strong></h3>\n<p>Skyward is a free service launched by <a href=\"https://www.aavechan.com\">ACI</a> to assist Aave DAO members with the proposal process, making it more accessible and streamlined. The service covers various AIP types, including asset onboarding, risk parameter changes, interest rate strategy changes, supply &amp; borrow caps changes, E-mode activation, and asset offboarding. Skyward is open to everyone and free of charge in order to lower the barriers to participation in Aave’s governance.</p>\n<p>How Skyward works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Initial contact: Proposer will often contact ACI before engaging in the governance process to ensure efficient progression through the various stages.</li>\n<li>Temp Check: Proposer writes a Temp Check and has ACI review the draft before publishing to forums.</li>\n<li>Temp Check Snapshot: ACI publishes Temp Check Snapshot.</li>\n<li>ARFC Request: ACI creates and publishes the ARFC in collaboration with the proposer.</li>\n<li>ARFC Snapshot : ACI publishes the ARFC Snapshot.</li>\n<li>AIP Creation: If the Snapshot vote is successful, ACI writes the payload and publishes the AIP for a vote.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To help understand at what point ACI Skyward takes responsibility for the governance process, see the figure below.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/3f67b6b9008c446544f0003d24489c232016dc5e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/92UhKI4m7HZTPu26YoWwIvYic7I.png?dl=1\" title=\"governance process ACI Skywards\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/3f67b6b9008c446544f0003d24489c232016dc5e.png\" alt=\"governance process ACI Skywards\" data-base62-sha1=\"92UhKI4m7HZTPu26YoWwIvYic7I\" width=\"1999\" height=\"584\" data-dominant-color=\"B1DFC1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Governance process when making use of ACI Skyward</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47048-non-standard-governance-frameworks-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-non-standard-governance-frameworks-9\"></a>Non-standard Governance Frameworks</h2>\n<p>For some common actions that governance needs to take in order to manage the Aave protocol, there are frameworks for expedited governance. This helps reduce the governance burden on the DAO, tailors governance processes to the level of scrutiny required for various tasks, and helps the DAO run more efficiently.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47048-arfc-addendum-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-arfc-addendum-10\"></a>ARFC Addendum</h3>\n<p>In order to make minor changes to an existing ARFC, rather than restarting the process from Temp Check stage, an Addendum can be proposed by forum post which progresses to Snapshot then AIP. This expedites minor changes, reducing governance burden. An illustration of the process is shown below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/eebbe86fcf25977dbdbe2398cc77e29d8409e19e.png\" alt=\"ARFC Addendum Process\" data-base62-sha1=\"y3WebUIpUOFQedEBLPaexAv7uMe\" width=\"1664\" height=\"408\"></p>\n<p>ARFC Addendum Governance Process</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47048-asset-onboarding-framework-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-asset-onboarding-framework-11\"></a><strong>Asset Onboarding Framework</strong></h3>\n<p>The Asset Onboarding Framework is available to read on the forums here: <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-update-the-asset-onboarding-framework/15629\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework</a> along with minor modifications here: <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-addendum-update-asset-onboarding-framework/17899\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[ARFC Addendum] Update Asset Onboarding Framework</a>.</p>\n<p>There are two pathways for onboarding new assets to Aave. If there is no existing Aave market for the asset, the standard governance process is followed, starting at temp check and progressing through all standard governance stages. For assets already listed in other Aave markets, a direct-to-AIP process is used, skipping the Temp Check stages and taking about 10 days. To use this process the following must be applicable for the asset being onboarded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Existing Aave market presence.</li>\n<li>Submission or feedback from a risk service provider.</li>\n<li>Supply cap not exceeding 50% on the respective chain.</li>\n<li>At least 90 days old Chainlink price feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New listing candidates must deposit $100 worth of the intended asset into the Aave Short Executor.

By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-motivation-5\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>GNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<p>osGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.</p>\n<p>Creating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.</p>\n<p>osGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed <a href=\"https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism\">here</a>. If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.</p>\n<p>osETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\"></a><strong>Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments</strong></h3>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-specification-7\"></a><strong>Specification</strong></h3>\n<p>Contract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0</p>\n<p>Risk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-useful-links-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-useful-links-8\"></a><strong>Useful Links:</strong></h3>\n<p>osGNO announcement post: <a href=\"https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Announcing the Launch of StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain | by StakeWise | Jul, 2024 | Medium</a></p>\n<p>osGNO Vaults: <a href=\"https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\" class=\"inline-onebox\">StakeWise | Vaults</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-osgno-to-aave-v3-gnosis/18439\">TEMP CHECK Onboard osGNO to Aave V3 Gnosis</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-disclaimer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-disclaimer-9\"></a><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal is powered by Skywards.

The largest supplier has not adjusted their position since last month’s sell off and does not have any immediately apparent liquidity to improve their health score.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/5c2c9fe6e2a61172236e43632068e40d71c3461f.png\" alt=\"Untitled (27)\" data-base62-sha1=\"d9pxaQYRMnRcyVgIYb0poWpjO4D\" width=\"631\" height=\"257\"></p>\n<p>Elsewhere, USDC and USDT utilization has declined significantly, to 76% and 77.5%, respectively, following liquidations of positions with stablecoins as the borrowed asset.</p>\n<p>The wstETH market does not show any immediate warning signs, as the largest supplier borrows WBTC but has a health score of over 2. The next largest supplier is looping wstETH and WETH, putting the position at low risk of liquidation given wstETH’s calculated oracle.</p>\n<p>Overall, there is currently $255M total collateral at risk on Ethereum.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-46992-base-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46992-base-9\"></a>Base</h2>\n<p>Liquidations on Base were concentrated with WETH as a collateral asset;

Many of you will already know me, but a bit about myself for those who don’t.</p>\n<p>My name is Harry and I worked on Strategy and Governance at Aave Companies (now Aave Labs) for close to two years. In that role I spent a lot of time extremely close to Aave governance. Following that I spent a year working at LayerZero Labs on strategic initiatives. I am currently working @ Stargate Finance helping them rejuvenate their governance as well as @ Members Capital, an upcoming onchain insurance fund, where I’m effectively their in-house degen.</p>\n<p>My passion for the space has only grown throughout this time and my interest in Aave has always remained top of my mind. I am proud to have spent so much time working on Aave and I want to take the next step in my Aave journey and work with the community to help determine the future of one of the most exciting and important projects in the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Why You Should Delegate to Me</strong></p>\n<p>Like some others, such as the amazing <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/EzR3aL\">EzR3aL</a>, I am not some large institution or platform (for now at least). I am a user of Aave, a DAO participant and someone who truly cares about Aave and the DAOs success. By delegating to me you will be delegating to someone who is honest, determined to make Aave better and excited to vote on your behalf. Here are some more specific factors to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarity with the Aave DAO: I know many of the DAOs delegates and service providers personally. You can be assured that any vote I make will be well-informed by discussions with relevant parties.</li>\n<li>Ecosystem-wide connections: My time working in the space has helped me build strong connections throughout it. I intend to not only provide internal support for the DAO, but also help providers and delegates looking to support Aave’s expansions and integrations elsewhere. Having worked with many other protocols and chains very closely I am also a great point of contact for those looking to work with the DAO.</li>\n<li>I truly care about the Aave DAO: Working with the DAO was a labour of love for years. Anyone who knows me knows that I truly care about Aave and the DAO. Delegating to me you can be sure to see this in how I participate.</li>\n<li>Expertise: Not only do I have expertise in the DAO specifically, I also have spent a huge amount of time thinking about governance broadly. I intend to bring these expertise to the table and help to inform governance discussions. Furthermore, having worked at LayerZero and Stargate I now have a strong understanding of the interoperability world which is becoming increasingly important for Aave. Similarly, working with a deeply knowledgeable TradFi team at Members Cap will help me with understanding the role RWAs can play for the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Small sidenote: Some of you know I used to work on an Aave native newsletter that covered the space more broadly. I intend to bring this back. When I do, delegates will get early access and other perks as it develops)</p>\n<p><strong>What Voters Can Expect</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Honesty: I will always strive to be entirely honest in my opinions in the forum. This may seem like a no-brainer, but it is not always the case for delegates throughout the space.</li>\n<li>Consistency: I believe in the strong opinions loosely held mantra.Whilst I am willing to change my mind, I will always follow my values and you can be sure that I will consistently vote in what I view as the best interest of the DAO and users.</li>\n<li>Activity: I am terminally online and am obsessed with the space and more specifically Aave. You should have no concern about me missing a vote.</li>\n<li>Curiosity: I am not afraid to ask questions and I am willing to listen to any idea to understand its merits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Main Focus Points</strong></p>\n<p>Governance and decentralization: Given my experience this is where I believe I add most value. I am especially happy to help people with their proposals to the DAO and give feedback. I also wholeheartedly believe without decentralization none of this is worth anything - so I will emphasize this when relevant.</p>\n<p>Service providers: Over the years I have built extremely strong relationships with service providers. I have also spent a good amount of time reviewing their proposals. I believe I am well placed to focus on helping to keep service providers in check.</p>\n<p>Ecosystem synergies: As mentioned, I have built strong relationships throughout the space. I want to help teams looking to work with Aave and vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not expecting much, or anything really, to start. However over time, through proof of work, I hope to build your trust and support. Together, we can play a role in the future of one of the most exciting and important projects in the space. Let’s do this.</p>\n<p><em>Conflicts of Interest</em><br>\nNot necessarily conflicts of interest but as mentioned I currently work for the Stargate Foundation and Members Capital. I pledge not to use my platform to promote either of these or affiliated groups within the DAO. I am also an Optimism Badgeholder.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/hazbobo-delegate-platform/18524\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/hazbobo-delegate-platform/18524","pubDate":"Sun, 04 Aug 2024 12:12:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-18524"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/hazbobo-delegate-platform/18524.rss","#text":"Hazbobo Delegate Platform"},"filter":false},{"title":"[TEMP CHECK] Onboard steakLRT to Aave v3 Lido Instance","dc:creator":"ACI","category":"New Asset","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-46912-temp-check-onboard-steaklrt-to-aave-v3-lido-instance-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-temp-check-onboard-steaklrt-to-aave-v3-lido-instance-1\"></a><strong>[TEMP CHECK] Onboard steakLRT to Aave v3 Lido Instance</strong></h2>\n<h2><a name=\"p-46912-author-aci-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-author-aci-2\"></a><strong>Author: ACI</strong></h2>\n<h2><a name=\"p-46912-date-2024-08-02-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-date-2024-08-02-3\"></a><strong>Date: 2024-08-02</strong></h2>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46912-summary-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-summary-4\"></a><strong>Summary</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal aims to onboard steakLRT, Steakhouse’s restaking token built on Mellow and Symbiotic, to the Ethereum v3 Lido Instance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46912-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-motivation-5\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>The Steakhouse Resteaking Vault, steakLRT, is a wstETH-based liquid restaking token powered by Mellow and the Symbiotic restaking middleware. This is a logical extension of the work Steakhouse is doing as Lido DAO’s Finance Workstream, and is a work in progress proof of the crucial role that Lido stETH can play in helping restaking become more efficient, while preserving the decentralization of Ethereum.</p>\n<p>The onboarding of steakLRT to the Aave v3 Lido instance aims to enhance the diversity and robustness of the Aave ecosystem by integrating a novel restaking token.</p>\n<p>steakLRT, built on Mellow and Symbiotic, brings unique value propositions and additional yield opportunities through boosted points programs. By including steakLRT, we can continue to attract user deposits from restaking narratives and support the further growth of a Lido instance. Further, beacuse steakLRT accepts wstETH deposits, there are strategic programs that can be run to increase wstETH deposit yield through looping strategies and liquidity mining. These will continue to make the Aave v3 Lido Instance the best place to deposit wstETH as collateral.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46912-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\"></a><strong>Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments</strong></h3>\n<p>Mellow and Symbiotic deposits held as LRTs like steakLRT earn Symbiotic and Mellow points.</p>\n<p>Mellow will do an additional boosted points program for deposits into the Aave v3 Lido instance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46912-specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-specification-7\"></a><strong>Specification</strong></h3>\n<p>Contract address: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc\">0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc</a></p>\n<p>Risk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46912-useful-links-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-useful-links-8\"></a><strong>Useful Links:</strong></h3>\n<p>steakLRT announcement post: <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@SteakhouseFi/steakLRT\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Introducing steakLRT - HackMD</a></p>\n<p>steakLRT Mellow Vault: <a href=\"https://app.mellow.finance/restake/ethereum-steaklrt\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Mellow</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46912-disclaimer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46912-disclaimer-9\"></a><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal is powered by Skywards.

Custom behaviour (lack of) of the execution layer</h3>\n<p>Whenever a network has custom/extended behavior with respect to Ethereum, it is important to be aware of it and evaluate if it has any impact on the Aave protocol.</p>\n<p>Examples of this potential behavior are the presence of new pre-compiles (compared with Ethereum), EVM opcodes, native account abstraction/meta-transactions or chainId definition out of the norm.</p>\n<p>zkSync Era has <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/evm-instructions\">numerous differences to Ethereum and its various sidechains.</a> Some more relevant ones are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Contract deployments use a specific system contract, which has for consequence that using the CREATE and CREATE2 opcodes is only possible if the bytecode to be deployed is known at compile-time.</p>\n<p>This required some adaptation in the Aave v3 peripheral infrastructure (e.g. deployment orchestration), but doesn’t cause any blocker.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zkSync has their own implementation of account abstraction, which could be used to improve user experience on Aave. Certain functionality on Aave (e.g. <code>permit()</code> on aTokens or meta-transaction support on the Aave Pool) will only work for EOAs, but this is not a problem, as “smart accounts” can have the same functionality natively to zkSync.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Memory is handled differently, being allocated byte-per-byte, this could have an impact on inline assembly that expects memory to be allocated on a word (32 bytes)-by-word basis, but this should not have an impact on Aave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Historically, when fetching the block number or timestamp, the zkSync EVM was returning the L1 batch block number and timestamp rather than the L2’s. However this behaviour has changed since a <a href=\"https://github.com/zkSync-Community-Hub/zksync-developers/discussions/87\">previous upgrade</a> and now <code>block.number</code>, <code>block.timestamp</code> and <code>blockhash</code> work as expected, returning directly L2-related data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zkSync Era contracts handle immutables differently <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/evm-instructions#setimmutable-loadimmutable\">by using an immutable simulator contract</a>. This should not affect Aave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zkSync handles gas differently, including a fee for publishing data. This should not affect Aave, apart from having variations on gas cost compared with other networks where the protocol lives.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the previous, there are other technical differences between zkSync and Ethereum (e.g. lack of some precompiles, but addition of others), but from our analysis we don’t see any impact on Aave v3.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/953c2dd4b2ee708c1e7fde98a80a395c26f0de05.png\" alt=\"gold\" data-base62-sha1=\"lic4IoVKNchniTqtIYtnNYsy6sR\" width=\"104\" height=\"104\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-46878-h-37-support-of-wallet-providers-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-46878-h-37-support-of-wallet-providers-11\"></a>3.7.

Transactions simulation infrastructure (fork)</h3>\n<p>Lately, a really important development experience component is the ability to execute test transactions (simulations) on forked production networks.</p>\n<p>A good part of the tooling around Aave depends on simulations by using different libraries/frameworks like Hardhat, Foundry, or Tenderly.

Bridging infrastructure: assets, messages</h3>\n<p>Given the central role of Ethereum in the DeFi and Aave ecosystems, bridging infrastructure to/from is a must for any candidate network.</p>\n<p>The zkSync network has <a href=\"https://portal.zksync.io/bridge/\">proper bridge infrastructure for both transferring assets and generic messaging</a>.

Network security/technical model</h3>\n<p>At the core of any candidate network analysis are its morphology (which type of network it is) and security model (which parties are involved in the control over the network; decentralization degree).</p>\n<p>The zkSync Era network is a rollup based on validity proofs, inheriting the security of the Ethereum base layer. However, at the moment, there are the following considerations:</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.1. Sequencer and Proposer Downtime</strong></p>\n<p>Like all rollups, zkSync uses a sequencer, which is responsible for processing transactions on the L2 blockchain itself.</p>\n<p>The sequencer, can not skip transactions queued from L1, but can <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/zksync-era#risk-analysis\">stop processing them</a>. Furthermore, only the whitelisted proposer can publish state roots on L1, so withdrawals would be impossible should it go down.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.2. Custom virtual machine (zkSync VM)</strong></p>\n<p>The zkSync VM is quite different from the standard EVM at a low level, introducing another surface for problems. However, the zkSync VM has been worked on for multiple years, and the implementation high-level looks solid, surrounded by multiple different security procedures.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.3. Upgradeability and control model (decentralisation)</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, the zkSync Era network still has meaningful centralisation, with a <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e4943346848c4867F81dFb37c4cA9C5715A7828\">4-of-7 multi-sig</a> having super-admin control on a sophisticated system allowing different types of upgrades (e.g. transparent ones for standard software updates, or “shadow” ones for being able to perform bug fixes in a private manner, without compromising user funds).</p>\n<p>Given the early stage of the technology, this control is understandable, and relatively similar to other L2 networks.</p>\n<p>zkSync has been working on a decentralized governance system, removing some of the centralisation point, with the initial phase planned to be live in the following month. All the details can be found <a href=\"https://docs.zknation.io/zksync-governance/zksync-governance-procedures-overview\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.4. Security audits</strong></p>\n<p>zkSync Era has been submitted to multiple audits and security procedures, on all layers (L1, L2, cryptography).</p>\n<p>All of them can be found <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/audit-bug-bounty\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.5. Transaction lifecycle</strong></p>\n<p>The zkSync documentation contains an extensive explanation of the transaction lifecycle on Era <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/transaction-lifecycle\">HERE</a>, but to summarise:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users submit their transactions to the L2 Sequencer. Additionally, they also have the possibility to submit them directly to L1 to force their inclusion.</li>\n<li>Sequencer executes the transactions on L2, and afterwards forwards them to the prover components, creating proofs to submit to the L1 verifier.</li>\n<li>The cryptographic proof is submitted to the verifier contract on L1, together with the state diff, updating the state of the rollup on Ethereum.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3.13.6. Data availability</strong></p>\n<p>As previously commented, zkSync Era currently uses Ethereum as data availability layer.

By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-5\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>GNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<p>osGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.</p>\n<p>Creating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.</p>\n<p>osGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed <a href=\"https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism\">here</a>. If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.</p>\n<p>osETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption.
