This presents a lot of synergies between the two protocols with USDS being the largest decentralized stablecoin. We view this as a first step to a deeper relationship with Aave to promote both protocols as the core of scalable DeFi.</p>\n<p>Aave protocol teams have agreed to split revenue from the sUSDS and USDS markets 50/50 with Spark.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47800-h-1-susds-incentives-program-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47800-h-1-susds-incentives-program-2\"></a>1. sUSDS Incentives Program</h3>\n<p>sUSDS is used as the asset in the main market to improve capital efficiency for lenders. The idle supply consistently earns the Sky Savings Rate (SSR), allowing the market to outperform the USDC/USDT counterparts. Furthermore, debt is denominated in the yield-bearing version, so the minimum borrow rate is the SSR.</p>\n<p>The following formula will be used to prevent USD stablecoin looping: <code>sUSDS Supplies - Sum_i(Stablecoin_i Borrow Amount (in USD) / Stablecoin_i Liquidation Threshold)</code></p>\n<p>This program will help Sky to boost adoption of USDS after launch, and the incentives program will boost Aave’s TVL and revenue by attracting new borrowers.</p>\n<p>The Aave team has agreed to place rewards on the sUSDS market and will update their UI to display the SPK rewards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47800-h-2-usds-d3m-to-lido-market-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47800-h-2-usds-d3m-to-lido-market-3\"></a>2.

In collaboration with Aave and Lido, Phoenix Labs recommends deploying a D3M to this market to boost the adoption of USDS and wstETH. A 100m initial debt ceiling is proposed with the expectation that it will be used until the rates align with the broader market.</p>\n<p>The collateral in the market will be highly liquid ETH and wstETH, so we expect this debt ceiling to be raised to match demand. If for some reason there is not enough demand then liquidity can be removed if the borrow rate remains below SOFR.</p>\n<p>The following contracts will be used for the D3M:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-direct-deposit/blob/master/src/pools/D3MAaveV3USDSNoSupplyCapTypePool.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">D3MAaveV3USDSNoSupplyCapTypePool</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-direct-deposit/blob/master/src/plans/D3MOperatorPlan.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">D3MOperatorPlan</a> (Operator: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x298b375f24CeDb45e936D7e21d6Eb05e344adFb5\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x298b375f24CeDb45e936D7e21d6Eb05e344adFb5</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The operator plan will allow the governance facilitator multisig to adjust the exposure to match demand in a faster cadence than the spell process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47800-next-steps-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47800-next-steps-4\"></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Pending approval from the Sky governance process, both proposals will be implemented at the next available opportunity after the USDS and sUSDS tokens launch on September 18th.</p>\n<p>The SPK rewards program will start on the block that the market is onboarded into the Aave V3 Main Market.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/spark-proposal-for-integrations-into-aave/18873\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/spark-proposal-for-integrations-into-aave/18873","pubDate":"Tue, 03 Sep 2024 09:30:46 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-18873"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/spark-proposal-for-integrations-into-aave/18873.rss","#text":"Spark Proposal for Integrations into Aave"},"filter":false},{"title":"[ARFC] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll","dc:creator":"ACI","category":"New Asset","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-47771-arfc-onboard-stone-to-aave-v3-on-scroll-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-arfc-onboard-stone-to-aave-v3-on-scroll-1\"></a>[ARFC] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47771-author-aci-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-author-aci-2\"></a>Author: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/aci\">@ACI</a></h2>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47771-date-2024-09-02-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-date-2024-09-02-3\"></a>Date: 2024-09-02</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-summary-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-summary-4\"></a><strong>Summary</strong></h3>\n<p>StakeStone is the protocol issuing STONE, the liquid ETH, with over 150k users. Currently, StakeStone is seeking support to onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll and is launching a series of initiatives to boost liquidity and Aave adoption.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-motivation-5\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>STONE is an ERC-20 rebalancing token that generates risk-free rewards for ETH based on blue-chip underlying assets like Lido, EigenLayer, and Symbiotic in a decentralized manner through our OPAP governance mechanism. StakeStone currently has $350 million worth of STONE deployed on Scroll. To ensure that STONE has robust liquidity, in addition to the STONE-ETH DEX liquidity on Scroll, STONE also has PMM powered cross-chain liquidity. Users can perform cross-chain redemption and receive ETH on the Ethereum mainnet within 40 seconds, with optimized pricing.</p>\n<p>STONE aims to become the liquid ETH, covering users’ opportunity costs while creating more use cases for STONE holders. Thanks to its architecture supporting multiple underlying assets, STONE can maintain market adaptability and stability over the long term, allowing users and the protocol to avoid the need to mint or integrate a new asset.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of listing STONE token:</strong></p>\n<p>STONE is collaborating with Scroll to build a DeFi ecosystem. STONE works closely with various protocols to support the ecosystem and facilitate their go-to-market strategies. Currently, STONE is the largest asset category on Scroll, accounting for over 30% of the total TVL across the chain, with a high utilization rate (close to 90%). The StakeStone team is dedicated to offering services to protocols that support STONE while fostering collaboration for shared prosperity, which is reflected in the high utilization of STONE across various DeFi use cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Market Impact:</strong></p>\n<p>As of today, over 180,000 ETH have been staked in StakeStone, with a historical high of 340,000 ETH. StakeStone has also successfully processed nearly 1 billion dollars in inflows and outflows. Meanwhile, STONE has a wide user base, and all users are very active on-chain. We hope that this active community can bring more liquidity and activity to AAVE.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-chain-to-be-deployedlisted-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-chain-to-be-deployedlisted-6\"></a><strong>Chain to be deployed/listed:</strong></h3>\n<p>Scroll chain.

Large liquidity providers are highly interested in using STONE in AAVE and further boosting DEX liquidity for STONE. StakeStone will also have its own liquidity mining incentive campaign for STONE in AAVE.</p>\n<p>To incentivize the use of STONE in AAVE, StakeStone will provide boosted STONE points for STONE suppliers and is planning a yield-boost campaign specifically designed to maximize engagement.</p>\n<p>Among our active liquidity providers, we have gathered strong interest in using STONE for lending and borrowing. The team will actively engage with liquidity providers to achieve a supply of at least 5,000 STONE, gradually increasing it over time as risk parameters are adjusted.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-specification-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-specification-8\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>ARFC will be updated with Risk Parameters provided by Risk Service Providers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-other-relevant-information-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-other-relevant-information-9\"></a>Other relevant information</h3>\n<p>STONE has undergone multiple rounds of audits conducted by firms such as Quantstamp, Slowmist, Veridise, and Secure3, and closely collaborates with security organizations like Cobo and Coincover.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-useful-links-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-useful-links-10\"></a><strong>Useful Links</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/HolyMoon/stakestone\">Dune Analytics for data about STONE</a></p>\n<p><a>Security audits</a></p>\n<p>[Governance votes about asset](<a href=\"https://app.stakestone.io/u/portfolio-allocation/vote/vote-list\">StakeStone - Staking, But More</a>)</p>\n<p><a>OPAP proposal example</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb00c9a77dcfec2d3804249b4c8da8d82a3b4d6efe85dbeb6bb6fa3954afa3615\">[TEMP CHECK] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll Snapshot Vote</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-stone-to-aave-v3-on-scroll/18705\">[TEMP CHECK] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll Forum Thread</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47771-disclaimer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47771-disclaimer-11\"></a><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal is powered by Skywards.

Aave v3 ZKSync activation issue report","dc:creator":"bgdlabs","category":"Development","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-47661-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47661-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=153\">final activation phase of the Aave v3 ZKSync pool on August 21th</a>, a problem with its behaviour was detected. Consequently, a global pause of all assets was enacted by the Aave Guardian, delaying the activation of the new instance.</p>\n<p>The issue resulted to be not on Aave’s smart contracts, but consequence of a bug in one of the dependencies of the ZKSync Era compiler: LLVM, a widely used compiler library outside the blockchain industry. This affected very specifically one logic expression of Aave, reflecting in the aforementioned unexpected behaviour.</p>\n<p>After responsibly knowing that no production system on Era is affected, this report explains how the problem was detected, remediations executed without any funds at risk and next steps.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47661-before-the-aave-pool-pausing-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47661-before-the-aave-pool-pausing-2\"></a>Before the Aave pool pausing</h2>\n<p>Below is a rough timeline of events until the Aave v3 ZKSync pool was paused:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://app.aave.com\">app.aave.com</a> from Aave Labs is one of the user interfaces to interact with the Aave protocol and is usually the first to provide support on new network activations.<br>\nDuring the voting of pool activation governance proposals (5 days), it is routine for Aave Labs to perform integration testing of both basic actions on the pool (supply, borrow, etc) and more sophisticated flows combining different operations in a pseudo-random way manner.</p>\n<p>This procedure is complementary to the unit and integration tests of the smart contracts side performed pre-proposal stage by the proposal creator, and has two main objectives: detect any problem on the UI itself and its dependencies (e.g. helper periphery contracts aggregating data from Aave), and acting as yet another layer of redundancy of the protocol testing.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that this testing is conducted both before and immediately after the pool’s activation via governance, to eliminate any discrepancies between the fork environment and the actual production dependencies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At around 15.30 GMT on 21th August, Aave Labs was performing the testing process on the UI, and detected an issue when supplying assets. This was a problem on the user interface itself, and resolved soon after.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Later on, another issue was detected. This problem appeared after executing a more complex flow of operations involving supplying and borrowing multiple assets, and performing a full repayment of one of the positions. The Aave Labs team observed that part of the position was disappearing from the UI.<br>\nThe issue was initially narrowed down to a helper contract of the system, the UIPoolDataProvider. This contract is designed for interfaces to consume batched/processed data from the protocol. This finding was consistent with previous activations or pool upgrades, where helper contracts tended to have a larger surface area for integration issues, being non-core to the protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After further internal research by Aave Labs, and given that the smart contracts code of Aave v3 ZKSync was same as on other networks, the main hypothesis was that the fork environment might not be reliable, as the UIPoolDataProvider seemed correct. While this research was ongoing, the pool activated and went live</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In parallel, Aave Labs contacted BGD Labs to disclose the findings and seek deeper analysis of the potential problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upon involvement, BGD Labs sought to answer to two immediate questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is there really a bug?</li>\n<li>If there is a bug, can it affect other Aave instances?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Almost immediately it becomes evident that there is a bug, even if it was not clear what exactly was. Concurrently, Aave Labs tested the same flow on other production networks, revealing that no other instances seemed to be affected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Before conducting further research, BGD Labs decided to contact the Aave Protocol Guardian to pause the entire pool. The reasoning behind taking this step was, that with the pool being empty, there was no downside to taking the action, and theoretically, it would stop any potential attack surface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Aave Protocol Guardian demonstrated an outstanding reaction time, and the pool was paused almost immediately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Following the pause of the pool, it was determined that a thorough investigation should be conducted before public communications were made. This decision was informed by suspicions that the issue might be more complex than initially apparent, and not being even totally related with Aave’s contracts.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47661-the-bug-research-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47661-the-bug-research-3\"></a>The bug research</h2>\n<p>With the pool empty and paused and no other networks affected, our priority became understanding precisely the issue.</p>\n<p>The scenario was the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bug affected pretty deep dynamics of the pool.</li>\n<li>The behaviour was breaking very important high-level properties of the Aave protocol: an action on an asset (repaying) was affecting user flags related to another asset.</li>\n<li>Part of the pre-activation security procedures was to strictly check Solidity code differences between the Aave v3 (v3.1) contracts deployed on ZKSync and other networks’ instances. The code was the same, only different in totally unrelated components with the bug in question.</li>\n<li>As previously commented, the misbehaviour was not present in other Aave instances, technically sharing the same Solidity code.</li>\n<li>The bug was also not present in ZeroLend (tested there to understand if they could be affected), a fork of Aave v3 (non v3.1) in production for months in ZKSync.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>From the previous facts, our internal analysis on BGD was the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem must be on the pool data, not on tokenization or other components, as it seemed related with user positions involving multiple assets.</li>\n<li>Even if we know that a repayment on an asset should not affect others, is there any place where misbehaving logic could operate on the wrong data?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the previous analysis, we establish an initial hypothesis: <em>somehow, the bitmap on user data containing 256 bits of boolean pairs for if an asset is borrowed and/or used as collateral by the user is getting “corrupted” by the logic, with actions disabling an asset as borrowed affecting the usage as collateral of a different asset</em>.</p>\n<p>Immediately, we asked Aave Labs team members to reproduce alternative scenarios to the original that in the same environment. By our hypothesis, we thought they will show similar data corruption.</p>\n<p>Indeed, that was the case, and a clear pattern emerged: when having multiple assets enabled as collateral and borrowed, disabling the isBorrowing flag on the bitmap more to the “left”, would zeroed some of the isCollateral flags to the “right”. Moreover, we generalised testing the pattern to actually prove that all flags to the “right” of the one being disabled were getting zeroed.</p>\n<br>\n<p>To better understand the scenario, this is a practical example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User supplies and borrows multiple assets, wstETH, USDT, USDC, which by listing order have contiguous position on the user configuration bitmap. After this, the status of the bitmap is <code>000...111111</code> (256 bits) with the 1s representing <code>wstETH used as collateral | wstETH borrowed | USDT used as collateral | USDT borrowed | USDC used as collateral | USDC borrowed</code> .</li>\n<li>By repaying the whole debt of wstETH, the expected result would be <code>000...101111</code> , so just disabling the <code>wstETH borrowed</code> boolean bit. However the result observed was <code>0000...100000</code> . Consequently, the protocol enters in an inconsistent state, where it believes the user has no borrow position, and only wstETH collateral, which is not true.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the problem was clear, but the cause not completely. As aforementioned, the deployed contracts were exactly the same as in other networks where the issue didn’t exist, exactly the same in the case of the <code>UserConfiguration</code> contract dealing with bitmaps as an existing fork of Aave in ZKSync which also had no issue.</p>\n<p>So now another hypothesis we had from the moment we got involved by Aave Labs was becoming more clear: there is a bug somewhere on custom compilation layers of ZKSync, affecting specifically the version we compiled the contracts with, but not others.</p>\n<p>We reached out to the Matter Labs team and they started an investigation on the problem.</p>\n<br>\n<p>In parallel, we asked Certora to check deeper into the issue for detecting the root cause, while Matter Labs were performing their research . Later, by analysing the assembly output of compilation, Certora noticed the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On precisely the logic section of bitmaps manipulation of <code>UserConfiguration</code>, apparently some type of “magic value”/constant was introduced.</li>\n<li>This value was clearly not belonging to the basic bit manipulation instructions, so probably had to be a compiler optimisation: by detecting a pattern of multiple logic operations done together, it is quite common that optimisers “simplify” them with ad-hoc instructions, involving sometimes magic values/constants.</li>\n<li>This being a optimiser act was further proved by modifying the <code>UserConfiguration</code> logic in isolation with logic doing exactly the same, but with more convoluted (and unnecessary) bit instructions. Effectively, the output of the compilation was not including anymore the “magic value”, meaning that the optimiser was simply not detecting the pattern an consequently not acting.</li>\n<li>More important, the “magic” value had an strange property: it had 64 bits dimension, which initially looked pretty suspicious, given that the logic was operating in 256 bits data.<br>\nThis would definitely explain the bug, with a bit mask of non-expected dimension getting applied on the data, corrupting it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This finding by Certora was communicated to Matter Labs, which in parallel and independently had reached similar conclusions. At this stage it become pretty evident that effectively it was some type of compilation bug.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<p>The root cause of the issue detected by Matter Labs was the following.</p>\n<p>As described on the <a href=\"https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/compiler/toolchain\">ZKSync documentation</a>, one of the compilation layers uses LLVM, a well-known and broadly used compiler library, applying different optimisations on the intermediate state between EVM assembly code and the final ZKSync bytecode.</p>\n<p>The cause of the problem was actually a bug in the LLVM itself, not on the zksync side. The compiler was doing an optimisation for exactly the type of operation used on Aave, but there was a bug on the usage of signed vs unsigned constants, consequently affecting the magnitude in bits.</p>\n<p>Important to highlight than even if that logic was buggy, compilations not doing certain optimisations could not be affected; this is why forks of Aave running on ZKSync Era were not impacted.</p>\n<p>Considering that Aave was actually safe at all times post-pause, we have not published this report until now, after having confirmation from Matter Labs that <strong>the bug doesn’t impact any verified Era contract</strong>.</p>\n<p>All details on the ZKSync side can be read on <a href=\"https://x.com/zkSyncDevs/status/1829110498471621003\">https://x.com/zkSyncDevs/status/1829110498471621003</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47661-conclusion-and-next-steps-for-aave-on-zksync-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47661-conclusion-and-next-steps-for-aave-on-zksync-4\"></a>Conclusion, and next steps for Aave on ZKSync</h2>\n<p>For obvious reasons, the appearance of this type of bug required a re-evaluation of the ZKSync technology from our side, in order to proceed with a new activation vote of Aave.</p>\n<p>After internal discussion, the next steps are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Detecting an issue so deep in the tech stack is very complicated, requiring complex interaction flows that fairly frequently can only be reached by fuzzing of actions and property checking. At the same time, property checking is simply not possible at the moment, given that the tools available (e.g. Certora) are not covering custom VMs like ZKSync.</p>\n<p>Even if the codebase has some already tests in that direction, we are improving that coverage on fork scenarios. This has some technical obstacles like compilation time of zksolc and other infrastructure limitations, but until it is performed there will be no activation proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We are continuously discussing with Matter Labs of any other potential and realistic thread on compilation stage. Compiler bugs simply exist and happened in the past on for example the Vyper compiler or solc; so even if we know that we can’t have 100% assurance of the lack of them, we want to reduce to the minimum the probability of appearance.<br>\nIn line with that, we are studying reducing optimisations on middle stages to the minimum, and any other threat minimisation strategy. Exact measures are still being decided.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the previous aspects are addressed, and any other that gives us full confidence, we will proceed with a new activation proposal of Aave v3 ZKSync.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a positive note, we would like to highlight that highly frequently, bugs of this nature on the compiler layer are very difficult to detect and usually cause very high damage on anybody suffering them. However, the Aave procedures worked properly and there was pretty early detection, with absolutely zero impact.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We would like to explicitly acknowledge all the contributors involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave Labs (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/aavelabs\">@AaveLabs</a> ) for their work detecting the mis-behaviour on their user interface, and support testing our hypothesis in that environment.</li>\n<li>Certora (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/certora\">@Certora</a> ) for supporting on “low level” research once we formulated an hypothesis on BGD Labs.</li>\n<li>The Aave Protocol Guardian for the fast reaction on protective measures.</li>\n<li>The Matter Labs team for all research and remediation on the Era side, together with what we observed to be a strong security culture.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47661-links-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47661-links-5\"></a>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Logic on Aave being wrongly compiled <a href=\"https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/core/contracts/protocol/libraries/configuration/UserConfiguration.sol#L87\">https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/core/contracts/protocol/libraries/configuration/UserConfiguration.sol#L87</a></li>\n<li>Detailed explanation of the LLVM bug by ZKSync <a href=\"https://x.com/zkSyncDevs/status/1829110498471621003\">https://x.com/zkSyncDevs/status/1829110498471621003</a></li>\n<li>Aave v3 ZKsync activation proposal <a href=\"https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=153\">https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=153</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-zksync-activation-issue-report/18819\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-zksync-activation-issue-report/18819","pubDate":"Thu, 29 Aug 2024 11:15:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-18819"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-zksync-activation-issue-report/18819.rss","#text":"BGD.

The Superlend project was Initially conceived during the <a href=\"https://medium.com/etherlink/the-future-of-defi-insights-from-dca-in-singapore-d543477cdbe6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Etherlink Accelerator in Singapore</a> as a lending and borrowing platform on <a href=\"https://www.etherlink.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Etherlink</a>.</p>\n<p>Our goals include launching our own dedicated money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, while also integrating Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem, such as on Ethereum, Base, and Polygon, into our aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, we are planning to deploy an instance of Aave V3 that will exclusively support ETH and ETH-correlated assets (such as LRTs and LSTs), similar to Aave’s Lido instance on Ethereum. These deployments and integrations will enable users to seamlessly manage their positions within the robust and secure Aave framework, while also allowing Superlend to offer innovative cross-chain liquidity management features. Additional details for the Arbitrum proposal will be provided in the future as we finalize the risk parameters and asset selection. Leveraging Aave’s well-audited and secure infrastructure allows us to accelerate our development without compromising on security, avoiding the complexities and costs associated with building from scratch.</p>\n<p>In recognition of the value provided by the Aave community, we propose a revenue-sharing model, committing to share 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-47635-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47635-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The Aave V3 codebase has established itself as a cornerstone in the DeFi ecosystem, renowned for its reliability, security, and quality. Successful projects like the Spark Protocol and RealT further affirm Aave’s technology and reputation. Superlend’s objectives are twofold: launching our own innovative money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, and integrating the various Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (such as those on Ethereum and Polygon) into our aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, we plan to deploy an instance of Aave V3 focused exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to the Lido instance that Aave has deployed on Ethereum. By doing so, we aim to provide users with a cohesive experience that leverages the strength of Aave’s framework while also showcasing the unique features and innovations that Superlend can bring to the market.</p>\n<p>One of our other motivations for deploying on Etherlink and Arbitrum-like chains using the Aave V3 codebase is to enable a feature for our aggregator that allows users to keep their USDC in the best APY protocol across chains with a single click. After extensive testing with the LayerZero-like cross-chain protocol Across+, as well as flash-loan scripts, we discovered that integrating an Aave deployment with the Portal feature activated, along with a third-party bridge provider, could allow users to move their USDC positions from Compound on Arbitrum to Aave on Optimism seamlessly. In this scenario, Superlend markets can serve as a “temporary station” where liquidity is parked for a few seconds during the transfer. Before making such a feature live, we would, of course, share it first in the forum and seek feedback when it’s ready.</p>\n<p>Superlend’s vision aligns with deploying “friendly” forks of Aave V3, customized for specific use cases and ecosystems, and integrating these Aave V3 deployments by the Aave DAO as a prominent part of our aggregator. Keeping the open-source ethos at the forefront, we believe it is fair and respectful to seek the Aave community’s approval first, ensuring a mutually beneficial path forward for both Aave and Superlend.</p>\n<p>As Aave continues to explore areas like off-chain collateral and new developments such as GHO, projects like Superlend have the opportunity to add value and drive the adoption of Aave’s technology. Our proposal to deploy an Aave V3 fork on Etherlink and Arbitrum represents a strategic opportunity to extend Aave’s influence within the rapidly evolving cross-chain DeFi landscape. In appreciation of this opportunity, we propose a revenue-sharing model to ensure mutual benefit from this collaboration.</p>\n<p>As Aave continues to explore areas like off-chain collateral and new developments such as GHO, projects like Superlend have the opportunity to add value and drive the adoption of Aave’s technology.

These markets will operate independently from our aggregator platform but will be fully integrated within the Superlend ecosystem.

In the case of GHO:USDC, this can result in a surplus of USDC that in current deployed implementation remains idle.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs proposes to build a new instance of GSM that supports external integrations and related control mechanisms, specifically supporting BlackRock’s BUIDL. With this implementation GSM can be more capital efficient while maintaining the high standards of backing as USDC is backing the GHO.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0x7712c34205737192402172409a8f7ccef8aa2aec\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BUIDL</a> is deployed on the Ethereum network, providing onchain access to traditional financial assets managed by BlackRock Financial Management Inc., with BNY Mellon as custodian, Securitize as transfer agent, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the appointed fund auditor. BUIDL offers a novel approach to the digital asset space by combining the reliability of traditional financial mechanisms with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>BlackRock has partnered with Coinbase, Anchorage, Fireblocks, and Digital Bank NA as infrastructure providers, and with Circle for the onchain USDC redemption fund, ensuring instant liquidity for onchain participants.</p>\n<p>BUIDL is priced at $1 per token and pays daily accrued dividends directly to holders wallets in the form of new tokens each month. The fund allocates 100% of its assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, allowing holders to earn yield while holding the token on the blockchain. BUIDL holders can transfer their tokens 24/7/365 to other pre-approved holders. Additionally, fund participants have flexible custody options, allowing them to choose how to hold their tokens.</p>\n<p>The BUIDL fund currently has over <a href=\"https://dune.com/Marcov/blackrock-buidl\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$500 million in issuance</a>, with Circle providing a $100 million USDC redemption fund that guarantees conversion from BUIDL back into USDC for use in the USDC GSM. As of now, the redemption fund has $74.7 million USDC available.</p>\n<p>This GSM implementation sets the technical ability for the Aave DAO, essentially expanding yield sources into real-world assets (RWAs), and increasing the partnership opportunities with BlackRock. Additionally, it provides a hedge against fluctuating yield opportunities in DeFi markets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47567-specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47567-specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>The proposed GSM instance that will run in parallel with already existing GSMs, will enable 1:1 fixed-ratio swaps between USDC and GHO, utilizing the USDC surplus to mint BUIDL tokens. Thanks to instant redeemability between USDC and BUIDL, the GSM can mint and burn BUIDL in exchange for USDC based on user demand, ensuring a seamless experience similar to the existing GHO:USDC GSM. Swap fees will be accumulated in GHO, and dividends will be paid monthly in BUIDL.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcmwQznCM7HzfIuSN6xh8KmiMwM0pT9D2uQMvnfUSznAatzzvLsHP1p5Xg5fBd4PEcXcWPcqef6CtL1N5sPMV6nsbC4zo-GGHVOkFophigit1lZKgo2cYYmqH5duuGGCHzXm21u78P2aKIOssS4XW-reb79?key=WKIs45l2Bg1DCDjJu9_qRA\" alt=\"|\" width=\"1540\" height=\"1000\"></p>\n<p>Architecture may or may not integrate a USDC buffer to compensate the gas redemption cost of BUIDL for small swaps, subject to further evaluation.</p>\n<p>The GSM contract code requires modifications to support GHO &lt;&gt; USDC conversions and dividend reception. Additionally, BUIDL holders must be registered/allowlisted, meaning the GSM itself must also be registered.</p>\n<p>A detailed specification will be shared during the ARFC phase.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47567-next-steps-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47567-next-steps-7\"></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Gather feedback from the community.</li>\n<li>If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.</li>\n<li>If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the ARFC stage.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47567-copyright-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47567-copyright-8\"></a>Copyright</h2>\n<p>Copyright and related rights of this Temp Check waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-buidl-gsm/18775\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-buidl-gsm/18775","pubDate":"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 11:10:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-18775"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-buidl-gsm/18775.rss","#text":"[Temp Check] BUIDL GSM"},"filter":false},{"title":"[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Stewards - Increase Supply and Borrow Caps on Polygon and Base on Aave V3 - 08.24.2024","dc:creator":"ChaosLabs","category":"Governance","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-47547-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47547-summary-1\"></a><strong>Summary</strong></h1>\n<p>A proposal to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase wstETH’s supply cap on Aave’s Polygon deployment.</li>\n<li>Increase WETH’s borrow caps on Aave’s Base deployment.</li>\n<li>Increase weETH’s supply cap on Aave’s Base deployment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-47547-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47547-motivation-2\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47547-wsteth-polygon-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47547-wsteth-polygon-3\"></a><strong>wstETH (Polygon)</strong></h2>\n<p>wstETH has reached 100% supply cap utilization on Polygon, and its borrow cap is at 4% capacity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/5df22b2a0e8e4116748b7123db4fb638d0070f5b.png\" alt=\"image - 2024-08-25T021534.401\" data-base62-sha1=\"dp5fpDYjixG4bxo0XDuVkbmfrRh\" width=\"2000\" height=\"245\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/2d3a5b315383d53dd9072d7998bccb8586a729f7.png\" alt=\"image - 2024-08-25T021536.642\" data-base62-sha1=\"6s6vR2rcD9ZyL7rgS1M1SuvPAjR\" width=\"2000\" height=\"607\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47547-supply-distribution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47547-supply-distribution-4\"></a><strong>Supply Distribution</strong></h3>\n<p>Most of the top wstETH suppliers borrow WETH, with a few maintaining deposit-only positions.

Users deposit assets on Ethereum, which are then used as collateral on our zkRollup. This allows for gas-free transactions, with users only paying transaction fees on the rollup. Additionally, the system is designed to be non-custodial. Users can retrieve their assets with the forced withdrawal even if our server is down. Lastly, we guarantee mathematically that each loan is over-collateralized, ensuring the system’s stability and security.</li>\n<li>How Facilitator is backing GHO:<br>\nWith aTokens, PTs, or LP tokens as the collateral.

If one provides a price that severely deviates from the actual price, loans can be liquidated. To mitigate this, we can use the median price between multiple providers.</li>\n<li>Insufficient Liquidity:<br>\nWe need a certain level of liquidity to liquidate the collateral for a loan. If there isn’t, bad debts could be incurred. We will strategically select highly liquid collaterals to ensure adequate liquidity and implement a conservative, scalable cap structure for maximum borrowable amounts.</li>\n<li>Rug Pull:<br>\nSince we aim to support collaterals issued by third parties, these assets could be worthless should the team behind those protocols disappear.
