Challenges and Opportunities</strong></h3>\n<p>April 2024 presented Aave DAO with unique challenges and opportunities, reflecting the dynamic environment in which decentralized finance operates. Here’s an overview of the key issues and prospects faced by the DAO:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#challenges-9\"></a><strong>Challenges:</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Risk Management in Volatile Markets</strong>: As the cryptocurrency market remains prone to high volatility, Aave’s newly enhanced risk management systems were put to the test. Managing the implications of market swings on asset and GHO stablecoin governance continues to be a complex challenge.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-Chain Integration Complexities</strong>: While expanding GHO stablecoin’s functionality across multiple blockchains, Aave encountered technical and regulatory hurdles. These challenges stem from differing blockchain protocols and the need for compliance with various regulatory frameworks.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance Participation Consistency</strong>: Although governance engagement has been robust, sustaining high levels of participation and decision-making quality in a growing community is increasingly challenging.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"opportunities-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#opportunities-10\"></a><strong>Opportunities:</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>New Asset Classes and Markets</strong>: The exploration and integration of new assets present substantial opportunities for Aave to diversify its portfolio and tap into emerging markets. This move can enhance liquidity and attract a broader user base.</li>\n<li><strong>Educational Initiatives</strong>: By ramping up its community education and outreach, Aave has the opportunity to empower its users with better knowledge of DeFi mechanisms and the specific features of the Aave protocol, fostering a more informed and engaged community.</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralized Governance Tools</strong>: The development of new governance tools offers the chance to streamline operations and enhance transparency in decision-making processes. This could lead to more efficient governance and increased trust among stakeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Partnerships for Liquidity Enhancement</strong>: Collaborations with other DeFi and traditional financial entities could provide Aave with strategic opportunities to boost its liquidity strategies and secure its position as a leader in the DeFi space.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These challenges and opportunities highlight Aave’s proactive approach in navigating the complexities of DeFi, focusing on continuous improvement and strategic growth to maintain and enhance its competitive edge in the ecosystem.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"vii-conclusion-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#vii-conclusion-11\"></a><strong>VII. Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>April 2024 has been a pivotal month for Aave DAO as it continues to push forward with its strategic initiatives and governance enhancements. This month saw significant progress in several areas, including risk management, cross-chain functionality, and community engagement, reflecting Aave’s dedication to creating a more robust and inclusive financial ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The successful onboarding of a new risk management provider and the introduction of new assets are a testament to the DAO’s commitment to continuously enhancing protocol safety and expanding its market reach.

This new system creates a unified look that propels Aave into the future, standing out as DeFi goes mainstream. The Aave identity should not only stand out among crypto brands, but increasingly alongside blue chip financial brands. At the same time, this new visual aesthetic embraces Aave’s heritage as a reliable, resilient and innovative protocol that is accessible, transparent and community governed. The friendly ghost takes new heights.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Today, the Aave logomark gets applied inconsistently across various Aave-supported initiatives, diluting recognition power and potentially causing confusion.</p>\n<p>The aim of this proposal is to present a new, strong and distinctive visual identity  that stands out and supports Aave ecosystem’s continued growth into new frontiers. Our idea is that the logomark should be appropriately flexible for multiple usages and across multiple platforms. As well, Aave’s visual identity should be distinctive within the broader DeFi community and financial industry.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"preserving-aaves-brand-heritage-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#preserving-aaves-brand-heritage-3\"></a>Preserving Aave’s Brand Heritage</h2>\n<p>The Aave ghost is known and beloved within the DeFi community. Several months of research, positioning and design work – led by Avara’s design team and headed by Benji Taylor – went into developing the new proposed logomark to ensure that it retains its core elements while becoming distinctive and instantly recognizable.</p>\n<p>This visual identity honors Aave’s legacy while streamlining and modernizing its look. The process involved collaboration across the Aave ecosystem, targeting a final design that resonates with the community and reflects the Aave DAO’s standing as an industry leader and innovator.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRMpa2oT51A\">Aave | Say Hello</a></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-changes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#proposed-changes-4\"></a>Proposed Changes</h2>\n<p>In the proposal, Aave’s visual identity has undergone a distinctive refresh.

Building on the success of V3, Aave V4 is proposed to be built together with the community with a new architecture that enhances modularity, reduces governance overhead, optimizes capital efficiency, and integrates innovations such as the Aave-native stablecoin GHO more seamlessly. The proposal also introduces ideas for innovative risk management tools and a more efficient liquidation engine, all designed to enhance user experience and security.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs proposes to develop V4 as part of a wider <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-2030/17539\">Aave 2030 grant proposal</a> in a transparent manner, involving the community in feedback and testing phases, with a timeline stretching from initial development in Q2 2024 to a full release by mid-2025.

The launch of V3 in 2022 set the stage for growth by providing a variety of essential new features based on the community’s feedback. As the most significant upgrade to the protocol to date, V3 included an improved user experience, reduced gas costs, increased capital efficiency, new risk management tools, and targeted a seamless flow between V3 markets and different networks. At the time of this writing, Aave has a Market Size of $17B and is available on over twelve networks, with Ethereum being the largest market. V3 has operated successfully through multiple downward cycles thanks to its reliable liquidation engine and consistent risk management.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/fbb0244d091d92783345bbcd201c72442b2124ea.png\" alt=\"growth\" data-base62-sha1=\"zUxe5a93B0H9Gwxq49L2GctJllo\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>Our experience in designing and developing V3 and previous versions of the protocol gives us substantial insight and deep technological understanding. We are proud of our contributions to the Aave DAO and our successful track record supporting the community and its interests.</p>\n<p>The following plan introduces the results of our research for Aave V4 to position the protocol for continued success. We hope the community will consider, discuss and ultimately embrace our ideas in this proposal, which we believe will keep Aave at the forefront of innovation in this space.</p>\n<p>Over the past three years, since the inception of V3, Aave Labs has been analyzing on-chain user behavior and market tendencies to innovate around solutions to improve efficiency and security. The research on V4 builds on V3’s successful features such as eMode, Isolation Mode and granular risk management, while further increasing its integration with the Aave-native stablecoin GHO and introducing a number of other key capital efficiency features, substantially lower gas fees, enhanced UX and risk management innovations. Our ideas below propose a new, efficient architecture and modular design that has the goal of minimizing governance overhead, reducing risk, further optimizing capital efficiency and finally, with immutability in mind – creating a true, immutable and permissionless financial layer over the long run.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-features-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#proposed-features-4\"></a>Proposed Features</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"v4-new-efficient-architecture-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#v4-new-efficient-architecture-5\"></a>V4: New Efficient Architecture</h3>\n<p>One of the key aspects of previous versions of Aave is the evolutionary nature of the three iterations of the protocol. All three versions stem from the same design principles and can be considered as a progressive evolution of the same architecture. By keeping a consistent architecture across different versions, integrators who build on Aave can continue their work without needing to adapt to major changes, which helps to prevent disruptions in their work. While beneficial, this limits innovation. Aave V4 would be built with a completely new architecture with an efficient and modular design, while minimizing the impact on third-party integrators.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"unified-liquidity-layer-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#unified-liquidity-layer-6\"></a>Unified Liquidity Layer</h3>\n<p>The most important architectural change is the proposed introduction of a Unified Liquidity Layer. The liquidity layer generalizes the concept of Portals introduced by Aave V3 and enables a fully agnostic, independent and abstracted infrastructure for liquidity provisioning. The liquidity layer is proposed to manage supply/draw (borrow) caps, interest rates, assets, and incentives, allowing other modules to draw liquidity from it. In contrast to previous versions, the new liquidity layer abstraction is proposed to allow in the future for the Aave DAO to onboard new borrow modules and offboard old ones without needing to migrate liquidity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b102663f5e0683eebab4de10ecaed851baf16e25.png\" alt=\"unified-liquidity-layer\" data-base62-sha1=\"pfTEu0XWWrQsSJ2JwbYeEcduJBr\" width=\"1540\" height=\"1358\"></p>\n<p>This architecture allows adding or improving borrowing features (such as isolation pools, RWA modules, and CDPs) without changing the entire system or the liquidation module. It also avoids the problem of fragmented liquidity that older versions of the protocol had.</p>\n<p>The liquidity layer is capable of natively supporting both supplied and natively minted assets, therefore providing better integration with GHO and other collateralized, Aave native, assets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"fuzzy-controlled-interest-rates-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#fuzzy-controlled-interest-rates-7\"></a>Fuzzy-controlled Interest Rates</h3>\n<p>Based on the same innovative concept currently in development for the interest rate management of GHO, Aave V4 is proposed to feature fully automated interest rates with the ability to adjust both slopes and kink points. Currently this is a governance controlled configuration that introduces governance overhead and sub-optimal capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Fuzzy rules are to be defined to actively control the kink point, moving it according to dynamic market conditions. Base interest rates are to increase or decrease depending on market demand, thus optimizing rates for both suppliers and borrowers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/882d279169a09dfac4250ef0467481ffa85ec229.png\" alt=\"fuzzy-rates\" data-base62-sha1=\"jqFG6MQLE11E8NGnoYjAKi2JwE1\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>The biggest advantage of using fuzzy logic to control the IR curves is the ability to extend the controller indefinitely, feeding as much input data as possible to optimize its behavior. We are actively researching with Chainlink to define a clear set of data feeds needed to implement the most capital efficient interest rate models ever designed on-chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"liquidity-premiums-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#liquidity-premiums-8\"></a>Liquidity Premiums</h3>\n<p>Another novel feature of the liquidity layer is the proposed introduction of the Liquidity Premiums.</p>\n<p>One glaring aspect that was observed in previous versions of Aave is the inability to price borrowing cost appropriately depending on the collateral composition. Riskier collaterals (either because of centralization dependencies or market risk) should be priced accordingly, while with the current iteration of Aave V3 this is not possible. Once an asset gets collateral status, it accesses a wide array of borrowable assets at the same pricing as all other collaterals. This is the case even when the collateral profile may not reflect its current risk profile.</p>\n<p>Liquidity Premiums are proposed to introduce adjusted borrowing costs for borrowers based on their collateral composition. In this model, each asset will be assigned a risk factor that ranges from 0 to 1, and risk factors will be adjusted accordingly depending on dynamic risk conditions and other external risk factors. This will also introduce a Base Rate for borrowers using the strongest, lowest risk collateral (in the case of the Ethereum market, for example, ETH).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b60d5055a614c52748d766b814c8f0f276dfb3ae.png\" alt=\"risk-premiums\" data-base62-sha1=\"pYvqj5GibY4hRUDBbITGbqfCRzw\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>With fine-tuned risk management tools, Liquidity Premiums are capable of further increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol, bringing more yield to suppliers and lower fees to borrowers who use the strongest collaterals. With this capability, the protocol can provide borrowers with less risky collateral a better rate, attracting stronger collaterals to the protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"aave-v4-borrow-module-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-v4-borrow-module-9\"></a>Aave V4 Borrow Module</h2>\n<p>With the new Unified Liquidity Layer, a new Borrow Module is proposed that builds on the strong fundamentals of Aave V3, further improving UX, risk management and safety. The V4 borrow module proposes a set of innovative features that will make the protocol even more safe and easy to use.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"vaults-and-smart-accounts-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#vaults-and-smart-accounts-10\"></a>Vaults and Smart Accounts</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/53701383a45e3b522a2aeabfb89246a3afa44ef6.png\" alt=\"smart-account-vault\" data-base62-sha1=\"bU7KDFWnnhZ8ga1nrvnwJCTvS4K\" width=\"1540\" height=\"1260\"></p>\n<p>V4 marks the introduction of the concept of Smart Accounts, which seek to solve one major UX problem with Aave V3 - the need to use separate wallets to manage positions in cases where a user is borrowing using eMode or isolated assets. The idea is that users will be able to create as many smart accounts as needed using only one wallet, greatly simplifying interactions with the protocol.</p>\n<p>Smart accounts will also enable another major feature that fulfills a need often expressed in the Aave governance forum - Aave Vaults. Vaults are used to allow borrowing without requiring them to supply collateral to the liquidity layer. The collateral is instead deposited in the smart account, non borrowable and locked as long as the borrow position is active, or becomes subject to a liquidation event. This will allow users to further segregate risk, which will consequently reflect on yields for users who instead supply collateral to the liquidity layer. Smart accounts will be built completely on top of Aave V4, further showcasing the composability and flexibility of this new iteration of Aave.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"dynamic-risk-configuration-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#dynamic-risk-configuration-11\"></a>Dynamic Risk Configuration</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/f497462ded62b0677d2afc419729b7822be15e73.png\" alt=\"dynamic-risk-config\" data-base62-sha1=\"yTKBzZcVl214adxRarfGnIYXkJl\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>One of the main challenges with V3 risk management is that risk parameters (mainly what is identified as liquidation threshold) cannot be changed when market conditions change. The reason is that there is only one configuration instance per asset, and every change to the configuration affects both existing and future borrowers. Lowering the liquidation threshold is an action that can cause great discomfort (in the form of unwanted liquidations) and is currently handled very carefully. At the same time, it is a key parameter that should be updated frequently to reduce risk exposure, introducing governance overload.</p>\n<p>Aave V4 proposes a dynamic configuration mechanism per asset, where users are “hooked” to the current configuration of an asset when a borrow takes place. If a new asset configuration is required, a new configuration instance is created. Existing users remain hooked to the previous configuration.</p>\n<p>If the need arises, governance is designed to retain the ability to change previous risk configurations but with added dynamic configuration coupled with automated asset offboarding (see below), however, in the proposed framework the need for making such changes should be drastically reduced.</p>\n<p>The ability to create independent risk configurations is proposed not only to improve risk management and reduce liquidity risk for suppliers, but also to allow offloading risk management functions to external entities without changing the trust assumptions; something that is not possible with the current version of the protocol. We are also researching with Chainlink to explore solutions for full automation of risk management. The idea is to involve utilizing ad-hoc, on-chain feeds to assess asset risk and dynamically adjust risk parameters through control theory or AI.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"automated-assets-offboarding-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#automated-assets-offboarding-12\"></a>Automated Assets Offboarding</h3>\n<p>Together with Dynamic Risk Configuration, V4 proposes a new procedure to automate asset offboarding. Currently, offboarding assets is a long and governance-intensive procedure, where multiple proposals are needed to reduce the asset LTV to 0, progressively reducing the asset liquidation threshold to avoid massive liquidations, ultimately reducing its borrowing power to zero. With Aave V4, when governance triggers an automated offboarding operation, a new configuration is introduced which automatically reduces the liquidation threshold of the asset for new users to zero. Every action on the asset will trigger a progressive reduction of the historical liquidation thresholds, starting from the highest ones, until the liquidation threshold reaches zero for everyone and assets are officially offboarded as collateral. This will offer users a predictable offboarding plan that does not require governance proposals, drastically reducing governance workload.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"automated-treasury-management-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#automated-treasury-management-13\"></a>Automated Treasury Management</h3>\n<p>Aave V3 currently collects Reserve Factor in a variety of assets, that require governance to reallocate to stablecoins or ETH periodically. Aave V4 will propose a reverse auction mechanism where every token collected through reserve factor can automatically be sold to any pre configured asset once a certain threshold is reached, reducing governance overload.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"actions-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#actions-14\"></a>Actions</h3>\n<p>Aave V4 lets users set up custom automatic actions (Actions) in response to decisions made by governance.</p>\n<p>For instance, if governance lowers the risk limit for borrowing on a certain asset (liquidation threshold), users can set up automatic actions to increase collateral for that asset or repay some of the asset to avoid liquidation. Actions limit the need for users to constantly check the governance forum for updates, as they can set custom actions that automatically adjust their position.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidation-engine-v4-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#liquidation-engine-v4-15\"></a>Liquidation Engine V4</h2>\n<p>While the liquidation engine in the current version of the protocol has proven reliability, a few key improvements are planned for Aave V4:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A variable Liquidation Factor:</strong> enough to bring the position back to safety, to reduce the impact on borrowers compared to V3 where up to 50% of the collateral can be liquidated on liquidation event.</li>\n<li><strong>A variable Liquidation Bonus</strong>: factually introducing reverse dutch auctions, linearly increasing the liquidation bonus (and decreasing the protocol fee) as the health factor of the position decreases.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidation Strategies</strong>: different assets can use different liquidation engines to maximize efficiency.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple Parallel Liquidations</strong>: one key aspect that has been identified is that often multiple liquidations happen within the same block. The Aave V4 liquidation engine will allow batch liquidations targeting the same debt/collateral pair together to maximize efficiency for liquidators.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>GHO soft liquidations</strong>: more on this later below.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"excess-debt-protection-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#excess-debt-protection-16\"></a>Excess Debt Protection</h3>\n<p>One of the drawbacks of the shared liquidity model is the risk of contagion in case one asset accumulates excess debt. Excess debt can manifest in a variety of ways, mainly due to custody or liquidity risk. While custody risk can be mitigated through monitoring services, for example the Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve, already having been used in V3 on multiple occasions. However, there is currently no method for clearing excess debt resulting from liquidations.</p>\n<p>Aave V4 proposes a novel mechanism to track insolvent positions and automatically account for the accumulated excess debt. A threshold for the excess debt can be set so that once the threshold is crossed, the asset automatically loses its borrowing power, preventing it from being used to spread the bad debt to other assets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"new-oracle-design-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#new-oracle-design-17\"></a>New Oracle Design</h3>\n<p>Together with Chainlink, we are conducting advanced research for an oracle design aimed at further reducing trust assumptions, detecting outliers and reacting accordingly. We will share more details on this research with the community once the design is ready.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"stronger-gho-integration-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#stronger-gho-integration-18\"></a>Stronger GHO integration</h2>\n<p>Several new features are proposed to integrate GHO with Aave V4 more natively, improving UX and yield for stablecoin suppliers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"native-gho-minting-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#native-gho-minting-19\"></a>Native GHO minting</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the liquidity layer will be proposed to allow natively mint GHO more efficiently than with the current implementation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"gho-soft-liquidations-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gho-soft-liquidations-20\"></a>GHO “soft” Liquidations</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/dae6c12ac30d046e9d8ca7aa126f5d702641bb61.png\" alt=\"soft-liquidations\" data-base62-sha1=\"veutD7H6zpCofeLjFITXopvXaw1\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>This mechanism is similar in concept as the liquidation model first pioneered by crvUSD. A Lending-Liquidating AMM (LLAMM) is proposed to ease liquidations. Liquidity is subdivided in ranges that can be chosen to address the conversion to GHO in market downturns and when buying back collateral in upturns. Compared to the crvUSD, Aave V4 design comes with three main advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can choose which collateral to liquidate to GHO within their basket of collaterals.</li>\n<li>Users can choose which collateral to buy back <strong>within all the assets available on the Aave Protocol (even assets not initially supplied).</strong></li>\n<li>GHO will automatically earn interest (in markets where it can be supplied).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"stablecoin-interest-paid-in-gho-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#stablecoin-interest-paid-in-gho-21\"></a>Stablecoin Interest Paid in GHO</h3>\n<p>V4 proposes a feature that allows suppliers to opt-in to receive interest payments in GHO, rather than the stablecoin they originally supplied. When suppliers choose this option, the interest payments from borrowers are converted into V4 Protocol Controlled Value (PCV), which directly backs the issued GHO.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this feature for the protocol is that, by converting these payments into PCV, the protocol can enhance its capital efficiency. The capital acquired from borrows can be strategically utilized to bolster the stability of GHO, allocated to the GSM, reinvested within Aave itself, or used in other protocols to generate additional yield for the Aave DAO. Users can benefit from receiving GHO interest thanks to reduced reserve factors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"emergency-redemption-mechanism-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#emergency-redemption-mechanism-22\"></a>Emergency Redemption Mechanism</h3>\n<p>V4 proposes an Emergency Redemption Mechanism to handle situations of prolonged and heavy depegging of GHO. When the emergency redemption mechanism is triggered, collaterals of positions with the lowest health factor are gradually redeemed to GHO and their debt is repaid. This, in addition to automated interest rates, soft liquidations and GHO interest repayments, will help scale GHO while ensuring stability and reliability.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"deprecated-features-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#deprecated-features-23\"></a>Deprecated Features</h2>\n<p>V4 proposes to streamline some older features from previous versions that were not used and were kept mostly for compatibility reasons. Their depreciation is expected to make the system simpler and more efficient. The affected features would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Credit Delegation</strong>: Moved to the V4 Smart Accounts.</li>\n<li><strong>Stable Rate:</strong> Deprecated. Borrow modules provide flexibility to define new variable rate strategies, and dynamic parameters enable better user experience and risk mitigation compared to stable rate re-balancing.</li>\n<li><strong>Tokenization</strong>: Positions not natively tokenized. Tokenization is to remain optional and built using ERC 4626 vaults. Internal accounting modified to reflect this, with the removal of any exchange rate or scaled balance. This will reduce the risk of rounding errors and further improve the overall reliability of the protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>LTV Configuration:</strong> With Dynamic Configuration (as there will be no need for a separate LTV parameter).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"gas-optimizations-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gas-optimizations-24\"></a>Gas Optimizations</h2>\n<p>Subject to the new proposed architecture and the removal of deprecated features, initial estimates show a reduction between 30 and 50% in gas fees with V4 technical innovations.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-25\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"development-plan-and-course-of-action-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#development-plan-and-course-of-action-26\"></a>Development Plan and Course of Action</h2>\n<p>Aave Protocol V4 is currently in an advanced research phase. If community approval on the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-2030/17539\">Aave 2030 proposal</a>  is received, the development for Aave V4 is planned as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research phase completion: Q2 2024</li>\n<li>Development starts: end of Q2 2024</li>\n<li>First prototype expected: Q4 2024</li>\n<li>Code completion, auditing and release: Q1-Q2 2025</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s important to highlight a few aspects of this timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave V3 has proven to be a robust protocol that has achieved remarkable growth — for instance, V3 Ethereum’s TVL grew from zero to $7 billion in less than a year. We see that V3 still has capacity to scale, serving as a solid foundation until V4 is ready for production.</li>\n<li>While certain innovations such as fuzzy-controlled interest rates and the new oracle design were researched with Aave V4 in mind, these solutions can be developed independently to be released in advance to function with Aave V3, which is looking to have a new version (3.1) developed by BGD Labs to be released in production soon.</li>\n<li>With V4 and the community required approach to funding, Aave Labs plans to build in public. The idea is to release an initial prototype and finalize its implementation, conduct audits and security assessments with the code accessible to everyone. This will allow community engagement and gathering of feedback, which will result in producing safer and more reliable code.</li>\n<li>While V4 is already in an advanced stage of research, some of the features described above might become subject to changes, be reworked or removed if unexpected development challenges arise.</li>\n<li>Aave Labs maintains an unwavering commitment to security and responsible development. We aim to adhere to the outlined timeline, bearing in mind that prior versions of the Aave Protocol have undergone extensive battle-testing over time. Our plans undergo comprehensive audits, including formal verification, to ensure the highest security standards. While we endeavor to meet the deadlines outlined above, our priority remains the safety and reliability of the protocol, allowing for flexibility to accommodate thorough review, auditing processes and unexpected findings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/fc48dff8cab2a7d6551a948b1cd8064c51079646.png\" alt=\"plus-plus\" data-base62-sha1=\"zZOshXtqTdfngv7QYcRPv4eAeTY\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#next-steps-27\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>This Temp Check is closely tied to the Aave 2030 Vision grant proposal and its purpose is to collect community feedback on the feature improvements of Aave V4.

Building upon the market-leading technologies of Aave V3 and GHO, these ideas, as a conceptual framework, aim to significantly boost the adoption of the Aave ecosystem and scale DeFi to reach the next billion users. Aave Labs suggests a scope for a technical contributor grant to cover the next three years, with an annual review and renewal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"introduction-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#introduction-3\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Aave Protocol has evolved into a leader in decentralized finance recognized for its wide array of assets, conservative liquidation and collateral system, and decentralized governance. Aave has reached this position by continuously implementing risk management and other feature improvements. As a non-custodial liquidity protocol governed by the Aave DAO, Aave has 450k+ token holders who can participate in governance, deciding on all proposed changes to the protocol.</p>\n<p>The Aave Protocol has reached an average of <a href=\"https://x.com/tokenterminal/status/1759210742035746890\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">50% market share</a>, thanks to Aave’s continued innovation, increased brand awareness and the committed participation of its community.</p>\n<p>To remain leaders in DeFi, we welcome the community to discuss, ratify and build together a plan based on a vision for 2030 and beyond.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"aave-to-2030-and-beyond-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-to-2030-and-beyond-4\"></a>Aave to 2030 and Beyond</h2>\n<p>The crypto ecosystem is ever-evolving and growing to attract new users and financial institutions. While currently Aave is the leading Non-LST DeFi protocol in TVL, it cannot be understated how important innovation and brand awareness are for Aave ecosystem’s continued success in the future. It’s exciting to see how in the past two years many contributors have participated in the growth of the Aave DAO, introducing new technologies that have drastically improved the experience for Aave users and community members. A few notable examples include a.DI and Aave Governance V3 by BGD Labs, Skyward and Merit by ACI risk management by Chaos Labs, security contributors including Certora and treasury management contributors TokenLogic and karpatkey.</p>\n<p>In line with the steady advancement of new technologies such as ZK networks, Superchains, and non EVM L1s, Aave Labs is proposing a few key solutions to enhance the Aave Protocol. Given the competitive DeFi landscape, we believe the key to staying ahead is through continued innovation, building and shipping excellent solutions that address the ongoing requirements of the Aave community. The suggested ideas are looking to position Aave at the forefront of DeFi in 2030 and beyond. In the spirit of decentralization, this Temp Check proposes a path and relies considerably on feedback from the community and the participation of contributors for its execution.</p>\n<p>We aim to implement this plan together with the community over the next three years. The structured approach that includes regular community check-ins and renewals is designed to ensure that every step aligns with Aave DAO’s objectives and receives community feedback and support.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs involvement is confined to a three-year grant, wherein our role is that of a technical contributor to the DAO, providing expertise and solutions in alignment with the goals as approved by the DAO for the grant. Any extended vision beyond this period serves only as a conceptual framework, helping the Aave governance visualize the broader trajectory of progress beyond our specific contribution. Aave Labs does not guarantee any involvement beyond the scope of any approved governance proposal, and to prevent reliance on Aave Labs by the DAO, we will seek to reduce our technical contribution progressively throughout the grant period, empowering the community members to continue owning the future of the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solutions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#solutions-5\"></a>Solutions</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"aave-protocol-v4-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-protocol-v4-6\"></a>Aave Protocol V4</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/5ce54ac68c2e3785d833a840f32365a19fa7bb6b.jpeg\" alt=\"v4-feature-overview\" data-base62-sha1=\"dfNbmGZW8qscSYCp6CQHWB4wZwn\" width=\"1540\" height=\"1048\"></p>\n<p>The cornerstone of the 2030 vision is the introduction of Aave V4 – the next iteration of the protocol. We are proud of what the previous versions have accomplished and cannot wait for Aave V4 to showcase the massive step forward the technology will be for the community and the DeFi space.</p>\n<p>Given the number of innovations built into V4, the full explanation is presented in a separate Temp Check <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-protocol-v4-development-proposal/17541\">here</a>. We are excited to unveil the innovations behind the V4 proposal, and we look forward to discussion and feedback from the community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cross-chain-liquidity-layer-ccll-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#cross-chain-liquidity-layer-ccll-7\"></a>Cross-Chain Liquidity Layer (CCLL)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/93ac00ff66d00c9d1d6045b3abcda158e6f0cfc0.png\" alt=\"ccll\" data-base62-sha1=\"l4mHHh0osEywRDEFSr4TYi0onwA\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>When Aave Protocol V3 was initially introduced, one of the main features was <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/developers/whats-new/portal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Portals</a> - the concept of Aave becoming a chain-agnostic, borderless liquidity protocol. Although the idea was ahead of its time, it initially required significant trust assumptions to function effectively. However, technology has evolved rapidly. With the adoption of CCIP, the concept of superchains, and V4’s Unified Liquidity Layer feature, Aave can soon scale to become a fully cross-chain liquidity protocol. This will allow borrowers to access instant liquidity across all supported networks. These improvements have the potential to evolve Portals into the de facto fast lane bridge, leveraging this new infrastructure as a potential revenue source for the protocol.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"gho-and-rwas-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gho-and-rwas-8\"></a>GHO and RWAs</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b641e37cfaca862ce1f83849fa17fefe3726ab03.png\" alt=\"gho-rwa\" data-base62-sha1=\"q0k43d4G5ecVtdGUKW1OrQ4blar\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>Another important development is the emergence and adoption of Real World Assets (RWAs). We believe GHO is the perfect candidate to accommodate the introduction of RWAs within the Aave ecosystem. After the release of Aave Protocol V4, Aave Labs (together with other Aave DAO contributors) would like to focus on innovating solutions around adoption of RWA-based products built around GHO, which will help to scale GHO further as an infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Research on this topic is already underway, and we will be working closely with Chainlink to build the necessary technologies.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"aave-network-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-network-9\"></a>Aave Network</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/01b0490871a60b37229a8aa16f5ba3d606d73415.png\" alt=\"aave-network\" data-base62-sha1=\"eWalLj39Laq9dlaxaVXuspw0ND\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>Aave Labs suggests the introduction of the Aave Network that can serve as the primary hub for Aave and GHO, while remaining multichain and network-agnostic. The network can serve a variety of uses that fulfill requests frequently expressed by Aave users, for example, democratizing access to the Safety Module by lowering cost. The Network can serve as the main voting network for Aave Governance V3 developed by BGD Labs. It can also serve as the primary hub for the Aave cross-chain strategy.</p>\n<p>While Ethereum would remain the home of the Aave DAO and the Aave governance, the network can bring unprecedented growth to Aave and GHO by opening up unexplored markets. We believe there are some key features that should be considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using GHO for fees: with the use of Validium on top of Aave Network, enables cost-effective and micro payments and improves the UX.</li>\n<li>Aave V4 integrated at the network level: Aave V4 will become the main network liquidity hub, with simple integration access for developers.</li>\n<li>AAVE as main staking asset for decentralized validators/sequencers</li>\n<li>Governance control of the Aave Network interfaces to Ethereum through the Aave Governance V3</li>\n<li>Extensive usage of Account Abstraction</li>\n<li>Inheriting the network security from Ethereum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aave Labs will be monitoring the evolution of both L1 and L2 networks with the goal of assisting the DAO in choosing the best technology for this fundamental piece of infrastructure and to make sure key features above are integrated.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"updated-aave-protocol-visual-identity-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#updated-aave-protocol-visual-identity-10\"></a>Updated Aave Protocol Visual Identity</h3>\n<p>To bring together our ideas for the future of the Aave Protocol, we recognize the need for a cohesive and updated visual identity to carry the Aave Protocol into this new chapter. We propose streamlining the Aave visual mark to make it more modern and distinctive within and outside the DeFi space. It is essential that Aave have a distinctive visual mark that reinforces awareness as well as builds brand loyalty. This update is pivotal in propelling the community towards the idea of Aave 2030, ensuring that the visual identity effectively represents the ambitions and supports the community’s strategic goals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/daff14b30853fbad80281a9cb95ad68a7d74adbb.png\" alt=\"aave-visual-id\" data-base62-sha1=\"vfkAZZKJOGHfqqxt1wPoXOm9FqP\" width=\"1556\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<p>This proposed change and its rationale have been described in a separate Temp Check <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-visual-identity/17542\">here</a>, where it can be evaluated, discussed, and if approved by the community, immediately implemented. We welcome feedback on this key element in the associated governance proposal.</p>\n<p>Note: The proposed new Aave Visual Identity will be irrevocably licensed to the Aave DAO. This license will grant the community the broad rights to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and communicate the visual identity for the benefit of the Aave Protocol, the Aave ecosystem, the Aave DAO, and related activities. The use of the visual identity will be strictly prohibited for malicious activities, including but not limited to phishing scams and impersonation. This identity will be separate from that of Aave Labs, which will have its own distinct identity. For the purposes of this proposal, we are using the newly proposed visual identity in an effort to showcase the vision for the brand.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"additional-ideas-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#additional-ideas-11\"></a>Additional Ideas</h3>\n<p>The following ideas are projects that Aave Labs will commit to exploring during the three-year-period, but will not form part of the compensation for this proposal.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"new-products-built-around-aave-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#new-products-built-around-aave-12\"></a>New Products Built Around Aave</h3>\n<p>Aave Labs is planning, in the same three year timeframe, to introduce entirely new DeFi products. While these will be new and independent products, Aave Labs is planning to provide the Aave DAO with significant exposure to these new products and their governance, because these technologies are capable of further propelling the growth of Aave and GHO. However, Aave Labs will work independently to determine the terms and technical implementations of these products until they are ready to be shared with the community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"expanding-aave-protocol-to-non-evm-chains-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#expanding-aave-protocol-to-non-evm-chains-13\"></a>Expanding Aave Protocol to non-EVM chains</h3>\n<p>2023 and 2024 have been amazing years of growth in the crypto space. While the EVM ecosystem leads the way, there have been a number of emergent, non-EVM networks that have gained considerable user traction. The Aave ecosystem’s homebase is (and should be on) Ethereum. However, given the Protocol’s network-agnostic position, we at Aave Labs believe the opportunity to expand to other networks cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p>This aligns with the internal research conducted by the Aave Labs. We are pleased to announce that we are prepared to submit a specific proposal to the DAO shortly. If the proposal is adopted by the DAO, we can move forward swiftly and aim for implementation of the proposal by the end of 2024.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-14\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>To effectively manage and implement the ideas outlined in this Aave 2030 Temp Check, we propose the following approach, broken down into specific goals and timelines.</p>\n<p><strong>First Year</strong></p>\n<p>Agreement Scope:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of a New Aave Visual Identity</li>\n<li>Aave V4 Prototype (Q4 2024)</li>\n<li>Aave V4 Code Completion (Q2 2025)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional Efforts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration with a minimum of one new, innovative GHO facilitator</li>\n<li>Support on the integration of one non-EVM chain</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Second and Third Year:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave Network</li>\n<li>CCLL (Cross Chain Liquidity Layer)</li>\n<li>Research and introduction of RWA product</li>\n<li>Integration with a minimum of one additional non-EVM chain</li>\n<li>A minimum of one Aave Labs product that is intended to propel growth of Aave/GHO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will assess priorities on an annual basis at renewal of this proposal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/bf2ec7fa93355bb673ad0bf732aaa2a49ba35f8c.png\" alt=\"timeline\" data-base62-sha1=\"rhhqlRXiFpaf631aPjwK2nvCUdC\" width=\"1540\" height=\"948\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"funding-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#funding-15\"></a>Funding</h2>\n<p>Historically, Aave Labs sought retroactive funding from the DAO following the development of Aave Protocol V3. This method had its merits and allowed us to innovate and prove success before presenting the accomplishments to the community for compensation. However, the community requested a more proactive engagement model that states and seeks approval for costs in advance.</p>\n<p>We have thus shifted towards proposing a model where we outline the grant roadmap and associated budget in advance. This approach ensures mutual understanding in advance of the proposed work and agreement on the objectives and timeline with sharing and discussing with the community updates along the way.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"requested-budget-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#requested-budget-16\"></a>Requested Budget</h2>\n<p>For the execution of the first year of this three-year plan, Aave Labs requests a grant with a budget of 15M GHO and 25,000 stkAAVE to cover the following costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R&amp;D</li>\n<li>Technical Engineering Resources</li>\n<li>Non-Technical Resources</li>\n<li>Audits (excluding community’s existing agreements with security contributors)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"terms-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#terms-17\"></a>Terms</h2>\n<p>The roadmap to realize our ambitious ideas spans three years, underscoring Aave Labs’ long term commitment.

Periodically, the composition of this group undergoes renewals in which members may join, stay, or leave based on community votes. This process has occurred in the past, with the last renewal taking place in 2022. At present, it’s time for another round of renewals to ensure the Aave Guardians continue to embody the evolving interests and needs of the Aave community.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Aave Guardians play a vital role in protecting the Aave Protocol.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to start a renewal of the aave guardian, allowing for the removal of members who wish to step down &amp; the addition of new members more reflective of the Aave DAO’s current active contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces 2 different Guardians, with a majority of non-common members on each one, and different roles.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protocol-emergency-guardian-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#protocol-emergency-guardian-7\"></a>Protocol emergency Guardian</h3>\n<p>This Guardian is the holder of <code>EMERGENCY_ADMIN</code> role in Aave v3, together with similar role in v2 and surrounding systems.<br>\nGiven that speed is mandatory in an emergency situation, the members recommended are entities really active within the Aave DAO, for example service providers and delegates.</p>\n<p><em>Its multi-sig configuration will be a 5-of-9.</em></p>\n<p>Members proposed (1 representative of each):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chaos Labs (risk service provider).</li>\n<li>Llamarisk (risk service provider).</li>\n<li>Karpatkey (finance service provider).</li>\n<li>Certora (security service provider).</li>\n<li>Tokenlogic (finance service provider).</li>\n<li>BGD Labs (development service provider).</li>\n<li>ACI (growth and business development service provider).</li>\n<li>Ezr3al (Aave DAO delegate).</li>\n<li>Stable Labs (Aave DAO delegate).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"governance-emergency-guardian-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#governance-emergency-guardian-8\"></a>Governance emergency Guardian</h3>\n<p>This other Guardian has an even less frequent role: cancel governance proposal whenever detected as malicious or containing mistakes (detected on the on-chain verification stage by Certora).<br>\nThe rationale of being composed by different members than the Protocol emergency Guardian is that cancellation permissions whenever possible should be held by a different party than protocol-emergency ones. In addition, speed is not as critical as the Protocol emergency Guardian, given that Aave proposals happen during a period of 5 days, and problems can always be detected with enough time-margin.</p>\n<p><em>Its multi-sig configuration will be a 5-of-9.</em></p>\n<p>Members proposed (1 representative of each):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ACI (growth and business development service provider).

Created by stablecoin issuer platform STASIS, EURS mirrors the euro’s value on the blockchain and is supported by assurance mechanisms provided via an ecosystem of liquidity providers, custodians, exchanges, payment platforms, and others. Each token is backed 1:1 by euros held in the company’s reserve accounts (1).</p>\n<p>STASIS is a European Web3 fintech company that develops customer-friendly instruments to manage digital currencies and public blockchains for payments and settlements, e-commerce, and DeFi. This platform has a solid track record and vast expertise in technological, financial, and legal fields. Since all EURS are backed with fiat euro, there is no risk for investors and everyday users, who can always exchange their digital assets to fiat and vice versa thanks to the firm’s Sellback Service (2).</p>\n<p>EURS stablecoin combines experience, trust, technology, and financial infrastructure to enable business growth, narrowing the gap between the European financial and digital asset markets. EURS is the oldest, largest and legal stablecoin, accessible in 175 countries. Issued since 2018, STASIS EURO has zero conflict of interest and is audited by a top global firm — the BDO. All EURS assets are backed on a 1:1 basis with liquid euro balances or cash, and reserves are held at the Lithuanian Central Bank. With over 6B euros transferred on-chain, EURS supports 7 blockchains.</p>\n<p>Since USD-backed stablecoins are heavily dominating the market, Europeans/Asians are regularly forced into undesired dollar exposure with little on-chain hedging options. EURS stablecoin seeks to challenge the U.S. Dollar’s dominance in global financial markets. By 2024, it had become a popular tool for daily transactions, free of risks and volatility inherent in conventional cryptocurrencies. The potential of stablecoins use cases has been recognized in times of crisis, and the demand for EURS is growing steadily in the DeFi field.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Increase Borrowing Limit: Raising the borrowing limit for EURS will allow for larger positions, accommodating the needs of users who require higher liquidity for trading, yield farming, or hedging.</li>\n<li>Remove the Isolation Status: Currently, EURS is designated as an isolated asset, which means it can only be used as collateral for borrowing the same asset. Removing this restriction will enable EURS to be used as collateral for borrowing other assets, thereby enhancing its utility and integration into the broader AAVE ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Risk Assessment: Preliminary risk assessments indicate that EURS maintains robust backing and compliance with relevant financial regulations, suggesting that adjustments to its borrowing parameters are justified. Further analysis and community discussion are encouraged to validate these findings.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"benefits-for-aave-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#benefits-for-aave-4\"></a>Benefits for AAVE</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced liquidity: Increasing the borrowing limit and removing isolation status will enhance liquidity, making it easier for users to execute larger transactions and strategies.</li>\n<li>Increased adoption: EURS’s improved utility could lead to increased adoption, benefiting the AAVE ecosystem by attracting a larger and more diverse user base.</li>\n<li>Risk diversification: Allowing EURS to be used for a broader set of borrowing options helps diversify the risk profile of the assets on the AAVE platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#next-steps-5\"></a>Next Steps</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Receive the comprehensive feedback from the AAVE community on this proposal through discussions and Governance Forum.</li>\n<li>Conduct an on-chain voting of the proposed changes and ensure alignment with AAVE users expectation.</li>\n<li>Upon approval, coordinate with the AAVE development team for the technical implementation of the changes in the smart contracts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Community and Communication:</strong></p>\n<p>STASIS is active on Telegram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Discord server. The project team also maintains a YouTube account (3). STASIS and EURS are often mentioned in global press media (4). Gregory Klumov, the founder and CEO of the STASIS EURS project, is the project’s main spokesperson (5), often sharing his views on crypto. The STASIS website includes a mailing address in lsle of Man, and a contact e-mail (6).</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to adapt the EURS offerings on the AAVE platform to meet the evolving needs of the community while ensuring stability and security within the ecosystem. The proposed adjustments to the borrowing limits and isolation status of EURS on Polygon are designed to enhance its functionality and support broader financial activities on the platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open discussion in the forum for community feedback.</li>\n<li>Adjust the proposal based on community input and expert analysis.</li>\n<li>Proceed to a Snapshot vote if the discussion indicates general community support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Product videos</strong></p>\n<p>Team’s expertise video</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEGr3M2WZE0&amp;t=49s\">Helping decision-makers climb the learning curve in E-money 2.0</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Project Review</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWqRgi6gkPE\">STASIS / EURS - The Largest And Most Transparent Euro-backed Stablecoin In 2021 // STASIS Wallet</a></p>\n\n<p>STASIS Wallet Introduction</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJXKH6hG2-Q\">How to start using the STASIS stablecoin Wallet</a></p>\n\n<p>STASIS Wallet</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxViGuzITXM\">How to exchange cryptocurrencies in STASIS Stablecoin Wallet</a></p>\n\n<p>References</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://stasis.net/transparency\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Transparency and reserve verification</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://webapp.scb.io/service/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://webapp.scb.io/service/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Social media accounts</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog: <a href=\"https://medium.com/stasis-blog/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">STASIS Blog - Medium</a> <a href=\"https://stasis.net/blog\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">News, stories &amp;

This is equivalent to 36,500 units of AAVE emissions per year worth an estimated $3,394,500 at an AAVE price of $93.00/unit. The current annualised accrued GHO revenue, with 50M units of supply and Borrow Rate of <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3206348/5447167\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">12.26%</a> is 6.13M. The Aave DAO’s GHO revenue is sufficient to replace the AAVE emissions to stkGHO holders and meaningfully contribute to offsetting other DAO expenses like <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-is-forever-reward-system-program-extension/17336\">Merit</a>.</p>\n<p>With a bullish GHO revenue outlook, migrating stkGHO holders’ rewards from AAVE to GHO is a positive step forward for Aave DAO. As a direct result of this proposed change, the AAVE Emissions runway is extended by 13.89%. After a successful migration of stkGHO rewards to GHO, other Safety Modules can be evaluated for similar adjustments. In particular, stkBPT would make a good candidate once GHO supply is large enough to cover the corresponding $AAVE emissions.</p>\n<p>Given the recent price action in the AAVE price and the resulting lower yield on the stkGHO category, this publication propose a 20% yield on current GHO deposits.

For example, on Ethereum, there are 58 wallets that are both supplying and borrowing more than 10,000 USDC. This leads us to recommend two different options on which the community can decide: a more aggressive LT reduction, which will result in more liquidations but help reduce LT more quickly and a conservative LT reduction, which will prioritize limiting liquidations. For all options, we recommend decreasing LTV to the target of 75%.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ltltv-reduction-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#ltltv-reduction-3\"></a>LT/LTV Reduction</h2>\n<p>The overall goal of our stablecoin LT/LTV reduction is the same as on V3, ultimately achieving the following parameters:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Final LTV</th>\n<th>Final LT</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>75.00%</td>\n<td>78.00%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><em><strong>USDC (Ethereum)</strong></em></p>\n<p>Currently, reducing LT would require inducing a significant number of liquidations; a reduction of just 0.50% would create $137K in new liquidations, and a 2% reduction would create $200K in new liquidations. This is largely caused by two users (<a href=\"https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xb60bda0bab52839a3334bd849d2afb2aa566e631\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xf451d30a7ac2e56f52a36825b155b0ac1fb7a867\">2</a>), both of whom are looping USDC with itself.

More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"chain-to-be-deployedlisted-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#chain-to-be-deployedlisted-7\"></a>Chain to be deployed/listed</h3>\n<p>Aave V3 on Avalanche.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"technical-details-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#technical-details-8\"></a>Technical Details</h3>\n<p>With the recent implementation of <a href=\"https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=51\">Price Cap Adapters (CAPO)</a>, ggAVAX can be listed using an internal rate oracle without relying only on the AVAX/USD ChainLink price feed. This is the same approach that AAVE currently uses for sAVAX, wstETH, cbETH, weETH and other LSTs (and LRTs)</p>\n<p>ggAVAX’s CAPO, however, might require a max growth ratio higher than the 10.1% currently set for sAVAX to account for a generally higher level of yield.</p>\n<p>We welcome any questions about ggAVAX architecture and protocol structure and look forward to working on this with the DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proof-of-liquidity-pol-and-deposit-commitments-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#proof-of-liquidity-pol-and-deposit-commitments-9\"></a>Proof of Liquidity (POL)  and Deposit Commitments</h3>\n<p>GoGoPool has earmarked 10k GGP tokens (worth +100K USD at average 90-day prices) for incentivising ggAVAX deposits into AAVE over the first three months of the listing to help bootstrap the market adoption and attract leverage takers.</p>\n<p>After the listing is complete, we plan to work tightly with Avalanche ecosystem partners to integrate the market into their products. This can include autocompounding vaults, composite strategies and auto-leverage vaults.</p>\n<p>These and other integrations would help drive usage to the ggAVAX market specifically and AAVE in general.

This was designed as an initial and interim distribution, with the sole objective of providing liquidity for users affected as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the service provider of the Aave DAO and the Ampleforth team completed further analysis for a final distribution proposal; this one.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a><strong>Specification</strong></h2>\n<p>To fully understand the problem at hand and the rationale of this distribution, we recommend mandatorily reading its specification on the Aave forum <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886/155\" class=\"inline-onebox\">AMPL problem on Aave v2 Ethereum - #155 by ChaosLabs</a>, to make an informed decision.</p>\n<p>In summary, this proposal recommends making claimable 758’000 stablecoins from the Aave Ethereum Collector, in addition to the already distributed 300’000 USDC, making a total of approximately $1,057,677.</p>\n<p>Some key points output of the analysis are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decisions when doing the analysis have been made to favor aAMPL holders, whenever it was subjective generally, but always trying to maintain objectivity on the expected dynamics of AMPL on Aave.</li>\n<li>Real returns of supplied AMPL on Aave have been recalculated from the freezing period until the expected execution time of the proposal (beginning of May 2024). This approach, compared to calculating from market inception, preserves four times more AMPL for users, maximizing welfare for AMPL suppliers.</li>\n<li>The previous analysis resulted in identifying a claimable amount of 351,579 AMPL as of December 16th, 2023, after rectifying highly evident artificial inflation within the 764,303 aAMPL total supply. As a reference point, debt levels were observed to be at 42,847 AMPL during that period.<br>\nAs further compensation for the time passed since December during which funds were not withdrawable, the latest on-chain rate is applicable on the 351’579 AMPL: 256% compounding for more than 4 months, which results in a total of 882’869 AMPL, or $1,057,677.</li>\n<li>Uniform 100% utilization from 16th December 2023 to the beginning of May 2024 is considered, disregarding the underlying rebases of AMPL. This also tries to heavily increase the amount received by aAMPL holders, as once again, debt levels are currently just 72K vAMPL, compared to the much greater compensation amount.</li>\n<li>Pricing claims at $1.198 price per AMPL, despite the price falling below and negative rebases accruing on the aAMPL supply since.</li>\n<li>Any holding by the Aave Collector contract is not included in the compensation, to increase the amount received by other aAMPL holders.</li>\n<li>Interest generated from the 300’000 available on 17th April to withdraw is discounted, as those funds are fully claimable by users.</li>\n<li>Minor adjustments may occur during the AIP stage but will not significantly impact the compensation amount.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Ampleforth team agreed to compensate 40% of the total after proposal execution, as stated on <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886/128\">https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886/128</a>, which will be done after Aave fully approves this distribution.</p>\n<p>Regarding the technical details, the proposal will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initiate a distribution campaign of the 758’000 stablecoins (or any other stablecoin recommended by Aave treasury service providers) on the <a href=\"https://app.merkl.xyz/\">Merkle platform</a>, which has already been used for the initial interim distribution.</li>\n<li>Optionally, authorize any further technical update on the AMPL v2 Ethereum reserve to be done if required on the AIP stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"disclaimer-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#disclaimer-4\"></a><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h2>\n<p>This proposal was created by BGD Labs and Chaos Labs within their respective engagements for technical services with the Aave DAO.

decrease in DSR—from 13% to 10%—we believe it is prudent to update Aave stablecoin interest rates to best align with the broader market. Previously, we <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stablecoin-ir-curve-amendment-on-aave-v2-and-v3/16864/2\">recommended</a> increasing both UOptimal and Slope1 for stablecoins to reduce rate volatility. This recommendation was <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stablecoin-ir-curve-amendment-on-aave-v2-and-v3/16864/2\">amended</a> on the news of the DSR increase from 5% to 15%.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/53371da5aa592196424eabd7c2b90a7f91811a2f.png\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-22T155727.548\" data-base62-sha1=\"bS9IkVZGl8yZbdrk9KiaY4LPQv5\" width=\"1004\" height=\"622\"></p>\n<p>The new parameters went into effect on April 4, 2024, and thus far have helped improve rate stability and utilization rates. As part of our ongoing monitoring of broader markets, we note that MakerDAO is in the process of reducing the DAI Savings Rate, which could impact stablecoin rates throughout DeFi.</p>\n<p>Following our methodology laid out in previous <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stablecoin-ir-curve-amendment-on-aave-v2-and-v3/16864/2\">recommendations</a>, we recommend more closely aligning Slope1 with the DSR to reduce the opportunity of rate arbitrage and ensure that borrow rates remains competitive. As a result, we propose decreasing Slope1 by an equivalent amount from 12% to 9%.</p>\n<p>Caveats:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We do not recommend an update to the following assets on lower-cap stablecoins on Ethereum V2, as they are currently being deprecated.</li>\n<li>Similar to the previous proposals, we recommend bridged USDC.e on all deployments to have a 1% higher slope1 to motivate the borrowing of
