Merit Round 1 resulted in approximately 165k ETH leaving Morpho and growing Aave’s market share. The Morpho product is now imbalanced (limited to a 52k ETH capacity), ensuring it will not offer additional yield on top of Aave, thus achieving its primary goal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support the GHO stablecoin peg, fostering supply growth and revenue expansion while maintaining a stablecoin base for the safety module:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>StkGho supply increased by 45%.</li>\n<li>GHO supply grew by 40%.</li>\n<li>The GHO borrow rate was increased to 13.8%.</li>\n<li>GHO peg remained within target rate 97% of the time.</li>\n<li>GHO protocol revenue grew significantly, reaching approximately 6.5m$/year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Merit Round 2 involved 1367 eligible users, with Staker &amp; Strakoor being the largest booster (over 100 users), indicating a strong user trust in the Aave protocol and willingness to participate in the Safety module for yield and discounted GHO borrowings.</p>\n<p>Building on these positive outcomes from the first two Merit rounds, the ACI proposes extending the funding of Merit for an additional four periods (three merit rounds per period). This proposal would approve Merit’s continuation for the next 12 months.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"operational-aspects-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#operational-aspects-4\"></a>Operational aspects:</h3>\n<p>We propose Aave Finance incorporates Merit funding within their Treasury Management AIPs if this proposal is approved by a DAO snapshot vote. Our successful collaboration with Angle Protocol and their Merkl product will continue, with the ACI producing user-friendly applications for Merit beneficiaries and providing relevant data to the DAO.</p>\n<p>At present, we do not propose making any changes to boosters or diluters within Merit; however, ad-hoc ARFC snapshot votes can be used by the DAO to modify these aspects of Merit at any time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"budget-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#budget-considerations-5\"></a>Budget considerations:</h3>\n<p>The Aave DAO currently enjoys an excess annual net profit of 80m$. The ACI considers allocating 20m$/year to Merit a worthwhile investment, as it supports Aave protocol market shares and boosts DAO revenue. The expected returns, particularly with GHO, are anticipated to be noteworthy.</p>\n<p>Should the DAO decide to discontinue Merit due to unsatisfactory returns or lower profits stemming from market conditions in the future, an ad-hoc ARFC vote can terminate Merit funding and limit budget exposure.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"learnings-from-the-previous-rounds-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#learnings-from-the-previous-rounds-6\"></a>Learnings from the previous rounds:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The wETH “spray &amp; pray” approach has been underwhelming for most users due to the large scale of Ethereum borrowing on Aave (2B$). Despite this, wETH Merit was a resounding success in achieving its goals through the behavior of a subset of “whales” who recognize the value of Merit based on their substantial positions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To address this, this proposal grants flexibility to Aave Finance and the ACI to allocate a part of the wETH Merit budget towards targeting influential users.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The Ethereum-centric nature of the GHO Merit program generated some minor backlash due to high Ethereum network transaction fees. With the introduction of cross-chain GHO, we have an opportunity to deploy a “cross-chain” merit system in collaboration with L2 safety modules and L2 StkGHO.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To achieve this goal, this ARFC grants flexibility to Aave Finance and the ACI to allocate a portion of Merit budget to L2 markets following the deployment of cross-chain GHO.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Some “sleepy” liquidity will likely never claim merit airdrops. To increase program efficiency and resource allocation optimization, this proposal greenlights redistributing unclaimed funds to subsequent merit rounds if a user hasn’t claimed during six merit rounds.<br>\nAs an example, unclaimed funds from Round 1 can be allocated to boost the Round 7 budget.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-7\"></a>Specification:</h2>\n<p>If this proposal is approved by a snapshot YAE vote, Aave finance will incorporate Merit budget within their monthly Treasury Management AIPs.

This is an annual amount.  We made this request last <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/defisafety-quality-certificates/11593\">year</a> and it was granted via a grant. This year when we talked to the grant team they stated it would be better funded by the DAO as the grant team does not want to fund regular costs.</p>\n<p>The DeFiSafety Quality Certificate acts as a badge of quality for users who do not understand a list of smart contract audits.  We ask that the certificate logo is added to the security page of the AAVE documents and for context of liquidity providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation - Why should AAVE support DeFiSafety?</strong></p>\n<p>Our goal is to give users of DeFi a badge of quality they can understand, audit and trust. A list of audits means nothing to most users . In order for good protocols to gain the trust of a larger audience, a clear and understandable badge of quality is required.  We want an equivalent to ISO 27001 or SOC2 but for DeFi.</p>\n<p>The DeFiSafety Quality Certificate this request funds is that badge.  The certificate itself is the gold badge evident on the recent reports for AAVE V3 (<a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/597\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AAVE V3 - detailed report | DeFiSafety</a>) and AAVE V2 (<a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/598\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AAVE V2 - detailed report | DeFiSafety</a>) and our reviews page(<a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.defisafety.com/app</a>).  It indicates quality and refers to a human readable, auditable report with references.  We know that a high DeFiSafety score does not guarantee there will be no security events. But it does provide assurance that the protocol is following best practices and has auditable transparency.</p>\n<p>In addition to the financial funding requested here, there are other steps where the AAVE community could significantly help. The first is simple. Please support us by placing the DeFiSafety quality certificate logo on the security page of the AAVE Gitbook.  We understand this is an AVARA decision and we are working on that conversation. Any support representatives of the DAO can give would assist.</p>\n<p>Also, any connections with liquidity providers would be appreciated. If quality certificates are going to become popular, liquidity providers will drive acceptance. For many DeFi protocols will not fund a quality certificate without a clear financial incentive.  If a liquidity provider requires a DeFiSafety quality certificate before depositing funds in a DeFi protocol, then this is the incentive the DeFi protocol needs. It also greatly assists the liquidity provider by giving a minimum benchmark in quality and transparency of DeFi protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Specification</strong></p>\n<p>Inclusion of the DeFiSafety Quality Certificate logo [html avaiable upon request] on the AAVE docs Security and Audits page and/or on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>Duration &amp; Proposed Budget</strong></p>\n<p>15k  single milestone<br>\nDuration of certificate:  one year from payment of milestone</p>\n<p><strong>Useful Links</strong></p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">defisafety.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:192/44;\"><img src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/images/light/logo-desktop.svg\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"192\" height=\"44\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Process Quality Reviews | DeFiSafety</a></h3>\n\n  <p>DeFiSafety description</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/597\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">defisafety.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:192/44;\"><img src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/images/light/logo-desktop.svg\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"192\" height=\"44\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AAVE V3 - detailed report | DeFiSafety</a></h3>\n\n  <p>DeFiSafety description</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/598\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">defisafety.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:192/44;\"><img src=\"https://www.defisafety.com/images/light/logo-desktop.svg\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"192\" height=\"44\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.defisafety.com/app/pqrs/598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AAVE V2 - detailed report | DeFiSafety</a></h3>\n\n  <p>DeFiSafety description</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Thank-you for your attention and I am available for any questions or comments.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-defisafety-quality-certificate/17327\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-defisafety-quality-certificate/17327","pubDate":"Wed, 10 Apr 2024 23:27:40 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-17327"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-defisafety-quality-certificate/17327.rss","#text":"[Temp Check] DeFiSafety Quality Certificate"},"filter":true},{"title":"[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - OP on V3 Optimism","dc:creator":"ChaosLabs","category":"Governance","description":"<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>A proposal to increase OP’s liquidation threshold and LTV on Aave V3 Optimism.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>OP is currently configured with a liquidation threshold (LT) of 40% and max loan-to-value (LTV) of 30%.

This was aligned with the feedback from major Aave stakeholders and delegates. However, the expansion of Aave to multiple chains, in addition to the increased volatility and activity across DeFi and crypto, has significantly increased our scope and workload, necessitating additional resources to maintain the high level of service required.</p>\n<p>As dedicated risk contributors, Chaos Labs adopts a holistic approach to managing the spectrum of responsibilities within Aave’s ecosystem, including V3, GHO, and the continued offboarding of V2. Our commitment encompasses risk management, data science, analytics, and parameter recommendation, among other critical functions. An amendment to our compensation is essential to reflect better the resources committed, the depth of our engagement, and the substantial value we bring to the Aave community.</p>\n<p>Considering improved market conditions and Aave’s growth over the past several months, we believe the DAO is now in a position to revise our compensation to more accurately reflect the current scale and impact of our engagement and allocated resources.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"enhancing-aaves-risk-management-framework-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#enhancing-aaves-risk-management-framework-3\"></a>Enhancing Aave’s Risk Management Framework</h3>\n<p>The proposed compensation amendment is not merely a financial adjustment but a continued investment in our collaboration.

Sometimes, the improvements can be made in isolation in independent upgrades, for example, almost 1 year ago, we introduced a <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Aave-v3-1-ec65747a39cf41d7b984c841fd7468f7?pvs=21\">new 3.0.2 version</a>, including only relatively minor changes and bug fixes.</p>\n<p>However, since 3.0.2, we had multiple other ideas on the backlog heavily focused on security and optimisation, that over time got validated due to security incidents on similar protocols and by observing operational overhead for Aave contributors (e.g. governance proposals changing parameters). As some of this features in some cases were dependent between each other, end of 2023 we decided to batch them together in a new major-minor Aave v3 version we present here: Aave v3.1.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"aave-v31-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-v31-3\"></a>Aave v3.1</h1>\n<p>v3.1 is clearly focused in 2 fields: redundant security and optimisation of the logic to reduce operational overhead.<br>\nWith those principles in mind, the following is an detailed list of the changes/improvements included into this release.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"features-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#features-4\"></a>Features</h2>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-virtual-accounting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-1-virtual-accounting-5\"></a>1. Virtual accounting</h3>\n<p>Aave v3, is what we technically call a “dynamic” system in terms of underlying balances of ERC20 tokens. For example, to calculate utilisation and rates, the system checks how is the balance of underlying (e.g. USDC) on its aToken contract (aUSDC), and compares it with outstanding debt. Or to validate if there is enough funds for withdrawals, the system depends on not reverting on transfer() from the aToken to the user withdrawing; so also depending on ERC20 balances.</p>\n<p>This is generally perfectly fine, but from our experience, a system like Aave should be a bit more static, meaning being less sensible to operations that don’t follow explicit interaction paths. The most classic example of this is that a donation to the aToken address of underlying should not have any effect on the stored state of the system.</p>\n<p>The virtual accounting feature is very simple high-level: whenever there is an inflow of X capital to the protocol, that is accounted for in storage by adding X to the virtual balance variable of the specific asset; whenever there is an outflow, the opposite.</p>\n<p>As a consequence of this, Aave has an extra layer of protection (apart from other existent ones) for different type of attack vectors used in the past of other DeFi system, following a classic security approach of defense-in-depth.</p>\n<p>In terms of implementation, the proposal adds an optional <code>virtualUnderlyingBalance</code> field for assets listed on Aave (not always used, for example on GHO), which gets modified on every action causing an inflow or outflow of capital, like on <code>supply()</code>, <code>borrow()</code>, <code>withdraw()</code>, <code>liquidationCall()</code>, etc.</p>\n<p>The virtual balance is also now used in the interest rate strategy contract, in replacement of the aforementioned balanceOf() of underlying in the aToken. Now the formula of utilisation becomes high-level: <code>utilisation = total debt / (virtual balance + total debt)</code></p>\n<p>This new feature doesn’t create any incompatibility with Aave v3 integrations, being just additive: the asset data returned on <code>getReserveData()</code> is still the same as before without <code>virtualUnderlyingBalance</code>, but integrators can opt-in to use a new <code>getReserveDataExtended()</code> or directly <code>getVirtualUnderlyingBalance()</code> .</p>\n<p>Given its implications and criticality, virtual accounting can be considered the major feature of Aave 3.1.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-stateful-interest-rate-strategy-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-2-stateful-interest-rate-strategy-6\"></a>2. Stateful interest rate strategy</h3>\n<p>Having reviewed countless Aave governance rates updates, we noticed time ago that connecting new strategy contracts is a process prone to errors. To solve that, in the past we introduced an on-chain rate strategy factory, that completely removed that error-vector, deploying new rates automatically and efficiently.</p>\n<p>However, as the rate strategy for this 3.1 needed to be changed to support virtual accounting, we decided to go a step forward and move the parameters of the rate to an storage mapping, instead of having them as immutables on separate contracts for each asset.</p>\n<p>Implementation-wise, this feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defines a single default interest rate smart contract, to be connected to all assets listed, including those requiring a fixed rate like GHO.

The rationale is that on very high configured rates (e.g. hundred thousands %), predicting how the protocol reacts with specific assets’ configurations becomes very chaotic.

Liquidations grace sentinel</h3>\n<p>During one security incident that required pausing the protocol we noticed that could be important to introduce a grace period for users to refill their positions or repay debt, just after the system is unpaused, for them to avoiding liquidation. This is a similar approach as with the L2 Sentinel, allowing for a grace period (in that case stopping borrowing too) whenever a downtime on a rollup network is detected.</p>\n<p>Initially we followed the same approach as with the FreezingSteward mentioned before, and introduced on Aave v2 (the system that was affected by the pause) a <code>LiquidationsGraceSentinel</code> registry/steward contract, allowing for the emergency admin to define a “delayed” pause for any asset.</p>\n<p>However, at that point in time the mechanism was not needed on Aave v3 and slightly more complex to implement. So we postponed it until now, to make it a fully native mechanism to Aave v3.</p>\n<p>Implementation-wise, this feature adds a  <code>gracePeriod</code> input parameter to pass whenever an asset is to be unpaused, which will act as a delay for liquidations.<br>\nApart from being totally optional (it is possible to just unpause without any delay), it is heavily limited to a maximum value of 4 hours and we will recommend risk provider to always use it with maximum caution, as even if for users affected will give a window to refill collateral, it will still allow to borrow.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-7-ltv0-on-freezing-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-7-ltv0-on-freezing-11\"></a>7. <strong>LTV0 on freezing</strong></h3>\n<p>On previous freezing incidents, we have also noticed that when freezing an asset on v3, the correct approach, apart from halting deposits and borrows, would be to “remove” the collateral power of the asset for opening or increasing borrow positions.<br>\nFor this reason, in this 3.1 we have added setting LTV to 0 atomically when freezing an asset, returning to the previous LTV value when unfreezing.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-8-permission-less-movement-of-stable-positions-to-variable-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-8-permission-less-movement-of-stable-positions-to-variable-12\"></a>8. <strong>Permission-less movement of stable positions to variable</strong></h3>\n<p>Consequence of a security vulnerability detected end of next year related with stable rate mode and affecting more on Aave v2, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-full-deprecation-of-stable-rate/16473\">we proposed to completely deprecate it</a>.</p>\n<p>After getting extra approval by the community on the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb58ef33b4b7f4c35b7a6834b24f11b282d713b5e9f527f29d782aef04886c189\">ARFC stage</a>, we have included on this 3.1 a function to allow permission-less movement of stable rate debt positions to variable, which factually will off-board all users borrowing at stable to variable.</p>\n<p>Implementation-wise, this adds a <code>swapToVariable()</code> function in the Aave pool, allowing any address to swap any stable rate user to variable, without changing anything else in the position.</p>\n<p>This will only affect those v3 instances where stable rate was active at some point, so for example will not be applicable to Aave v3 Ethereum.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"h-9-allow-setting-debt-ceiling-whenever-lt-is-0-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-9-allow-setting-debt-ceiling-whenever-lt-is-0-13\"></a>9.

Presently maintaining a Supply Cap set at 1,200 ETH units, Metis faces the imperative to adapt to escalating liquidity demands and ensure stable market dynamics. In response, a proposal is presented to elevate the Supply Cap to 2,050 ETH units. This strategic adjustment is deemed essential to accommodate the anticipated influx of assets and optimize utilization rates within the ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The rationale behind the proposed elevation of the Supply Cap for Metis is deeply rooted in observed liquidity trends and borrowing patterns within the ecosystem. With approximately $1,250,000 in available liquidity earmarked for stablecoin borrowing, it is projected that an infusion of $2,500,000 worth of ETH collateral is necessary to optimize utilization rates. Additionally, an extra $500,000 infusion is indispensable to forge a resilient market terrain capable of exceeding optimal utilization thresholds.

As a result, deposit yield converged to zero and the capital efficiency of Aave v2 has been reduced on Polygon.</p>\n<p>With the RF now approaching the maximum across all reserves, this publication seek to gradually increase the cost of capital via periodic borrow rate adjustments, every two weeks in a predictable fashion.</p>\n<p>Based upon recent borrow rates behaviour, the market has demonstrated the ability to withstand periods of elevated borrowing rates.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"non-frozen-assets-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#non-frozen-assets-3\"></a>Non Frozen Assets</h2>\n<p>For non-frozen assets, this proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 parameter by 75bps every two weeks, or 1.5% per month, to encourage further migration of users from v2 to v3. The outcome of this <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe2dd228640c3cad93f5418c40c4b5743b3c6c85aa0aae9eee53cbdbca2ed5c2d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vote</a> has been taken into consideration when drafting the current IR parameters included in this proposal.</p>\n<p>The Slope2 parameter is to be revised to discourage utilisation exceeding the Uoptimal value. Note, several reserves are experiencing utilisation marginally exceeding Uoptimal.</p>\n<p>As utilisation of each reserve decreases over time, the Uoptimal will be periodically lowered to discourage new debt positions emerging. Any proposed changes to the Uoptimal parameter will be presented via a separate ARFC.</p>\n<p>Upon implementation, this change will not trigger liquidation of any users funds and will gradually increase the cost for users who remain on v2. Please note, there is a Migration Tool that was developed by BGD to aid users migrating from v2 to v3.</p>\n<p>Assets in scope: DAI, MATIC, wBTC, wETH, USDC and USDT.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"frozen-assets-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#frozen-assets-4\"></a>Frozen Assets</h2>\n<p>Each frozen reserve contains a small portion of funds with a very minimal amount of debt. For these assets we recommend a more aggressive implementation: reduce the Uoptimal to 10.00%, revise Slope1 to 50.00% and Slope2 to 500.00% - with  the exception of BAL, which receives a Uoptimal of 20% due to current utilisation being around 15%.</p>\n<p>Assets in scope: BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK and SUSHI.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-5\" class=\"anchor\"

This initial OEV research looks for ways to return value to Aave DAO.</p>\n<p>As seen with the discussion around the<a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-integrate-oval-for-the-bal-snx-ethereum-v3-markets/16475\"> Oval proposal by UMA</a> which kick-started the discussion around OEV, there was a lot of interest within the DAO to understand how Aave can potentially benefit from OEV capture. However, the primary feedback to the Oval proposal consisted of the following elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The revenue estimates required more analysis from the Aave community and contributors.</li>\n<li>Oval is a ‘generic’ solution which proves the benefit of OEV capture but may not be applicable for Aave’s needs.</li>\n<li>Given the criticality of OEV, multiple teams should be involved in the development to build such a solution for Aave and there should be a formal framework in place for Aave DAO to review the teams involved and select the most appropriate members for Aave’s purposes.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, there are other possible ways to capture OEV as example, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/marczeller\">@MarcZeller</a> proposed various solutions in his response on the Oval thread that could be explored further.</li>\n<li>The question of how Aave DAO should distribute captured OEV is up for debate - whether it should go only to the DAO, infrastructure providers, AAVE token holders, other stakeholders, or combinations of these groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To that end, this proposal aims to create a structured process via which Aave DAO can tackle all of the above issues identified in the Oval discussion and craft a bespoke OEV capture solution for the Aave protocol.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>What is OEV?</li>\n<li>OEV Exploration Framework</li>\n<li>Timelines</li>\n<li>Cost</li>\n<li>Next Steps</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"what-is-oev-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#what-is-oev-4\"></a>What is OEV?</h1>\n<p>Aave incentivizes third parties to liquidate Aave debt positions that have become distressed through a liquidation bonus. These liquidations generate enough profit that MEV searchers compete to liquidate transactions immediately after Chainlink price feed updates.</p>\n<p>The current MEV tooling landscape lacks a common mechanism to capture this kind of MEV, called Oracle Extractable Value (OEV). Instead, the majority of the value eventually flows down the supply chain to block builders and validators. It starts when searchers bid to backrun the oracle update by placing their transaction immediately after the update, enabling them to perform the profitable liquidation. These auctions are competitive, so a searcher bids the majority of their profit to have their bundle included, thus ending up passing the majority of the value down the supply chain.</p>\n<p>In particular, when a price update catalyzes a liquidation, a significant chunk of risk-free profit is turned into MEV. This MEV from Aave liquidations, OEV, has benefited searchers, block builders and validators, but not Aave protocol or its users.</p>\n<p>Aave DAO should aim to capture this OEV.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"oev-exploration-framework-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#oev-exploration-framework-5\"></a>OEV Exploration Framework</h1>\n<p>This framework will consist of the following components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creation of OEV Working Group</li>\n<li>Discovery Phase<br>\na.

These high standards have been maintained by Aave DAO historically trusting a core set of contributors to manage Aave’s infrastructure and keep a close eye on any changes to the protocol that will impact its security. It is crucial to involve BGD Labs in any discussions related to OEV and Aave’s ultimate selection of an OEV capture solution.</li>\n<li>Liquidations are a critical part of Aave’s infrastructure and security and any changes to Aave’s liquidation mechanism must be well thought out and deliberated upon by experts who are keenly familiar with the Aave protocol and its mechanisms.</li>\n<li>This is a deeply technical solution which requires inputs from a number of experts, including those well-versed in MEV/OEV, risk service providers like Chaos Labs, and security experts like Certora.</li>\n<li>It will take time to research OEV and review and select the appropriate solution for Aave. The process will involve liaising with external stakeholders (e.g., oracle providers like Chainlink who will be critical during the requirements gathering and phase, but may want to propose a solution themselves, and the Aave treasury managers to define how to distribute any captured revenue across stakeholders). Therefore, it is important to have an entity managing the operational aspect of the working group and ensure that timelines and deliverables are adhered to.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We propose a 5-member working group that will be elected by the community. We believe the working group must have the below 5 team profiles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aave Security Team</strong>: BGD Labs [set member]</li>\n<li><strong>Security Service Provider</strong>: Certora [subject to governance / open election]</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Service Provider</strong>: Chaos Labs [subject to governance / open election]</li>\n<li><strong>MEV Expert</strong> [subject to governance / open election]</li>\n<li><strong>Operational Manager</strong> [subject to governance / open election]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we have suggested parties that we deem skilled for the job, we believe that the election of the profiles for the OEV Working Group should be subject to governance (apart from BGD Labs). As such, applications for the OEV working group should be solicited on another forum post that we will create based on feedback from the community to this proposal, and the election of the OEV Working group should occur via a single Snapshot vote.</p>\n<p>The election will consist of a 7-day submission period for the interested applicants, with a Snapshot vote determining the members of the working group.</p>\n<p>We welcome feedback from the community on the definition of these roles and whether other types of profiles are required.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"discovery-phase-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#discovery-phase-7\"></a>Discovery Phase</h2>\n<p>Once the OEV Working Group has been elected by governance, the Discovery Phase will commence for a period of 3 months (12 weeks) and constitute the following elements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Requirements Definition</li>\n<li>Implementation Timeline Definition</li>\n<li>KPI Definition</li>\n<li>Research Submission Window</li>\n<li>OEV Solution Analysis</li>\n<li>RFP Definition</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The timelines presented in the below breakdown are tentative estimates and are subject to change based on input from the community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"see-details-below-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#see-details-below-8\"></a>See details below.</h3>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-requirements-definition-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#h-1-requirements-definition-9\"></a>1.

The festival auditory will be 300-400 people and during both days we would like to have a stand where we help to activate to participants their wallets.</p>\n<p>AAVE jumping on board with FLIP SIDE isn’t just about getting noticed by a bunch of creative minds; it’s about being the first blockchain fam to step into the digital fashion scene in a big way. This collab is gonna put AAVE on the map, right in the middle of where the magic happens, with shoutouts in all the cool mags and event pages around Lisbon. Plus, every piece of FLIP SIDE swag will rock a AAVE banner, making it clear who’s bringing the innovation.</p>\n<p>Teaming up with AAVE is a game-changer for FLIP SIDE. It’s about pushing boundaries, breaking new ground, and creating a space where young creators can thrive. This partnership is more than just tech meets textiles; it’s about inspiring a movement, where innovation meets street smarts in the coolest way possible. Let’s make history and show everyone how fashion and blockchain can vibe together, building a future where everyone’s invited to the party.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DAO’s Milestones for proposal</strong></li>\n<li>Activation of 100 wallets</li>\n<li>AAVE visibility for more than 1000 people through media channels and 500 people through event</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>II.

Given the abundance of networks and assets on the Aave protocol, this manual and cumbersome process significantly burdens teams across Chaos Labs, ACI, BGD Labs, and more. Our solution, grounded in guarded automation, alleviates these operational inefficiencies by seamlessly translating governance-approved risk parameters into actionable, on-chain updates.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"introduction-to-risk-oracles-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#introduction-to-risk-oracles-3\"></a><strong>Introduction to Risk Oracles</strong></h2>\n<p>Risk Oracles represent an advancement designed to automate the laborious process of updating risk parameters. The conventional approach to monitoring blockchain risk is challenging and marred by significant delays from risk signal detection to implementing protective measures by risk managers and the DAO. This latency is untenable, especially considering the billions in TVL and the inherent market volatility. Risk Oracles serve as the crucial linkage between the analytical prowess of the Chaos Labs Cloud and the practical application of governance-validated recommendations on the blockchain, extending the capabilities of the existing Risk Steward System developed by BGD Labs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/33ff174df91847ddc4edf1c1ba29330cf0da2b2c.jpeg\" alt=\"Untitled - 2024-04-02T124850.866\" data-base62-sha1=\"7pYSCBKgIAfSoxwvkRArwt0GklS\" width=\"1600\" height=\"919\"><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xADf86b537eF08591c2777E144322E8b0Ca7E82a7#code\">CapsPlusRiskSteward Contract, developed by BGD Labs.</a></em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"operational-mechanics-of-risk-oracles-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#operational-mechanics-of-risk-oracles-4\"></a><strong>Operational Mechanics of Risk Oracles</strong></h2>\n<p>The Risk Oracle introduces a bifurcated operational framework, encompassing both off-chain and on-chain workflows to ensure dynamic and secure risk parameter updates.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"offchain-workflow-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#offchain-workflow-5\"></a><strong>Offchain Workflow</strong></h3>\n<p>Situated within the Chaos Cloud, this segment is the analytical engine where various risk indicators are continuously monitored. These include but are not limited to, utilization of supply and borrowing caps, debt ceiling thresholds, market volatility, and patterns indicative of anomalous user behaviors. A simulation is triggered upon exceeding specific, pre-established thresholds, computing the newly optimized parameter settings.

Each parameter update is bounded by governance-established limits to facilitate “optimistic updates”—that is, updates enacted without necessitating an entire governance cycle. The updates are enacted upon successful validation, dynamically refining the Aave Market’s operational parameters.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/71a73aac63ff24a2220ebf2a82489e54d3850444.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gdqeWBZ5TlJ0uVp71S9ZkUGQ376.png?dl=1\" title=\"Frame 78332 (2)\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/7/71a73aac63ff24a2220ebf2a82489e54d3850444_2_2000x727.png\" alt=\"Frame 78332 (2)\" data-base62-sha1=\"gdqeWBZ5TlJ0uVp71S9ZkUGQ376\" width=\"2000\" height=\"727\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/7/71a73aac63ff24a2220ebf2a82489e54d3850444_2_2000x727.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/7/71a73aac63ff24a2220ebf2a82489e54d3850444_2_3000x1090.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/7/71a73aac63ff24a2220ebf2a82489e54d3850444_2_4000x1454.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"21282E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"pilot-implementation-version-0-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#pilot-implementation-version-0-7\"></a><strong>Pilot Implementation: Version 0</strong></h2>\n<p>For the pilot phase, we focus on low-risk and high-adjustment frequency parameters.

With the potential extension of this credit line to 1 billion DAI in the near term, the unpredictability of future governance decisions by MakerDAO raises concerns regarding the inherent risk nature of DAI as collateral.</p>\n<p>These liquidity injections are done in a non-battle-tested protocol with a “hands off” risk management ethos and no safety module risk mitigation feature.</p>\n<p>The Aave protocol had previous experience of the consequences of reckless minting policies at a much smaller scale, with Angle’s AgEUR (now EURA) mint into EULER a week before their hack and jEUR minting into Midas leading to the asset long-term depeg.</p>\n<p>Given that only a fraction of DAI deposits are currently utilized as collateral on Aave, and users have ample liquidity to switch to USDC or USDT as alternative collateral options, this proposal aims to mitigate potential risks without significantly negatively impacting our user base.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"proposed-changes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#proposed-changes-4\"></a>Proposed Changes:</h3>\n<h3><a name=\"conservative-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#conservative-5\"></a><strong>Conservative</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV by 12 Percentage Points, LT 1 Percentage Point Per 100M Deployed:</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the details outlined in this <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/generalized-lt-ltv-reduction-on-aave/16766\">post</a>, there is a planned gradual reduction in the LTV ratios for DAI and sDAI on Aave V3, transitioning from 77% to 75%, accompanied by a decrease in the LT from 80% to 78% across most chains. Considering these anticipated adjustments and the maximum implied percentage of total DAI backing by (s)USDe at 12%, we conservatively recommend a linear reduction of an additional 12 percentage points in LTV. Regarding the LT, we suggest a conditional decrease of 1 percentage point for every 100M in D3M exposure, with a maximum reduction of 6 percentage points, assuming the full 600M is deployed. LT reductions naturally come with potentially induced liquidations, thus if the amount liquidated due to LT changes is deemed too large, we will modify accordingly. This process will begin with a 1% reduction from the current value to account for the initial 100M, once the initial expected decrease has been completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Given current inconsistencies in DAI LTs across the different chains, we will aim to align the LTs and LTVs in the first stage of this proposal. This means that in instances where the LT is currently set higher, the initial reduction would be more than the 1% suggested above. This standardization will be carefully planned to minimize the impact of LT reductions on the likelihood of liquidations.</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Chain</th>\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Current Expected LTV</th>\n<th>Recommended LTV</th>\n<th>Current Expected LT</th>\n<th>Recommended LT (1st stage)</th>\n<th>Recommended LT (Last Stage)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>V3 Ethereum</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>78%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3 Arbitrum</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>78%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3 Optimism</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>80%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3 Polygon</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>78%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3 Gnosis</td>\n<td>WXDAI</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>78%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3 Avalanche</td>\n<td>DAI.e</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>80%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3 Metis</td>\n<td>m.DAI</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>80%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3 Ethereum</td>\n<td>sDAI</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>78%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V2 Ethereum</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>87%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V2 Polygon</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>80%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V2 Avalanche</td>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n<td>80%</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"aggressive-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aggressive-7\"></a>Aggressive</h3>\n<p><strong>Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV to 0%, LT 1 Percentage Point Per 50M Deployed:</strong></p>\n<p>Given Maker’s allocation of a significant portion of potential DAI backing to a new, riskier asset, should the community wish to take more aggressive action, we propose a temporary reduction in the LTV to 0%.
