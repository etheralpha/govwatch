All the details and governance proposal can be found <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-full-deprecation-of-stable-rate/16473/19\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Ampleforth off-boarding resolution</strong></p>\n<p>Together with the Chaos Labs, the risk provider of the community, we supported the community to reach a conclusion on the Ampleforth incident described <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<p>This involved doing an in-depth analysis to locate the root of the issue in the aAMPL/vAMPL custom implementation by the Ampleforth team, together with coordinating with Chaos Labs to propose a fair resolution for both aAMPL suppliers and the Aave DAO.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this task took very important resources, and this should be a good lesson going forward, for example, to not introduce significant custom components on Aave when coming from external teams, unless the trust and reputation of those are unquestionable.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48588-aave-v3-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-aave-v3-6\"></a>→ Aave v3</h2>\n<p>Improving Aave v3 has been most probably the most important focus of this engagement phase, both with visible/release-ready results, but also with important strategy changes that needed technical adaptations.</p>\n<p>The following is a comprehensive list of work streams over Aave v3:</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"p-48588-aave-v31-activation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-aave-v31-activation-7\"></a>Aave v3.1 activation</h3>\n<p>Even if the work on v3.1 was mainly done on Aave &lt;&gt; BGD Phase 2, its criticality and the very important off-chain infrastructure work required to release it with maximum assurances and scalability, cause it to be fully active in production in the middle of Phase 3, on <a href=\"https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=132\">THIS</a> governance proposal.</p>\n<p>We consider the work/time invested was worth it, as it allows us to have a way faster release cycle (v3.2 to be activated approximately two months after, v3.3 upcoming), and with tooling (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin\">Aave Origin</a>) following the same approach as all other Aave projects.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"p-48588-aave-v32-activation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-aave-v32-activation-8\"></a>Aave v3.2 activation</h3>\n<p>We designed and implemented Aave v3.2, introducing Liquid EModes and removing unused logic in production related to the deprecated stable borrowing mode. A comprehensive description of Aave v3.2 can be found <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-2-liquid-emodes/19037\">HERE</a>, and its activation is imminent via governance proposal, with ETA this upcoming week of 30th September.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"p-48588-aave-v33-wip-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-aave-v33-wip-9\"></a>Aave v3.3: WIP</h3>\n<p>While developing new versions of Aave, we need to do internal exercises of prioritizing features to introduce on each release, mainly balancing complexity versus go-to-market timing.</p>\n<p>Given the groundwork done on v3.1, in parallel with implementing v3.2 we have been working on several other improvements to release in an upcoming v3.3/v3.4. Some of them are related to the requirements of Aave Umbrella, while others are independent of the Aave protocol.</p>\n<p>We estimate v3.3 to be approximately 75% ready.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"p-48588-aave-generalised-risk-stewards-agrs-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-aave-generalised-risk-stewards-agrs-10\"></a>Aave Generalised Risk Stewards (AGRS)</h3>\n<p>We did multiple internal iterations for the generalization of Risk Stewards from the currently active CapsPlusSteward, resulting in the proposal AGRS, together with a pilot integration program of AGRS with Chaos Labs Edge’s Risk Oracle.</p>\n<p>All details can be found <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-generalized-risk-stewards-agrs-activation/19178\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"p-48588-aave-goes-multi-pool-in-the-same-network-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-aave-goes-multi-pool-in-the-same-network-11\"></a>Aave goes multi-pool in the same network</h3>\n<p>Historically, Aave has experience with maintaining multiple pools on the same network, but apart from minor exceptions on the “v2 era” (v2 main Ethereum, AMM, or even Aave Arc), the approach from v3 release was more on 1 network → 1 pool; and focus more on expanding to new networks.</p>\n<p>However, last months the community decided to put effort and resources into all contribution fields to make multiple pools on the same network a reality, at scale. As a result, Aave currently has three v3.1 instances on Ethereum, of which Aave v3 Lido stands out with close to a $700 million market size.</p>\n<p>For this strategy change to happen relatively seamlessly operations-wise, we helped on the technical side by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adapting the Aave tooling to support this multi-pool approach, including but not limited to aave-address-book, aave-proposals, aave-helpers, aave-permissions-list.</li>\n<li>Supporting other contributors like ACI or TokenLogic with advice on for example pool or rewards configurations.</li>\n<li>Answer any technical doubts to external partners involved in those pools, like Lido or EtherFi.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if there is room to improve tooling and procedure-wise for multi-network and multi-pool strategy going forward, we are confident that the process should be pretty scalable now.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><a name=\"p-48588-assets-pricing-capo-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-assets-pricing-capo-12\"></a>Assets’ Pricing: CAPO</h3>\n<p>On the pricing side of the Aave protocol, we have worked on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We proposed to apply CAPO for all stable coins on Aave v2, to be aligned with the strategy on v3, <a href=\"https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=82\">HERE</a>.</li>\n<li>We made different improvements and refactoring on the <a href=\"https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-capo\">CAPO repository</a>, including adding a <a href=\"https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-capo/blob/main/how-to.md\">guide for other contributors to add new CAPO instances to it</a>.</li>\n<li>More on the listings side (described in a different section on this recap), we did pricing strategy recommendations for assets, mainly depending on their technical and security architecture.</li>\n<li>Given the frequency of listings of LSTs/LRTs and in general, assets tied to an underlying, we started researching new pricing strategies for these assets, with technologies with Chainlink PoR in mind.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48588-h-2-aave-tooling-and-infrastructure-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-h-2-aave-tooling-and-infrastructure-13\"></a>2.

This has enabled all types of parameter changes on the 10 active Aave pools, proposals by treasury contributors to rebalance funds across networks, activations of new Aave pools, or even the activation of cross-chain GHO.</p>\n<p>The main success metric on this project in our opinion is the lack of any type of operational/security incident: <em>a.DI has worked as expected</em> .</p>\n<p>Another very important aspect to highlight about a.DI, is the adoption by the Lido DAO of the system, as it can be seen <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/network-expansion-workgroup-initiative-governance-decision-forwarding-to-non-l2-networks-lip-24/7446/8\">HERE</a>. We see this as a good symptom of the quality of our contribution to Aave, when other very important actors of the ecosystem like Lido adopt independently Aave’s technology just for its quality and suitability.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, even if a.DI is stable, we have made different improvements to it during this engagement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The biggest contribution has been the release of <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-a-di-aave-delivery-infrastructure-v1-1/17838\">a.DI v1.1</a>, including 2 major features: a.DI Shuffling and granular access control. Shuffling improved the scalability and cost optimization of the system, while granular access control aligned better with the requirements of Aave for operational vs emergency actions, in a decentralized framework.</li>\n<li>We proposed an update of all a.DI adapters of “native” bridges (e.g. rollups) to add extra metadata (standardizing aspects like events across paths), or improve gas configurations, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-technical-maintenance-proposals/15274/26\">HERE</a>.</li>\n<li>We updated the LayerZero adapters to their v2, via the maintenance proposal <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-technical-maintenance-proposals/15274/29\">HERE</a>.</li>\n<li>We updated the HyperLane adapters to their v3, via the maintenance proposal <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-technical-maintenance-proposals/15274/31\">HERE</a>.</li>\n<li>We added support on a.DI for both Wormhole and Axelar. Currently pending to be added into the consensus of some a.DI paths, but already in production in a.DI Lido instance.</li>\n<li>As part of the pre-requirements for the activation of a new Aave pool, we enabled a.DI on ZKSync, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-technical-maintenance-proposals/15274/40\">HERE</a>.</li>\n<li>We did an important refactoring/improvement of the a.DI deployment infrastructure (<a href=\"https://github.com/bgd-labs/adi-deploy\">adi-deploy</a>), to have it more decoupled from the a.DI codebase itself (e.g. using more create2).</li>\n<li>Refactor testing/visibility infrastructure (e.g. configurations diffs, standard payloads similar to governance proposals) for upgrades on the a.DI smart contracts in production via governance.</li>\n<li>On a.DI Monitoring (<a href=\"https://adi.onaave.com/\">https://adi.onaave.com/</a>):\n<ul>\n<li>Added bridging times, by adapter.</li>\n<li>Burn rates of the system: transaction cost, bridging cost; with granularity per underlying provider.</li>\n<li>Adaptation to support a.DI v1.1, mainly its new Optimal Bandwidth configuration.</li>\n<li>Multiple internal optimisations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Similar to Aave Governance v3, a.DI has reached quite some maturity, and the work going forward will be focused on quality improvements.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48588-aave-permissions-list-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-aave-permissions-list-15\"></a>→ Aave permissions list</h2>\n<p>The work on Aave Permissions List has been on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Maintenance</em> : support the new networks Aave expands to and new pools, add interpretation of some extra smart contracts of the Aave ecosystem and miscellaneous internal refactoring.</li>\n<li><em>Contracts upgradeability</em> : we added a new table of each pool’s report, to show which level which contracts of the ecosystem are upgradeable (and controlled by who) versus non-upgradeable. This is a useful way for both users and integrators to simply see the levels of trust deposited into each contract. Example <a href=\"https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-permissions-book/blob/main/out/MAINNET-V3.md#contracts-upgradeability\">HERE</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aave permissions list has become a pretty fundamental infrastructure piece for quality assurance of both the new Aave pool and generally any Aave governance proposals, in order to have visibility about any type of permissions change on both simulation (e.g. Tenderly) and pre-production (e.g. during voting) stages.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48588-aave-address-book-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-aave-address-book-16\"></a>→ Aave Address Book</h2>\n<p>Aave Address Book (and its UI Search on Aave) has become one of the most used projects in the Aave ecosystem, being the “source of truth” for the official Aave smart contract addresses.</p>\n<p>During this engagement, we did the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adapted the repository whenever necessary for compatibility with new Aave versions, like v3.1 or v3.2.</li>\n<li>Added automatic validations for contracts to be verified when added to Aave Address Book.</li>\n<li>Added automatic validations of cross-references: when an address is added, we verify that of for example getters in other contracts, the value is the same.</li>\n<li>Added support to Gnosis Safe address book, for users to be able to import a compatible format all Aave ecosystem addresses.</li>\n<li>Misc internal improvements whenever required.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48588-aave-governance-v3-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-aave-governance-v3-17\"></a>→ Aave Governance v3</h2>\n<p>Aave Governance v3 has been working without any significant problems since its activation, and we have focused mainly on improving internally <a href=\"https://vote.onaave.com/\">vote.onaave.com</a>, the interface used by a good part of governance participants.</p>\n<p>Amongst other, we have improved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improving the logic handling data fetching from IPFS, handling better fallback strategies to improve stability when the main gateway has any problem.</li>\n<li>Add support to new networks like ZKSync.</li>\n<li>Internal refactoring of icons (assets, wallets, networks).</li>\n<li>General maintenance to keep dependencies updated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the smart contracts side, we have not made any improvement in order to prioritize other fields of contribution, given that Aave Governance v3 is already completely efficient and scalable.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48588-safety-module-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-safety-module-18\"></a>→ Safety Module</h2>\n<p>On the Safety Module side, our focus has been on Umbrella, covered by a separate scope on the Aave &lt;&gt;

Technical/security analysis</h2>\n<p>During this period, it has been quite frequent to have assets candidates for listing where its technical architecture and general security are even more important than usual for the Aave protocol.

The rationale for the reduced number of new networks is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Even if Aave is very scalable at the moment in terms of expansion to networks, generally we believe it is important to balance expansions with improving the quality and features of the product. In this scope, we have prioritized slightly more protocol improvements.</li>\n<li>We underestimated the effort required for ZKSync, which is a good lesson for ourselves and the community going forward: tooling compatibility and full stack equivalence between Ethereum and other networks can imply tremendous overhead, even when the team behind the network is allocating resources, like in the ZKSync case.</li>\n<li>The change of strategy to multi-pool in the same network in the order of 1-2 analyses to be slightly delayed, planned for the following weeks. Even if this is not ideal, we think it is both a characteristic and strength of our scopes: if we see the community is demanding something with business urgency, we are able to swap focus between tasks, while keeping quality.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48588-review-deployments-by-catapulta-35\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-review-deployments-by-catapulta-35\"></a>→ Review deployments by Catapulta</h2>\n<p>During this engagement, we reviewed two pool deployments by Catapulta (engaged for 6 months <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboard-catapulta-as-aave-v3-deployment-service-provider/17113\">HERE</a>): the Aave v3 Lido Ethereum and the Aave v3 Etherfi Ethereum pools.</p>\n<p>Even if there was no problem with the collaboration or outcome, we detected a lack of optimality during the process, <em>so our recommendation going forward is for us BGD to again proceed with these activations replacing Catapulta</em> , as it is complicated to decouple the system that we still need to deploy (for different networks) and our tooling, from the deployment and activation proposals themselves.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48588-h-5-umbrella-36\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48588-h-5-umbrella-36\"></a>5.

This naturally has affected development flow, as from BGD we can reduce the support required by other parties.</li>\n<li>Documentation of projects and visibility is still a field we think we could improve. Even if we put important focus on both, we tend to prioritise execution and a system like Aave should be even better in that direction.</li>\n<li>Generally, we think the separation of a continuous scope versus project-based is suitable for our role, given how unpredictable are the needs on the first versus the clearer planning on the second (even if with only an approximate duration).

Borrowing GHO on Ethereum to provide liquidity on Arbitrum requires extra steps and generates similar returns. Of the GHO that was coordinated through the bridge, a large portion has been swapped out of DEX liquidity pools and now resides on Aave. The ability to arbitrum GHO’s price between networks becomes more practical with growing supply on both networks.</p>\n<p>The above has influenced in GHO consistently trading above $1.00, with a 5M swap resulting in a higher price impact (above 50%). The TVL in GHO pools in Arbitrum is $5.7M, with GHO representing about $1.2M.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48564-phase-iv-lookahead-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48564-phase-iv-lookahead-6\"></a>Phase IV Lookahead</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48564-ethereum-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48564-ethereum-7\"></a>Ethereum</h2>\n<p>In the near future we expect GHO to be listed on InstadApp with several curated vaults providing additional utility and yield opportunites that use GHO.</p>\n<p>A sUSDS/GHO strategy vault is expected to launch on Contango with support from the Contango team. Early stage discussions with prospective investors is promising.</p>\n<p>We also expect GHO to feature in the upcoming Royco launch with the intent to drive flows into several yield strategies across Ethereum and Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Achieving 50M of DEX liquidity on Ethereum across various integrations remains a key focus. Whilst we are yet to acheive this target, we are currently very well positioned for current market conditions.</p>\n<p>The 80/20 wstETH/GHO pool on Balancer and GHO/wBTC/wstETH pool on Curve are to be consolidated into GHO/tBTC/wETH pool. This is expected to reduce cost and offer better swap routings.</p>\n<p>In the near future, we expect further joint collaborations between Paxos, Balancer and the ALC resulting in a new liquidity pool and acheiving the 50M TVL target. Looking beyond this, there will be an increasing focus on integrations that create utility for GHO.</p>\n<p>With GHO surpassing 150M circulating supply and approaching 50M in DEX liquidity, we expect potential opportunities for the ALC to support GHO listing on centralised exchanges.</p>\n<p>When accounting for the above, the proposed quarterly budget for the Ethereum ecosystem is 650,000 GHO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48564-arbitrum-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48564-arbitrum-8\"></a>Arbitrum</h2>\n<p>To boost GHO supply on Arbitrum, the September Finance update proposes transferring 5M GHO from the Treasury on Ethereum to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. This is substantially increase the GHO supply on the network.</p>\n<p>In the near future, we expect GHO to be listed on Synthetixs v3 with under-utilised liquidity deposited into Aave v3 to earn yield.</p>\n<p>A USDe/aGHO ECLP is to launch soon with x30 Sats with support from the ALC.</p>\n<p>The ALC’s focus on Arbitrum is shifting towards creating utility and demand sinks for GHO as DEX liquidity is well positioned to support the peg.</p>\n<p>The previous ARB budget for GHO liquidity on Arbitrum was 375,000 ARB over 3 months. This is equivalent to around $200,000 at spot prices. With the expected GHO listing on Synthetix in the near future, the overal Arbitrum budget is to replace existing liquidity spending and also focus on the broader adoption of GHO within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The quarterly budget for the Arbitrum ecosystem is 300,000 GHO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48564-performance-metrics-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48564-performance-metrics-9\"></a>Performance Metrics</h2>\n<p>The below details some high-level GHO metrics:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Ethereum Value</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Arbitrum Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>TVL DEX Liquidity Pools</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">50M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">30M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TVL Utility Liquidity Pools (Excl. stkGHO)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">15M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DEX Liquidity Composition</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">&lt; 50% GHO (&lt; 33% for 3pools)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">&lt; 50% GHO (&lt; 33% for 3pools)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Swap Price Impact $5M Swap (GHO to USDC)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">&lt; 0.10%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">&lt; 0.25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Annualised Peg Volatility</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">&lt; 5.00%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">&lt; 5.00%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Price level for &gt;90% time</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$0.995 using <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Redstone Medium Price</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$0.995 using <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Redstone Medium Price</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Please note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC.

As extra protection, during the initial period of updates (estimated 1-2 months), BGD Labs will join the Risk Council multi-sig in order to add an additional layer of security review. <em>Chaos Labs will still be the only decision maker for recommendations as defined on their professional scope with the DAO, with us BGD just being a security contributor</em>.</li>\n<li>The second is a pilot version to automate interest rate updates of assets (starting with WETH on Aave v3 Lido Ethereum), based on the newly released risk infrastructure technology Edge, by Chaos Labs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The repository can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards\">https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48547-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48547-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The base motivation of Aave Generalized Risk Stewards (AGRS) is still the same as the previously proposed version <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204\">HERE</a>. After a successful initial iteration for cap updates and different GHO parameters using the Stewards pattern, Aave is prepared to generalize the solution and improve its operational efficiency and reactivity to the market.</p>\n<p>Regarding the pilot integration of AGRS with Chaos Labs new Edge infrastructure, it has the following rationale:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Whenever aligned with other strategic and technical aspects, Aave should benefit from infrastructure built by service providers, in this case, Chaos Labs.</li>\n<li>This pilot will be very non-invasive and with only positive outcomes, as the AGRS layer will guarantee that only acceptable interest rate recommendations will reach the Aave protocol, while ideally having a way more dynamic rate.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48547-specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48547-specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48547-h-1-agrs-risk-provider-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48547-h-1-agrs-risk-provider-4\"></a>1. AGRS + Risk provider</h2>\n<p>The main version of AGRS will follow the specifications described in the previous Risk Stewards post <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204#specification-3\">HERE</a>, which can be summarised in the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The following risk params could be changed by the RiskStewards:\n<ul>\n<li>Supply Caps</li>\n<li>Borrow Caps</li>\n<li>LTV</li>\n<li>Liquidation Threshold</li>\n<li>Liquidation Bonus</li>\n<li>Debt Ceiling</li>\n<li>Base variable borrow rate</li>\n<li>Slope 1</li>\n<li>Slope 2</li>\n<li>Optimal point</li>\n<li>CAPO configurations</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For each configuration type, there will be a minimum delay associated with how frequently the AGRS can be used, named <code>minDelay</code>. Ex. after increasing LTV by 5%, the operator of the AGRS (risk provider) must wait a minimum of minDelay before either doing any additional change.</li>\n<li>Each configuration type will have an associated percentage-based constraint (in basis points), indicating how much the parameter can be changed via AGRS compared to the live value on Aave v3. These constraints (<code>maxPercentChange</code>) can be of 2 types:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Absolute</em>. E.g. for LTV a 5_00 <code>maxPercentChange</code> means that is possible to change the LTV value by +/- 5_00 basis points, or 5%, compared to the current live value. So if the current LTV is 65%, it is possible to change up to 70% or down to 60%.</li>\n<li><em>Relative</em>. E.g. for Supply Cap a 50_00 <code>maxPercentChange</code> means that is possible to change the Supply Cap value by +/- 50_00 basis points, or 50%, proportional to the current live param.

Simple Summary</strong></p>\n<p>This is a proposal for adding supply/borrow support for wsuperOETHb on the Aave v3 Base Instance</p>\n<p><strong>2. Motivation/Background</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.originprotocol.com/super-oeth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Super OETH </a>(superOETHb) is the next iteration of OETH, a superior LST with an extremely tight peg and high yields thanks to a combination of the OETH AMO and DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p. superOETHb yields are able to reach double digit levels, making it an exceptionally perfect token for lending and borrowing against ETH. superOETHb was built reusing 90% of the code from OETH, for which the codebase has already been <a href=\"https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audited 12+ times</a>, and for which there is also an Aave <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-support-for-wrapped-oeth-woeth-to-aave-v3/19103\">Temp Check</a> currently on the forum.</p>\n<p>Super OETH is the first token in a new category of liquid staking: Supercharged LSTs. Supercharged LSTs will have materially higher yield while being designed for L2s, with a similar risk profile to mainnet LSTs. Ethereum liquid staking is amplified with chain-specific, auto-compounded incentives. Deep concentrated liquidity pools guarantee exits with minimal costs - users will never lose ability to convert back to ETH.</p>\n<p>We’ve noticed many LSTs trade below their peg due to DEX fees and slippage, and to reflect the time value of money. LSTs that consistently trade below peg effectively impose a hidden exit fee - certain LSTs often trade ~0.25% below peg, meaning it takes three weeks of staking to break even. This may be ok for long-term holders, but is terrible for projects who plan to integrate the LSTs, or for users who plan to loop LTSs for additional yield. This is not the case with OETH, and it will not be the case with Super OETH.</p>\n<p>Using Super OETH on Aave will produce higher yield than the other top LSTs and have a near perfect ETH peg. Utilizing a concentrated Aerodrome liquidity pool with the tightest tick possible helps make Super OETH the most pegged L2 LST currently available, while being able to reach double digit yields. Our vision for Super OETH is for it to become the most trusted LST for those seeking to use an LST for leveraged staking.</p>\n<p>Obtaining superOETHb is effortless, users can convert their ETH into Super OETH via any of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minting on the <a href=\"https://originprotocol.eth.limo/#/super\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Super OETH dapp</a></li>\n<li>Swapping on <a href=\"https://aerodrome.finance/deposit?token0=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006&amp;token1=0xDBFeFD2e8460a6Ee4955A68582F85708BAEA60A3&amp;type=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">WETH/superOETHb</a> - $178.8m TVL, $1.49m volume</li>\n<li>Swapping on <a href=\"https://aerodrome.finance/deposit?token0=0x7002458B1DF59EccB57387bC79fFc7C29E22e6f7&amp;token1=0xDBFeFD2e8460a6Ee4955A68582F85708BAEA60A3&amp;type=-1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OGN/superOETHb</a> - $12.3m TVL, $60.5k volume</li>\n</ul>\n<p>wsuperOETHb is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap superOETHb, you get back a fixed number of wsuperOETHb tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wsuperOETHb tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of superOETHb tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wsuperOETHb earns yield at the same rate as standard superOETHb. The wsuperOETHb to superOETHb exchange rate can be read from the contract (0x7FcD174E80f264448ebeE8c88a7C4476AAF58Ea6, function number 16), or via the OETH dapp.</p>\n<p>Current exchange rate as of 9/20/24: 1 wsuperOETHb = 1.00945809 superOETHb</p>\n<p><em>Security Considerations</em></p>\n<p>superOETHb and wsuperOETHb were built reusing 90% of the OETH code, which was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which many audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, OUSD reached a market cap of $300m without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. All OETH audits can be found in the <a href=\"https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audits section</a> of the OETH docs. We have recently retained <a href=\"https://yaudit.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">yAudit</a> to look at our PRs as we code, and OpenZeppelin is also held on retainer to review 100% of the OETH and OUSD smart contract changes. Origin maintains an active bug bounty with rewards ranging in size from $100 OUSD for minor issues to $1,000,000 OUSD for major critical vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program is currently administered by <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bounty/origindefi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Immunefi</a>, where Origin maintains a median resolution time of 6 hours.</p>\n<p>Through its integration with Aerodrome, Super OETH is able to ensure a 1:1 peg with ETH at any scale. The Super OETH AMO holds a portion of the protocol’s underlying collateral in a concentrated liquidity pool with an extremely tight price range within a single tick above 1.0000 WETH. This allows anyone to sell superOETHb into the pool for at least 1 WETH (minus swap fees). The Aerodrome TWAP quoter, which works the same as the <a href=\"https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/core-concepts/oracles\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap TWAP</a> oracle, can be used to derive the price of superOETHb on chain, and a superOETHb Tellor oracle is also in<a href=\"https://github.com/tellor-io/dataSpecs/issues/160#issuecomment-2338268712\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> the works</a>. superOETHb is also derived from OETH, which has mainnet oracles from <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x703118C4CbccCBF2AB31913e0f8075fbbb15f563\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chainlink</a>, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x8cFc184c877154a8F9ffE0fe75649dbe5e2DBEbf#writeContract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tellor</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.diadata.org/t/cdr-057-ousd-price-feed/801\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dia</a>.</p>\n<p>Chainlink has actually recommended protocols treat superOETHb to be 1:1 with ETH rather than use an oracle, as Aave has done with stETH.

Previously, we posted an update stating that issuing a risk-off recommendation immediately after the announcement would be premature. Since then, we have engaged in discussions with the BitGo team and published <a href=\"https://x.com/omeragoldberg/status/1829179549915197779\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">research</a> on proofs of reserve and attestations for wrapped assets.</p>\n<p>Following this process, we find that the material risk of WBTC has changed, given its new jurisdictional set up, which may increase regulatory risk, as well as its new “strategic partnership” with Justin Sun, which may increase counterparty risk.</p>\n<p>As discussed in the X thread linked previously, it is impossible to eliminate the need for trust when it comes to centralized wrapped assets. However, users and protocols should demand transparency from issuers, including detailed legal structures and complete ownership disclosures. Additionally, the announcement has sparked new competition, providing the Aave protocol more options for BTC-linked assets. As such, we find it prudent to begin changing WBTC’s risk parameters to ensure the Aave protocol is protected.</p>\n<p>WBTC is one of the largest markets on Aave, so making any changes to its parameters is critical. We welcome community feedback on the proposed parameters.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48395-supply-and-borrow-caps-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48395-supply-and-borrow-caps-3\"></a>Supply and Borrow Caps</h2>\n<p>To prevent significant new deposits, we propose decreasing supply and borrow caps for all WBTC markets to a level 5-15% higher than current utilization. This ensures that users can still manage the health of their WBTC collateral positions while limiting market growth. This is a critical change to manage Aave’s exposure to WBTC.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48395-liquidation-threshold-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48395-liquidation-threshold-4\"></a>Liquidation Threshold</h2>\n<p>An asset’s liquidation threshold determines the health at which a position is liquidated. Setting the liquidation threshold lower ensures that there is a larger buffer with which to process liquidations, helping to reduce the risk of bad debt, especially during periods of stress. We recommend reducing WBTC’s LT to create a larger buffer. However, we note that reducing LT can induce liquidations for previously healthy positions. We have thus tailored our recommendations to each market to mitigate potentially induced liquidations at current price levels (included in the Potential Liqs. column below; note that these values will fluctuate as the price of BTC and borrowed assets change). WBTC.e’s reduction on Avalanche to 60% is due to the market being frozen. As markets deleverage with reduced LTVs, we may continue recommending LT reductions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48395-ltv-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48395-ltv-5\"></a>LTV</h2>\n<p>LTV determines the borrowing power of users’ collateral. Given that WBTC is primarily used as a collateral asset, it is important to reduce this figure to limit future borrowing against WBTC. For all V3 markets (except Avalanche, where WBTC.e is frozen), LTV is currently set to 73%. We propose reducing LTVs to maintain a 5 percentage point difference between LTV and LT in each respective market.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48395-reserve-factor-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48395-reserve-factor-6\"></a>Reserve Factor</h2>\n<p>Increasing Reserve Factor is one of the most commonly used levers when limiting or reducing an asset’s market on Aave. However, in this instance, we note that this will not be as effective on its own. As shown above, WBTC is primarily used a collateral asset and generally has limited borrow demand, and thus a low borrow and supply rate; it currently offers a supply APY of 0.04% on Ethereum.  We recommend increasing the Reserve Factor to 40% for all WBTC markets where it is currently lower than that figure, reflecting the increased risk associated with this asset. We may recommend further changes to this parameter in the future.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48395-specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48395-specification-7\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>Given these observations, we recommend making the following changes, with the new recommended value following the arrow:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Version</th>\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Chain</th>\n<th>Reserve Factor</th>\n<th>LT</th>\n<th>Potential Liqs.</th>\n<th>LTV</th>\n<th>Supply Cap</th>\n<th>Borrow Cap</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>V3</td>\n<td>WBTC</td>\n<td>Arbitrum</td>\n<td>20% → 40%</td>\n<td>78.0% → 73.0%</td>\n<td>$121</td>\n<td>73.0% → 68.0%</td>\n<td>5000 → 3300</td>\n<td>1115 → 250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3</td>\n<td>WBTC</td>\n<td>Optimism</td>\n<td>20% → 40%</td>\n<td>78.0% → 73.0%</td>\n<td>$568</td>\n<td>73.0% → 68.0%</td>\n<td>1200 → 600</td>\n<td>250 → 40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3</td>\n<td>WBTC</td>\n<td>Polygon</td>\n<td>20% → 40%</td>\n<td>78.0% → 75.0%</td>\n<td>$1,300</td>\n<td>73.0% → 70.0%</td>\n<td>3100 → 1750</td>\n<td>851 → 70</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3</td>\n<td>WBTC</td>\n<td>Ethereum</td>\n<td>20% → 40%</td>\n<td>78.0% → 76.0%</td>\n<td>$533</td>\n<td>73.0% → 71.0%</td>\n<td>43000 → 37500</td>\n<td>28000 → 3000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3</td>\n<td>WBTC.e</td>\n<td>Avalanche</td>\n<td>20% → 40%</td>\n<td>67.0% → 60.0%</td>\n<td>$94.30</td>\n<td>0.0%</td>\n<td>2000 → 175</td>\n<td>1100 → 7.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V2</td>\n<td>WBTC</td>\n<td>Ethereum</td>\n<td>80%</td>\n<td>82.0% → 78.0%</td>\n<td>$1,400</td>\n<td>72.0% → 73.0%</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V2</td>\n<td>WBTC</td>\n<td>Polygon</td>\n<td>99.99%</td>\n<td>75.0% → 74.0%</td>\n<td>$1,100</td>\n<td>70.0% → 69.0%</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V2</td>\n<td>WBTC.e</td>\n<td>Avalanche</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n<td>70.0% → 55.0%</td>\n<td>$1,100</td>\n<td>0.0%</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h1><a name=\"p-48395-next-steps-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48395-next-steps-8\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.</li>\n<li>If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48395-disclaimer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48395-disclaimer-9\"></a><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h1>\n<p>Chaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48395-copyright-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48395-copyright-10\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-wbtc-parameter-adjustments/19118\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-wbtc-parameter-adjustments/19118","pubDate":"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 21:57:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-19118"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-wbtc-parameter-adjustments/19118.rss","#text":"[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - WBTC Parameter Adjustments"},"filter":false},{"title":"[ARFC] GHO Steward v2 Upgrade","dc:creator":"karpatkey_TokenLogic","category":"Governance","description":"<hr>\n<p>title: [ARFC] GHO Steward v2 Upgrade<br>\nauthor: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/karpatkey_tokenlogic\">@karpatkey_TokenLogic</a><br>\ncreated: 2024-09-19</p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48390-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48390-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>This publication proposes upgrading the GHO Steward Role to incorporate additional functionality to accomodate the current and future growth of GHO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48390-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48390-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>In response to the expanding GHO ecosystem, GhoSteward v2 incorporates several different stewards to avoid the need to redeploy the entire steward contract whenever an upgrade or change is proposed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GhoBucketSteward</li>\n<li>GhoAaveSteward</li>\n<li>GhoCcipSteward</li>\n<li>GhoGsmSteward</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any future change to the GHO Steward functionality will require only the corresponding steward to be updated.

Simple Summary</strong></p>\n<p>This is a proposal for adding supply/borrow support for wOETH on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave v3 Main Ethereum Instance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the onboarding of OETH to Aave is successful, Origin hopes to discuss an additional onboarding of wOETH to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave v3 Lido Instance</li>\n<li>Aave v3 EtherFi Instance</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Motivation/Background</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://oeth.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Origin Ether </a>(OETH) was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 that generates yield while sitting in your wallet. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.</p>\n<p>Until a <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth/proposal/0x76f64251d37310c5d241ec84a892751c7a34874faff7af848db193141ea24a6f\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposal </a>earlier this year, OETH was an LST aggregator that earned yield by tapping into blue-chip protocols while being collateralized by other LSTs. Over the weeks following, the ability to deploy OETH collateral to other projects was removed and LST collateral was divested back to ETH, as OETH transitioned into a full-fledged LST with an extremely tight peg (1:1 redemptions to ETH thru Origin’s <a href=\"https://www.originprotocol.com/arm-announcement\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARM</a>) and high yields thanks to DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p.</p>\n<p>We’ve noticed many LSTs trade below their peg due to DEX fees and slippage, and to reflect the time value of money. LSTs that consistently trade below peg effectively impose a hidden exit fee - certain LSTs often trade ~0.25% below peg, meaning it takes three weeks of staking to break even. This may be ok for long-term holders, but is terrible for users who plan to loop LTSs for additional yield. This will not be the case with OETH.</p>\n<p>Using OETH on Aave will produce higher yield than other top LSTs and have a near perfect ETH peg. OETH ARM mechanics and gas optimizations will ensure the best possible prices for traders looking for instant exit liquidity, while DVT staking will achieve greater risk-adjusted yield. Our vision for OETH is for it to become the most trusted LST for those seeking to use an LST for leveraged staking.</p>\n<p>Obtaining OETH is seamless, users can convert their ETH into OETH via any of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minting on <a href=\"https://app.oeth.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OETH.com</a></li>\n<li>Swapping on Curve OETH/ETH: <a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Curve.fi</a></li>\n<li>Swapping on Uniswap OETH/ETH: <a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x52299416C469843F4e0d54688099966a6c7d720f\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap</a></li>\n<li>Swapping on Curve OETH/frxETH : <a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-353/deposit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Curve.fi</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>wOETH is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OETH, you get back a fixed number of wOETH tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wOETH tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OETH tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wOETH earns yield at the same rate as standard OETH. The wOETH to OETH exchange rate can be read from the <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">contract</a> (function number 16), or via the OETH dapp.</p>\n<p>Current exchange rate as of 9/18/24: 1 wOETH = 1.104402 OETH</p>\n<p><em>Security Considerations</em></p>\n<p>There is no set emission schedule for OETH. Similar to stETH, OETH is minted on demand when users lock their ETH into the protocol, and burned on demand when users exit OETH for the collateral. The OETH protocol is upgradeable by a 5 of 8 multi-sig and there is a 48-hour timelock before any changes go into effect. You can read more about that in the <a href=\"https://docs.originprotocol.com/ogn/governance#guardians\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">admin section</a> of the OETH docs.</p>\n<p>OETH and wOETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OUSD reached a market cap of $300m</a> without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. All OETH audits can be found in the <a href=\"https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audits section </a>of the OETH docs. We have recently retained<a href=\"https://yaudit.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> yAudit</a> to look at our PRs as we code, and OpenZeppelin is also held on retainer to review 100% of the OETH and OUSD smart contract changes. Origin maintains an active bug bounty with rewards ranging in size from $100 OUSD for minor issues to $1,000,000 OUSD for major critical vulnerabilities.

As we onboard various LRTs, our goal is to promote the use of wstETH as a debt asset to enhance the returns of the wstETH/wETH yield strategy.</p>\n<p>By increasing the Uoptimal of the wstETH reserve, we can significantly improve its capital efficiency. Strategists using LRTs as collateral and borrowing wstETH to generate yield will be able to borrow a larger portion of the wstETH that in turn generates a wstETH deposit yield.</p>\n<p>The wstETH deposit yield will offset the wETH borrowing costs. Depending on market conditions, this could lead to a future proposal that fine-tunes the wETH and wstETH Slope1 parameters to balance the wETH deposit yield, revenue, and the performance of the wstETH/ETH yield strategy. Optimizing these parameters is expected to significantly reduce the payback period on the Lido instance and improve the DAO’s overall return on investment.</p>\n<p>A separate proposal will provide details on the new eMode configurations being introduced to the Lido instance of Aave v3. This publication focuses specifically on optimizing the wstETH Uoptimal to improve capital efficiency in preparation for LRT onboarding.</p>\n<p>Whilst several teams are expected to offer incentives for strategies involving LRT collateral and wstETH debt, general market conditions are not sufficiently buoyant to support retaining the current 3.50% Slope1 parameter.</p>\n<p>Whilst we expect strong demand for wstETH debt from users wanting to leverage farm LRT point incentives. Our research indicates sufficient demand emerges when the Slope1 is within the 2.00% to 2.50% range. As a result, this publication proposes reducing the Slope1 from 3.50% to 2.25%.</p>\n<p>By revising the Slope1 and Uoptimal configuration for the wstETH reserve, we expect LRT deposits to drive significant AUM growth for the Lido instance.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48275-specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48275-specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>The Lido instance wstETH Slope1 and Uoptimal are to be revised as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Current</th>\n<th>Proposed</th>\n<th>Change</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Slope1</td>\n<td>3.50%</td>\n<td>2.25%</td>\n<td>-1.25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uopitimal</td>\n<td>45.00%</td>\n<td>80.00%</td>\n<td>35.00%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h1><a name=\"p-48275-disclosure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48275-disclosure-4\"></a>Disclosure</h1>\n<p>TokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

This currently active version of the Aave protocol was focused on security improvements (e.g. introducing virtual accounting), changing the architecture of the interest rate strategies, and multiple other updates to improve the operational efficiency of the system.</p>\n<p>Additionally, with Aave v3.1 we introduced <a href=\"https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin\">Aave v3 Origin</a>, a new repository for the Aave protocol (Foundry-based) to serve as the cornerstone to release further post-v3.1 versions faster while keeping maximum security standards.</p>\n<p>One and a half months later, as a result of previous groundwork with v3.1 and Origin, we are glad to present to the community this new Aave v3.2 version.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"p-48189-aave-v32-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48189-aave-v32-3\"></a>Aave v3.2</h1>\n<p>The changes included in Aave v3.2 are more isolated than those of v3.1, and of different nature. While removing stable rate-related logic is more on the maintenance/codebase cleanup side, liquid eModes is a total user-facing and powerful feature.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48189-h-1-liquid-emodes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48189-h-1-liquid-emodes-4\"></a>1. Liquid eModes</h2>\n<br>\n<p>Aave v3 introduced the concept of eMode (efficiency mode), an abstraction within the pool for configuring groups of assets with more capital-efficient risk configurations (LTV, Liquidation Threshold). This unlocked use cases like native high-leverage or even strategies between stablecoins. eMode could be deemed one of the first experiments in DeFi at scale with the concept of pools of assets within pools of assets.</p>\n<p>The eMode feature has seen since then tremendous success, enabling use cases like ETH-correlated eMode, allowing for higher than default risk parameters on ETH LSTs/ETH positions (or MATIC, AVAX with their LSTs). However, the eMode feature always had some room for improvement, that way truly unlocking even more powerful use cases and flexibility on Aave.</p>\n<p>A known technical limitation of the initial iteration of eMode is the following: a single eMode is optionally assigned to assets listed on Aave. That means that if let’s say WETH is assigned eMode 1 eligibility (ETH-correlated, with ETH LSTs), WETH can’t be eligible for any other eMode.</p>\n<p>In different scenarios, this is an important constraint, as currently is not possible to have on the same Aave pool an eMode with wstETH and WETH, together with a different eMode with weETH and WETH, as WETH can only be in one of them at the same time.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<p>The new Liquid eMode feature of Aave v3.2 removes the previous constraint: <strong>an asset listed on Aave can be eligible for different eModes, and then it only depends on the user to choose which eMode he wants to enter to</strong>.</p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/435c8159fb9a0a6f57925713f3681ae7a3eeddf7.jpeg\" alt=\"liq-emode-diagram\" data-base62-sha1=\"9BUbiftc8LaoIjg4gSmWyuII0Zh\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1517\"><br>\n<em>eMode, before and after v3.2</em></p>\n<br>\n<p>For example, with liquid eModes, a possible configuration not doable before would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>eMode 1, with wstETH, weETH and WETH.</li>\n<li>eMode 2, with wstETH and WETH.</li>\n<li>eMode 3, with weETH and WETH.</li>\n<li>eMode 4, with WETH and GHO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So then, user A holding the wstETH and weETH collaterals, could borrow WETH at high LTV. User B holding only wstETH could borrow WETH at high (but different) LTV. User C holding only weETH could similarly borrow WETH at a different LTV than the previous two eModes. User D could have a position with WETH collateral and GHO borrowings.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t stop there, as more sophisticated configuration strategies could be adopted, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>eMode for only WETH and stablecoins.</li>\n<li>eMode for onboarding less mature LSTs, without requiring them being together with all major LSTs.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>For extra configuration flexibility, liquid eModes also allow now to flag an asset as only borrowable, only collateral, or both, in the context of an eMode</strong>. For example, in a hypothetic eMode with only wstETH and WETH, the normal configuration would be wstETH as only collateral and WETH as only borrowable, fully focusing on the wstETH leverage use-case.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<p>In addition to the previous main characteristics of liquid eModes, we have also introduced the following minor changes to the system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now the protocol doesn’t enforce the LTV/LT of an asset being lower outside its eligible eModes. However, the validation gets stricter on the user side when entering any eMode (or from no-eMode): Health Factor is always validated to never allow the user to get his position below 1HF post-eMode swap.</li>\n<li>The protocol previously had an eMode-specific price feed, to be used to price with the same feed all assets on an eMode. However, this has never been used, and its utility (in its current form) is quite arguable. Therefore, we have to remove it from the data structure to allow more efficient storage allocation.</li>\n<li>On a technical note, before 3.2, the eMode of an asset was stored on the asset’s data itself. Now, the eMode data stores all the necessary information for the protocol to understand which assets are eligible on that eMode.</li>\n<li>Similar as with previous upgrades on Aave v3, we have tried to follow a non-invasive approach when adding the feature, only touching/refactoring those pieces that were clearly necessary, but without doing any big high-level refactoring of the pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Security procedures</strong></p>\n<p>Similar as with any other Aave upgrade, we have applied multiple security measures that will be finished before the activation stage via governance proposal. Detailed information will be published once they are finalised.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"p-48189-h-2-stable-rate-logic-cleanup-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-48189-h-2-stable-rate-logic-cleanup-5\"></a>2. Stable rate logic cleanup</h2>\n<br>\n<p>Part of the v.3.1 upgrade was the addition of a function swapToVariable() for anybody to permissionless off-board stable borrowings to variable, that way factually deprecating completely stable rate on Aave pools.</p>\n<p>With currently no active stable rate position (<a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-full-deprecation-of-stable-rate/16473/20\">moved via the Dolce Vita program by the service provider ACI</a>), we have executed a follow-up step on the process: completely removing the stable rate logic from the protocol, which one hand simplifies the codebase, but on the other hand it also slightly optimises gas consumption and logic flows.</p>\n<p>Even if fairly extensive change, this cleanup is non-invasive in how the protocol operates given that there are no active stable rate positions. All technical details about it will be included in the upcoming v3.2 release technical changelog.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Security procedures</strong></p>\n<p>Similar as with any other Aave upgrade, we have applied multiple security measures that will be finished before the activation stage via governance proposal.
