OpenBlock is an established provider of economic modeling for leading protocols in the space, including: EigenLayer, Lido, Arbitrum, Solana, Sui, Uniswap, Scroll, Fuel, Linea, Mode, and many others; we have also received a small grant in the past to study incentives on Aave. OpenBlock Labs is based in San Francisco, CA, dedicated to fostering sustainable growth within decentralized protocols through a data-driven platform.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-5\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>OpenBlock is backed by notable figures in the crypto space, including: Foundation Capital, Electric Capital, Circle Ventures, AlleyCorp, and others. Our team of 40+ has backgrounds from Stanford, a16z, Carnegie Mellon, Meta, Palantir, and other top-tier institutions; the highly technical background of our team makes us confident that OpenBlock is uniquely positioned to tackle a problem of this nature.</p>\n<p>OpenBlock brings a distinctive advantage to Aave by harnessing its deep expertise in LSTs, which dominate the supplies of Aave. Our extensive liquidity modeling has delved into the intricate dynamics between LSTs and lending activities. Additionally, OpenBlock is at the forefront of LRT analysis, which will be a critical asset class for Aave to maintain its dominance in the market. We believe our unparalleled expertise in this domain will allow Aave to be a first mover with LRT integrations, while upholding rigorous risk assessment standards</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>OpenBlock will conduct a continuous analysis of new asset listings and propose adjustments based on a number of factors including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> We will leverage time-series analysis to assess liquidity trends, employing econometric models like GARCH to account for volatility clustering in liquidity and volume. This will enable us to forecast liquidity scenarios and ascertain liquidity risks associated with each token.</li>\n<li><strong>Agent-Based and Monte Carlo Simulation:</strong> Simulating short-term dynamics like liquidation cascades, such as those driven by liquidator bots with established arbitrage strategies, will be central to our modeling. We also plan to observe the behavior of various network participants, and how they have previously reacted to market events. These interactions will provide insights into how the Aave platform might evolve over time and how various factors could impact its security and asset distribution. Monte Carlo simulations can help predict different scenarios, considering factors such as protocol upgrades, changes in market conditions, and variations in user behavior. These models will provide us with a probabilistic understanding of outcomes and value-at-risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Counterparty Risk:</strong> Counterparty risk pertains to the governance of a given asset and degree of centralization. It is assessed based on factors such as: the level of decentralization of the asset’s governance (measured by power law distribution and Gini coefficient calculations), historical security measures taken by the protocol (smart contract audits, economic simulations), smart contract functionality and complexity (enabling withdrawals, supply caps, whitelists), historical risk mitigation in black swan events (kill-switches, speed of governance, depegging scenarios), the number of holders of the asset, and the general market sentiment of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We outline some of our past work on these topics below.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"past-experience-eigenlayer-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#past-experience-eigenlayer-7\"></a>Past Experience: EigenLayer</h5>\n<p>OpenBlock has diligently conducted comprehensive data collection and monitoring of staking dynamics in our engagement with EigenLayer. Furthermore, we’ve executed Monte Carlo simulations to forecast staking behavior among validators and LSTs. Our platform offers unparalleled insights into liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) and their liquidity levels across various DeFi integrations. Our ability to remain current on emerging asset classes will prove invaluable for meeting Aave’s risk management requirements.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Jm9CY_LNvRtNN7D385Icu0WnS_KiO7igMQ9g1GmvsXh2-4WK118g9eNgPA1ZAG3N5-VwUslyK7jIrll_ASreFKWrAzqslEUNs6sA3-zBIhJ5YIjxLAIGhjKzjY6QIyX5AVFJjWi8R-hYMAqzLqLwiG4\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"325\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<h5><a name=\"past-experience-lido-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#past-experience-lido-8\"></a>Past Experience: Lido</h5>\n<p>When engaging with Lido, OpenBlock utilized advanced data intelligence and modeling to research the dynamics of on-chain liquidity providers and traders of Lido’s stETH. In completing this analysis, we studied the liquidity needs of potential liquidations on Aave, and built models to recommend incentives to attract sufficient DEX liquidity for these markets. OpenBlock’s volume profiling models discovered much of the volume was driven by bots engaging in risk-free arbitrage using stale prices from LPs. This finding was crucial in preventing Lido from continuing to incentivize LPs under the false assumption that the volume was organically increasing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_CMPQFmBuWJx0PCjnVMr121TkI0vIxV3rODsULikJ92ExU2vv6sQoUkrTeCvRYoWDP1VLYs5KkjQSs2M9eaHKmIgxESEyvxTFqnKIPlX1tVXbwbwLeonfylAU8vubwAyLHtpquOH1UeKGW_KF22Igw8\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"329\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ePyHDkG-Sm9DC_RPm6dDxM2TuD9r-CqtpoXygTgki0-LiNr_ESqpodbIwhmpjOz8T1eL6DVWgsVzWzDeMa7kPisvzh3c0r5llLvIYlTcRSCEEZ-rEndiYksyCWUQ6E4HfsgWBsCamo1VznoE3BMdCOE\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"329\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n<h5><a name=\"past-experience-arbitrum-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#past-experience-arbitrum-9\"></a>Past Experience: Arbitrum</h5>\n<p>OpenBlock’s engagement with the Arbitrum DAO has spanned three initiatives: STIP, Backfund, and LTIPP. The consistent renewals showcase OpenBlock’s dedicated nature to an ecosystem, and the level of excellence we strive to achieve. This initiative also highlights OpenBlock’s resilience in engaging with a diverse and vocal community, committing to <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/openblock-labs-stip-data-reporting-update-12-15/20119/2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bi-weekly updates</a> with diligent insights.

As productive assets, staking tokens are high quality collateral to borrow against.</p>\n<p>Given their high correlation to ETH, LRTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.</p>\n<p>The onboarding of ezETH will consequently create increased ezETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of ezETH.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"chain-to-be-deployedlisted-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#chain-to-be-deployedlisted-6\"></a><strong>Chain to be deployed/listed</strong></h2>\n<p>Ethereum mainnet.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"relevant-kpi-points-rewards-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#relevant-kpi-points-rewards-7\"></a><strong>Relevant KPI &amp; Points Rewards</strong></h2>\n<p>Renzo awards ezPoints and EigenLayer Restaked Points based on users’ ezETH holdings.

We will achieve this through thoughtful and deep quantitative and qualitative analysis, community engagement and empowerment, and promoting a culture of transparency and collaboration. By integrating these principles into our approach, we envision a future where Aave sets new industry standards for risk management and operational excellence, driving sustainable growth and securing user trust across the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"our-values-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#our-values-5\"></a>Our Values</h2>\n<p><strong>Impactful Contribution:</strong> Allez Labs prioritizes areas where our expertise can significantly enhance the protocol’s stability and growth. Through strategic focus and dedicated effort, we believe that our work can lead to substantial improvements, driving Aave towards achieving its full potential in the DeFi landscape. Our roadmap adapts based on the most pressing needs of the DAO, and where we can have the greatest impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Community-Centric Innovation:</strong> Our approach to risk management is deeply rooted in serving the community. We utilize transparent, robust methodologies to deliver risk recommendations that are both effective and intuitive, reflecting the dynamic nature of DeFi markets and the needs of the DAO. Allez Labs is committed to democratizing access to risk insights, offering the community tools and reports that require deep expertise and data to build yet are accessible to the wider community. By focusing on clarity, we will empower the community with the knowledge needed for sound decision-making, thereby contributing to a more resilient and vibrant Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> We champion transparency as a pillar of the DeFi ecosystem. By fostering the development and adoption of transparent methodologies, such as open sourcing code and frameworks, we aim to create a culture of mutual growth and innovation. This philosophy is rooted in our belief that progress in the DeFi space is a collective journey, propelled by shared knowledge and collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>Empowering Autonomy:</strong> Central to our ethos is the goal of minimizing dependency on any single service provider, including ourselves. We envision a future where the Aave DAO is equipped with the knowledge and tools to independently manage risk. To this end, we are dedicated to open-sourcing our data pipelines and models, ensuring that our contributions have a lasting impact and support the DAO’s journey towards self-reliance. Our objective is clear: to build a foundation that not only serves immediate needs but also empowers future generations of the Aave community.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"our-approach-as-a-risk-provider-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#our-approach-as-a-risk-provider-6\"></a>Our approach as a risk provider</h2>\n<p>Our focus is on providing clear, actionable risk management insights that enhance understanding of the interplay between growth opportunities and potential risks. Through transparent methodologies and open communication, we commit to empowering the Aave DAO with the knowledge needed for informed decision-making, thereby fostering a proactive, risk-aware community.</p>\n<p>Our mission is aligned with the evolving priorities of the Aave DAO and its stakeholders. Whether the focus shifts towards GHO, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), or other areas of interest, Allez Labs is dedicated to adapting our resources to meet these needs. By maintaining a flexible approach, we ensure that while we concentrate on the DAO’s current priorities, we also keep a vigilant eye on the broader risk landscape. Our goal is to provide targeted, relevant contributions that not only address immediate concerns but also strengthen Aave’s resilience and strategic position in the long term.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#proposal-7\"></a>Proposal</h1>\n<p>Allez Labs proposes to partner with Aave DAO, leveraging our extensive experience in risk management and our commitment to open-source principles to enhance the protocol’s stability and growth across Aave V3 and GHO.

A phased approach to the rollout will permit the DAO to initiate cross-chain GHO deployments in a controlled and secure manner, meticulously evaluating each step of the process, and sequentially broadening to additional networks as time progresses.</p>\n<p>Drawing from the research conducted by Aave Labs to identify suitable networks for the initial phase, it is deemed crucial for the DAO to lead this exploration with transparency. This approach encourages all members to actively participate, voice their opinions, provide feedback, and welcome proposals from various networks.</p>\n<p>Networks that choose to integrate GHO could significantly enrich the stablecoin ecosystem within their domain, granting users access to the native Aave Protocol stablecoin. The onboarding of GHO to these networks comes with a variety of integration opportunities within the new ecosystem, potentially unlocking novel functionalities and enhancing user experience.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>To ensure a structured and streamlined process, we propose dividing this procedure into two phases:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Submission Phase (March 22 - April 1, 2024)</strong></p>\n<p>This phase focuses on gathering comprehensive information about each network’s proposal, ensuring that all of them are documented and accessible for community evaluation.</p>\n<p>Running until April 1, 2024, networks have the opportunity to submit their proposals, which must cover at least the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The connection between the proposal’s author and the network</li>\n<li>A brief high-level summary of the network</li>\n<li>An explanation of the network’s relationship with the Aave ecosystem</li>\n<li>An outline of the opportunities that the adoption of the GHO stablecoin could bring to both GHO and the Aave ecosystem. Examples of such opportunities include:\n<ul>\n<li>Protocols, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXes), that could support the creation of significant liquidity</li>\n<li>Possible synergies with other stablecoins or assets within the ecosystem</li>\n<li>Tools and incentive programs designed to encourage participation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Discussion and Evaluation Phase (April 2 - April 12, 2024)</strong></p>\n<p>Following the submission phase, a 10-day period of community engagement, discussion, and preliminary evaluation begins. This phase allows the community and risk providers to delve into the proposals, offering feedback, raising questions, and assessing the feasibility and potential impact of each proposal on the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The aim is to foster an informed and collaborative decision-making process, culminating in a snapshot vote to determine the most suitable network for GHO’s cross-chain expansion.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs invites the DAO risk providers and contributors, such as <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/chaoslabs\">@ChaosLabs</a> , among others, to share their insights and feedback on the viability of expanding to the specific network from a risk management standpoint.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-next-steps-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#conclusion-next-steps-4\"></a>Conclusion &amp; Next Steps</h3>\n<p>This TEMP CHECK proposal aims to establish a forum for the DAO to be able to get information about potential network opportunities for GHO and for the community to explore the prospects of introducing GHO to other networks.

This knowledge comes from extensive research, development, and hands-on experience with various DeFi protocols, enabling us to anticipate and mitigate risks effectively.</li>\n<li>C<strong>ommitment to Innovation:</strong> At LlamaRisk, we continually evolve our methodologies and tools to stay at the forefront of DeFi research and risk management, ensuring our strategies are effective.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>Recognizing the significance of a dual risk provider model, LlamaRisk’s proposal is designed to complement Chaos Labs’ risk services, with whom we plan to collaborate extensively.</p>\n<p>The initial 6-month engagement, which may be extended pending DAO approval, involves the following scope:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>On-demand Risk Assessments:</strong> LlamaRisk will deliver prompt and in-depth risk assessments for assets listed or considered to be listed on Aave with particular emphasis on the collateral types comprising the GHO stablecoin. This will involve developing a custom framework tailored specifically to the categories of relevant assets and Aave’s needs, which will standardize the assessment process.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborative Engagement with Chaos Labs:</strong> We plan to collaborate extensively with Chaos Labs, combining our expertise to provide Aave with comprehensive and nuanced risk analysis, enhancing the protocol’s risk management capacity.</li>\n<li><strong>Active Involvement in DAO Governance:</strong> LlamaRisk will actively participate in Aave’s DAO governance, offering informed insights and strategic recommendations on risk management practices for principal stakeholders and the community.</li>\n<li><strong>Legal Regulatory Advisory and Policy Work:</strong> We will offer specialized legal research and regulatory guidance, including a thorough analysis of evolving legal frameworks and regulatory policies, and equip Aave with the necessary foresight to navigate the regulatory landscape of the DeFi sector effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Risk vectors are diverse and cannot be fully managed by qualitative risk tools. That is why we specialize in comprehensive risk assessment of tokenized assets and DeFi protocols. Our work supports our partners in making informed decisions that mitigate potential threats and promote a culture of transparency and sustainability. Our team of experts meticulously evaluate various risk factors, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protocol design and architecture</li>\n<li>Tokenomics and economic incentives</li>\n<li>Smart contract security</li>\n<li>Governance mechanisms</li>\n<li>Regulatory compliance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LlamaRisk leverages advanced simulation techniques, including statistical and agent-based modeling, to test and validate DeFi protocols and their collateral assets under various stress scenarios. Our simulations provide valuable insights into potential risks, allowing our partner protocols to set competitive parameters resilient to adverse market conditions.</p>\n<p>Our DeFi strategy managers employ data analytics and risk monitoring tools that allow us to maintain high efficiency and safety standards. We support our partners with publications and dashboards that give users the information they need to interact with the protocol responsibly.</p>\n<p>Our advisory services cater to the unique needs of DeFi projects, providing strategic guidance and support throughout their lifecycle. From ideation to implementation, our experienced advisors offer expert advice on protocol design, tokenomics, governance, and risk management strategies, ensuring optimal outcomes for our partners.<br>\nComment</p>\n<p>Traversing the complex regulatory landscape is crucial for DeFi protocols and projects. Our team of legal experts provides in-depth analysis and guidance to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate legal risks, assist with regulatory filings, and help clients develop robust strategies for operating within the evolving regulatory framework.</p>\n<p>We actively engage in policy development and legislative processes related to crypto and blockchain at national, supranational, and international levels. This includes participating in specialized working groups, contributing opinions to public discussions on regulatory developments, and involvement in policymaking dialogues. We aim to ensure that DeFi stakeholders are represented and protected in the evolving regulatory landscape, facilitating informed and proactive responses to legislative changes.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"duration-proposed-budget-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#duration-proposed-budget-4\"></a>Duration &amp; Proposed Budget</h3>\n<p>We propose a flexible retainer model for our collaboration, with an initial 6-month commitment. This model is designed to ensure maximum efficiency in resource utilization, with a commitment to transparency and responsible financial management.</p>\n<p>The budget request is $250,000 for a 6-month engagement.</p>\n<p>Detailed quarterly reports on our spending will be provided, with any unused funds either carried over to the next quarter or returned to the Aave DAO, as preferred.</p>\n<p>Overall, this proposed scope is an opportunity for LlamaRisk to demonstrate its ability to make an appreciable improvement in Aave’s risk management, which is a pragmatic and cost-effective onboarding strategy. It also serves as an introduction to building a working relationship with Chaos Labs and DAO stakeholders. We intend to demonstrate our value throughout a 6-month engagement and expand our suite of services as pain points are identified.</p>\n<p>We are a flexible and agile team ready to work together to provide risk management solutions that will suit Aave’s specific needs within the wider organization of service providers and stakeholders making up the DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"useful-links-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#useful-links-5\"></a>Useful Links</h3>\n<p>You can find in this section links to our work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Curve Gauge Risk Substack</a> (CryptoRisk Assessments): We publicize research related to assets with Curve pools (mostly stablecoins and RWAs) with attention to risks to the Curve gauge and governance system</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@PrismaRisk\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PrismaRisk Hackmd</a>: We publicize comprehensive collateral risk assessments for proposed collateral assets on Prisma Finance (LSTs and LRTs)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">LlamaRisk Hackmd</a>: We publicize comprehensive collateral risk assessments for potential collateral assets for Curve crvUSD</li>\n<li>ArcadiaSim: <a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Update 1</a>,  <a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-d98\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Update 2</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-388\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Update 3</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-42d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Update 4</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-3fa\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Update 5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://v2.sturdy.finance/aggregators/ethereum/0x73E4C11B670Ef9C025A030A20b72CB9150E54523/deposit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sturdy Finance crvUSD Aggregator</a>: Sturdy V2 app of the aggregator managed by LlamaRisk</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dune.com/llamarisk/sturdy-crvusd-aggregator-monitoring\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aggregator Dune Dash</a>: LlamaRisk dashboard monitoring the aggregator and underlying assets</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/sturdy-finance-crvusd-aggregator\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aggregator Oracle Explainer</a>: Publication on Sturdy silos Oracle design</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/llama-risk-response-to-fca-discussion\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Response to FCA Discussion Paper DP23/4</a>: Our response to the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Discussion Paper on Regulating Cryptoassets Phase 1: Stablecoins</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/llama-legal-defi-yield-optimizers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi Yield Optimizers</a>: The legal status of DeFi yield optimizers under the EU crypto regulatory framework</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/subdao-legal-entity-formation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SubDAO Legal Entity Formation</a>: Llama Risk resources for DAO sub-orgs in search of suitable legal structures</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"disclaimer-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#disclaimer-6\"></a>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>This proposal is powered by Skywards.

With today’s launches, Gyroscope expands upon its reputation for stablecoin design innovations that put risk controls on autopilot.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Aave Grants for their support in bringing Rehype (or boosted) elliptic concentrated liquidity pools (E-CLPs) to market.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"new-rehype-liquidity-pools-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#new-rehype-liquidity-pools-2\"></a>New ‘Rehype’ Liquidity Pools</h2>\n<p>Gyroscope’s Rehype pools maximise LP yields by combining asymmetric concentrated liquidity with auto-rehypothecation to Aave. They allow LPs to triple dip in yield sources by layering swap yields from concentrated liquidity on top of lending yields on top of token incentive markets, in addition to earning Gyroscope SPIN. The combination of yield sources is expected to often reach mid-double-digit organic yield rates in the current environment.</p>\n<p>Rehype pools work by incorporating lending deposits like Aave aUSDC in a simple way directly at the pool asset level with the conversion between lending deposit and underlying asset handled through front-ends and smart order routing.</p>\n<p>“Our new Rehype liquidity pools will be, by far, the most capital efficient liquidity pools on the market. They improve capital efficiency on two fronts: asymmetric concentrated liquidity from E-CLPs and yield from auto-rehypothecating pool assets to lending protocols. They combine many yield sources into one form that can itself be used as productive collateral in other protocols in the form of pool shares,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aklamun\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ariah Klages-Mundt</a>, co-founder of FTL Labs, developer of Gyroscope. “At the same time, rehypothecation in these pools is transparent and user controlled, in contrast to common rehypothecation practices that give issues in TradFi.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9d2ef7b377d3480b30ee9bd55a6533abb4c7c798.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"mqvABEH9WwlDTw8cLZiMYLzdLgk\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></p>\n<p>At the time of writing, GYD E-CLPs are 75% more efficient than competitive offerings and are providing yield of over 60%.</p>\n<p>Read more about Rehype E-CLPs here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">E-CLPs</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/rehype-e-clps\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Rehype E-CLPs</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"initial-pools-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#initial-pools-3\"></a>Initial Pools</h2>\n<p>The first ‘Rehype’ pools are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.gyro.finance/pools/arbitrum/e-clp/0x125bc5a031b2db6733bfa35d914ffa428095978b/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">aUSDC/aUSDT on Arbitrum</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.gyro.finance/pools/polygon/e-clp/0xf6394a1ebabf706eb471ff09cef357cd2ff6bd61/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">aUSDC/aUSDT on Polygon</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.gyro.finance/pools/optimism/e-clp/0x8bb826afc0ff7d2c034a2883f4c461ffd238e1c3/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">aUSDC/aUSDT on Optimism</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0x7f2b3b7fbd3226c5be438cde49a519f442ca2eda/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GYD/aUSDT on Ethereum</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"spin-gyroscope-governance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#spin-gyroscope-governance-4\"></a>SPIN &amp; Gyroscope Governance</h2>\n<p>SPIN will allow the community to recognize new early Gyroscope stakeholders for consideration in governance bootstrapping, including governance token distribution.</p>\n<p>The Gyroscope SPIN system comes in the context of the rollout of the Gyroscope Governance system.
