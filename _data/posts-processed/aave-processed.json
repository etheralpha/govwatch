The proposed contributions extend over the three themes detailed below: Treasury Management, GHO adoption and the Aave Stack.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership has created significant value for the Aave DAO across all three focus areas detailed <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/phase-i-summary-karpatkey-tokenlogic/17962\">here</a>. GHO’s peg, liquidity, and growth prospects have each improved dramatically over the last 6 months. The DAO’s finances are more transparent than ever before and the DAO is firmly positioned for growth.</p>\n<p>Building on the success of Phase I, we seek to extend our collaboration with the Aave Community for another 6 months. Phase II of our engagement is to focus on enabling GHO and Aave to grow market share through prudent financial management and contributing to numerous growth initiatives. Our three primary focus areas are summarized below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Treasury Management</li>\n<li>GHO Adoption</li>\n<li>Aave Stack</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"what-to-expect-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#what-to-expect-4\"></a>What to Expect</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"treasury-management-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#treasury-management-5\"></a>Treasury Management</h3>\n<p><strong>Asset Management</strong></p>\n<p>The Aave DAO receives revenue in the form of revenue-generating aTokens for each deployed lending market. Whilst that reduces the need to deploy assets beyond the protocol itself, this creates a need for continual rebalancing of asset holdings.</p>\n<p>To facilitate streamlining routine operational tasks, the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-finance-steward/17570\">Finance Steward</a> role, which has been already introduced to the Aave community, will be developed. Given the ability to create allowances, streams, perform transfers, assets bridging, and swaps within pre-approved guidelines and without AIPs, we expect the governance overhead around treasury management to decrease significantly.</p>\n<p>The GHO Finance Steward’s capacity to perform swaps will also be improved by the implementation of the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-swap-upgrade/15311\">Aave Swap</a> contract. With this tool, the DAO will be able to acquire assets in a timely and targeted manner, and to support GHO’s peg during turbulent market conditions with the ability to create limit orders.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Security</strong></p>\n<p>A key objective is to define the DAO’s annual budget and secure sufficient funds to ensure DAO operations under stressfull market conditions. As the DAO’s revenues have exceeded the burn-rate and currently holds more assets (about $145M at <a href=\"https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=9&amp;month=6&amp;year=2024&amp;currency=USD\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">end of June</a>) than planned expenses, this proposal will target to cover a <a href=\"https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/runway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">six months’ runway</a> matching holdings with expense tokens or token class as deemed appropriate for capital efficiency. This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO.</p>\n<p>Key components of this objective will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploying bridging contracts (as required);</li>\n<li>Bridging Aave funds between networks;</li>\n<li>Alocating assets for capital efficiency. In particular, migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and</li>\n<li>Swapping assets to align expenses and holdings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Aave Analytics</strong></p>\n<p>Reporting and analytics functions will be expanded to provide the utmost transparency into the DAO’s financial status and overall performance of the protocol, and to support informed decision-making and analysis of the Aave ecosystem. This includes the <a href=\"https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aave Portal</a> and the <a href=\"https://reports.karpatkey.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aave Treasury Report</a>, which shows detailed information on DAO holdings and treasury performance.</p>\n<p>The Aave Portal will continue to evolve to showcase the performance of the Aave Protocol and GHO’s adoption.

To nurture and maximize the growth potential of GHO, its success hinges on the ability to hold its peg and scale simultaneously.</p>\n<p>As a GHO Steward, we will continue to manage key GHO and GSM configurations, including Borrow Rate, GSM Caps, and GSM fees. As the Treasury Managers, we will ensure the GSM is adequately funded, targetting a collateralization in the range of 5% to 10% of total supply, and that GHO swaps are performed in a manner supportive of retaining a tight peg.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>We will continue to lead the operations of the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), overseeing the liquidity growth across different protocols. This includes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusting liquidity incentives to maintain sufficient market depth;</li>\n<li>Defining and executing direct liquidity incentives;</li>\n<li>Leading initiatives that create utility for GHO;</li>\n<li>Optimizing the utilization of the DAO’s strategic voting assets;</li>\n<li>Supporting GSM Integrations with aggregators;</li>\n<li>Ensuring GSM are adequately funded;</li>\n<li>Supporting future D3M, Facilitator, and Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) initiatives; and</li>\n<li>Support efforts to integrate GHO to Centralized Exchanges, and fund managers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Growth</strong></p>\n<p>As GHO continues to grow beyond Ethereum, our efforts will expand to support those new deployments to ensure adequate liquidity and peg stability is maintained. We will continue to work with teams that build with GHO and advocate for the adoption of GHO wherever practical.</p>\n<p>When GHO is mature enough to support deploying Protocol Owned Liquidity, we will actively contribute to the creation of sGHO and balancing the needs for sGHO and stkGHO within the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"aave-stack-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#aave-stack-7\"></a>Aave Stack</h3>\n<p><strong>Safety Module Management and Optimisation</strong></p>\n<p>The Safety Module (SM) currently presents exposure risks due to its reliance on the DAO’s native token and its deployment solely on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>With multiple instances of the SM being deployed, we will continue to perform the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transition from AAVE emissions;</li>\n<li>Introduce new categories;</li>\n<li>Amend emission schedules; and,</li>\n<li>Progressively align protocol exposure with SM holdings;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Aave Liquidity Network</strong></p>\n<p>With upcoming changes in the Aave product stack, including the Liquidity Network and the stablecoin’s multichain deployment, new challenges will arise in integrating these aspects with other products.

These initiatives are aimed at helping to continue the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem by showcasing Aave Protocol’s core values. Thank you for reviewing this proposal and for your earlier questions and positive vote in the snapshot.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Although the Aave Protocol has emerged as a leader within DeFi, the sector at large is still in its nascent stages, and Aave should work hard to retain its spot as a leader. For the events proposal from the DAO for 2024, Aave Labs wants to concentrate on proposing fewer but higher-quality events to maximize impact.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>Aave Labs is requesting a budget allocation for 650,000 GHO for events for the remainder of 2024 for EthCC Brussels (45%) and Devcon Bangkok (55%). These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Hackathons &amp; Bounties: We want to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, and to remain visible and competitive in a growing industry, but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem. We propose to sponsor one ETHGlobal hackathon in Q4 in Bangkok.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open Finance Day: We are hosting Open Finance Day in partnership with key players in DeFi for high quality talks, networking, and light bites. Talks will include members of the DeFi community, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members and service providers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences is an opportunity to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge, and industry insights. Typically featuring panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts, side events are designed to strengthen awareness of Aave and GHO technology among strategic audiences, reach new target audiences, and ensure Aave and GHO remain top-of-mind within and outside the community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Merch: Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the new visual identity and the beloved Ronnie ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merchandise people actually wear, use, and love.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>rAAVE: To celebrate the Aave community’s welcoming culture, we aim to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Brussels and Devcon in Bangkok. To mitigate some costs for rAAVE, we are planning to potentially obtain co-sponsorship with current or potentially new partners for the Aave ecosystem. Due to the event’s high visibility, it is crucial that if co-sponsorship is obtained, the selected partners are aligned with the Aave Community and this is conducted in a balanced manner.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"activations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#activations-4\"></a>Activations</h1>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>rAAVE</td>\n<td>July &amp; Nov TBD</td>\n<td>During the weeks of EthCC &amp; Devcon. rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem.

CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> platform.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every<br>\nwallet. As of June 2024, <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange<br>\nplatform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform.</p>\n<p>To enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> introduced a Liquid<br>\nStaking Token (LST) - <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).</p>\n<p>Currently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues.</p>\n<p>Other liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers.</p>\n<p>The liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> platform.</p>\n<p>Integrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand<br>\nfrom CDCETH users on the <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> platform to utilize the LST as collateral to<br>\nborrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as<br>\ncollateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded,</p>\n<p>Confidential banners/listings on the <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main<br>\nApp platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.<br>\nOnboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users<br>\nand <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve<br>\nCDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH &amp; Aave adoption<br>\n&amp; increased revenues for both parties.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proof-of-liquidity-pol-and-deposit-commitments-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#proof-of-liquidity-pol-and-deposit-commitments-6\"></a>Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.</p>\n<p>Integration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a>’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-7\"></a>Specification</h3>\n<p>Contract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e<br>\nRate Provider contract for current exchange rate:<br>\n0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)</p>\n<p>Risk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"audits-relevant-links-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#audits-relevant-links-8\"></a>Audits &amp; Relevant links</h3>\n<p>Audit: <a href=\"https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\">https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024</a><br>\nIssuer: <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a><br>\nWhitepaper: CDCETH<br>\nDeFillama: <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth\">https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth</a><br>\nCoingecko: <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth\">https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> Staking page: <a href=\"https://crypto.com/staking\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Crypto Staking — Crypto.com | Earn up to 16.64% per year by staking with us</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> Liquid Staking Q&amp;A page: <a href=\"https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Liquid Staking | Crypto.com Help Center</a></p>\n<p>Community:<br>\nTwitter/X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptocom\" class=\"inline-onebox\">x.com</a><br>\nTelegram: <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a><br>\nNews on Telegram: <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a><br>\nDiscord: <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"disclaimer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#disclaimer-9\"></a>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>The ACI is not directly affiliated with <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> and did not receive compensation for the creation of this proposal.

As Maker is minting DAI into Spark and represents 97.8% of the DAI liquidity in Spark, Maker is the main recipient of interest paid by Spark users.</p>\n<p>This situation, also considering the fact that PheonixLabs (devs of Spark) is an entity on MakerDAO payroll, makes it clear that Spark and Maker are the same entity. This is enforced by Spark becoming an official Maker Subdao as part of their “endgame”.</p>\n<p>We then have reasons to consider the Spark &amp; Aave DAO agreement to be a Maker &amp; Aave DAO agreement as Spark is a transparent proxy of Maker entity.</p>\n<p>As a result, we consider the creative accounting done by Maker leading to a ~1m$/year profit share to Aave to be a reason for a breach of our agreement and justification to declare Spark as a non-approved fork of the Aave Codebase by the Aave Governance.</p>\n<p>To de-escalate conflict and improve the Maker/Aave relationship, the ACI <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-aave-revenue-share-calculation-payment-4-q2-2024/24572/5?u=lemiscate\">made several synergies proposals</a> in the MakerDAO forum to change the paradigm in the Aave &amp; Maker relation and create mutually beneficial markets, allowing both DAOs to increase their profits compared to the status quo and benefiting the DAI &amp; Maker ecosystems.</p>\n<p>This proposal allows the Aave governance to provide feedback on the future of the Aave/Maker diplomacy and get out of the current status quo that is optimal for none of the parties involved.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>The Aave governance is invited to express their opinion on this proposal with the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Option A: Declare Spark in breach of agreement<br>\nThis option will declare Spark a non-approved Fork of the Aave codebase</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Option B: Approve new dynamics in Aave &amp; Maker protocol relationship</p>\n<p>This will give greenlight signal to develop and deploy new synergistic markets to make the DAI shine and allow Maker to re-activate a D3M policy on markets tailored for them and the Main mainnet market.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This option will be followed by specific TEMP CHECK &amp;

However, it also brings limitations, especially considering the existence of many non-EVM blockchains that offer different advantages such as lower transaction fees, higher throughput, and more advanced consensus mechanisms. In addition to purely technical advantages, many non-EVM blockchains can allow the Aave community to expand to an entirely new ecosystem, previously inaccessible user groups, and introduce new product possibilities.</p>\n<p>Aptos is a blockchain designed for building scalable and secure dApps. Developed by former leaders of Meta’s Diem blockchain project, it aims to address some of the limitations in existing blockchain systems such as throughput, scalability, and security. With a TVL of approximately $350m and growing rapidly, Aptos is the 17th largest chain by TVL (source: <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chain/Aptos\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFiLlama</a>). Its robust infrastructure offers high transaction throughput, low, predictable fees, and advanced security through the <a href=\"https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/why-move\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Move programming language</a>, that make Aptos an ideal platform for DeFi applications. The chain has a diverse array of <a href=\"https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/projects/defi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi</a> offerings, including prominent projects like Thala, Aries Markets, Amnis Finance, Econia, alongside primarily EVM-native projects such as Sushiswap and Pancake Swap. Aptos Labs Founders Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching have leveraged their extensive experience at Meta to propel Aptos towards becoming a leader in scalable and secure blockchain solutions. Moreover, Aptos has established high-profile partnerships with industry giants like Google Cloud, Microsoft, SK Telecom and many more others, further enhancing its technological capabilities and broadening its influence.</p>\n<p><em>Advantages of Aptos</em></p>\n<p>Aptos offers several significant advantages that make it an ideal platform for high-demand applications. With its ability to handle over <a href=\"https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">30,000 transactions per second (TPS)</a>, it excels in supporting DeFi, real-time financial services, gaming, AI and other use cases. The platform’s agile governance allows for rapid upgrades and swift implementation of new features. Additionally, Aptos ensures low and predictable fees through a stable fee model, and its use of the Move programming language enhances security with formal verification and resource-oriented programming. Built-in security features and automated auditing tools streamline the security process, while advanced state management techniques optimize data storage and access. Furthermore, Aptos simplifies integration with other blockchains through built-in interoperability, creating a cohesive and efficient ecosystem for developers and users alike.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation:</h3>\n<p>Deploying Aave V3 on Aptos represents a groundbreaking expansion as it marks Aave’s first deployment on a non-EVM blockchain. This strategic move is significant as it opens up new technological frontiers, diversifies Aave’s ecosystem, and underscores its commitment to innovation.</p>\n<p>By leveraging Aptos’ innovative technology and developer community, Aave can address diverse financial needs, attract new users, and drive greater innovation in the DeFi sector. This deployment aligns with the Aave community’s strategic goal to explore new technological possibilities and tap into a wider pool of talent and resources.</p>\n<p>Key benefits of deploying Aave V3 on Aptos include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First Non-EVM Deployment:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>This deployment is a significant milestone as Aave’s first move beyond EVM-compatible blockchains. It positions Aave to explore and integrate with new blockchain ecosystems, enhancing its resilience and broadening its reach.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Early Mover Advantage and Strong Brand:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave is a leading brand in the DeFi space, with a strong reputation and market share. By deploying on Aptos, Aave captures early mover advantages on a high-performance blockchain, similar to its strategic expansions to Polygon and other L2s. This can attract both seasoned DeFi users and new participants exploring Aptos.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Aptos’ Strategic Position:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The Aptos team, with their background from Meta’s Diem project, has strong connections and expertise in finance, social and gaming sectors. Integrating Aave into Aptos complements these areas by adding a mature financial layer, essential for a complete blockchain ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>High Transaction Throughput:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Aptos supports up to <a href=\"https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">30,000 transactions per second (TPS)</a>, crucial for DeFi protocols like Aave that handle a high volume of transactions, including loans, repayments, and interest accruals. This high throughput can significantly enhance user experience and enable new use cases that require high-frequency transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Enhanced Security with Move Language:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave v3 introduces sophisticated risk management tools and improved security protocols. The Move programming language used by Aptos has inherent security advantages, such as preventing reentrancy attacks. This alignment can lead to a more secure DeFi lending environment, leveraging Move’s safety features and formal verification.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Transaction Cost Efficiency:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave v3 focuses on gas efficiency, critical for reducing transaction costs. Aptos’ efficient processing capabilities further complement this by potentially lowering transaction fees even more. This makes Aave more accessible and attractive to a broader range of users, from retail participants to institutional players.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Modular and Flexible Architecture:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave v3’s modular and flexible architecture facilitates easier upgrades and expansions. Aptos supports upgradable smart contracts and a flexible account model, enhancing this aspect.

Deploying a GSM on the Arbitrum network enables swaps to be filled without unnecessarily creating an arbitrage opportunity between networks.</p>\n<p>With the LTIPP ARB grant coinciding with GHO being launched on Arbtirum, the Aave DAO can stimulate demand for GHO whilst also restricting the Bridge Facilitator mint cap to encourage users to mint GHO via the GSMs. User will also be able to swap USDC and USDT for GHO via aggregators that have integrated the GSM. This will lead to USDC and USDT being deposited into the GSM.</p>\n<p>With a healthy balance of USDC and USDT in each respective GSM, the Bridge Facilitator cap can be raised more aggressively and a GHO Bucket Cap with Facilitor role can be introduced to Aave v3 on Arbitrum.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>The below outline the proposed changes to be included in the governance proposal submission.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ethereum-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#ethereum-4\"></a>Ethereum</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"arbitrum-focused-facilitator-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#arbitrum-focused-facilitator-5\"></a>Arbitrum Focused Facilitator</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mint Cap</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2M Units</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"ccip-bucket-capacity-adjustment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#ccip-bucket-capacity-adjustment-6\"></a>CCIP Bucket Capacity Adjustment</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mint Cap</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2M Units</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"arbitrum-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#arbitrum-7\"></a>Arbitrum</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"ccip-facilitator-capacity-adjustment-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#ccip-facilitator-capacity-adjustment-8\"></a>CCIP Facilitator Capacity Adjustment</h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mint Cap</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2M Units</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"gsm-configuration-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#gsm-configuration-9\"></a>GSM Configuration</h3>\n<p>The below provides the initial configuration of the USDC and USDT GSMs that will be updated by the GHO Stewards post launch.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Freeze Lower Bound</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$0.990</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Freeze Upper Bound</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$1.010</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unfreeze Lower Bound</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$0.995</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unfreeze Upper Bound</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$1.005</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mint GHO Fee</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0.05%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Burn GHO Fee</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0.20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Supply Cap</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1.00M</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Any deviation from the above will be shared in the comments section below prior to the AIP being submited for vote.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"disclosure-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#disclosure-10\"></a>Disclosure</h1>\n<p>TokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.
