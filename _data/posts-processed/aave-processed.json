It also explores new use cases for GHO, such as lending against PTs or LP tokens, thereby increasing GHO’s adoption.</li>\n<li>Organization / DAO responsible for operation of the Facilitator (if applicable):<br>\nTKSpring Ltd., based in Taiwan, built and maintained the Term Structure protocol. The company is a subsidiary of Decentral Portal (BVI) invested by Cumberland DRW, Hashkey Capital, etc.</li>\n<li>History, Details, Background of the operator of the Facilitator (if applicable):<br>\nTKSpring Ltd. has been building Term Structure since late 2022.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The company raised $4.25M in November 2023, led by Cumberland DRW.</li>\n<li>The company received grants from the Arbitrum Foundation in March 2024.</li>\n<li>The protocol went live in June 2024 with wstETH, weETH, wBTC, and sDAI as the collateral.</li>\n<li>The protocol started to support Pendle’s PTs as collateral in August 2024.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47455-credit-line-details-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47455-credit-line-details-2\"></a>Credit Line Details</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Requested Facilitator Cap: 4M GHO</li>\n<li>Cap Increase Roadmap (if applicable):</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Upon successfully utilizing 1M GHO with aTokens as collateral, increase the cap to 2M GHO.</li>\n<li>Upon successfully utilizing an additional 1M GHO with aTokens and Pendle’s PTs as collateral, increase the cap to 3M GHO.</li>\n<li>Upon successfully utilizing an additional 1M GHO with aTokens, Pendle’s PTs, and LP tokens as collateral, increase the cap to 4M GHO.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Use of Funds:<br>\nIssuing fixed-rate and fixed-term loans against aTokens, PTs, and potentially LP tokens from third parties’ POL.</li>\n<li>Revenue Streams:<br>\nOur robust revenue model includes multiple streams:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Borrowing Fees: 10% of the interest from loans.</li>\n<li>Spread on the Interest: We apply a spread on the interest rate to lend to the borrowers.</li>\n<li>Withdrawal Fees: 2 GHO per withdrawal from our zkTrue-up.</li>\n<li>Protocol Penalties: We charge up to 5% on the collateral as the protocol penalty upon liquidation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Revenue Split / Interest Terms:<br>\n40% of GHO-associated lending/borrowing revenue from points a and b above will be shared with Aave.</li>\n<li>Collateral Posted:<br>\nNo, we will not be posting any collateral. Our protocol is designed to mathematically ensure that the borrowers over-collateralize all loans. This means that for every loan created, the borrower must provide collateral worth more than the loan itself; otherwise, the transaction will fail when submitted back to Ethereum. This design choice eliminates the need for us, as the protocol operators, to post additional collateral. It’s a key feature of our system that helps maintain security and stability for all users.</li>\n<li>Other Commercial Details/Considerations:</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47455-mechanism-risk-details-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47455-mechanism-risk-details-3\"></a>Mechanism &amp; Risk Details</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Detailed Description of the Facilitator:<br>\nTerm Structure enables users to borrow GHO at fixed rates and terms on our zkRollup (zkTrue-up), using aTokens as collateral. Users deposit assets on Ethereum, which are then used as collateral on our zkRollup. This allows for gas-free transactions, with users only paying transaction fees on the rollup. Additionally, the system is designed to be non-custodial. Users can retrieve their assets with the forced withdrawal even if our server is down. Lastly, we guarantee mathematically that each loan is over-collateralized, ensuring the system’s stability and security.</li>\n<li>How Facilitator is backing GHO:<br>\nWith aTokens, PTs, or LP tokens as the collateral. Also, each loan is over-collateralized.</li>\n<li>If RWA - description of legal structure etc:<br>\nN/A</li>\n<li>Detail any / all risks (Oracle risk, Third-party Dependencies, Contract risk, Cross-chain, Bridging, Regulatory, etc) as well as any prevention/mitigation methods:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Oracle Risk:<br>\nWe use oracles like RedStone and Chainlink to price the value of the collateral right now. If one provides a price that severely deviates from the actual price, loans can be liquidated. To mitigate this, we can use the median price between multiple providers.</li>\n<li>Insufficient Liquidity:<br>\nWe need a certain level of liquidity to liquidate the collateral for a loan. If there isn’t, bad debts could be incurred. We will strategically select highly liquid collaterals to ensure adequate liquidity and implement a conservative, scalable cap structure for maximum borrowable amounts.</li>\n<li>Rug Pull:<br>\nSince we aim to support collaterals issued by third parties, these assets could be worthless should the team behind those protocols disappear. We will exclusively work with teams with proven track records or support assets issued by immutable contracts, minimizing the risk of rug pulls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47455-governance-controls-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47455-governance-controls-4\"></a>Governance Controls</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>List of controls given to Aave DAO:<br>\nAs a rule of thumb, Term Structure keeps functions related to daily operations, and others are given to Aave DAO.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>setVerifier: set the address for the verifier, the smart contract on Ethereum that verifies the ZK proof upon submission</li>\n<li>setEvacuVerifier: set the address that can be used to trigger the evacuation mode</li>\n<li>setPriceFeed: set the Oracle address for an asset</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Controls given not to Aave DAO:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>setInsuranceAddr: set the Insurance Fund address</li>\n<li>setTreasuryAddr: set the Treasury address</li>\n<li>setFlashLoanPremium: set the fee for the flash loan</li>\n<li>setActivatedRoller: set if the roll-to-Aave function is active or not</li>\n<li>setVaultAddr: set the vault’s address</li>\n<li>setFundWeight: set the weight/discount factor for each asset</li>\n<li>setPaused: set if the system is paused</li>\n<li>setStableCoin: set if an asset is a stablecoin</li>\n<li>setMinDepositAmt: set the minimum deposit amount for an asset.</li>\n<li>withdrawProtocolFee: set the withdrawal fee for an asset</li>\n<li>setBorrowFeeRate: set the borrowing fee for an asset</li>\n<li>setRollOverFee: set the rollover fee for an asset</li>\n<li>setHalfLiquidationThreshold: set the threshold for half liquidation</li>\n<li>setLiquidationFactor: set the threshold for full liquidation</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Alternative controls / roles that may be present but not set (optimistic governance?

Stay tuned for an overview of all grants awarded, a retroactive summary of how Aave Grants evolved, and a final treasury breakdown.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-47402-update-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47402-update-5\"></a>Update</h1>\n<p>This past May marks three years since the community welcomed the idea of a community funded grants program to the Aave ecosystem. Aave Grants DAO (AGD) has gone on to become a pioneer in crypto grants, supporting over 250 teams with grants to grow Aave and GHO, encouraging countless contributors to join the Aave ecosystem, and inspiring numerous grants programs across the industry.</p>\n<p>AGD has evolved as the Aave protocol and Aave ecosystem has grown. AGD’s focus and support started with the first V2 deployments and shifted with new releases and priorities from the community, most recently with Aave V3 and GHO.</p>\n<p>The last major interaction on the governance forum from AGD was at the beginning of 2024 when our <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x774c3ae45347e9778988143c59c56bf994661470c9103d69b30955652bb21f16\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">renewal proposal fell short</a>. Since then, we have continued to operate by awarding grants to builders with the resources we have remaining. We have also reflected on the feedback received from various stakeholders, Aave Grants’ role in the ecosystem, and how the ecosystem needs have changed since AGD’s inception.</p>\n<p>AGD has continued to drive impact to the Aave ecosystem, with <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/agd-2024-recent-work-updates/16981/3\">recent grantees being some of the highest quality teams ever seen</a>. However, this is under the same structure and processes, that although have evolved and been augmented, are still relatively the same as when AGD started. Continuing to shift our focus and experimenting as we have done throughout AGD’s life is not enough at this point in time. A new approach is needed to maintain a high quality, impactful, and forward thinking grants program that the Aave ecosystem deserves.</p>\n<p>There were no other Service Providers when AGD launched in May 2021. Today there is a thriving ecosystem of teams interacting directly with and driving forward the Aave protocol, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave Labs focused on innovation and events</li>\n<li>BGD focused on protocol development</li>\n<li>ACI focused on business development and growth</li>\n<li>Chaos Labs and Llama Risk focused on risk management</li>\n<li>TokenLogic and Karpatkey focused on treasury management</li>\n<li>Certora focused on security verification processes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we can work with Service Providers under AGD’s existing framework and processes, the impact and potential does not compare to what is possible if a net new program is made with the input of Aave’s diverse contributor base from the get go.</p>\n<p>With this backdrop and after conversations with the whole AGD team, it is time to close the first chapter on AGD and start the process of creating something new with the community that will best serve the current Aave ecosystem and push all of crypto grants and community programs forward. To facilitate this, we will wind down the majority of operations and begin working with the community to create something new from the ground up. Specifically, starting immediately we will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pause all new grants.</strong> Any applications in progress will be paused and the application will be removed from our website. The aim will be to re engage these applicants once new processes are in place</li>\n<li><strong>Disband team.</strong> The AGD team will be appropriately disbanded. Bill will remain to coordinate discussions with relevant parties and guide the next steps.</li>\n<li><strong>Engage the community.</strong> We will reach out to Service Providers, delegates and other key stakeholders in the Aave ecosystem to help shape what comes next and understand how a new version of AGD could best serve them. We invite everyone in the community to share their opinion and participate in shaping the future of grants in the Aave ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The current multisig signers and setup will remain until an appropriate transition plan is in place. The current signers have agreed to continue their duties reviewing and signing transactions, and helping to transition when appropriate.</p>\n<p>In subsequent posts we will follow up with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A final overview of all grants distributed and their current status. This information will also be made available in a way that is accessible and remains available to the community over the long term.</li>\n<li>A retroactive summary of how AGD evolved, lessons learned, and other takeaways.</li>\n<li>A final breakdown of the AGD treasury.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes will best position AGD to forge a new path forward. AGD is excited to work with the community and share updates as progress is made.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/update-from-aave-grants-winding-down-agd-1-0-and-what-s-next/18707\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/update-from-aave-grants-winding-down-agd-1-0-and-what-s-next/18707","pubDate":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 15:23:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-18707"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/update-from-aave-grants-winding-down-agd-1-0-and-what-s-next/18707.rss","#text":"Update from Aave Grants: Winding Down AGD 1.0 and What’s Next"},"filter":false},{"title":"[TEMP CHECK] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll","dc:creator":"Rof","category":"New Asset","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-47391-temp-check-onboard-stone-to-aave-v3-on-scroll-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47391-temp-check-onboard-stone-to-aave-v3-on-scroll-1\"></a>[TEMP CHECK] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47391-author-stakestone-team-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47391-author-stakestone-team-2\"></a>Author: StakeStone Team</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47391-date-2024-08-19-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47391-date-2024-08-19-3\"></a>Date: 2024-08-19</h2>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><strong>Simple Summary</strong></strong><br>\nStakeStone is the protocol issuing STONE, the liquid ETH, with over 150k users. Currently, StakeStone is seeking support to onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll and is launching a series of initiatives to boost liquidity and Aave adoption.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Motivation/Background</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Asset validation:</strong></p>\n<p>STONE is an ERC-20 rebalancing token that generates risk-free rewards for ETH based on blue-chip underlying assets like Lido, EigenLayer, and Symbiotic in a decentralized manner through our OPAP governance mechanism. StakeStone currently has $350 million worth of STONE deployed on Scroll. To ensure that STONE has robust liquidity, in addition to the STONE-ETH DEX liquidity on Scroll, STONE also has PMM powered cross-chain liquidity. Users can perform cross-chain redemption and receive ETH on the Ethereum mainnet within 40 seconds, with optimized pricing.</p>\n<p>STONE aims to become the liquid ETH, covering users’ opportunity costs while creating more use cases for STONE holders. Thanks to its architecture supporting multiple underlying assets, STONE can maintain market adaptability and stability over the long term, allowing users and the protocol to avoid the need to mint or integrate a new asset.</p>\n<p>STONE has undergone multiple rounds of audits conducted by firms such as Quantstamp, Slowmist, Veridise, and Secure3, and closely collaborates with security organizations like Cobo and Coincover.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of listing STONE token:</strong><br>\nSTONE is collaborating with Scroll to build a DeFi ecosystem. STONE works closely with various protocols to support the ecosystem and facilitate their go-to-market strategies. Currently, STONE is the largest asset category on Scroll, accounting for over 30% of the total TVL across the chain, with a high utilization rate (close to 90%). The StakeStone team is dedicated to offering services to protocols that support STONE while fostering collaboration for shared prosperity, which is reflected in the high utilization of STONE across various DeFi use cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Market Impact:</strong><br>\nAs of today, over 180,000 ETH have been staked in StakeStone, with a historical high of 340,000 ETH. StakeStone has also successfully processed nearly 1 billion dollars in inflows and outflows. Meanwhile, STONE has a wide user base, and all users are very active on-chain. We hope that this active community can bring more liquidity and activity to AAVE.</p>\n<p><strong>Chain to be deployed/listed:</strong></p>\n<p>Scroll chain. Scroll grew to become the top zk rollup in terms of TVL and shows continued strength in community and volume.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments</strong></strong></p>\n<p>StakeStone has collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity for a more robust and diverse liquidity environment at AAVE.

Previous discussions around supply cap methodologies resulted in the [TEMP CHECK] vote to limit the maximum supply cap of an LST to 75% of that LST’s circulating supply.</p>\n<p>In the year and a half since that vote, Aave has continued to grow and new liquid restaking tokens (LRT) like weETH have shown strong demand as collateral in the protocol. LRTs have also seen strong proliferation to various chains with varying levels of the total supply spread across multiple L2s.</p>\n<p>As a result, Aave is often the main location for storing LST and LRTs on any given chain and often represents an outsized share of the total supply on any given chain.</p>\n<p>In this new environment, Aave has becomes the main location for LRT supply on chains like Scroll and Base, while also driving LST/LRT demand on chains like Polygon PoS. Simply put, when Aave increases LST supply caps, new supply comes to fill it.</p>\n<p>LST and LRT have also had longer time in the market, with clear support for peg and asset profiles developing. Aave’s use of oracles based on the LST redemption rate and implementation of CAPO have allowed for reduced risk from the secondary market volatility.</p>\n<p>This calls for a new limit on a collateral’s supply limit as a percentage of the total supply. This proposal suggests raising the community preference supply cap limit to 90% of the total supply.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47162-specification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47162-specification-6\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The community preference will update from 75% of total supply to 90% of total supply.</li>\n<li>Risk Parameters will be updated by Risk Service Providers based on the results of this ARFC as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47162-useful-links-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47162-useful-links-7\"></a>Useful Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba\">[Temp Check] - Community Preference for Supply Cap Limits for LSTs</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47162-disclaimer-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47162-disclaimer-8\"></a>Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>The ACI has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47162-next-steps-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47162-next-steps-9\"></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Publish a standard ARFC and collect community &amp; service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.</li>\n<li>If the ARFC snapshot passes, this community preference becomes canon and risk service providers incorporate this into current and future recommendations.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47162-copyright-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47162-copyright-10\"></a>Copyright</h2>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0</a></p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-community-preference-for-supply-cap-limits/18614\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-community-preference-for-supply-cap-limits/18614","pubDate":"Mon, 12 Aug 2024 09:22:07 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-18614"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-community-preference-for-supply-cap-limits/18614.rss","#text":"[ARFC] Increase Community Preference For Supply Cap Limits"},"filter":false},{"title":"[ARFC] Onboard steakLRT to Aave v3 Lido Instance","dc:creator":"ACI","category":"New Asset","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-47160-arfc-onboard-steaklrt-to-aave-v3-lido-instance-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-arfc-onboard-steaklrt-to-aave-v3-lido-instance-1\"></a><strong>[ARFC] Onboard steakLRT to Aave v3 Lido Instance</strong></h2>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47160-author-aci-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-author-aci-2\"></a><strong>Author: ACI</strong></h2>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47160-date-2024-08-12-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-date-2024-08-12-3\"></a><strong>Date: 2024-08-12</strong></h2>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers 2024-08-19 and ARFC has been updated.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47160-summary-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-summary-4\"></a><strong>Summary</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal aims to onboard steakLRT, Steakhouse’s restaking token built on Mellow and Symbiotic, after TEMP CHECK &amp; TEMP CHECK Snapshot have passed.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47160-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-motivation-5\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>The Steakhouse Resteaking Vault, steakLRT, is a wstETH-based liquid restaking token powered by Mellow and the Symbiotic restaking middleware. This is a logical extension of the work Steakhouse is doing as Lido DAO’s Finance Workstream, and is a work in progress proof of the crucial role that Lido stETH can play in helping restaking become more efficient, while preserving the decentralization of Ethereum.</p>\n<p>The onboarding of steakLRT to the Aave v3 Lido instance aims to enhance the diversity and robustness of the Aave ecosystem by integrating a novel restaking token.</p>\n<p>steakLRT, built on Mellow and Symbiotic, brings unique value propositions and additional yield opportunities through boosted points programs. By including steakLRT, we can continue to attract user deposits from restaking narratives and support the further growth of a Lido instance. Further, beacuse steakLRT accepts wstETH deposits, there are strategic programs that can be run to increase wstETH deposit yield through looping strategies and liquidity mining. These will continue to make the Aave v3 Lido Instance the best place to deposit wstETH as collateral.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47160-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\"></a><strong>Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments</strong></h3>\n<p>Mellow and Symbiotic deposits held as LRTs like steakLRT earn Symbiotic and Mellow points.</p>\n<p>Mellow will do an additional boosted points program for deposits into the Aave v3 Lido instance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47160-specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-specification-7\"></a><strong>Specification</strong></h3>\n<p>Contract address: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc\">0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc</a></p>\n<p>Risk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers 2024-08-19 and ARFC has been updated.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Isolation Mode</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Borrowable</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collateral Enabled</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Supply Cap</td>\n<td>240</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Borrow Cap</td>\n<td>24</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Debt Ceiling</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LTV</td>\n<td>72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LT</td>\n<td>75%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Liquidation Penalty</td>\n<td>7.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Liquidation Protocol Fee</td>\n<td>10.00%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Variable Base</td>\n<td>0.0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Variable Slope1</td>\n<td>7.00%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Variable Slope2</td>\n<td>300.00%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uoptimal</td>\n<td>45.00%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reserve Factor</td>\n<td>15.00%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stable Borrowing</td>\n<td>Disabled</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flashloanable</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Siloed Borrowing</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Borrowable in Isolation</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>E-Mode Category</td>\n<td>ETH-correlated</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"p-47160-capo-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-capo-8\"></a>CAPO</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent</th>\n<th>ratioReferenceTime</th>\n<th>MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>9.68%</td>\n<td>monthly</td>\n<td>7 days</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-47160-useful-links-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-useful-links-9\"></a><strong>Useful Links:</strong></h3>\n<p>steakLRT announcement post: <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@SteakhouseFi/steakLRT\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Introducing steakLRT - HackMD</a></p>\n<p>steakLRT Mellow Vault: <a href=\"https://app.mellow.finance/restake/ethereum-steaklrt\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Mellow</a></p>\n<p>TEMP CHECK - <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-steaklrt-to-aave-v3-lido-instance/18518/4\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[TEMP CHECK] Onboard steakLRT to Aave v3 Lido Instance - #4 by ACI</a></p>\n<p>TEMP CHECK Snapshot - <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x29d3044e3ba8eb1bd071cf7d1f05f1d4cf53451571ecf94ebdc0384cc5a2bb92\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Snapshot</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47160-disclaimer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47160-disclaimer-10\"></a><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal is powered by Skywards.

The stages are as follows: temp check forum post, temp check snapshot, ARFC forum post, ARFC snapshot, AIP on-chain vote. A standard proposal will take a minimum of 19 days to pass through all of these stages, although it is uncommon that it progresses this quickly as time is needed for writing and reviewing payloads, and there are timelocks and other waiting periods relating to the various voting stages.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-47048-proposal-types-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-proposal-types-4\"></a><strong>Proposal types</strong></h2>\n<p>There are generally three main types of proposals in Aave Governance; these three general proposal classifications strictly refer to the maturity of a proposal in the Aave Governance Process. In specific situations, in order to minimise governance burden and increase speed, there are streamlined versions of this process. These situations are described in a later section.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TEMP CHECK: These serve as “temperature checks” to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.</li>\n<li>TEMP CHECK Snapshot: This is an off-chain vote using the Snapshot platform, with voting starting after the TEMP CHECK discussion period has ended.</li>\n<li>ARFC: Aave Request for Comment (ARFCs) are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.</li>\n<li>ARFC Snapshot: This is an off-chain vote using the Snapshot platform, with voting starting after the ARFC discussion period has ended.</li>\n<li>AIP: Aave Improvement Proposal (AIPs) are a formal proposal to improve the Aave Protocol; before submitting an AIP, an ARFC should be submitted to the community to gather feedback.

Voting in the Aave DAO allows AAVE, stkAAVE, and aAAVE holders to participate directly or delegate their voting power to representatives.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Off-chain voting (<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth\">Snapshot</a>):</strong></em> Off-chain votes are used to gauge the sentiment for Temp Checks and ARFCs. The off-chain voting period lasts 3 days for both Temp Check and ARFC votes.</p>\n<p><em><strong>On-chain (<a href=\"https://app.aave.com/governance/\">Native</a>):</strong></em> On-chain voting is required on any Aave Improvement Proposal. Aave on-chain votes will occur on the Aave Governance Portal. The voting period must last for a minimum period of 3 days. With the launch of V3 governance, it is now possible to vote across multiple chains and carry out gasless voting, read more <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/governance/master/aave-governance-v3\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The on-chain voting process is composed of four stages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First of all, the proposal and payload are reviewed by Security Service Providers to ensure that it is not malicious and that it doesn’t contain errors which put the protocol at risk.</li>\n<li>The second stage is entered if no errors or malicious payload are identified, and the proposal is moved on-chain. Once the proposal is on-chain, a voting delay of 1 day must pass before the proposal becomes active.</li>\n<li>In the third stage, once the voting delay has elapsed the proposal becomes active and is available to be voted on. This stage lasts for 3 days.</li>\n<li>In the fourth stage, once the voting period has ended, the proposal will either have SUCCEEDED or FAILED, depending on whether it has passed quorum and has a majority of YAE votes or not. In this stage, if the proposal has passed, the payload is queued with a timelock of 1 day, after this is elapsed the payload may be executed. If the proposal is not executed before the end of a grace period it expires and must be deployed and voted on again from the beginning of the on-chain voting process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A visual representation of this flow is shown in the figure below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/68b1dc5e533ce8b9ee19904b8f07ebf7ec8131ec.png\" alt=\"onchain voting process\" data-base62-sha1=\"eWaILeczaodiYyF5Wzq0lDBKdLm\" width=\"1536\" height=\"513\"></p>\n<p>On-chain voting process</p>\n<p>In both off-chain and on-chain votes, the voting power is directly proportional to the amount of AAVE, stkAAVE or aAAVE a user holds or has delegated to them.

In addition to this, the winning vote must also have 320,000 votes. For example if a proposal had 320,000 total votes, with less than 320,000 votes for the winning option, this would not meet quorum requirements. Any changes to the quorum requirements must be amended by the community through an AIP.</p>\n<p>Each vote has to reach the minimum quorum, even if it has a majority, for it to be considered an official proposal. It is the responsibility of the proposal author to enlist voting participation from the community in order to reach a quorum.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47048-aci-skyward-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47048-aci-skyward-8\"></a><strong>ACI Skyward</strong></h3>\n<p>Skyward is a free service launched by <a href=\"https://www.aavechan.com\">ACI</a> to assist Aave DAO members with the proposal process, making it more accessible and streamlined.

For assets already listed in other Aave markets, a direct-to-AIP process is used, skipping the Temp Check stages and taking about 10 days. To use this process the following must be applicable for the asset being onboarded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Existing Aave market presence.</li>\n<li>Submission or feedback from a risk service provider.</li>\n<li>Supply cap not exceeding 50% on the respective chain.</li>\n<li>At least 90 days old Chainlink price feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New listing candidates must deposit $100 worth of the intended asset into the Aave Short Executor.

By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-motivation-5\"></a><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>\n<p>GNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<p>osGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.</p>\n<p>Creating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.</p>\n<p>osGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed <a href=\"https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism\">here</a>. If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.</p>\n<p>osETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-proof-of-liquidity-and-deposit-commitments-6\"></a><strong>Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments</strong></h3>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-specification-7\"></a><strong>Specification</strong></h3>\n<p>Contract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0</p>\n<p>Risk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-useful-links-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-useful-links-8\"></a><strong>Useful Links:</strong></h3>\n<p>osGNO announcement post: <a href=\"https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Announcing the Launch of StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain | by StakeWise | Jul, 2024 | Medium</a></p>\n<p>osGNO Vaults: <a href=\"https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\" class=\"inline-onebox\">StakeWise | Vaults</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-osgno-to-aave-v3-gnosis/18439\">TEMP CHECK Onboard osGNO to Aave V3 Gnosis</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-47043-disclaimer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-47043-disclaimer-9\"></a><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></h3>\n<p>This proposal is powered by Skywards.

Many of you will already know me, but a bit about myself for those who don’t.</p>\n<p>My name is Harry and I worked on Strategy and Governance at Aave Companies (now Aave Labs) for close to two years. In that role I spent a lot of time extremely close to Aave governance. Following that I spent a year working at LayerZero Labs on strategic initiatives. I am currently working @ Stargate Finance helping them rejuvenate their governance as well as @ Members Capital, an upcoming onchain insurance fund, where I’m effectively their in-house degen.</p>\n<p>My passion for the space has only grown throughout this time and my interest in Aave has always remained top of my mind. I am proud to have spent so much time working on Aave and I want to take the next step in my Aave journey and work with the community to help determine the future of one of the most exciting and important projects in the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Why You Should Delegate to Me</strong></p>\n<p>Like some others, such as the amazing <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/EzR3aL\">EzR3aL</a>, I am not some large institution or platform (for now at least). I am a user of Aave, a DAO participant and someone who truly cares about Aave and the DAOs success. By delegating to me you will be delegating to someone who is honest, determined to make Aave better and excited to vote on your behalf. Here are some more specific factors to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarity with the Aave DAO: I know many of the DAOs delegates and service providers personally. You can be assured that any vote I make will be well-informed by discussions with relevant parties.</li>\n<li>Ecosystem-wide connections: My time working in the space has helped me build strong connections throughout it. I intend to not only provide internal support for the DAO, but also help providers and delegates looking to support Aave’s expansions and integrations elsewhere. Having worked with many other protocols and chains very closely I am also a great point of contact for those looking to work with the DAO.</li>\n<li>I truly care about the Aave DAO: Working with the DAO was a labour of love for years. Anyone who knows me knows that I truly care about Aave and the DAO. Delegating to me you can be sure to see this in how I participate.</li>\n<li>Expertise: Not only do I have expertise in the DAO specifically, I also have spent a huge amount of time thinking about governance broadly. I intend to bring these expertise to the table and help to inform governance discussions. Furthermore, having worked at LayerZero and Stargate I now have a strong understanding of the interoperability world which is becoming increasingly important for Aave. Similarly, working with a deeply knowledgeable TradFi team at Members Cap will help me with understanding the role RWAs can play for the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Small sidenote: Some of you know I used to work on an Aave native newsletter that covered the space more broadly. I intend to bring this back. When I do, delegates will get early access and other perks as it develops)</p>\n<p><strong>What Voters Can Expect</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Honesty: I will always strive to be entirely honest in my opinions in the forum. This may seem like a no-brainer, but it is not always the case for delegates throughout the space.</li>\n<li>Consistency: I believe in the strong opinions loosely held mantra.Whilst I am willing to change my mind, I will always follow my values and you can be sure that I will consistently vote in what I view as the best interest of the DAO and users.</li>\n<li>Activity: I am terminally online and am obsessed with the space and more specifically Aave. You should have no concern about me missing a vote.</li>\n<li>Curiosity: I am not afraid to ask questions and I am willing to listen to any idea to understand its merits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Main Focus Points</strong></p>\n<p>Governance and decentralization: Given my experience this is where I believe I add most value. I am especially happy to help people with their proposals to the DAO and give feedback. I also wholeheartedly believe without decentralization none of this is worth anything - so I will emphasize this when relevant.</p>\n<p>Service providers: Over the years I have built extremely strong relationships with service providers. I have also spent a good amount of time reviewing their proposals. I believe I am well placed to focus on helping to keep service providers in check.</p>\n<p>Ecosystem synergies: As mentioned, I have built strong relationships throughout the space. I want to help teams looking to work with Aave and vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not expecting much, or anything really, to start. However over time, through proof of work, I hope to build your trust and support. Together, we can play a role in the future of one of the most exciting and important projects in the space. Let’s do this.</p>\n<p><em>Conflicts of Interest</em><br>\nNot necessarily conflicts of interest but as mentioned I currently work for the Stargate Foundation and Members Capital. I pledge not to use my platform to promote either of these or affiliated groups within the DAO. I am also an Optimism Badgeholder.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/hazbobo-delegate-platform/18524\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://governance.aave.com/t/hazbobo-delegate-platform/18524","pubDate":"Sun, 04 Aug 2024 12:12:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"governance.aave.com-topic-18524"},"source":{"@url":"https://governance.aave.com/t/hazbobo-delegate-platform/18524.rss","#text":"Hazbobo Delegate Platform"},"filter":false}]}}}
