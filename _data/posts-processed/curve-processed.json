The ynETH token (YieldNest’s first LRT) represents native restaked ETH within the YieldNest ecosystem, offering users enhanced yield opportunities. The ynETH/wstETH pool allows users to trade between ynETH and wstETH, combining the benefits of YieldNest and Lido’s wrapped staked ETH.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong><br>\nThe ynETH/wstETH pool requires incentivization to attract liquidity providers and deepen the pool’s liquidity. By adding this pool to the Gauge Controller, liquidity providers will earn CRV rewards, making the pool more attractive and fostering a robust trading environment on Curve Finance. We used Curve Sim to calculate the best parameters, ensuring this pool will be highly competitive and beneficial for Curve, bringing in more admin fees for veCRV stakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Governance:</strong> Decentralization and community governance are important for YieldNest starting as an open finance protocol and plan to become a fully decentralized protocol. We are currently investigating <a href=\"https://aragon.org/aragonosx\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aragon OSx</a> (Aragon V2) and plan to implement this once the protocol is in a more hardened and stable position. The YieldNest contracts are currently upgradeable using standard TransparentUpgradeableProxy and BeaconProxy contracts from the OpenZeppelin libraries. This is necessary given the project’s current stage and its dependency on Eigenlayer, which still makes breaking changes to the core protocol requiring logic upgrades. Admin and multisig addresses, along with their roles, are documented <a href=\"https://docs.yieldnest.finance/security/roles\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a> and will be hardened over time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Oracles:</strong> YieldNest will leverage a Curve Oracle a crvUSD/ynETH oracle will be built by multiplying the TricryptoLlama crvUSD/wstETH oracle with the ynETH/wstETH oracle.

Unlike other bridges, dlcBTC is theft-proof as funds can only return to the original depositor. dlcBTC is minted by a permissioned set of merchants managed by the DLC Foundation, ensuring self-custody and reducing central points of failure. dlcBTC operates as an oracle-free system where 1 BTC = 1 dlcBTC, and its contracts have minimal parameters, making it a fully automated and robust solution.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"wbtc-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.curve.fi#wbtc-8\"></a>WBTC</h3>\n<p>WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) is a tokenized version of Bitcoin (BTC) that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. WBTC is backed 1:1 with Bitcoin and is managed by a consortium of custodians and merchants. WBTC is held in centralized custody by BitGo, introducing counterparty risk. WBTC enables Bitcoin holders to use BTC in the Ethereum ecosystem and access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"motivation-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.curve.fi#motivation-9\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Incentivizing the dlcBTC/WBTC pool is essential to provide deep liquidity for both dlcBTC and WBTC, promoting their usage within the DeFi ecosystem. This will enhance the trading experience for users, ensuring low slippage and high availability for both tokens. Additionally, it will support the broader adoption of decentralized Bitcoin solutions in DeFi, fostering a more robust and diverse ecosystem.</p>\n<p>DLC.Link has committed to co-incentivizing the dlcBTC/WBTC pool to ensure its success and sustainability. This strategic collaboration aims to attract a significant amount of liquidity, thereby enhancing the pool’s depth and efficiency.</p>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"specifications-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.curve.fi#specifications-10\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"governance-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.curve.fi#governance-11\"></a>Governance</h3>\n<p>dlcBTC operates with a minimized governance framework, detailed in this forum post. The protocol’s contracts have minimal parameters and operate as an oracle-free system where 1 BTC = 1 dlcBTC. This soft peg is maintained through market makers such as Amber Group.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"oracles-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.curve.fi#oracles-12\"></a>Oracles</h3>\n<p>dlcBTC utilizes a Chainlink proof of reserve feed to ensure transparency and trust in the system.

Depositors’ Bitcoin is secured in a Discreet Log Contract (DLC), a special type of pseudo-programmable multisig that is supported natively on Bitcoin L1. Mint and burn signals are relayed through DLC.Link’s Attestor network (powered by node operators including Hashkey Cloud, OKX and Everstake).</p>\n<p>However, the attestors cannot receive funds. Attestors cannot maliciously divert or burn a depositors’ BTC collateral, and the collateral can only be released to the wallet address that provided it.</p>\n<p>dlcBTC is not a Bitcoin L2.

The stablecoin’s delta-neutral design ensures price stability, and is backed by a tokenized insurance pool (RLP) to provide additional security and overcollateralization.</p>\n<p>Key features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Stable and Transparent:</strong> USR is backed 100% by ETH collateral pool. Its price fluctuations are hedged using perpetual futures to ensure price stability. This approach creates a delta-neutral portfolio, maintaining a stable value pegged to the US Dollar.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Insurance Layer:</strong> RLP acts as a protection mechanism, absorbing risks related to counterparty defaults and negative interest rates. This additional layer of security guarantees that USR remains overcollateralized, which enhances the stablecoin’s stability and reliability.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Capital Efficiency:</strong> USR and RLP can be minted and redeemed on a 1:1 basis with liquid collateral, avoiding the inefficiencies associated with overcollateralization. This straightforward minting process allows users to efficiently utilize their assets without tying up excessive capital.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Profitable and Secure:</strong> The protocol’s collateral pool generates profits through staking ETH and earning funding fees from futures positions. Additionally, Resolv employs robust risk management strategies, including diversifying exposure to trading venues and using off-exchange custody solutions, to ensure the security and profitability of its assets.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Optimized for Investment:</strong> USR and RLP have different levels of expected yield and its volatility. The protocol’s separation of risks and returns allows investors to understand their investment profiles better, making USR a reliable choice for stable and predictable returns.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong><br>\nResolv is looking to develop depth of secondary liquidity for USR, with Curve USR-USDC pool as its main venue. With more liquidity, Resolv will proceed with integrations with leverage DeFi protocols, enabling more use cases for USR and its purchase flow going through Curve.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Governance:</strong> Governance token RSLV is expected to launch soon. Currently the protocol utilises a multi-signature wallet to deploy smart contracts and operate collateral pool. As the protocol moves into public phase, the contributors will shift protocol governance to public discussions and voting.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Oracles:</strong> There is currently no on-chain oracle for USR. Oracle will be set up as soon as there are more reliable sources of on-chain liquidity.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Audits:</strong> Resolv is audited by MixBytes and Pessimistic, links to audit reports can be found on the protocol documents page (<a href=\"https://docs.resolv.im/resources/security\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Security | Resolv Docs</a>)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Centralization vectors:</strong> Collateral pool that backs Resolv tokens is operated by a centralized backend / Ops team. The signatories for the operations, both offchain and onchain, consist of executive team.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Market History:</strong> Resolv has been live since April 2024 and has current TVL of approx $16mn. Average yield metrics since the start of the product: Native USR staking - 9.16% APR, RLP - 19.36% APR.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Voting Live:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/778\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/778</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://crvhub.com/governance/ownership/778\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://crvhub.com/governance/ownership/778</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.curve.fi/t/proposal-to-add-usr-usdc-pool-to-the-gauge-controller/10155\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.curve.fi/t/proposal-to-add-usr-usdc-pool-to-the-gauge-controller/10155","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 11:38:49 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.curve.fi-topic-10155"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.curve.fi/t/proposal-to-add-usr-usdc-pool-to-the-gauge-controller/10155.rss","#text":"Proposal to add USR-USDC Pool to the Gauge Controller"},"filter":true},{"title":"Proposal to add TriLST-PT Pool to the Gauge Controller","dc:creator":"0xsoe","category":"Gauge Proposals","description":"<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\n<p>Hey everyone, Yusuke here from Napier Finance.

It is backed exclusively by Lido’s stETH and powered by immutable smart contracts with minimized counterparty risk. Designed to be the most decentralized synthetic Bitcoin in DeFi, eBTC allows anyone in the world to borrow BTC at no cost.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>tBTC:</strong> tBTC is a permissionless wrapped Bitcoin, that is 1:1 backed by mainnet BTC. tBTC is trust minimized and redeemable for mainnet BTC without a centralized custodian.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong><br>\nIncentivizing the eBTC/tBTC pool is essential to provide deep liquidity for both eBTC and tBTC, promoting their usage within the DeFi ecosystem. This will enhance the trading experience for users, ensuring low slippage and high availability for both tokens. Additionally, it will support the broader adoption of decentralized Bitcoin solutions in DeFi, fostering a more robust and diverse ecosystem.</p>\n<p>BadgerDAO and Threshold have committed to co-incentivizing the eBTC/tBTC pool to ensure its success and sustainability. This strategic collaboration aims to attract a significant amount of liquidity, thereby enhancing the pool’s depth and efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Governance:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>eBTC:</strong> eBTC’s Minimized Governance framework is detailed in this <a href=\"https://forum.badger.finance/t/ebtc-minimized-governance-framework/6168\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">forum post</a>. The protocol’s contracts are immutable, with minimal parameters that can be modified via two Timelocks with 2 or 7-day delays. Only parameters that do not violate users’ trust assumptions can be changed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>tBTC:</strong> tBTC operates on Threshold DAO’s decentralized threshold encryption protocol. Threshold DAO is governed by the network’s work token, T. T token holders govern the DAO via proposals raised to the Threshold forum, which can be raised to a vote via Snapshot, as well as the on-chain Governor Bravo module via Boardroom. In the future, all contract authorities will be passed to the Governor Bravo contract.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Oracles:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>eBTC:</strong> The eBTC Protocol primarily relies on Chainlink for price data and is adding a secondary (fallback) oracle via governance.

The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool.</p>\n<p>ETH staked through the <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols.</p>\n<p>ETHFI is the governance token that gives community members a direct mechanism to contribute to the <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> protocol and influence the growth of the <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> ecosystem. ETHFI was launched on March 18, 2024</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ether.Fi</a> is looking to seed a ETHFI/weETH twocrypto pool on Curve to serve as a primary source of liquidity for ETHFI on chain. Incentivising a Curve pool will continue to boost the liquidity of the governance token. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the ETHFI token within the DeFi ecosystem. To ensure success, <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> is committed to growing pool liquidity through bribes and incentives.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Governance:</strong> Currently, the <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> protocol utilises a time-locked multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> executives and investors. Governance of ETHFI is comprised of a Discourse channel for discussions, a snapshot page used for voting, and Agora used for voting delegation.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Oracles:</strong> For weETH, the protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Audits:</strong> Audit reports for the <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://ether.fi/</a> protocol are found on the GitBook page - <a href=\"https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Audits | ether.fi</a>. The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Centralization vectors:</strong> The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team and investors. ETHFI is a non-upgradable governance token.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Market History:</strong> eETH has accumulated approx. 1.58M of ETH staked within the protocol since launching in the middle of November 2023. ETHFI has a market cap of approx. 542M, with a FDV of 4.7B. 24 hour trading volume since launch has ranged from</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pool / Token: 0xcccd572b22dee28479b11dd99589a1e4c0682a7e</li>\n<li>Gauge: 0x6579758e9e85434450d638cfbea0f2fe79856dda</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.curve.fi/t/proposal-to-add-ethfi-weeth-on-ethereum-to-gauge-controller/10133\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.curve.fi/t/proposal-to-add-ethfi-weeth-on-ethereum-to-gauge-controller/10133","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Jun 2024 11:22:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.curve.fi-topic-10133"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.curve.fi/t/proposal-to-add-ethfi-weeth-on-ethereum-to-gauge-controller/10133.rss","#text":"Proposal to add ETHFI/weETH on Ethereum to Gauge Controller"},"filter":true},{"title":"sUSDe LlamaLend market for up to 35x leverage with a special monetary policy","dc:creator":"michwill","category":"Proposals","description":"<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>\n<p>Ethena’s sUSDe vault provides a very interesting currency for farming and speculation.

Curve has recently released <a href=\"https://docs.curve.fi/crvUSD/pegkeepers/overview/#pegkeeperv2-and-regulator\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PKv2 documentation</a> where you can read further on the new design.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong>:</p>\n<p>The old pegkeeper was vulnerable to several adverse scenarios, most critically to the risk that a pegkeeper asset depegs temporarily or permanently, causing unbacked crvUSD to enter circulation and potentially resulting in depeg. The new design mitigates this risk by preventing the pegkeeper from depositing crvUSD into circulation if the pool oracle price deviates from other pegkeeper pools. There is also a rate limit implemented that requires multiple pegkeepers to become active before any single pegkeeper can deposit up to its debt ceiling. There is also an emergency admin set to the Curve emergency DAO multisig that can pause pegkeepers if necessary. Together these additional precautions reduce crvUSD’s dependency on the stability of its pegkeeper assets.</p>\n<p>Because of the reduced risk to crvUSD, the proposal here reintroduces TUSD as a pegkeeper asset. It also introduces pyUSD as a new pegkeeper asset, replacing USDP (also issued by Paxos). Both of these assets have been previously reviewed by Llama Risk:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk/PYUSD\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">pyUSD Pegkeeper Onboarding Review</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-trueusd-tusd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">TUSD Asset Risk Assessment</a></p>\n<p><strong>Specification</strong>:</p>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://curvemonitor.com/#/dao/proposal/ownership/728\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DAO vote</a> active for this upgrade.

It is backed exclusively by Lido’s stETH and powered by immutable smart contracts with minimized counterparty risk. Designed to be the most decentralized synthetic Bitcoin in DeFi, eBTC allows anyone in the world to borrow BTC at no cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The request to enable this gauge is motivated by several factors. Firstly, establishing Curve as a primary liquidity venue for eBTC will strengthen the protocol and enhance its composability and use cases. Secondly, Lido aims to expand the liquidity profile of stETH and views eBTC as a strategic pairing due to the synergies between the assets.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the CDP nature of eBTC, backed solely by stETH with a 110% MCR requirement and no fees or interest rates, makes it the most capital-efficient way to long stETH against BTC in DeFi. Having a pool with this pair will enable a smooth path for most leverage operations, and we believe Curve is the perfect venue to handle this with the highest efficiency possible. The liquidity in this pool is expected to drive most of the leverage volume, resulting in high fees for the protocol.</p>\n<p>Finally, Lido plans to incentivize LPs to adopt the pool. The communities of Lido, BadgerDAO, Curve, and Convex have historically collaborated closely, and this pool will further strengthen these ties, unlocking a variety of integrations and synergies.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Governance:</strong> eBTC’s Minimized Governance framework is detailed in this <a href=\"https://forum.badger.finance/t/ebtc-minimized-governance-framework/6168\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">forum post</a>. The protocol’s contracts are immutable, with minimal parameters that can be modified via two Timelocks with 2 or 7-day delays. Only parameters that do not violate users’ trust assumptions can be changed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Oracles:</strong> The eBTC Protocol primarily relies on Chainlink for price data and is adding a secondary (fallback) oracle via governance.

This will spend the remainder of the ARB in the DAO vault.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Proposing to spend the remainder because it’s a hassle to continue creating multiple votes for an inherently finite reward program. The incentives are overall a useful way to bootstrap crvUSD on Arbitrum and Curve Lending on Arbitrum, which requires sufficient crvUSD liquidity to process liquidations and pool liquidity where pool oracles are employed in lending markets. Not anticipating any major departure in strategy that would require adjustments to the reward distribution, so this proposal prefers to distribute all over a reasonable timeframe that slightly reduces the overall rewards to each pool so as not to shock the markets too much when ARB incentives end around early August.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Specification</strong>:</p>\n<p>The vote requires several calls as a series of arguments to the Arbitrum Broadcaster (the contract that relays cross chain messages to the DAO agent on Arbitrum via Arbitrum Bridge):</p>\n<p>Call via agent (<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x40907540d8a6C65c637785e8f8B742ae6b0b9968\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x40907540d8a6C65c637785e8f8B742ae6b0b9968</a>):<br>\n├─ To: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xb7b0FF38E0A01D798B5cd395BbA6Ddb56A323830\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xb7b0FF38E0A01D798B5cd395BbA6Ddb56A323830</a><br>\n├─ Function: broadcast<br>\n└─ Inputs:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">0x25877b9413Cc7832A6d142891b50bd53935feF82 (Arbitrum Vault)\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"transfer\",\n  \"params\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"_token\",\n      \"value\": \"0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548\",\n      \"type\": \"address\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"_to\",\n      \"value\": \"0x452030a5d962d37d97a9d65487663cd5fd9c2b32\",\n      \"type\": \"address\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"_value\",\n      \"value\": \"1.421611e24\",\n      \"type\": \"uint256\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Transfer ARB to the agent)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548 (ARB token)\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"approve\",\n  \"params\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"spender\",\n      \"value\": \"0xf968e2e28460a8f419877df2ec86574636e8262c\",\n      \"type\": \"address\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"amount\",\n      \"value\": \"1.421611e24\",\n      \"type\": \"uint256\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Approve RewardStream to spend the amount of ARB tokens)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">0xF968E2e28460a8F419877Df2Ec86574636e8262c (rewardStream)\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"set_reward_duration\",\n  \"params\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"_duration\",\n      \"value\": \"6912000\",\n      \"type\": \"uint256\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>(set the reward duration to 80 days)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">0xF968E2e28460a8F419877Df2Ec86574636e8262c (RewardStream)\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"notify_reward_amount\",\n  \"params\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"_amount\",\n      \"value\": \"1.421611e24\",\n      \"type\": \"uint256\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>(begin distribution of the received amount to the RewardStream reward_recipients)</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts -

The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.</p>\n<p>ETH staked through the <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on <a href=\"http://ether.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols.</p>\n<p>USDY is a tokenized note secured by short-term US Treasuries, and bank demand deposits.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ether.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a> and Ondo Finance are looking to seed a USDY/weETH cryptoswap pool on Curve to serve as a primary source of liquidity for both assets.
