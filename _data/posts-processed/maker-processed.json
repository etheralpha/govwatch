In this post I will describe several related changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new feature: <strong>NewGovToken Activation</strong></li>\n<li>Changes to LockStaking, including renaming it to <strong>Sealed Activation</strong></li>\n<li>Renaming of SPK Staking to <strong>SPK Activation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below represents my current thinking about the topic and the final design will be subject to the community’s feedback and approval.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"new-feature-newgovtoken-activation-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#new-feature-newgovtoken-activation-1\"></a>New Feature: NewGovToken Activation</h1>\n<p>Activation is a new feature that will be available to NewGovToken holders. It is designed to incentivize governance participation in the long term among NewGovToken holders who do not wish to lock up their tokens long term with Sealed Activation (formerly LockStaking).</p>\n<p>NewGovToken holders can Activate or Deactivate their NewGovToken at any time, with no restrictions, cost, or additional risk. Later on it will be possible to delegate while Activating, with additional incentives to reward governance participation.</p>\n<p>When NewGovToken is Activated, the user chooses a reward to receive. The rewards available will be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10% of total Protocol Stablecoin Surplus</li>\n<li>15% of the Token Reward supply for each SubDAO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NewGovToken Activation will become available at Spark launch.</p>\n<p>At first only SPK rewards will be supported for users who Activate (at a rate of 150 million SPK per year distributed across all Activated NewGovToken). Some time after Spark launch, Protocol Stablecoin Surplus will become available, and other SubDAO tokens will be available as Activation Rewards as soon as they launch.</p>\n<p>In addition to incentivizing governance participation in the long term, NewGovToken Activation will also act as a useful primitive that can power restaking mechanisms built on top of NewGovToken. Restaking protocols will be able to stack the native Activation Rewards with their own Restaking rewards.</p>\n<p>NewGovToken Activation will not be available to US-based and VPN users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"newgovtoken-sealed-activation-formerly-known-as-lockstaking-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#newgovtoken-sealed-activation-formerly-known-as-lockstaking-2\"></a>NewGovToken Sealed Activation (formerly known as LockStaking)</h1>\n<p>LockStaking is being renamed to Sealed Activation, and some of its parameters have changed.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation is designed to incentivize participants to delegate their NewGovToken and MKR and get additional skin in the game, by Sealing the tokens behind an Exit Fee.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation will launch shortly after the launch of NewStable, NewGovToken, and the new Endgame app.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation is available both to NewGovToken and MKR holders, and provides Activation Rewards. It is possible to delegate while Sealed. When Unsealing, there is an Exit Fee.</p>\n<p>When NewGovToken is Sealed, the user chooses a reward to receive. The rewards available will be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>25% of total Protocol Stablecoin Surplus</li>\n<li>15% of the Token Reward supply emissions for each SubDAO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Sealed Activation launches, only 25% of the Protocol Stablecoin Surplus will be available as an Activation Reward, but SPK Token Reward will become available as an additional choice soon as Spark launches (at a rate of 150 million SPK tokens per year distributed across all Sealed NewGovToken and MKR).</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation has an Exit Fee that is paid on the Sealed principal when the user Unseals. The Exit Fee starts at 5% at the moment Sealed Activation launches, and then increases by 1% every 6 months until it reaches its long term value of 15%. Exit Fee increases are applied retroactively. The Exit Fee is set low initially to encourage a lot of early participation.</p>\n<p>NewGovToken Sealed Activation will not be available to US-based and VPN users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"spk-activation-formerly-known-as-spk-staking-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spk-activation-formerly-known-as-spk-staking-3\"></a>SPK Activation (Formerly known as SPK Staking)</h1>\n<p>When the Spark SubDAO launches SPK will have the SPK Activation feature available from launch (previously known as SPK Staking).</p>\n<p>Just like NewGovToken Activation, SPK holders can Activate or Deactivate their SPK at any time, with no restrictions, cost, or additional risk. Later on it will be possible to vote while Activating, and there will be additional incentives to reward governance participation.</p>\n<p>When SPK is Activated, the user receives NewGovToken Rewards. The total rewards are 80 million NewGovToken per year distributed across all Activated SPK.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"additional-changes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#additional-changes-4\"></a>Additional changes</h1>\n<p>I will follow up with another post that will detail more changes, both feature changes and terminology changes, which I plan to put into the next MIP edit for community feedback and approval.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/newgovtoken-activation-new-feature-and-other-changes/24688\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/newgovtoken-activation-new-feature-and-other-changes/24688","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 19:08:59 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24688"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/newgovtoken-activation-new-feature-and-other-changes/24688.rss","#text":"NewGovToken Activation: new feature and other changes"},"filter":false},{"title":"Capital Transparency: Endgame Operational Expenses Enabled by the Atlas","dc:creator":"ecosystem-team","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>The Ecosystem team is providing an update on our progress toward expense transparency, specifically building on the former <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/capital-transparency-2023-overview-of-the-transition-to-endgame/23438\">Capital Transparency: 2023 Overview of the Transition to Endgame</a>.</p>\n<p>In the sections below, we provide an overview of expenses from <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/preparing-to-decentralize-the-launch-project-after-launch-season/24193\">May 2023</a> through July 7, 2024.

Here is a quick overview of EtherMail’s security and important business context to allow one to assess the longevity EtherMail may have.</p>\n<p>Encryption:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emails sent between EtherMail users: Always end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that only the sender and recipient can read the messages.</li>\n<li>Emails from EtherMail users to non-EtherMail users: Encrypted with TLS if the non-EtherMail mail server supports it. While this provides encryption in transit, it is not end-to-end encrypted, meaning providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail can read these messages and hand them over if needed.</li>\n<li>Emails from non-EtherMail users to EtherMail users: Unless PGP is used, the email message is encrypted in transit using TLS and stored on EtherMail’s servers with zero-access encryption. However, it is not end-to-end encrypted and might be accessible to the sender’s email service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Funding:</p>\n<p>EtherMail has secured $7.3M in funding over two rounds from notable investors, including Tim Draper, Draper Associates, MS&amp;AD Ventures, Fabric Ventures, Greenfield, Rene Reinsberg, and w3.fund. This information is sourced from Crunchbase and confirmed in their EMT token launch article.</p>\n<p>Business Model:</p>\n<p>EtherMail recently launched the EMT token, introducing “Consensual Marketing.” In this model, users opt-in to receive promotional content and are compensated with EMT tokens for their engagement. The utility of EMT includes access to premium features and market buybacks equating 50% of all Consensual Marketing advertising revenue.</p>\n<p>For more details, you can read the article on the EMT token here (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@ethermail_io/launching-emt-the-worlds-first-email-token-e2378336de18#:~:text=Consensual%20Marketing%3A%20EtherMail%20introduces%20a,EMT%20tokens%20for%20their%20engagement\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Launching $EMT: The World’s First Email Token | by EtherMail | Jun, 2024 | Medium</a>).</p>\n<p>Best Practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a security precaution, do not use an address already used for handling financial transactions or storing funds for EtherMail. This minimizes the risk of financial loss.</li>\n<li>Inform your contacts about the security practices and limitations of using different email services. Encourage them to adopt secure email practices and consider using EtherMail for secure communications.</li>\n<li>For communications that must extend outside the EtherMail network, using PGP encryption can provide an additional layer of security. Both senders and recipients should be familiar with setting up and using PGP to ensure their messages are protected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This overview should help Alignment Conservers and those committed to high OpSec standards understand EtherMail’s potential as a secure and innovative email solution.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ethermail-email-solution-with-ethereum-sign-in/24670\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ethermail-email-solution-with-ethereum-sign-in/24670","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 14:52:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24670"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ethermail-email-solution-with-ethereum-sign-in/24670.rss","#text":"EtherMail: Email Solution with Ethereum Sign In"},"filter":false},{"title":"Analysis and Summary of Recent Liquidations in the MakerDAO and SparkLend Ecosystems","dc:creator":"Mezdalug","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In the wake of recent market turbulence, the DeFi ecosystem has experienced liquidation events affecting positions across both the MakerDAO Core and SparkLend lending engines. This report will analyze the liquidations from 2 July 2024 to 8 July 2024, highlighting affected vaults, collateral types, and the financial implications in both DAI repayment and collateral liquidation. By understanding these market dynamics, we aim to underline the DeFi sector’s resilience and areas for potential enhancement.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"market-conditions-leading-to-liquidations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#market-conditions-leading-to-liquidations-2\"></a>Market Conditions Leading to Liquidations</h1>\n<p>There had been a significant bearish movement in the BTC and ETH prices in the first week of July. The BTC price plummeted by ~16% from 1 July to 5 July. Similarly, the price of ETH has decreased by ~20% in the same period - yet both assets have gained some value since. The recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market was, among others, also instigated by the large-scale movement of assets by Mt Gox, which started to repay users, triggering a significant supply shock. This had the effect on Thursday when its BTC movement (together with other market conditions) moved the price on Thursday evening, 4 July, to Friday morning, 5 July, ~8.8% lower.</p>\n<p>With previous bearish pressure on BTC and ETH prices, this rapid asset devaluation cascaded through the DeFi space, prompting a series of liquidations.</p>\n<p>For why exactly the Mt Gox movement had such an effect, refer to the following sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/303586/mt-gox-moves-nearly-47229-btc-ahead-of-9-billion-payout\">Mt Gox moves nearly 47,229 BTC</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/05/mt-gox-begins-repaying-bitcoin-to-creditors-a-decade-on-from-collapse.html\">Mt.

Although the total number of liquidations is only seven, the value of those liquidations is far from negligible.

Liquidators repaid $3.26M of debt, accounting for a 13% penalty fee, resulting in a $423K penalty collected by Maker protocol. While the movement of MtGox had an effect on the liquidations happening on 5 July, the liquidation on 3 July had to be due to some other reasons for not adjusting the position to the bearish market conditions. The recent liquidation data suggests the critical need for maintaining appropriate collateralization ratios in such volatile conditions.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"sparklend-liquidations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#sparklend-liquidations-4\"></a>SparkLend Liquidations</h1>\n<p>Similarly, SparkLend also faced the brunt of this market crash, resulting in numerous forced liquidations of various borrower positions. A lot more liquidations have been executed here, however the total value is significantly lower compared to Maker. While the Maker has seen the liquidations also before the MtGox effect, the SparkLend had more liquidation in number, but the majority of positions were very small, resulting in $892.7K collateral being liquidated and $853.4K debt being repaid.</p>\n<p>The total number of liquidations on Spark was 30, the vast majority on 5 July due to the explained market effect. There were 12 liquidations cumulatively on 6, 7, and 8 July; however, these positions were minimal in value, while 2 liquidations happened on 4 July, also extremely small.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/raFIAhmoosoTA3NtyJbD5avwPca.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e_2_690x510.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"raFIAhmoosoTA3NtyJbD5avwPca\" width=\"690\" height=\"510\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e_2_690x510.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e_2_1035x765.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"212027\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://spark.blockanalitica.com/v1/ethereum/liquidations/?days_ago=7\">Block Analitica Spark Liquidations</a></p>\n<p>The most liquidated collateral was WETH, which represented 92.43% ($661K) of all the collateral; the rest was WSTETH with 4.09% ($29K), WBTC with 3.21% ($23K), and sDAI with 0.27% ($2K).

We also initiate phase 1 of a three-step migration process intended to gradually migrate USDC from <code>USDC-PSM-A</code> and <code>RWA014-A</code>, to <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>. The first migration phase is estimated to last for 4 weeks, but can be changed depending on how many users and integrations managed to migrate, which will be communicated on this forum via new parameter proposal recommendation. To learn more about the proposed migration process and its respective phases, refer to <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-lite-psm-usdc-a-introduction-and-overview/24512\">LitePSM (LITE-PSM-USDC-A): Introduction and Overview</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that the recommended parameter values covered in this post are intended to change as the <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code> migration initiative reaches phase 2, and then again, as we reach phase 3. <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> will provide two additional forum posts with recommended parameter changes for the remaining steps of the migration process.</p>\n<p>As we explain in the LitePSM introduction post, the LitePSM contract had already been deployed at <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xf6e72Db5454dd049d0788e411b06CfAF16853042\">0xf6e72Db5454dd049d0788e411b06CfAF16853042</a>, the upcoming spell will finalize all required parameter configurations and execute the initial migration of reserves from PSM-USDC-A to LitePSM.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-parameters-for-phase-1-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposed-parameters-for-phase-1-3\"></a>Proposed Parameters for Phase 1</h1>\n<p>BA Labs recommends the Stability Facilitator to poll the following parameter changes and deployments in next available cycle and include them in the next available executive vote assuming positive poll outcome:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploy <code>PSM_MOM</code> GSM Delay Exception</li>\n<li>Migrate initial USDC (20M) reserves from PSM-USDC-A to LitePSM with a script executed in the spell</li>\n<li>The current DC-IAM available DAI liquidity is distributed between the two PSMs\n<ul>\n<li><code>PSM-USDC-A</code>\n<ul>\n<li><code>tin</code> &amp; <code>tout</code>: 0 (remains unchanged)</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>line</code> (max DC): 10B (remains unchanged)</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>gap</code>: Decrease for 20M from 400M to 380M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>ttl</code>: 12h (remains unchanged)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>\n<ul>\n<li><code>tin</code> &amp; <code>tout</code>: Set to 0</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>line</code> (max DC): Set to 50M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>gap</code>: Set to 20M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>ttl</code>: Set to 12h</li>\n<li><code>buf</code>: Set to 20M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>GSM Delay</code>: Decrease by 14h, from 30h to 16h</li>\n<li><code>ESM</code> (Emergency Shutdown Module) minimum threshold: Increase for 150k from 150k to 300k</li>\n<li>Deploy the keeper network job for calling permissionless LitePSM functions</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"keeper-network-threshold-parameters-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#keeper-network-threshold-parameters-4\"></a>Keeper Network Threshold Parameters</h1>\n<p>This group of parameters is specific to when the keeper network job is deployed and configured to call certain functions related to LitePSM buf.</p>\n<p>These are permissionless functions, but we still want to call them regularly in order to maintain a certain amount of DAI in the buf and transfers accumulated fees to the surplus buffer.</p>\n<p>Fill function mints additional DAI to the buf after a defined threshold had been reached up to the limit. Trim function burns DAI from the buf after a defined threshold had been reached down to the limit. The chug function transfers accumulated fees from the LitePSM to the surplus buffer, note that fees will not be activated for a considerable amount of time and are not planned as part of any migration phase.</p>\n<p>The keeper network job thresholds configuration will likely change in latter migration phases as liquidity and available DAI in buf increases, in the initial phase they are set relatively close to the buf in order to achieve good experience for transactors and integrators.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>fill</code>: Set threshold at 15M DAI</li>\n<li><code>trim</code>: Set threshold at 30M DAI</li>\n<li><code>chug</code>: Set threshold at 300k DAI</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"evaluation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#evaluation-5\"></a>Evaluation</h1>\n<p>The main goal of phase 1 is to have an initial low exposure period that will provide integrators with sufficient time to familiarize themselves with the LitePSM and to start migrating their solutions from PSM-USDC-A to LITE-PSM-USDC-A. The estimated duration of phase 1 is approximately 4 weeks. However, this duration may change depending on multiple factors, including (i) integrations, (ii) legal and technical aspects, (iii) the Maker governance process, and more.</p>\n<p>Below, we provide some additional context for the proposed parameter values for phase 1.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"deploy-psm_mom-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#deploy-psm_mom-6\"></a>Deploy PSM_MOM</h2>\n<p>Due to the fact that the LitePSM will have pre-minted DAI in the <code>buf</code>, the normal <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#10-2-3-debt-ceiling-breaker\">LINE_MOM</a> contract is not sufficient for temporarily disabling <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>. Instead, a new module referred to as <code>PSM_MOM</code> will be deployed. The PSM_MOM will be able to disable the LitePSM contracts by temporarily halting swaps.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"dc-iam-parameters-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dc-iam-parameters-7\"></a>DC-IAM Parameters</h2>\n<p><a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> believes that 20 million USDC serves as an adequate migration amount for the initial testing period. The 20 million USDC will be migrated from <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> to <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code> using a script in the determined Executive Spell.</p>\n<p>In order to counterbalance the increased exposure resulting from a gap and buf value of 20M respectively, we recommend decreasing the gap of <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> by 20M, from 400M to 380M. All other <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> parameters will remain unchanged for phase 1.</p>\n<p>For <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>, we recommend setting <code>tin</code> &amp; <code>tout</code> to 0, and the <code>ttl</code> to 12h in order to minimize unnecessary changes during the migration process and to reproduce a similar user experience as <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> and finally to achieve same available DAI liquidity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"gsm-delay-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#gsm-delay-8\"></a>GSM Delay</h2>\n<p>During phase 1 of the migration plan, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> believes that it is prudent to apply a lower GSM Delay in case any swift actions or parameter changes become necessary. We believe that a 16h GSM delay is a good compromise solution between being able to react quickly, while still being able to mitigate any potential malicious spells.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"esm-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#esm-9\"></a>ESM</h2>\n<p>The Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) will be increased, as the long-term plan is to remove this feature from the system and the LitePSM module is not supported by the ESM. There is still some value of maintaining the module until the full deployment of the Allocation System as part of the Endgame, but the threshold should be increased in order to prevent hostile activation when the module should not be used.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-scope-language-changes-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposed-scope-language-changes-10\"></a>Proposed Scope Language Changes</h1>\n<p>We will provide a more comprehensive language change edit where we define PSM_MOM, the LitePSM, and relevant parameters, in a future proposal. For the time being, the only relevant parameter value that needs to be changed is <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#10-1-1a\">10.1.1A</a> in the <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#0-the-governance-scope\">Governance Scope</a>.

Below is an update from 6s Capital:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We remain in continual compliance with the revolver’s covenants, and each of the underlying projects remaining in the portfolio is current with rent payments. These underlying projects are, or will shortly be put, on the market for divestiture. As each project is divested, closing funds will be utilized to pay down the revolver directly, to clear the lien.</p>\n<p>6s would again like to express our appreciation and our thanks to the community for the faith they put in us and our plan to deploy capital into senior secured loans.

Cohort Analysis</h1>\n<p>In the analysis we are presenting, we’ve organized wallets into categories based on the month they first used the protocol. Each category is called a “cohort month.” For example, all the wallets that first used the protocol in January are in the January cohort, those that first used the protocol in February are in the February cohort, etc. We measure how long each wallet has been active with a “Cohort tenure” number. This number is just the number of months since the wallet joined its cohort. So, if a wallet’s Cohort tenure is 1, it means it’s the wallet’s first month since joining; if it’s 2, it’s the second month, and so on.</p>\n<p>One important note is that for our analysis, we’ve put all wallets that joined from May 2023 to January 2024 into a single group, which we’re calling the January Cohort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"healthy-growth-patterns-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#healthy-growth-patterns-3\"></a>Healthy growth patterns</h2>\n<p>After reaching the peak of supplied amounts in February 2024 (~$4.1B), the total supply fell until April, reaching a new low of ~$2.8B (Chart 1). The main reason the total supply has been dropping is the down-market we have been witnessing, with BTC price falling by ~14% from its peak and ETH falling by ~20% from its peak. However, since then, we have seen a new supply coming in May and June. While the bullish sentiment has primarily driven the growth in May (ETH Price increased by ~35%); the growth in June was driven by a new supply coming into a protocol. There had been ~$800M of new supply coming in from the new wallets. The pattern is very similar for total borrows (Chart 4), which reached their low in April 2024, increased in May, and reached new highs in June 2024 (~$1.75B).</p>\n<p>While this metric alone is not enough to assess the protocol’s overall growth, the remaining ones give a clearer picture of SparkLend’s status. Since January 2024, the new cohorts have been supplying less as a percentage of total supplies (Chart 2). However, this changed in June 2024, as new entrants supplied 19.8% of the total supply in the protocol. The lower growth during the previous months has been due to two main factors: (i) the positive retention patterns of the May-January cohort and (ii) the decreasing number of new wallets opening positions on SparkLend (Chart 7). Even though the number of new wallets has been the lowest in the analyzing period, these wallets hold a lot of supply. Up to date, supplied and borrowed amounts have been dropping in the range of 10% - 50% for new cohorts (Charts 3 and 6), except for the April cohort, which exhibited a growth in supply and borrowing. Except for the March and May cohorts, the large wallets’ dominance per cohort tenure has been extremely high for each individual cohort (Chart 8). It shows that even though supply increased by $800M in June, 76% of this supply is due to only five big wallets that joined the protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"supplied-and-borrowed-amounts-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#supplied-and-borrowed-amounts-4\"></a>Supplied and borrowed amounts</h2>\n<p>Regarding total amounts supplied in June 2024, $801M (or 19.8%) came from the June cohort, followed by the February (12.4%) and the March (6.3%), with respectively $502M and $253M. Except for the April cohort (+34%), all other cohorts’ supplied amounts have been dropping, such as March (-47%), February (-37%), January (-15%), and May (-12%).</p>\n<p>The largest cohorts by amount supplied are the same cohorts dominating borrowing, with June borrowing $389M (22.2%), March borrowing $141M (8.1%), and February borrowing $125M (7.1%). The February and March cohorts dropped the most, down 55% and 43%, respectively, since they started using SparkLend.</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the cohorts.</p>\n\nChart 1.

Segmentation Analysis</h1>\n<p>The segmentation analysis assessed the types of positions and strategies SparkLend users are deploying. For a detailed understanding of how these were calculated, please refer to the previously conducted Segmentation Analysis. Compared to the previous analyses, this time we have added new positions that segment LRT users. To summarize briefly, here are the identified segments:</p>\n\nIdentified Segments <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h2><a name=\"the-sparklend-sentiment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#the-sparklend-sentiment-6\"></a>The SparkLend Sentiment</h2>\n<p>In the last analysis, we used individual wallet positions to assess the sentiment of SparkLend users towards the crypto market. It is very interesting to note that most wallets are still exhibiting bullish behavior, with the largest positions being <code>Long ETH LST</code> ($1.77B) and <code>Long Type 1</code> ($1.07B), together accounting for ~70% of the total supply in June (Charts 9 and 10). The third-largest position is the <code>Recursive ETH LST</code> (~$735M), roughly ~18% of the total supply. It is also worth noting that the wallets in the highest supply bucket (&gt;$100M) all have long positions, deployed only in three segments mentioned before (<code>Recursive ETH LST</code>, <code>Long Type 1</code>, and <code>Long ETH LST</code>) (Chart 12).</p>\n<p>Short positions are practically non-existent in relative terms compared to long ones. That tells us that the participants have a bullish outlook for the future. Short positions are currently ~0.3% of total supply, which has decreased from the previous month (~0.4%) and has dramatically dropped from its peak in January 2024 (~2.9%).</p>\n<p>The wallet count per position strategy (Chart 11) highlights a high predominance of <code>Long Type 1</code> (516) users, followed by <code>Long ETH LST</code> (191) and <code>Diversified Borrowers</code> (143). Only 12 wallets display strictly short strategies. The large wallets dominate in strategies <code>Long LRT</code>, <code>Short Type 1</code>, and <code>Supply Only Stablecoins</code> (Chart 14). This is mainly due to a low number of wallets employing these strategies.</p>\n<p>A comparison between the current state of health rates (Chart 16) and the previous analysis shows that Recursive ETH LST has lower debt-weighted health rates (up from 1.02 on 1 May to 1.09 on 1 July). Short strategies also have a higher health rate (1.52 vs. 1.81), the same as does Long ETH LST (2.15 vs. 2.33).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"behavioral-analysis-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#behavioral-analysis-7\"></a>Behavioral analysis</h2>\n<p>User’s interaction with the protocol can provide valuable insights. The need for active management can be primarily seen in <code>Long LTR</code> followed by less active management in the <code>Long ETH + ETH LST + ETH LRT</code> segment and the <code>Diversified Borrowers</code> (Chart 17). It is evident that, on average, a high number of events are performed by wallets with lower and higher health rates (Chart 18), while average health rates on average perform fewer actions. This can indicate that those in these categories must execute more actions to maintain their strategies. There is also a positive relation between how much users supply to the protocol and the number of actions they perform (Chart 19), meaning that the more someone supplies, the more likely they are to execute more actions.</p>\n<p>This distribution highlights a behavioral tendency towards active management in strategies perceived as higher risk, evidenced by the monthly need for more events and a lower health rate associated with <code>Long LRT</code> and <code>Long ETH + ETH LST + ETH LRT</code> strategies. In particular, Long LRT strategies exhibit the highest median value of events per month (3.5). Also, three wallets in the <code>Recursive ETH LST</code> category performed the highest number of actions in a month (45, 39, 38).</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the segments.</p>\n\nChart 9: Supply Amount Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 10: Percentage Supply Amount Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 11: Wallet Count Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 12: Percentage Supply Amount Per Supply Amount Bucket <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 13: Wallet Count Per Supply Amount Bucket <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 14: Top 10 Large Wallet Supply Percentage Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 15: Borrow Per Health Rate <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 16: Debt-Weighted Health Rate Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 17: Events Per Month Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 18: Events Per Month Per Health Rate <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 19: Events Per Month vs Supply Amount <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-external-capital-analysis-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-3-external-capital-analysis-8\"></a>3. External Capital Analysis</h1>\n<p>This analysis aims to assess how SparkLend users behave outside SparkLend by assessing their external capital held and cross-protocol usage. We define external capital as assets held outside the protocol that could be used to protect individual positions. External capital can either be passive (idle in the wallet) or active (used in other protocols). The data refers to a snapshot taken on 1 July 2024.</p>\n<p>SparkLend users hold approximately $5.17B in other protocols (Chart 20), $1.62B of which is in Maker (~31% of the total). The supply of other lending protocols equals 454M on Aave v3 and 146M on Ethena. Furthermore, other protocols used by SparkLend wallets are Lido, Stakefish, and Morpho AAVE. Together, Morpho AAVE (v1 and v3) has a supply from SparkLend users of $743M across 37 wallets.</p>\n<p>By looking at the passive external capital per asset (Chart 21), we can see that users hold WBTC ($164M), GNO ($143M), (W)ETH ($97M), and MKR ($81M) primarily. Since the previous analysis, there has been a significant drop in sDAI popularity, which has decreased from $73M to $24M. The majority of the wallets hold idle ETH (1230 wallets), DAI (400 wallets), and USDC (357 wallets). The other stablecoins are falling behind DAI and USDC, such as USDT ($27M, 216 wallets), sDAI ($24M, 143 wallets), and USDe ($13M, 83 wallets).</p>\n<p>Assessing passive external capital relative to debt (Chart 22), it is evident that 56.7% of users have enough passive external capital to cover 25% of their debt, a slight increase of 0.9 percentage points compared to the previous analysis. However, there has also been a slight increase (0.3 percentage points) in users with a buffer of more than 500% to 10.4% of users. In general, 26.6% of wallets have enough external capital to cover the total debt exposure.</p>\n<p>What would require more attention is the current passive external capital as a percentage of debt (Chart 23) since 86.3% of total debt is covered by less or equal to 25% of capital held in wallets, which was previously 66.2% in December, 78.6% in March, and 83.6% in April. In case of price drops or changing market conditions, this might negatively affect the protocol’s health. On the other hand, 6.7% of total debt is fully collateralized by capital held in wallets (down from 18.8% in March and 9.8% in April).</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the external dynamics.</p>\n\nChart 20: Wallets' Active External Capital Per Protocol <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 21: Wallets' Passive External Capital Per Asset <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 22: Wallets' Passive External Capital Over SparkLend Borrow (Percentage of Wallets) <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 23: Wallets' Passive External Capital Over SparkLend Borrow (Percentage of Debt) <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-9\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The analysis highlighted a positive growth pattern for SparkLend during Q2-2024. While the protocol is still struggling to attract new user interaction (as the number of new wallets per month is still decreasing), the increase in total supplied and borrowed amounts in the last cohorts suggests higher popularity among larger users. Yet, it is essential to note that the five biggest wallets drive the most new supply and borrowing in the protocol from the last cohort. This shift is marked by a significant engagement of new cohorts and strong retention within earlier cohorts, indicating a reliance on established users even through less favorable market conditions.</p>\n<p>The segmentation analysis reveals that with the market moving again into a bullish sentiment, many SparkLend users also maintain bullish sentiment, particularly in long positions with substantial investments in Long Type 1 assets. At the same time, the small portion in short positions reflects a withdrawal from riskier strategies, aligning with the overall conservative trend observed in the cohort analysis. This behavior suggests that while SparkLend users continue to use the protocol, there is a tangible shift towards safety in response to market volatility.</p>\n<p>Regarding external dynamics, the analysis highlights a robust interaction with other protocols. However, there’s a decrease in passive external capital relative to debt, which could pose a risk in adverse market shifts. This condition requires more detailed monitoring of capital buffers to prevent potential liquidations, especially in a volatile market.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"future-work-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#future-work-10\"></a>Future Work</h1>\n<p>BA Labs plans to continue monitoring user metrics to ensure the protocol’s stability. We will also continue providing quarterly analyses of the most important dynamics and suggestions for tackling potential issues. At the same time, we plan to automate this kind of analysis to get live data on user behavior and promptly respond to changing market conditions.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 08:20:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24600"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600.rss","#text":"Sparklend User Metrics & Growth Analysis - Report #3"},"filter":true},{"title":"Promoting Blockchain-based finance system to NGO audience","dc:creator":"Liam_Bodin","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Hey all.

Accounting for Effective Borrow Rates (since users are able to earn some yield on the collateral they supply), Aave v2 markets (USDC and USDT) have particularly increased, with USDT going from ~9% to ~13% and USDC from ~12% to ~18%. At the same time, other v3 markets on Aave and Compound have witnessed a slight rate decrease. We are far from the mid-march environment where rates skyrocketed, and they have stabilized since then, with some minor peaks in mid-April, end of May and beginning of June. This can also be seen in the DeFi Rate 7-Day Volatility, with Aave v2 markets reaching 11% volatility at the beginning of June, with largest v3 markets being more stable. In the second half of June, the Rate Benchmark’s volatility has not surpassed 2%, implying a more stable situation in the DeFi rate ecosystem.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uiVMrLqj81Ub3dzHcXlqrtVuUBW.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_624x308.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uiVMrLqj81Ub3dzHcXlqrtVuUBW\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_624x308.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_936x462.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_1248x616.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F8F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/\">Blockanalitica</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9kZfoOCoQm9qfXPtW7E5QZVtA23.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_624x308.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9kZfoOCoQm9qfXPtW7E5QZVtA23\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_624x308.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_936x462.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_1248x616.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/\">Blockanalitica</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"funding-rates-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#funding-rates-3\"></a>Funding Rates</h2>\n<p>We are far from the March peak, where 7-Day Average funding rates for ETH and BTC have touched 60% APY.

The Stablecoin reserves drop is in line with what was expected after the Accelerated Proposal in March, which substantially increased them to avoid a possible depeg scenario. Following the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp34-mip-amendment-subproposal/23971\">MIP-102c2-SP34</a>, stablecoin reserves should be equal to 25% of DAI Supply. Even though this is not the case currently, reserves are close to that value and, more importantly, have risen from the 20% registered at the beginning of June. Stablecoin reserves remain critical for the FiRE, since substantial deviations from the 25% threshold can introduce higher rates to incentivize collateral dynamics to go back to the equilibrium value.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9SLpBR55qAUgjWV1NlmzAP5NvnL.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_624x308.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9SLpBR55qAUgjWV1NlmzAP5NvnL\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_624x308.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_936x462.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_1248x616.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/charts\">Makerburn</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"fire-implementation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#fire-implementation-5\"></a>FiRE Implementation</h1>\n<p>We have experimented with the FiRE to suggest optimal Base Rates and adjusted the DeFi Benchmark Rate to account for Effective Borrow Rates, which were at the time ignored. The main issues we encountered were the lagging reactions to rate decreases (since it utilizes EMAs to avoid rate spikes) and the non-feasibility of rate benchmarks. Specifically, the issue with DeFi competitive rates was fixed by implementing an Effective Rate Benchmark, while the issue persists for Funding Rates. For this reason, we have temporarily applied a 200 basis points spread (2%) to the Funding Rate Benchmark.</p>\n<p>The FiRE was run with the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CE: 0.7691</li>\n<li>LR: 0.0534</li>\n<li>BR: 0.0872</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And returned a Base Rate of 9.38%.</p>\n<p>This increase in the Base Rate is mainly due to Stablecoin Reserves being &lt;25%. Since we believe that, even though important, bringing Stablecoin Reserves to the 25% threshold is not trivial, we have re-run the model with TE: 0.80, hence allowing more room for breathing to the Base Rate. Under these conditions, the Base Rate was equal to 8.58%.</p>\n<p>Until the FiRE model is finalized based on research similar to this, we will use it as a reference and not strictly adhere to it when making our rate change recommendations. We will continue to adjust the model’s parameters before they are incorporated into the Stability Scope as determined by governance.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"dsr-changes-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dsr-changes-6\"></a>DSR Changes</h1>\n<p>The DAI in DSR, over the last two months, has been slightly dropping from its peak on 19 May, when it was equal to 2.2B.

Even though it dropped since then, it has stabilized around the 36% level, currently at 36.23%.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/d/9df8a5a9a8231364366a5fa736f9c2cb04442fab.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/mxtGAhxQ5hG1srrW9pCzpdZZLVp.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/d/9df8a5a9a8231364366a5fa736f9c2cb04442fab_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"mxtGAhxQ5hG1srrW9pCzpdZZLVp\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/d/9df8a5a9a8231364366a5fa736f9c2cb04442fab_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/d/9df8a5a9a8231364366a5fa736f9c2cb04442fab_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/d/9df8a5a9a8231364366a5fa736f9c2cb04442fab.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/dsr\">Makerburn</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"feasibility-analysis-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#feasibility-analysis-7\"></a>Feasibility Analysis</h1>\n<p>The Estimates of Annualized Profits from vaults due to a rate change accounts for a 1% reduction in the DSR and a 1% reduction to Crypto Vaults Stability Fees on Maker Core and the Effective DAI borrow rate on SparkLend.

To change a document model, rather than store a new state, the changes are noted by publishing events (or operations) of the specific updates to the document.

What are some other characteristics of a SNO?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open and transparent - SNOs are freely accessible with a gradual on-boarding path, using open-source software and open data</li>\n<li>Software platform - the core product is some scalable marketplace platform and the organization has its best practices embedded in software and a moving towards progressive automation</li>\n<li>Decentralized - ownership, operations and infrastructure cannot be coopted by a single entity, producing zero lock-in to technology or a platform</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SNOs require new software infrastructure that is decentralized as well as open-source legal templates for establishing and linking offchain processes together with onchain governance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"legal-templates-for-network-organizations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#legal-templates-for-network-organizations-9\"></a><strong>Legal templates for network organizations</strong></h3>\n<p>While Powerhouse’s software enables organizations to build customized and streamlined processes, only if this software is integrated into offline components can it be truly useful.

This month’s compensation will be used to fill the AD buffer with MKR and DAI, and the MKR from the old buffer will be distributed to the ADs if applicable. However, if ADs prefer, they can request the Governance Facilitators to distribute this MKR through multiple payments via this post.</p>\n<p>Each payment request should include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ethereum addresses to which the payments should be sent.</li>\n<li>The specific amounts of MKR to be distributed to the address.</li>\n<li>A description, clarifying the purpose of the payment.</li>\n<li>Cryptographic signatures from their EA addresses for any new addresses to authorize them to receive future payments, including the text “Authorize [address] to receive payments” (this only needs to be done the first time an address is used).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cryptographic signature is not needed if the address is the EA address of the AD.</p>\n<p>The deadline for submitting these payment requests is this Thursday, EOD.

These adjustments aim to improve transparency and accountability in the compensation of ADs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-changes-to-compensation-scheme-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#key-changes-to-compensation-scheme-3\"></a>Key Changes to Compensation Scheme</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"compensation-management-from-the-ad-buffer-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#compensation-management-from-the-ad-buffer-4\"></a>Compensation Management from the AD Buffer</h3>\n<p>ADs must manage their compensation through the AD Buffer, which accumulates funds based on their budget ranks. Once there is a minimum of one month’s budget in the buffer, ADs can request payments. These requests can include multiple payout addresses for various purposes such as personal compensation, compensation to team contributors, research expenses, and more. Each payment request must leave sufficient funds in the buffer to cover at least one more month. Governance Facilitators will process these requests in the next Executive Spell.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"monthly-compensation-requests-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#monthly-compensation-requests-5\"></a>Monthly Compensation Requests</h3>\n<p>Each month, we will create a forum post where ADs can submit their payment requests from the AD Buffer. To ensure a streamlined process, each submission should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ethereum addresses to which the payments should be sent.</li>\n<li>The specific amounts of MKR and DAI to be distributed to each address.</li>\n<li>A description for each transaction, clarifying the purpose of the payment.</li>\n<li>Cryptographic signatures from their EA addresses for any new addresses to authorize them to receive future payments, including the text “Authorize [address] to receive payments” (this only needs to be done the first time an address is used).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please ensure that your requests maintain a buffer balance that can cover at least one month’s budget after payments are made. This will be verified before the inclusion of the payments in the Executive.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"transitioning-to-the-new-buffer-system-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#transitioning-to-the-new-buffer-system-6\"></a>Transitioning to the New Buffer System</h3>\n<p>As we transition from the previous buffer system, which solely contained MKR, to the new dual-token buffer consisting of both MKR and DAI, the next payout will be utilized to balance the new buffer accordingly. If the new MKR buffer does not reach its full required capacity using the next payout alone, the MKR from the old buffer will be used to fill the shortfall. Any excess MKR, after filling the new buffer, will then be transferred to the AD. For this reason, we won’t be asking the ADs to submit payment requests this month.</p>\n<p>However, for convenience, we will create a post allowing the ADs to request the Governance Facilitators to distribute this excess MKR through multiple payments. If payment requests are not provided by this Thursday’s EOD, the excess MKR will be distributed to the EA address. Please note that this applies only for this month. In future months, ADs will need to communicate their payment requests to receive the payments.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"submission-deadline-and-adjustments-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#submission-deadline-and-adjustments-7\"></a>Submission Deadline and Adjustments</h3>\n<p>The post will be created on the <strong>first day of each month</strong>. ADs will have to include payment requests for the previous month, as compensation will be calculated for that period.</p>\n<p>The deadline for submitting payment requests is the end of the day on Thursday one week before the Executive date when the payments will be transferred.</p>\n<p>If the total compensation requested surpasses the budget after accounting for the required buffer amount, we will contact the AD to review and possibly revise their request. If adjustments are not made in a timely manner, we will modify the requested amount to align with the available budget.</p>\n<p>Please ensure that your submissions are accurate and timely to avoid any delays in compensation.</p>\n<br>\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out.

This interim solution was adopted by Maker Governance in May 2023, and as noted at the time, it came with the inherent risks associated with custodial solutions.</p>\n<p>Developed in partnership with Coinbase, the Migration seeks to address the risks relating to the Custody Arrangement in a manner that is aligned with the onchain ethos of MakerDAO while allowing the DAO to participate in the Coinbase Institutional USDC Rewards Program (the “<strong>USDC Rewards Program</strong>”).</p>\n<p>Specifically, the Migration will leverage the Coinbase Web3 Wallet (the “<strong>W3W</strong>”) and LitePSM to store USDC in the W3W while granting the LitePSM authority to move funds in and out of the W3W.</p>\n<p>For a detailed discussion of the technical aspects of the Migration, see <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-lite-psm-usdc-a-introduction-and-overview/24512\">LitePSM: Introduction and Overview</a> by the BA Labs team.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-definitions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#key-definitions-2\"></a>Key Definitions</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Term</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CBIUK</td>\n<td>Coinbase Institutional (UK) Limited.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CBIUK Fee</td>\n<td>An annual SaaS subscription fee of $50,000 per year charged by CBIUK in exchange for Pinwheel’s use of the W3W services.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Coinbase Key Shard</td>\n<td>A key shard generated by CBIUK on its server during W3W creation, as part of the Initial Transaction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custody Arrangement</td>\n<td>The existing Coinbase Custody arrangement (RWA014-A) which was initiated in May 2023.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Initial Transaction</td>\n<td>The first transaction on the W3W to activate it, to be signed using the Coinbase and Pinwheel Key Shards.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>KSGH</td>\n<td>Key Shard Generation &amp; Handling.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LitePSM</td>\n<td>LITE-PSM-USDC-A.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Migration</td>\n<td>The proposed migration of USDC from the PSM-USDC-A to the LitePSM.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pinwheel</td>\n<td>Pinwheel Ltd, an exempted company with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly owned subsidiary of the RWA Foundation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pinwheel Key Shard</td>\n<td>The key shard generated by the Pinwheel Representatives at W3W creation, as part of the Initial Transaction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pinwheel Representatives</td>\n<td>The parties representing Pinwheel that will generate the Pinwheel Key Shard on a mobile device at W3W creation, as part of the Initial Transaction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDC Rewards Program</td>\n<td>The Coinbase Institutional USDC Rewards Program.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDC Rewards Rate</td>\n<td>The annual rate of rewards earned on the W3W USDC balance.

The W3W enables users to (i) store, send and receive digital assets; (ii) access, participate in, and interact with third party services; (iii) view addresses and information that are part of digital asset networks; (iv) sign and broadcast transactions; and (v) access additional functionality as CBIUK may add from time to time.</p>\n<p>During W3W onboarding, there will be a distributed key generation process to create the W3W. Through this process, two key shards will be generated. Parties representing Pinwheel (the “<strong>Pinwheel Representatives</strong>”) will generate a key shard on a mobile device (the “<strong>Pinwheel Key Shard</strong>”) and CBIUK will generate a key shard on its server (the “<strong>Coinbase Key Shard</strong>”). The key shards are independently generated and CBIUK won’t ever have control of the Pinwheel Key Shard. The signing of transactions associated with the W3W address will require both key shards.</p>\n<p>The key terms of the W3W Addendum are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Recovery</strong>: As requested by Pinwheel, CBIUK will not provide a device recovery service and will be unable to restore or grant access to the Pinwheel Key Shard under any circumstance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>LitePSM Integration</strong>: Pinwheel is entitled to connect the W3W to the LitePSM with ongoing access to the W3W. Upon completion of the Prime consensus approval process and transaction signature by Pinwheel, CBIUK will automatically co-sign the transaction to initiate the smart contract connection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key Shard Disposal</strong>: Pinwheel is entitled to dispose of the Pinwheel Key Shard at its own risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unsupported Networks, Assets and Errors</strong>: CBIUK will incur no responsibility or liability with regard to digital assets associated with unsupported digital asset networks sent to a W3W or with regard to digital assets sent to an incompatible wallet address and/or unsupported network.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Changes</strong>: CBIUK may propose updates or changes to W3W Addendum at any time, subject to Pinwheel’s prior written consent. Upon receiving notice of a proposed update,  Pinwheel will have a period of 30 calendar days from the date of the notice to accept or reject the changes. Acceptance can be indicated by Pinwheel’s continued use of the W3W services after the expiration of this period. If Pinwheel does not agree to the proposed changes, Pinwheel may terminate the W3W Addendum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fees</strong>: CBIUK will charge an annual SaaS subscription fee of $50,000 in exchange for Pinwheel’s use of the W3W services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"key-shard-generation-handling-agreement-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#key-shard-generation-handling-agreement-15\"></a>Key Shard Generation &amp; Handling Agreement</h3>\n<p>The Pinwheel Representatives will each enter into a Key Shard Generation and Handling (“<strong>KSGH</strong>”) Agreement with Pinwheel. This agreement outlines the duties of each Pinwheel Representative with respect to (i) the generation of the Pinwheel Key Shard; (ii) signing of the Initial Transaction; and (iii) secure disposal of the Pinwheel Key Shard thereafter.</p>\n<p>The rationale for the destruction of the Pinwheel Key Shard is security and reduction of the risks associated with the Custody Arrangement. See <em>Risks</em> below.</p>\n<p>The key terms of the KSGH Agreement are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key Shard Generation</strong>: The Pinwheel Representatives are required to generate the Pinwheel Key Shard by using the designated application on a mobile device.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Signing of the Initial Transaction</strong>: The Pinwheel Representatives must activate the W3W and sign the Initial Transaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Secure Destruction of the Key Shard</strong>: Following the signing of the Initial Transaction, the Pinwheel Representatives must securely destroy the Pinwheel Key Shard and provide written confirmation of the destruction method employed and time of destruction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Compensation</strong>: Each Pinwheel Representative will be paid 1,000 Dai in exchange for the performance of their duties under the KSGH Agreement. They will also be reimbursed for any reasonable and pre-approved expenses incurred directly in respect of the performance of their duties.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"risks-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#risks-16\"></a>Risks</h2>\n<p>The Migration is intended to replace the existing <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/coinbase-custody-legal-assessment/20384\">Custody Arrangement</a>, which was adopted as an interim solution in May 2023. As noted at the time of adoption, the Custody Arrangement came with the inherent risks associated with custodial solutions. Therefore, when reviewing the risks relating to the Migration, it’s important to not only look at the risks around the Migration itself, but also how it compares to the Custody Arrangement it is set to replace.</p>\n<p>The key improvement presented by the LitePSM and W3W over the Custody Arrangement is the transition from using a custodial solution to a noncustodial one. Following the Migration, assets will remain under the control of the Maker protocol, while still allowing for participation in the USDC Rewards Program.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, as with any arrangement, there are still risks related to the LitePSM and W3W. The key risks are as follows:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"regulatory-risk-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#regulatory-risk-17\"></a>Regulatory Risk</h4>\n<p>The digital assets industry is subject to an extensive, highly-evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape. Many of the applicable legal and regulatory regimes were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile technologies, crypto assets, and related technologies. As a result, some applicable laws and regulations do not contemplate or address unique issues associated with the crypto economy, are subject to significant uncertainty, and vary widely across jurisdictions globally. These legal and regulatory regimes, including the laws, rules, and regulations thereunder, evolve frequently and may be modified, interpreted, and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another. To the extent Pinwheel is deemed to have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations in connection with the LitePSM and W3W, it could be subject to significant fines and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect MakerDAO.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"service-provider-risk-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#service-provider-risk-18\"></a>Service Provider Risk</h4>\n<p>The successful completion of the Migration and its functionality thereafter will rely on the coordinated actions of a number of independent service providers to the Maker protocol including CBIUK, the Director of Pinwheel (Leeward), the Pinwheel Representatives and several other Ecosystem Actors within the Maker ecosystem. Each of these parties plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth execution of the Migration and any failure, delay, or miscommunication among these providers could disrupt the Migration, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, or financial losses. Additionally, the reliance on multiple parties increases the complexity of the migration and the risk of errors or oversights. To mitigate these risks, continuous monitoring, regular updates, and prompt response mechanisms are essential.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"smart-contract-risk-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#smart-contract-risk-19\"></a>Smart Contract Risk</h4>\n<p>The Maker protocol relies on smart contracts to manage and execute transactions. These smart contracts are susceptible to vulnerabilities and bugs that could be exploited by malicious actors. Despite thorough audits and testing, there is no guarantee that all potential issues have been identified and resolved. Exploitation of any vulnerabilities in the smart contracts could lead to loss of funds, disruption of services, and a loss of confidence in the protocol. To mitigate these risks, continuous monitoring, regular updates, and prompt response mechanisms are essential.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/coinbase-web3-wallet-legal-overview/24577\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/coinbase-web3-wallet-legal-overview/24577","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 02:09:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24577"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/coinbase-web3-wallet-legal-overview/24577.rss","#text":"Coinbase Web3 Wallet - Legal Overview"},"filter":false},{"title":"Spark - Aave Revenue Share Calculation & Payment #4 [Q2, 2024]","dc:creator":"Sean","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<h2><a name=\"context-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#context-1\"></a>Context</h2>\n<p>In February 2023, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/phoenixlabs\">@PhoenixLabs</a>, a contributor to the development of <a href=\"https://spark.fi/\">Spark</a>, proposed a Spark Lend profit-sharing program with the Aave community for the FOSS work done on Aave v3.
