Our Stablebond tokens accrue interest, allowing users to purchase and retain their yield like any other investment. By holding onto Stablebonds, token holders receive a guaranteed return from the government bond and the interest accrued on their token.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Describe the underlying asset</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of our underlying assets are government-issued, short-term US treasuries that guarantee return for token holders.

Founded in 2018, Franklin Templeton Digital Assets believes that blockchain technology has the ability to create efficiencies across a variety of business processes, which is why we are building our own blockchain-based technology solutions to support these assets in the investment management space. Our team built a full service proprietary blockchain-based technology stack to support a blockchain-enabled money fund, known as the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, which includes a digital transfer agent platform, digital asset management system, and digital wallet infrastructure.

One BENJI Token is equivalent to one share of the Fund.</p>\n<p>In addition, Franklin Templeton Digital Assets is committed to investing in the early stages of the digital assets market and in tokens that are listed on digital asset exchanges.

Product Information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tDescribe the product</strong></p>\n<p>Under this proposal, SparkDAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) would be invested in the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, which is the world’s first U.S. registered money market mutual fund offered and issued on blockchain in tokenized form. An investment in the BENJI Token, which is a digital asset security that represents one share of the Fund, can help diversify SparkDAO’s DAI reserves and/or treasury into a steady, income-generating asset that seeks to provide capital preservation, and its liquidity preservation characteristics present a unique opportunity for SparkDAO’s reserves.</p>\n<p>While minor, many of the largest stablecoins have faced price volatility in the peg of their stablecoin. Similar to the objective of stablecoins, the Fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price (NAV). The Fund has maintained this NAV since inception, having provided price stability, and is also required by law to provide quarterly public disclosure of all holdings. The Fund’s 7-day current yield is 5.12% as of August 31, 2024, with a 20 basis point net expense ratio. Fund shares are offered without sales charge. The Fund is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and invests 99.5% of its total assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash.</p>\n<p>The BENJI Token is designed to provide transparency by using blockchain technology to process transactions and record share ownership. The Fund’s transfer agent maintains the official record of share ownership via a proprietary blockchain-integrated system that utilizes public blockchains as the source of truth for recording transactional activity, known as the Benji platform. It’s important to note that there is no personally identifiable information stored on the blockchain, only transaction-level data. Because the Benji platform records transactions and Fund ownership via public blockchains, and because this on-chain record serves as the true system of record with no shadow record keeping behind the scenes, SparkDAO would have real-time transparency and assurance that their assets are in good stead. SparkDAO can interact with their account at any time using our Benji Institutional Web Portal and provide a look through to their holdings using their preferred block explorer, such as Etherscan for Ethereum.</p>\n<p>Please see below for a preview of our Institutional Web Portal supporting the BENJI Token.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/2/923383ea373ea42777a2ab1719512e3f48c9caad.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kRm541eDuZ4zSnY9T7kSIwl9khT.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/2/923383ea373ea42777a2ab1719512e3f48c9caad_2_690x437.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"kRm541eDuZ4zSnY9T7kSIwl9khT\" width=\"690\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/2/923383ea373ea42777a2ab1719512e3f48c9caad_2_690x437.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/2/923383ea373ea42777a2ab1719512e3f48c9caad.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/2/923383ea373ea42777a2ab1719512e3f48c9caad.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1F272E\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/9/3901cbdcce3f76da77e544c0a9fedfd3ed58b9c7.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/88j3ZKHQlqk4bdvJgumsZtuIUAf.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/9/3901cbdcce3f76da77e544c0a9fedfd3ed58b9c7_2_690x437.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"88j3ZKHQlqk4bdvJgumsZtuIUAf\" width=\"690\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/9/3901cbdcce3f76da77e544c0a9fedfd3ed58b9c7_2_690x437.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/9/3901cbdcce3f76da77e544c0a9fedfd3ed58b9c7.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/9/3901cbdcce3f76da77e544c0a9fedfd3ed58b9c7.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"383E45\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Please see below for previews of the modal interface for ZeroHash on Benji Institutional.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e2b54604d85c7fe7c5f1cd39e8e8782d36aee87a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wlyhFEhFMl44n36ebWnNtPKYZOa.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e2b54604d85c7fe7c5f1cd39e8e8782d36aee87a_2_690x437.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"wlyhFEhFMl44n36ebWnNtPKYZOa\" width=\"690\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e2b54604d85c7fe7c5f1cd39e8e8782d36aee87a_2_690x437.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e2b54604d85c7fe7c5f1cd39e8e8782d36aee87a.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e2b54604d85c7fe7c5f1cd39e8e8782d36aee87a.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"3A3F43\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/a/9a129646b69952e99f16e31f3bbe2eb2fe44a5c4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lYZlSJtjLacd9FKsNM0LqvlY9xi.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/a/9a129646b69952e99f16e31f3bbe2eb2fe44a5c4_2_690x437.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"lYZlSJtjLacd9FKsNM0LqvlY9xi\" width=\"690\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/a/9a129646b69952e99f16e31f3bbe2eb2fe44a5c4_2_690x437.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/a/9a129646b69952e99f16e31f3bbe2eb2fe44a5c4.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/a/9a129646b69952e99f16e31f3bbe2eb2fe44a5c4.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"363C41\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>While BENJI Token subscriptions and redemptions are typically done in fiat, namely USD, investors in the BENJI Token are not required to utilize a bank account. Zero Hash conversion services, which are available on the Benji platform, allow investors to convert US Dollar Coins (USDC) to USD, which in turn is transferred to their Franklin Templeton account and used to seamlessly purchase BENJI Tokens. Investors in the Fund may also use Zero Hash services to convert USD proceeds from the sale of BENJI Tokens to USDC. These conversions do not require USDC being on the same network as BENJI Tokens.</p>\n<p>Ensuring the safety and stability of treasury and reserve funds is of the utmost importance and, as a result, many invest in stablecoins to try to preserve capital. Stablecoin providers invest the underlying assets across many different investment types to generate return but rarely pass that return to holders of the stablecoin. In the case of the BENJI Token, we believe that SparkDAO’s reserves and/or treasury can not only receive the benefit of capital preservation but can also earn any income generated from the Fund’s holdings through an asset that lives natively on-chain. Any income generated by investing in the BENJI Token can provide additional capital to aid in the development of new products, technology, or other initiatives deemed important to SparkDAO.</p>\n<p>We would like to advocate for SparkDAO to liquidate a portion of its DAI reserves and/or treasury to invest in the BENJI Token. Please refer to Appendix 1 - <em>Say Hello to Benji</em> for more information on the BENJI Token and process of investing.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund intends to be a “Government money market fund,” as such term is defined in or interpreted under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act). The Fund invests at least 99.5% of its assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash.</p>\n<p>The Fund invests in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. government securities, which may include fixed, floating and variable rate securities.</li>\n<li>Repurchase agreements which are agreements by the Fund to buy Government securities and then to sell the securities back on an agreed upon date (generally, less than seven days) at a higher price, which reflects prevailing short-term interest rates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Fund’s portfolio managers seek to build a diversified portfolio of Government securities. Government securities include those issued by government agencies or instrumentalities, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks, whose securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Government.</p>\n<p>The portfolio managers make the final security selection decisions, consistent with desired overall risk positioning, and based on relative pricing and trading liquidity. Throughout the portfolio construction process, dedicated risk analysts collaborate with the portfolio managers to identify the level and sources of risk and help determine optimal position sizing.</p>\n<p>The Fund only buys securities that the investment manager determines present minimal credit risks. The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 calendar days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average life for its portfolio of 120 calendar days or less, and only buys securities that mature or are deemed to mature in 397 calendar days or less. As of August 31, 2024, the Fund’s weighted average maturity was 16 days, and 27 days as of June 30, 2024.</p>\n<p>The Fund uses the amortized cost method of valuation to seek to maintain a stable $1.00 share price and does not currently intend to impose liquidity fees or redemption gates on Fund redemptions.</p>\n<p>An Institutional Web Portal is available for institutional investors and other investors that require a multi-user interface for Fund subscriptions and redemptions.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>Income received from the Fund are paid daily when its net asset value (NAV) is calculated, which is based on NYSE business days. Your account (via the Institutional Web Portal) begins to receive dividends on the day after the Fund receives your investment, provided the investment is received by the Fund on any business day in good order prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time or the regularly scheduled close of the NYSE, whichever is earlier. Investments received after that time will normally begin to earn dividends on the following business day. Dividends from net investment income are normally declared and distributed daily; these dividends may be reinvested or paid daily to shareholders directly to their account in the form of additional BENJI tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

(e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></p>\n<p>Users of the Benji platform are run through typical KYC/AML verification and are whitelisted inside the contract (using ERC-20 roles).</p>\n<p><strong>12.\tWhat is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Over the last 12 months, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund has done over 1900 transactions. This does not include daily dividend reinvestments. BENJI tokens are not traded on a secondary market. The Fund is organized as an open-end mutual fund so investors can generally purchase or redeem BENJI Tokens directly from the Fund on days that the at the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading.</p>\n<p><strong>13.\tWhat is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>Expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from the Fund depends on the time of the subscription or redemption. If we receive your request in proper form prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time, or the regularly scheduled close of the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier, proceeds sent by ACH generally will be available within two to three business days, however, in most cases, we are able to make the proceeds available same day. Institutional Fed Wires must be received prior to 3 p.m. Pacific time in order to receive same day trade date. We have not had any interruptions in our ability to process redemptions and subscriptions to date.</p>\n<p><strong>14.\tProvide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>Subscriptions and redemptions for the Fund are typically done in fiat via Fed Wire for institutional investors, however, we also provide the ability to convert USDC to BENJI Tokens (or BENJI Tokens to USDC) through an agreement we have with Zero Hash. As mentioned in the question above, all Fund transactions must be conducted via the Institutional Web Portal.</p>\n<p>You can redeem your shares at any time through the Institutional Web Portal, although redemptions of Fund shares will only be processed during normal business hours on business days (NYSE business days). Institutional investors making redemptions via the Institutional Web Portal will use a submitter/approver process to authorize transactions.</p>\n<p>Redemption proceeds will be sent by electronic funds transfer (Fed Wire) from your Institutional Web Portal account to your bank account within seven days after we receive your request in proper form.</p>\n<p>Before requesting to have redemption proceeds sent to a bank account, please make sure we have your current bank account information on file.</p>\n<p>If the bank account was added or changed within the last 15 days, you may be required to provide written instructions signed by all Fund account owners, with a signature guarantee for each Fund account owner.</p>\n<p>If we receive your request in proper form prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time, or the regularly scheduled close of the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier, proceeds sent by ACH generally will be available within two to three business days, however, in most cases, we are able to make the proceeds available same day.</p>\n<p>For a diagram of the flow of funds, please see the graphic in question 7 above.</p>\n<p><strong>15.\tHave any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p>No, however, the investment manager may also hold cash when securities meeting the Fund’s investment criteria are unavailable or to maintain liquidity. The Fund only buys securities that at the time of acquisition are “eligible securities,” as defined by applicable regulation (e.g., government securities, securities issued by a money market fund, and securities that the investment manager determines present minimal credit risks). As previously mentioned, the Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 calendar days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average life for its portfolio of 120 calendar days or less, and only buys securities that mature or are deemed to mature in 397 calendar days or less (or securities otherwise permitted to be purchased because of maturity shortening provisions under applicable regulation).</p>\n<p><strong>16.\tWith what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p>While BENJI Token subscriptions and redemptions are typically done in fiat, namely USD, investors in the BENJI Token are not required to utilize a bank account. Zero Hash conversion services allow investors to convert USDC to USD, which in turn is transferred to their Franklin Templeton account and used to seamlessly purchase BENJI Tokens. Investors in the Fund may also use Zero Hash services to convert USD proceeds from the sale of BENJI Tokens to USDC.</p>\n<p><strong>17.\tWhat are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>We are working on a number of enhancements that bring new functionality to money market funds not seen before, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for subscribing/redeeming using a wider variety of tokens beyond USDC</li>\n<li>Self-custody and web3 wallet interfaces</li>\n<li>A general purpose GraphQL API</li>\n<li>Expansion to issue BENJI on even more blockchain networks</li>\n<li>Further enhancements to peer-to-peer transferability</li>\n<li>Availability through third party distributors/exchanges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These features are naturally subject to regulations and regulatory interpretations. If you would like to learn more about these development efforts, we would be happy to offer discussion with our engineering team members.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned above in question 4 under the “Product Information” section, Franklin Templeton Trust (Trust) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) as an open-end management investment company, consisting of one series – the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund. The Fund intends to be a “Government money market fund,” as such term is defined in or interpreted under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For more information, please contact our team or visit the Fund’s Prospectus: <a href=\"https://www.franklintempleton.com/tools-and-resources/lit-preview/29386/SINGLCLASS/franklin-on-chain-u-s-government-money-fund#prospectus\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund - FOBXX (franklintempleton.com)</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question 1 above.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question 1 above.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s assets are maintained by a qualified custodian and are separate from holdings of the Fund’s investment manager or its affiliates. Because the Fund’s investment manager is prohibited from comingling Fund assets with assets of the investment manager or its affiliates, a bankruptcy by the investment manager or an affiliate would not subject Fund assets to risk of creditors in any bankruptcy proceedings. As previously mentioned, it is also important to note that the Fund intends to be a “government money market fund” as such term is defined in or interpreted under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act). The Fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash.</p>\n<p>Yes, the issuer has more than one product. The Fund’s investment manager is Franklin Advisers, Inc. The investment manager is a wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc., a publicly owned company engaged in the financial services industry through its subsidiaries. Franklin Resources, Inc. is the holding company for various subsidiaries that form the global investment management organization known as Franklin Templeton. With more than 75 years of active management experience, Franklin Templeton offers investment solutions to help clients achieve better outcomes. Our independent specialist investment managers (SIMs) provide clients with deep expertise and boutique specialization across asset classes, investment styles, and geographies. Furthermore, as we mentioned previously, our SIMs are backed by a global infrastructure with at-scale capabilities in research, data analytics, and servicing—this combination of independent, entrepreneurial SIMs and global strength makes Franklin Templeton uniquely agile and allows us to offer 200+ investment strategies across a full range of vehicles.</p>\n<p>The Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund is managed by Franklin Templeton’s Fixed Income portfolio management team.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is a series of Franklin Templeton Trust, which is an open-end investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act (the “1940”), which confers certain rights to all shareholders, including, among other rights, the right to: (i) vote for the board of trustees; (ii) approve the Fund’s investment management agreement; and (iii) vote on other Fund-specific matters.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the Fund or its officers.</p>\n<p>During the year ended June 30, 2024, neither Franklin Advisers, Inc. (FAV) nor, to the best of its knowledge, its individual <em>advisory affiliates</em> was named as a respondent in any regulatory <em>investment-related</em> <em>proceedings</em> brought by any U.S. federal or state regulatory agency, <em>foreign financial regulatory authority,</em> or <em>self-regulatory organization.</em> Further, in connection with investigations by multiple state attorneys general (“AGs”) concerning Environmental Social and Governance-related investment activities of asset managers in the industry, in 2023, FAV received two Civil Investigative Demands (“CIDs”) issued by AGs of the State of Louisiana and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. We submitted responses to the CIDs in July and August 2023. On February 6, 2024, the Office of the Louisiana AG confirmed that FAV has complied with the CID and that the CID is no longer outstanding. As of the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we have received no further requests for documents or information under the CID from the Office of the Kentucky AG. <em>Investment-related proceedings, findings</em> or <em>orders</em> resulting from the investigations, if any, will be reported, to the extent required and permitted by law, on FAV’s Form ADV filed with the SEC.</p>\n<p>For a summary of <em>investment-related proceedings, findings</em> or <em>orders</em> brought or issued by any such regulatory entity against FAV and/or certain of its <em>advisory affiliates</em> in the past 10 years ended June 30, 2024, as well as certain other regulatory matters, please see Appendix 2 – <em>Franklin Advisers, Inc. Regulatory Summary</em> . In addition, from time to time, FAV and its <em>advisory affiliates</em> receive subpoenas and inquiries, including requests for documents or information, from governmental authorities or regulatory bodies and also are the subject of governmental or regulatory examinations or investigations. <em>Investment-related</em> <em>proceedings</em>, <em>findings</em> or <em>orders</em> resulting from such subpoenas, inquiries, examinations, or investigations, if any, will be reported, to the extent required and permitted by law, on FAV’s Form ADV filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>\n<p>For a summary of material, investment-management-related private litigation in which FAV and/or certain of its <em>advisory affiliates</em> were named as defendants at any point in the past five years ended June 30, 2024, please see Appendix 3 – <em>Franklin Advisers, Inc. 5-Year Litigation Summary</em>. In addition, FAV and its <em>advisory affiliates</em> are from time to time named in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including currently.

(Italicized terms are as defined on SEC’s Form ADV.)</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>As of September 2024, we do not believe that Franklin Templeton or the Fund has any conflicts of interest with MakerDAO.</p>\n<p>Franklin Templeton has a corporate policy aimed to mitigate conflicts of interest. Franklin Templeton’s policy is to take all reasonable steps to maintain and operate effective organizational and administrative controls to identify and manage relevant conflicts that may occur between Franklin Templeton and its clients or between multiple clients.</p>\n<p>The following list provides a summary of the main conflicts we have identified and the controls in place to manage such conflicts within the Franklin Templeton group.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Franklin Templeton Seed Money versus Shareholders’ Investment.</strong> As part of normal business practice, Franklin Templeton will invest money, initially, at the launch of a fund in order to diversify and attract clients. The policy is that an investment by Franklin Templeton is treated in a manner that is believed to not conflict with the interests of any client.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fairness of Trading Allocation and Order Priority among Clients</strong>**.** Franklin Templeton has trading aggregation, allocation, and best execution policies and procedures that are designed to ensure that all trades are treated in an equitable and fiduciary manner relative to investment objectives. Where there is insufficient liquidity, the allocation policy automatically attributes liquidity proportionately across all client orders. The aggregation and allocation procedures are subject to a regular review.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interfund Trading and Franklin Templeton Funds Purchasing Franklin Templeton Funds.</strong> At times, Franklin Templeton may match internal orders of sales and purchases of portfolio securities. This is known as crosses or Interfunds. Some Franklin Templeton funds can also trade units in other Franklin Templeton funds. This process is dealt with in the existing trading system and procedures. The trade is executed at market price with no commissions or spread taken by Franklin Templeton. This activity is regularly reviewed with the goal of ensuring that clients are treated fairly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Research Material and Client Commissions.</strong> Franklin Templeton (FT) proprietary research material is not offered to the general public for sale. FT may enter into Client Commission Arrangements (CCAs), whereby FT directs trades to a broker-dealer with the instruction that the executing broker segregate commission in excess of execution costs in a pool which may be used to compensate brokers and other third parties that provide research services or products to FT. FT has established policies and standards that include ongoing monitoring, oversight, and audit controls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Use of Sensitive Data and Non-Public Information.</strong> Franklin Templeton has a number of policies and procedures in place that place restrictions on staff use of confidential or non-public information. There are formal reporting and approval procedures to release such information to satisfy Franklin Templeton’s fiduciary obligations to clients and shareholders. These policies and procedures are regularly reviewed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Information Barrier among Investment Advisors and Broker-Dealer Relationships.</strong> With the goal of ensuring that sensitive decision information cannot be used to the disadvantage of another fund and that confidential information is not shared inappropriately, Franklin Templeton has Information Barrier Compliance Policy and Procedures in place that separate the physical and logistical investment information between different advisor groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Code of Ethics.</strong> All Franklin Templeton personnel are bound by a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct which requires staff to conduct themselves with ethics and integrity and to avoid a conflict, particularly where their personal interests (including family members) could interfere with the interests of the firm and/or the client. In addition, Franklin Templeton has a Personal Investments and Insider Trading Policy that requires pre-clearance of personal transactions, including those of the immediate family of staff members who have access to non-public information regarding securities transactions, securities recommendations, or portfolio holding of FT funds or client accounts. Personal transactions of such staff members are regularly monitored, and prescribed sanctions are issued in the event of a breach.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Equitable and Fair Treatment among Clients.</strong> At the heart of Franklin Templeton procedures is the requirement to treat clients fairly and equitably in line with the firm’s fiduciary obligations and investment objectives. This includes, but is not limited to, activity such as the allocation of fees and expenses, redemption in kind, and the lending of securities of a fund. Franklin Templeton procedures are regularly reviewed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Investment in Client Securities.</strong> At times, Franklin Templeton funds or investors will invest in the securities of a company for which Franklin Templeton serves as investment manager. Such investment decisions made by Franklin Templeton to invest in client securities are always guided by what is in the best interest of the relevant fund, account, or its investors. Investment decisions are regularly reviewed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gifts and Entertainment.</strong> Franklin Templeton has adopted strict guidelines regarding what gifts and business entertainment are acceptable. The policy is part of our Code of Ethics, any violation of which may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Side-by-Side Management.</strong> Franklin Templeton has implemented “Policies and Procedures for Side-By-Side Management of Registered Investment Companies and Investment Accounts” designed to address potential conflicts of interest that may arise when a portfolio manager or different portfolio managers within a single investment adviser or within a single investment group manage both U.S.-registered funds and other investment accounts or pooled vehicles for other advisory clients.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>Fund distributions, which will be automatically reinvested in additional shares, are generally taxable to you as ordinary income, capital gains or some combination of both. Investment company dividends paid to you from interest earned on certain U.S. government securities may be exempt from state and local taxation, subject in some states to minimum investment or reporting requirements that must be met by the Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>Dividend income:</strong> Income dividends are generally subject to tax at ordinary rates. Because the Fund invests primarily in debt securities, it is expected that none of the Fund’s income dividends will be qualified dividends subject to reduced rates of taxation to individuals. A return-of-capital distribution is generally not taxable but will reduce the cost basis of your shares, and will result in a higher capital gain or a lower capital loss when you later sell your shares.</p>\n<p><strong>Capital gains:</strong> Fund distributions of short-term capital gains are also subject to tax at ordinary rates. Because the Fund is a money market fund, it does not expect to realize and distribute any long-term capital gains on its investments.</p>\n<p><strong>Sales of Fund shares:</strong> Because the Fund seeks to maintain a $1.00 per share NAV, sales of its shares will not generally result in a taxable capital gain or loss for federal or state income tax purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Medicare tax:</strong> An additional 3.8% Medicare tax is imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received from the Fund and net gains from redemptions or other taxable dispositions of Fund shares) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent that such person’s “modified adjusted gross income” (in the case of an individual) or “adjusted gross income” (in the case of an estate or trust) exceeds a threshold amount. Any liability for this additional Medicare tax is reported on, and paid with, your federal income tax return.</p>\n<p><strong>Backup withholding:</strong> A shareholder may be subject to backup withholding on any distributions of income and capital gains if the shareholder has provided either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, has failed to certify that the shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or has not certified that the shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. State backup withholding may also apply.</p>\n<p><strong>State and local taxes:</strong> Distributions of ordinary income and capital gains, if any are generally subject to state and local taxes. However, distributions of ordinary income paid to individual shareholders from interest earned by the Fund on certain U.S. Government obligations may be exempt from state and local income taxation depending on the state. Shareholders should contact their tax advisors with respect to the state and local income tax consequences of investing in the Fund, including whether Fund dividends derived from interest on U.S. government obligations held by the Fund qualify for tax free treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-U.S. investors:</strong> Non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. withholding tax at 30% or a lower treaty rate on Fund dividends of ordinary income. Non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. estate tax on the value of their shares. They are subject to special U.S. tax certification requirements to avoid backup withholding, claim any exemptions from withholding and claim any treaty benefits. Exemptions from U.S. withholding tax are generally provided for capital gains realized on the sale of Fund shares, capital gain dividends paid by the Fund from net long-term capital gains, short-term capital gain dividends paid by the Fund from net short-term capital gains and interest-related dividends paid by the Fund from its qualified net interest income from U.S. sources. However, notwithstanding such exemptions from U.S. withholding tax at source, any such dividends and distributions of income and capital gains will be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24% if you fail to properly certify that you are not a U.S. person.</p>\n<p><strong>Other reporting and withholding requirements:</strong> Payments to a shareholder that is either a foreign financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity within the meaning of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) may be subject to a 30% withholding tax on income dividends paid by the Fund. The FATCA withholding tax generally can be avoided by such foreign entity if it provides the Fund, and in some cases, the IRS, information concerning the ownership of certain foreign financial accounts or other appropriate certifications or documentation concerning its status under FATCA. The Fund may be required to report certain shareholder account information to the IRS, non-U.S. taxing authorities or other parties to comply with FATCA.</p>\n<p><strong>Other tax information:</strong> This discussion of “Distributions and Taxes” is for general information only and is not tax advice. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding your particular circumstances, and about any federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences before making an investment in the Fund. Additional information about the tax consequences of investing in the Fund may be found in the SAI.</p>\n<p><strong>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark</strong></p>\n<p>As of August 31, 2024, the Fund’s average annual total return since inception (April 4, 2021) is 2.97%, 3.37% on a three-year basis, and 5.32% on a 1-year basis. This Fund does not have a benchmark.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tDescribe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p>As an investor, you will receive monthly and quarterly account statements from Franklin Templeton electronically through the Institutional Web Portal that show all your account transactions for the period. You also will receive the Fund’s shareholder reports every six months, which include the Fund’s financial statements. In addition, you will receive an annual updated summary prospectus electronically through the Institutional Web Portal (prospectus available upon request). At any time, you may view current prospectuses/summary prospectuses and shareholder reports through the Institutional Web Portal or online at <a href=\"http://www.franklintempleton.com/FOBXX\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">www.franklintempleton.com/FOBXX</a>.

As mentioned above, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Fund’s independent registered public accounting firm, audits the financial statements included in the Fund’s Annual Report to shareholders. To see a copy of this audit report, please visit page 16 of Appendix 4 – <em>Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund Annual Report</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tDescribe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p>Franklin Templeton’s Digital Asset Technology team pioneered, created, and built our own proprietary blockchain-integrated recordkeeping system that utilizes features of traditional book-entry system and records transactions to one or more public blockchain networks, and this integrated ecosystem is referred to as the Benji platform. The Benji platform allows for the for the minting, burning, transferring, freezing and clawing back of Benji Tokens. The code is tested internally as well as audited by providers shared below. The platform has been demonstrated to the U.S. SEC, Luxembourg CSSF, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and the UK FCA on more than one occasion. The tokenization engine is multi-chain and the official transaction records are on-chain. The blockchain protocols Franklin Templeton supports are Stellar, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche and Ethereum. In addition, we are working on the deployment of Aptos, Solana and Base. Other networks are evaluated regularly and go through an assessment of suitability based on specific criteria. The current U.S. Fund is available to individual or institutional investors that purchase shares directly from the Fund through the Benji Mobile App (for retail investors) or Benji Institutional Web Portal (as applicable). Similar to traditional fund recordkeeping systems, all Fund and shareholder records in the blockchain-integrated system are under the full and complete control of the Fund’s transfer agent.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>Our smart contract code has been audited by Trail of Bits as of September 2023. A detailed report can be accessed <a href=\"https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-05-franklintempleton-moneymarket-securityreview.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. Updates to our smart contact code were made in May 2024 and audited by Ancilia. A detailed report can be accessed <a href=\"https://github.com/ancilia-xyz/AuditReports/blob/main/FT%20-%20Money%20Market%20Fund%20Auditing%20Report%20v1.4.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tDescribe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to MakerDAO’s Endgame implementation, we proposed that a portion of MakerDAO’s treasury to be allocated to the BENJI Token. To read more about our proposal from April 2023, please visit our MIP <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposal-for-the-makerdao-treasury-to-invest-in-the-benji-token-franklin-onchain-u-s-government-money-fund/20643\">here</a>. In addition, our team has relationships with some of the largest Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in the digital asset ecosystem. Currently in our Digital Asset Investment portfolios, we own several governance tokens including many of the top governance tokens by market cap.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tBeyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The BENJI Token provides SparkDAO and MakerDAO access to the first U.S. registered Fund whose transaction records live natively on public blockchains, which can enhance the DAO’s treasury transparency, diversification and liquidity through a stable, regulatory compliant product. Additionally, we are actively working on expanding both the features of the BENJI Token, such as self-custody through your preferred wallet provider, which is currently available for Institutional clients, and extending its functionality across additional blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>We envision numerous applications for the BENJI Token across both the digital asset ecosystem and traditional finance. We believe peer-to-peer transfers have the potential to enhance the corporate funding process, whether that’s through Venture Capital firms who want to fund new projects or existing portfolio companies through a yield-bearing asset, or even for DAOs like Spark who may want to give grant funding to their sub-DAOs or other projects building on their native chain. In addition, we believe the BENJI Token may be able to provide utility for payments or even as a settlement or collateral token, since holders can engage in peer-to-peer transfers between each other between networks for any purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tDoes the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund currently uses the Stellar network as the primary public blockchain and Fund investors will initially hold their wallets on the Stellar network. However, the Fund may also use other blockchain networks, including Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Ethereum, Solana, and Base for certain accounts upon request and subject to eligibility, although one or more of those other blockchain networks may not be available at certain times. Please stay tuned for additional network availability.</p>\n<p>Fund shares may be transferred in peer-to-peer transactions from one shareholder wallet to another shareholder wallet (or potential shareholder wallet) within any approved blockchain network or between any two approved blockchain networks. Shares of the Fund may be transferred using the Institutional Web Portal. A complete record of these transactions is viewable on the blockchain due to being recorded by the transfer agent’s blockchain-integrated recordkeeping system. Before transferring Fund shares, you (as the transferor) and the potential transferee must each have an active, permissioned (i.e., “whitelisted”) wallet registered with the Fund’s transfer agent on any approved blockchain network. You may use the Institutional Web Portal to authorize the transfer agent to transfer your shares to a transferee that you identify using the public key for the transferee’s wallet. There is no minimum number of shares required to process a transfer. The transfer agent is responsible for ensuring that the potential transferee in a peer-to-peer transaction has a permissioned wallet on an approved blockchain network.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although you may provide instructions to transfer Fund shares at any time, transfers are processed at the Fund’s next NAV calculation time after we receive your transfer request in proper form through the Institutional Web Portal.</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding the fact that the Fund processes peer-to-peer transfers after the next calculated NAV following the receipt of a transfer request in proper form, the Fund does not require that peer-to-peer transfers occur at NAV.</li>\n<li>A whitelisted investor must be aware of other whitelisted investors who are available to enter into peer-to-peer transfers and neither the Fund nor its transfer agent will play any role in connecting transferors and transferees.</li>\n<li>Peer-to-peer transfers do not constitute a public trading market and Fund shares will not be listed for trading on any such market, including a national securities exchange or an alternative trading system operating by a registered broker that is subject to Regulation ATS.</li>\n<li>To the extent investors engage in peer-to-peer transfers at a price other than NAV, such transfers may, in certain circumstances, have legal implications for those investors under the federal securities laws or otherwise.</li>\n<li>The transfer agent cannot ensure the reliability of any transfer of other assets negotiated in connection with peer-to-peer transfers other than transfers of Fund shares that a shareholder instructs the transfer agent to make.</li>\n<li>Blockchain network(s) on which a peer-to-peer transfer is recorded may impose transaction fees to validate the transaction on the network. These fees are typically paid in the native digital asset for the operation of the blockchain network and will be the responsibility of the investment manager or its affiliates; Fund investors will not be required to purchase any native digital asset to transact on the network.<br>\nYou should consult your own tax advisor regarding your particular circumstances, and about any federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences in connection with the transfer of Fund shares.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4.

We initially supported the legacy Maker system through the Maker Risk Dashboard and Makerburn. Following the launch of SparkLend, we extended our support to Spark users through the Spark Risk Dashboard.</p>\n<p><strong>After more than a year of development, we are now excited to announce the launch of the Sky Risk &amp; Analytics Dashboard.</strong></p>\n<p>Sky Risk &amp; Analytics Dashboard is available on the following URL: <strong><a href=\"https://info.sky.money\">https://info.sky.money</a></strong></p>\n<p>The Sky Risk &amp; Analytics Dashboard was designed with two main goals in mind: providing a simple user experience while at the same time highlighting the resilience of the Sky Ecosystem. The motivation behind these design principles are based on the assumption that a protocol’s risk management is only as effective as its ability to clearly present risk metrics to protocol users, regardless of their knowledge or experience level. Our aim is for the Sky Risk &amp; Analytics Dashboard to become the new standard, where all Sky stakeholders can easily digest data regarding the most critical aspects of the Sky Protocol and broader Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Below, we highlight some of the key features that make the new dashboard an important tool for Sky Ecosystem participants.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-99004-homepage-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99004-homepage-2\"></a>Homepage</h1>\n<p>The Sky Risk &amp; Analytics Dashboard homepage is intended to provide insights into the holistic performance of the Sky Ecosystem.

For both metrics, an APY counter is also included.</li>\n<li><strong>Upgrade Progress Tracker:</strong> Below the TVL widgets, we have included an Upgrade Progress Tracker for both USDS and SKY. On the left side of the Upgrade Progress Tracker, the dashboard tracks the amount of DAI which has been upgraded to USDS. On the right side of the Upgrade Progress Tracker, the dashboard tracks the amount of MKR which has been upgraded to SKY.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> Total Supply is an aggregate metric, consisting of all DAI and USDS supply in the Sky Ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Surplus:</strong> This widget allows users to check the current system-level surplus. By clicking on the Surplus widget, the user is taken to a Surplus page, where more specific information is available.</li>\n<li><strong>Collateralization:</strong> The Collateralization widget shows the total dollar-denominated value of collateral which is being used to borrow DAI and USDS.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart Burn Engine:</strong> On the homepage, the Smart Burn Engine widget displays the total amount of dollar-denominated liquidity owned by the Sky Ecosystem. If the user clicks on the widget, the dashboard will show more detailed information, such as the amount of SKY &amp; USDS tokens owned, impermanent loss/profit, historical metrics, and historical activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Estimated Annual Net Revenue:</strong> This widget shows the estimated annual net revenue, assuming that protocol parameters, such as stability fees, liquidations penalties, PSM fees, and expenses remain constant.</li>\n<li><strong>USDS Diversification Donut Chart:</strong> On the bottom-right side of the homepage, we have included a donut chart to illustrate the USDS diversification throughout the Sky Ecosystem. It is possible to click on individual sections within the donut chart to see more detailed information regarding each USDS allocation.</li>\n<li><strong>USDS &amp; SKY Widgets:</strong> Finally, at the bottom of the page, we have included two widgets regarding USDS and SKY, displaying dollar-denominated price, token supply, and market capitalization. By clicking on these widgets, the user is able to retrieve more granular information, including historical activity, number of holders, and holder distribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-99004-dashboard-menu-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99004-dashboard-menu-3\"></a>Dashboard Menu</h1>\n<p>By clicking on the menu item in the top right corner of the dashboard interface, the dashboard menu pops up.

At the time of writing, the page tracks DAI, MKR, sDAI, USDS, SKY, and sUSDS.

Product type / underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>$M is a permissionless, immutable cryptodollar (currently) exclusively backed by short term t-bills (0-90 day maturity). The M^0 protocol is capable of passing protocol yield to governance-approved parties, as a function of the underlying collateral yield and governance parameter, currently at a rate of 5% APY. While this rate should roughly track the yield on the collateral portfolio, the M^0 protocol allows governance to express monetary policy in ways similar to Maker, while protecting the $M’s overcollateralization.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Issuer jurisdiction</strong></p>\n<p>Like USDS and DAI, the same $M can be issued by several parties and should thus be considered a multi-issuer cryptodollar. Actors called “Minters” are able to deposit collateral into specially purposed structures (SPVs) that are designed exclusively to serve the protocol, and for which Minters must provide evidence to governance. Minters can then bring this balance on-chain with the assistance of one or more “Validators.” One of our first Validators is <a href=\"https://chroniclelabs.org/blog/m-0-and-chronicle-raising-the-standard-in-collateral-verification-with-the-rwa-oracle\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chronicle Labs</a>, the team that has been powering Maker’s (and now Sky’s) oracles since the project’s inception. Once the collateral balance is on-chain, the Minter can generate up to a certain percentage of its value in $M. Minters accrue interest on the collateral balance, and pay a fee to the protocol (the Minter Rate). The vast majority of those proceeds are passed by the protocol to eligible Earners.</p>\n<p>The first Minter (issuer) in the M^0 ecosystem is <a href=\"https://www.mxon.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MXON</a>, an entity operating in the British Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>5.

Company Details</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Company description</strong></p>\n<p>M^0 is not a traditional company, but a decentralized protocol like Sky. The protocol was built by M^0 Labs (The Thing GmbH), which is based in Berlin, Germany. Since the protocol is immutable, M^0 Labs, the M^0 Foundation (Switzerland), and any other affiliated entity, no longer has the ability to upgrade or control the protocol. Token holders, which include founders, team members, and investors (see <a href=\"http://www.m0.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">www.m0.org</a> for our list of investors) control a limited set of parameters in the protocol through the governance process. In M^0 governance, all token holders are required to participate or else lose 10% of their voting power per missed vote, providing a high likelihood that proposals are exposed and voted on by the entire set of governors. The primary function of governance in M^0 is to approve Minters, Validators, Earners, and updates to the Adopted Guidance.

Product Information</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p>M^0 is a decentralized protocol, as well as a set of off-chain standards and APIs, that allows institutional holders of high-quality collateral to issue fungible cryptodollars (“stablecoins”). As in the Sky protocol, everything in the M^0 protocol must be achieved through decentralized governance. We designed a custom governance mechanism which over time enforces 100% participation from all token holders and requires total transparency for even the slightest alteration – nothing is outsourced to centralized parties. Our protocol’s smart contracts are completely immutable and cannot be upgraded through governance. Our protocol was audited 8 times by some of the best names in the business, including Prototech, who wrote many of the smart contracts that Maker has been using for years. We are confident that M^0 is the only safe and credibly neutral solution to Sky’s needs.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>$M is a permissionless, immutable cryptodollar that combines the benefits of digital dollars with the risk profile of physical cash. Backed by Eligible Collateral, currently short-term U.S. Treasury bills held in insolvency-remote, orphaned SPVs, $M is issued through a permissionless and immutable protocol, ensuring daily auditable reserves. M^0’s overcollateralized model not only secures the value of $M but also allows institutional partners to earn yield natively, without additional smart contract risk. $M is currently paying 5% to these Earners, making it an attractive option for on-chain treasuries seeking secure and transparent returns .</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>There are two options for yield accrual - rebasing, which is the native way to accrue yield on $M, or claiming via our wrapper contract, Smart $M. Rebasing occurs continuously while claiming via the wrapper is triggered manually or upon transfers.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>The first issuer in the M^0 ecosystem is MXON. The company is based out of the British Virgin Islands. The key entities are “Minter One Ltd.” and “Minter One Generator (SPV) Ltd” Currently, the shareholders of M^0 Labs and MXON are very similar as MXON was created to help bootstrap the network. Furthermore, the collateral is held in a Luxembourg, orphaned, bankruptcy-remote SPV incorporated as “Asset Repository Sàrl”.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>At this current time, according to the governance-approved Adopted Guidance, only short term (&lt;90 day residual maturity) US t-bills are considered Eligible Collateral. No bank deposits whatsoever are counted towards Minter collateralization. Eligible Collateral is tested on a near-daily basis to ensure continued eligibility.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>7.

What is the AUM of the product? Provide a breakdown by blockchain</strong></p>\n<p>Ethereum Mainnet - 42,734,580 $M</p>\n<p>Eligible Collateral (off-chain) - $ 54,000,000</p>\n<p>This initial TVL/AUM is the result of a few months of efforts. We anticipate significant increases, based on existing agreements, across several blockchain ecosystems in the coming months.</p>\n<p><strong>9. What are the standard fees (i.e., subscription, redemption, management, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>Minters in the M^0 network will compete on purchase/sale fee structure. The current fee for purchasing or selling through MXON is $0. Once on-chain, $M is tradable in a 1 bps UniV3 market with PSM-style (i.e. 1-tick) liquidity. Our liquidity partners will periodically rebalance this pool by purchasing or selling directly with MXON (and potentially other Minters), to ensure Sky and other users have sufficient on-chain liquidity for their needs.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</strong></p>\n<p>M^0 is structured similarly to MakerDAO v1 – a user (Minter) comes to the protocol with collateral (US t-bills) that they anticipate will increase in value. They generate a credit line against this collateral ($M) and pay interest (the Minter Rate) on that credit line. The Minter keeps (or loses) the spread between what they are earning in collateral appreciation and the Minter Rate.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Minter Rate is slotted to be set to 4.8% and the collateral has an average yield of 5.10%, leaving a levered (by the Mint Ratio which is currently 95%, and in the process of changing to 97%) 30 bps spread for the Minter to cover its own expenses. This level of spread ceases to be loss generating and is sustainable at approximately $300M+ in AUM. We anticipate for the fixed and variable costs of operating a Minter/SPV combination to compress substantially over the coming years and therefore for breakeven Minter AUM to compress significantly as well.</p>\n<p><strong>11. How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></p>\n<p>$M as a native asset is entirely permissionless and immutable. In order to become a Minter, Validator, or Earner, the entity must submit an application and be approved by the on-chain governance process. All off-chain entities must be approved by the rules in the Adopted Guidance, which requires governance approval to amend.</p>\n<p><strong>12. What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>N/A - On-chain liquidity for $M was only launched this week. We anticipate this volume to grow significantly.</p>\n<p>There is a Uniswap v3 Pool being managed by our liquidity partners which should soon hold approximately $20M of liquidity in $M and $USDC. We plan to support the growth of this and other liquidity facilities.</p>\n<p><strong>13. What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>We estimate that current Minters will require a maximum of 5 days to purchase/sell $M, mainly due to bank holidays abutting a weekend. In the normal course of business, purchasing or selling $M should not take longer than 3 business days, as the t-bill collateral must be sold and the transaction and wire transfers cleared. We have not had any interruptions to date. As mentioned above, we anticipate that Sky will never need to integrate directly with Minters and will be able to exclusively use on-chain liquidity facilities to enter/exit $M.</p>\n<p><strong>14. Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>For $M holders who do not wish to utilize secondary markets or OTC desks, direct purchase or sale requests can be made with Minters, assuming they are qualified entities and not based in a restricted jurisdiction such as the USA. The transaction requires KYC/AML checks with the BD Minter and potentially with the Corporate Service Provider. This process may take up to a week once all documentation has been received. Again, it is not anticipated that Sky, being a crypto-native organization, will need to interface with real-world entities and should be able to exercise its needs via on-chain liquidity facilities.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/9/49cc467355a64931c7b7f01caf4a62f19fa68b2b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/awQvNIHcTvll6ZWzn3tSwVSKvAD.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/9/49cc467355a64931c7b7f01caf4a62f19fa68b2b_2_607x324.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"awQvNIHcTvll6ZWzn3tSwVSKvAD\" width=\"607\" height=\"324\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/9/49cc467355a64931c7b7f01caf4a62f19fa68b2b_2_607x324.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/9/49cc467355a64931c7b7f01caf4a62f19fa68b2b_2_910x486.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/9/49cc467355a64931c7b7f01caf4a62f19fa68b2b_2_1214x648.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DEEEFA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>15.

What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Each Minter is overseen in their respective jurisdiction(s). The first issuer, MXON, is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and therefore falls under this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>All collateral which backs $M must be demonstrably, continuously held in orphaned, insolvency remote, special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Specifically, all SPVs in the M^0 ecosystem must meet the following criteria, which is taken from our most recent governance-approved Adopted Guidance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is an orphaned entity;</li>\n<li>is minimally affiliated (via its shareholders) with or (practically) controlled by any Validator or Minter or the affiliates of any Validator or Minter;</li>\n<li>does not conduct any other business except the storage of collateral for Minters and issuance of Notes to Minters;</li>\n<li>is a restricted-purpose vehicle that prevents entering into any other liabilities but the ones directly related to the storage of collateral and the issuance of Notes against such collateral;</li>\n<li>is designed to be insolvency remote;</li>\n<li>is incorporated in an Approved Jurisdiction, as described below;</li>\n<li>possesses all required licenses and permissions (if necessary) to store collateral and to issue Notes against such collateral;</li>\n<li>is audited on an annual basis by a licensed auditor deemed appropriate to perform the task.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, any Notes issued to the Minter shall comply with the following in order to be considered Eligible Collateral:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full asset segregation of collateral not only at the Minter level, but also at the level of each wallet address controlled by the Minter — in case the Minter controls more than one permissioned address.</li>\n<li>Limited recourse so that the claims of any Minter are strictly limited to the collateral belonging to its Notes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently the only Approved Jurisdiction is Luxembourg, but this list is expected to grow to other high quality jurisdictions as the list of approved Minters grows. Candidates for Approved Jurisdictions shall comply with the following minimum requirements (again taken from the Adopted Guidance):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bankruptcy Remoteness - The jurisdiction provides legal and structural mechanisms that reduce the risk of insolvency for the legal entity, reinforcing the effectiveness of provisions that prevent creditors and investors from initiating insolvency proceedings against the legal entity or seizing its assets or the assets of its compartments, estates or sub-funds.</li>\n<li>Non-Petition and Non-Seizure Provisions - Jurisdictions must uphold provisions that prevent creditors and investors from initiating insolvency proceedings against a legal entity or seizing its assets or the assets of its compartments or estates or sub-funds, thus ensuring the legal entity’s bankruptcy remoteness.</li>\n<li>Priority of Payments and Subordination - The legal system recognises and enforces contractual or statutory arrangements that clearly define the priority of payments and the subordination of claims among investors and creditors.</li>\n<li>Regulatory Compliance - The jurisdiction has a regulatory framework that supports the business activities of the legal entity, including clear guidelines for the trading of financial instruments and Eligible Collateral associated with them.</li>\n<li>Legal and Regulatory Framework - The jurisdiction has a legal and regulatory framework that permits the issuance of financial instruments and the investment in Eligible Collateral.</li>\n<li>Political Stability - The jurisdiction exhibits a high degree of political stability, characterized by a consistent and predictable legal and regulatory environment, minimal political unrest, and an upholding of the rule of law.</li>\n<li>Dispute Resolution - An effective legal framework for dispute resolution is in place, including access to courts or arbitration panels.</li>\n<li>Asset Segregation - Collateral for each Minter is either to be stored in a separate legal entity per Minter or the jurisdiction must provide legal frameworks that enable the establishment of separate compartments or estates or sub-funds within a single legal entity, ensuring that each compartment or estate or sub-fund is its own distinct pool of assets and liabilities. There must be clear legal recognition that assets within one compartment or estate or sub-fund are exclusively reserved for the investors and creditors of that compartment or estate or sub-fund and are protected from the claims of creditors of other compartments or estates or sub-funds and claims of creditors of the legal entity to ensure the functioning of the intended wind down processes, as described below.</li>\n<li>Limited Recourse- The legal system must enforce that the claims of investors and creditors are strictly limited to the assets of the compartment or estate or sub-fund to which they have exposure. In cases where the assets of a compartment or estate or sub-fund are insufficient to satisfy the claims, the legal framework permits the extinguishment of any remaining claims, prohibiting further recovery efforts.</li>\n<li>Investor Protection - There are robust mechanisms in place to protect investors, including clear disclosure requirements and the enforcement of fiduciary duties by the managers of the legal entity.</li>\n<li>Operational Infrastructure - The jurisdiction boasts a developed financial infrastructure capable of supporting complex financial transactions, including experienced service providers and legal counsel with expertise in financial matters.</li>\n<li>Custody Relationship - The jurisdiction recognises and enforces the legal nature of the custody relationship between the legal entity and its custodian, ensuring that assets held in custody are protected and segregated from the custodian’s general estate in the event of its bankruptcy.</li>\n<li>Audit - The jurisdiction requires the mandatory (by law) audit of the annual financial statements of the legal entity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.

Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p>Approximately once per day (30 hours) every Minter with an active balance of Owed $M must submit a proof of reserve. Failure to post this proof on-chain results in a Penalty Rate being charged on their balance of Owed $M. They achieve this by calling the updateCollateral() method in the M^0 smart contracts and providing the current USD value of the Eligible Collateral in their associated SPV. However, they cannot submit this transaction on-chain without a governance-provided quorum of Validator signatures. Validators are written into the bank and custodial accounts of the SPV and are attesting that the USD value of the Eligible Collateral is identical to what the Minter has provided. M^0 is by far the most transparent and provides the most frequent updates compared to any peer in the industry.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product</strong></p>\n<p>Each day, the Minter must put the USD value of the Eligible Collateral on-chain using current market prices for the collateral. From here, they can only mint the Mint Ratio (currently 95% but proposed to become 97%) against the balance of the Eligible Collateral as $M.</p>\n<p>The SPV holding the collateral is reviewed daily by all Validators associated with the Minter, a review for which Validators provide on-chain signature verification and will soon provide live information at the individual asset level, and undergoes an annual audit by a professional audit firm.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p>Lift Dollar (USDL) is a regulated yield-bearing ERC-20 stablecoin issued by Paxos International and overseen by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). USDL distributes the yield generated on reserve assets directly to token holders on a daily basis. This is achieved through a rebasing mechanism that increases the circulating supply by the rate of daily distributed interest without any action needed from token holders. Currently USDL is only issued on Ethereum but we plan to issue USDL on additional blockchains this year.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>Lift Dollar (USDL) reserve assets are held in cash and equivalents in the below categories, as required by our regulator:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cash deposits residing in a bank deposit account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>US Government Securities with three-month or less residual maturity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overnight reverse repurchase agreements overcollateralized by US Government Securities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>US Government Money Market Funds</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the token holder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>USDL is an ERC-20 token, with the USDL smart contract distributing yield daily through a rebasing mechanism. Rebasing was chosen as an efficient, scalable approach for distributing yield. Yield is generated from the token’s reserves that are invested in cash and cash equivalent assets. Every day around 8:30 am EST, token holders’ USDL balance increases as a result of rebasing.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>Abu Dhabi Global Markets</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>USDL cannot be held by US institutions or individuals. There are no additional restrictions toward asset eligibility.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the use of hedging or derivatives is not permitted by our regulator. Lift Dollar (USDL) reserve assets are held in cash and equivalents in the below categories, as required by our regulator:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cash deposits residing in a bank deposit account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>US Government Securities with three-month or less residual maturity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overnight reverse repurchase agreements overcollateralized by US Government Securities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>US Government Money Market Funds</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>7.

Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></p>\n<p>The USDL token is centrally minted and burned by Paxos International, licensed and regulated by the FSRA to conduct the Regulated Activity of “Providing Money Services” in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). The FSRA has granted Paxos Issuance MENA Ltd. (doing business as Paxos International) a Financial Services Permission for the provision of Money Services (FSP) to conduct the FSRA-regulated activity of providing money services in and from the ADGM. Under FSRA rules, stablecoins are treated as a “mechanism for storing value” similar to e-money. USDL meets the FSRA criteria to be deemed an Accepted Virtual Asset following the FSRA assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International is regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International has approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market to issue U.S. dollar and other currency backed stablecoins.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International holds all reserve assets segregated and bankruptcy protected with permitted custodians for the benefit of token holders, in accordance with COBS pursuant to the FSRA framework for Fiat-Referenced Tokens (FRTs). All reserve assets are held by Paxos International for the benefit of the token holders and cannot be used by Paxos International’s general creditors in the event of an insolvency of Paxos International or any of its affiliates.</p>\n<p>The Paxos International reserve management approach includes the following safeguards for all assets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The mint and burn operation requires the requisite amount of US dollars in the USDL reserve account before Paxos International mints USDL.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paxos International employs a robust intraday liquidity management program to assess cash balances and asset custody across all banking and custodial relationships.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reserve assets may be held in one or more of the following categories, as required by the FSRA:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Cash, residing in segregated bank deposit accounts held for the benefit of USDL holders.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Cash equivalents and debt securities issued by the U.S. Government or organizations that are of both a government and international character with a minimum credit rating of “AA-” with up to three (month) residual maturity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Institutional stable NAV USD government money-market funds, domiciled in non-US jurisdictions with weighted average maturities (WAMs) of no greater than 60 days and weighted average lives (WALs) of no greater than 120 days, subject to FSRA-approved limits on the value of reserve assets to be held in such funds and FSRA-approved credit ratings of such funds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Reverse repurchase agreements overcollateralized by debt securities issued by U.S. Government with maturities of one business day, with a counterparty that is not Paxos International affiliated and adequately creditworthy (as defined by the FSRA credit rating requirements).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eligible reserve assets may be acquired and managed directly by the Paxos International treasury and portfolio management team or indirectly through third-party investment managers in the form of separately managed accounts (SMAs).</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Pursuant to FSRA requirements, in the event of Paxos International’s insolvency or another triggering event as defined by the FSRA, the USDL reserves are required to be liquidated and distributed on a first priority basis to all USDL holders on a pro rata basis up to the amount of USDL outstanding on a 1:1 basis to US dollars. Such funds (up to the USDL outstanding amount) are not permitted to be paid to any other party including any creditor of Paxos International, nor is any USDL holder entitled to any additional yield in such an event.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No, Paxos International does not have any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>To our knowledge, Paxos International or the USDL product does not have any identified conflicts of interest with MakerDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International recommends consulting with a tax advisor regarding the potential tax implications associated with USDL.</p>\n<p><strong>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International believes that the relevant benchmark for USDL would be the risk-free rate for the US Dollar. The general market consensus is that the risk-free rate for the US Dollar is a zero-coupon US Treasury security, i.e., a one year (52-week) US Treasury Bill. This can be independently obtained via TreasuryDirect at <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/auction-query/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/auction-query/</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the launch of USDL, the APY on USDL has closely approximated the risk-free rate given the composition of the underlying reserves.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International has engaged Crowe MAK, a global audit, tax, advisory and risk firm to perform the monthly examination of USDL’s reserves in accordance with guidelines as set forth by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (“FSRA”) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (“ADGM”). Reports are issued monthly and posted to <a href=\"http://www.liftdollar.com/transparency\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lift Dollar (USDL) - Access Restricted</a>.</p>\n<p>Since inception, USDL’s APY has approximated 5%.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International has engaged Crowe MAK, a global audit, tax, advisory and risk firm to perform the monthly examination of USDL’s reserves in accordance with guidelines as set forth by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (“FSRA”) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (“ADGM”). Crowe is an independent-third party with both the knowledge and experience to perform the examination engagement.</p>\n<p>As part of Crowe’s monthly examinations, they ensure that the fair value and the amortized cost of the reserve assets is at equal to or greater than the total outstanding market capitalization of USDL at the time of the examination. Crowe’s examinations are performed in accordance with the standards set forth by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p>The USDL token is deployed on the Ethereum network and is centrally minted/burned by Paxos International. USDL and the associated smart contract provide yield through a daily rebasing mechanism. Rebasing is a technique used to adjust the supply of a token. The USDL smart contract uses rebasing, through a smart-contract multiplier, to distribute yield to eligible token holders. All eligible token balances increase based on the multiplier value.</p>\n<p>Deploying this smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain enables transparent and programmatic yield distribution. It also allows yield to be distributed to a large number of wallets regardless of the amount being distributed. Rebasing occurs at a set interval, for example, at the same time every day. Eligible token holders see their balance increase as a result of rebasing at these set time intervals. USDL is configured to rebase daily at launch, though this frequency could change in the future to address customer needs.</p>\n<p>For more information on the USDL technical implementation, please see our white paper at <a href=\"https://whitepaper.liftdollar.com/index.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://whitepaper.liftdollar.com/index.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>5. What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>The USDL smart contract is audited by both Certik and Trail of Bits to ensure that the code is sound and operates as intended. The most recent audits were completed in Q1 2024. Audits are publicly viewable on github <a href=\"https://github.com/paxosglobal/ybs-contract/tree/master/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/paxosglobal/ybs-contract/tree/master/audits</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos has previously worked on direct listings with platforms such Aave and Compound, as well as incentive programs with MakerDAO PSM.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The SparkDAO/MakerDAO allocation to USDL will help give these ecosystems direct access to competitive yield in a transparent and conservative manner. Due to USDL’s prudential oversight by the FSRA, USDL’s stablecoin reserves may only be held in the most secure and liquid assets which include cash deposits at regulated financial institutions, short-term US Government Securities and US Government Money Market Funds. Further, USDL’s reserves will be examined monthly by an independent third-party to ensure that USDL is adequately reserves. The results of this examination will be published monthly by Paxos International.</p>\n<p>In addition to tokenized assets such as USDL, onboarding to Paxos International will give SparkDAO/MakerDAO access to Paxos’ asset orchestration platform. This enables the seamless movement between stablecoins (including USDL, PYUSD, USDC, USDP, and USDT).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>USDL is relatively new but we plan to introduce integrations on platforms such as Morpho and Aave in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to USDL, Paxos is also the issuer of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>PAXG, a regulated tokenized gold product. With a market capitalization of ~$500M.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PYUSD, PayPal’s regulated stablecoin. Current market capitalization of $850M.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>We can offer a revenue share on the amount of PYUSD adopted by SparkDAO</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>USDP, Paxos’ original regulated stablecoin. Current market capitalization of $105M.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>We can offer a revenue share on the amount of USDP adopted by SparkDAO</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Paxos is open to partnerships and potential revenue sharing opportunities on these products as well. We also expect to tokenize other assets as the leading regulated tokenization for platforms like Paypal, and can explore future opportunities when they arise.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-paxos-international-usdl/25117\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-paxos-international-usdl/25117","pubDate":"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 22:03:44 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25117"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-paxos-international-usdl/25117.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Paxos International USDL"},"filter":false},{"title":"First Wave Integrator Program - FAQ","dc:creator":"Viridian","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Following on from the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/first-wave-integrator-program/24784\">First Wave Integrator Program</a> introductory post, this guide has been created by Viridian Advisors to assist applicants in understanding the details of the Accessibility Reward system.

Viridian Advisors acts as the Accessibility Reward Codes operator.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Who is eligible to apply ?</strong></p>\n<p>As Viridian Advisors, we are open to projects across the ecosystem including segments such as L1’s, L2’s, Wallets, Exchanges, dApps, and Consumer applications.</p>\n<p>Note that the final decisions regarding availability will be made by Sky Ecosystem Governance. The First Wave Integrator Program is in its early phases, and its rules will develop and become more comprehensive over time. We encourage applicants to contact us but note that eligibility and geographical restrictions will apply.</p>\n<p><strong>3) What’s the application process?</strong></p>\n<p>Applications should be made via the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/first-wave-integrator-program/24784\">First Wave Integrator Program</a> post in the Sky Ecosystem Governance forum or directly via the following <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScg-RZPJMy4hJI8f42Vsvqn947Ls9ZfNH5idLnCa2AyDnmy4g/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">google form</a>.</p>\n<p>All applications will be reviewed by Viridian Advisors on their individual merits against the program selection criteria and for those projects being considered for inclusion, the listed contact in the application process will be contacted by us to coordinate next steps. As noted above, final decisions regarding eligibility and participation in the program will be made by Sky Ecosystem Governance in a discretionary manner.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Will there be other Sky integrator programs beyond the First Wave program ?</strong></p>\n<p>It is expected that over time, the Sky Integrator Program will encompass more than just the First Wave Program. The final decisions in this respect belong to Sky Ecosystem Governance.</p>\n<p>As such, non-inclusion in the First Wave Integrator Program by Viridian Advisors does not exclude potential future inclusion in a Sky integrator program and future access to Accessibility Rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>5) What are the main rules ?</strong></p>\n<p>Integrators included in the program will be issued an Accessibility Reward Code, which will allow them to earn Accessibility Rewards on USDS balances that access the Sky protocol via the Integrator front ends or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The accessibility rewards are specified and maintained updated within the <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5.2_Accessibility_Reward-553ee681-dba2-4e2e-8bb8-2fc606989e88%7C8d5a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Accessibility Scope of the Atlas v2</a> ,</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the latest Sky Ecosystem Governance proposal update, Integrators earn a 0.4% annual adoption-based incentive on USDS balances held in the Sky Savings Rate or Sky Token Rewards features of the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<p>For USDS balances outside of the Sky Savings Rate or Sky Token Rewards, Integrators earn an annual adoption-based incentive fee equal to [Sky Savings Rate - 0.2%].</p>\n<p><strong>6) How are integrators selected ?</strong></p>\n<p>Projects will be initially reviewed by Viridian Advisors against criteria, including having an active and live product, community reach, segment focus and strategic alignment with the Sky money ecosystem.</p>\n<p>As Viridian Advisors, we will prioritize those Integrators who demonstrate commitment and the agility to integrate USDS in a timely manner following launch.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Are there any ongoing operational requirements for integrators ?</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5.2_Accessibility_Reward-553ee681-dba2-4e2e-8bb8-2fc606989e88%7C8d5a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Accessibility Scope of the Atlas v2</a>., governs accessibility efforts, including the Accessibility Reward system, and integrators should stay abreast of updates implemented by Sky Ecosystem Governance to this scope.</p>\n<p><strong>8) Are there any geographical or other restrictions for integrators ?</strong></p>\n<p>As a decentralized and permissionless protocol, the Sky Protocol itself, including the contracts for its native stablecoin, USDS, and native governance token, SKY, have no inherent jurisdictional restrictions.</p>\n<p>Integrator interfaces that serve as gateways to the Sky Protocol may implement access restrictions in light of any applicable regulatory considerations. However, these restrictions are specific to those interfaces and do not reflect any jurisdictional restrictions imposed by the Sky Protocol itself as the Sky Protocol is permissionless software that can be accessed via the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5.5_Location_Resilience-d788d60f-be4b-4b93-aa08-d3935081c8e4%7C8d5a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">location resilience article</a> within the Accessibility Scope defines the location-filtering rules applicable for integrator frontends that receive Accessibility Rewards. Any infringement to the restrictions in this article may result in the loss of access to Accessibility Rewards.</p>\n<p>While we expect the Atlas rules regarding Accessibility Rewards to be elaborated in the future, as Viridian Advisors, we will aim to accept participants who comply with the rules and requirements as specified in the Atlas. Participants based out of or serving customers in highly regulated or regulatorily uncertain countries will likely be excluded from participation. Feel free to clarify your regulatory position when applying to the program.</p>\n<p><strong>9) What are the technical integration requirements of the program ?</strong></p>\n<p>Integrators will need to support USDS via their front end or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>At least one of the USDS features of the Sky Protocol , i.e., USDS Unrewarded, USDS Savings or USDS Token Rewards will need to be integrated to qualify for receiving Accessibility Rewards.</p>\n<p>First Wave Program Integrators will be issued an Accessibility Reward Code, which will allow them to tag USDS balances and user transactions that access the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>10) What technical support is available for integration efforts ?</strong></p>\n<p>The technical developer documentation, available at <a href=\"https://docs.sky.money/developers/yFbKYQfnTPVv36vJZ3OK\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.sky.money/developers/yFbKYQfnTPVv36vJZ3OK</a> should be the first port of call.</p>\n<p>Additionally, for First Wave Program members, on a best effort basis, technical support can be provided by relevant Sky Ecosystem Actors.</p>\n<p><strong>11) What data (e.g., addresses, reports, metrics) needs to be tracked/provided ?</strong></p>\n<p>All Integrators should provide an Ethereum address for receiving their Accessibility Reward.</p>\n<p>In cases where custodial addresses exist for USDS and/or sUSDS balances, they should be provided.</p>\n<p>Transactions calling the relevant contracts of the Sky Protocol for USDS Savings and for USDS Token Rewards should be tagged with the Accessibility Reward Code issued to the Integrator.</p>\n<p>Where on-chain monitoring is not viable, off-chain reports / metrics may be requested, such as aggregated user balances for USDS.</p>\n<p>At the time of issuance of the Accessibility Reward Code, the exact data to be provided for monitoring purposes will be reviewed and confirmed with each integrator.</p>\n<p><strong>12) How are transactions tagged with the Accessibility Reward Code ?</strong></p>\n<p>Integrators should tag USDS Savings and USDS Token Rewards Transactions with their unique Accessibility Reward Code as per the following links;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>USDS Savings contract ( <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sdai/blob/7014ce105f88f1d0b1ff2c190c135342e0d7da8d/src/SUsds.sol#L352\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a> )</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>USDS Token Rewards contract ( <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/endgame-toolkit/blob/1e419c6d0a4287ff6d04c7c7cc68bfa6442d076f/src/synthetix/StakingRewards.sol#L110\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a> )</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>13) Is the First Wave Program available Multichain (i.e., beyond Ethereum Mainnet) ?</strong></p>\n<p>Initially the First Wave Program will only launch on mainnet, and accessibility rewards for USDS on other domains can only be credited to the Reward Code holder of any qualifying bridge contract.</p>\n<p>Once Skylink launches and supports other domains, starting with L2’s, Accessibility Rewards will be available directly for L2 and other domain integrators, since Skylink infra will facilitate the tracking of individual integrator activity on other domains.</p>\n<p><strong>14) How long is the process to be approved for the program ?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no defined or limiting timeframes, neither for application nor for processing, although best efforts will be made to respond to all applicants in a timely manner and for the processing of Accessibility Reward Codes.</p>\n<p>The program should be considered as ongoing and continuous and also subject to change over time via Sky Ecosystem Governance updates to the <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5_The_Accessibility_Scope-9e3f76e6-3343-4e70-af0b-c914be2e8d5a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Accessibility Scope</a> in the Atlas.</p>\n<p><strong>15) How are accessibility rewards calculated and received ?</strong></p>\n<p>Accessibility rewards are calculated on a monthly basis based on the rates defined within the <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5.2_Accessibility_Reward-553ee681-dba2-4e2e-8bb8-2fc606989e88%7C8d5a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Accessibility Scope of the Atlas v2</a> ;</p>\n<p>Rewards will be calculated and published by Viridian Advisors using available on chain data of USDS and/or sUSDS balances , as well as Accessibility Reward Code tagged transactions. Where applicable off-chain reports and data may also be used.</p>\n<p>Integrator rewards will be disbursed by the Accessibility Scope Facilitator to the Ethereum wallet corresponding to the registered Integrator, subject to approval from Sky Ecosystem Governance.</p>\n<p>Note that the rules are subject to change as the program evolves. Any detected unwanted behavior to misuse the program may cause exclusion from the program without notice, or refusal to pay out the rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>16) Can an Accessibility Reward Code be pre-issued to facilitate integration efforts prior to inclusion in the program?</strong></p>\n<p>In some cases, where inclusion in the First Wave Program may be delayed, an accessibility reward code may be pre-issued to allow integrators to proceed with their integration efforts and so allow for the retroactive calculation of Accessibility Rewards when and if inclusion in the program is eventually approved.</p>\n<p>In such cases, the issuance of an Accessibility Reward Code should not be interpreted as an inclusion to receive Accessibility Rewards, which will only be disbursed following approval into the program and based on the Participant lists published on the Sky Ecosystem Governance forum.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/first-wave-integrator-program-faq/25115\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/first-wave-integrator-program-faq/25115","pubDate":"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 06:04:01 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25115"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/first-wave-integrator-program-faq/25115.rss","#text":"First Wave Integrator Program - FAQ"},"filter":false},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Cogito Finance TFUND","dc:creator":"Kenneth246","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<p><strong>I.

The Company is registered with CIMA pursuant to section 4(3) of the Mutual Funds Act.</p>\n<p>The SPC is a separate legal entity and fully bankruptcy-remote from the remaining Cogito legal structure.</p>\n<p>Per Cayman regulations, please also note that TFUND is not available to investors from the following jurisdictions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OFAC Sanctions List</li>\n<li>United States</li>\n<li>The People’s Republic of China</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>The regulatory body that oversees TFUND is the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA)</p>\n<p><strong>What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Cogito holds a mutual fund license from CIMA and is not required to have a VASP license.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cogito-finance_tokenization-activity-7150474249059606529-KvYE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Announcement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/cogito-shakes-the-market-with-groundbreaking-rwa-ai-financial-products\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cointelegraph</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>TFUND is issued under a Cayman Segregated Portfolio Company (Ergo Sum SPC), regulated by CIMA. A Segregated Portfolio company can create several segregated portfolios which legally separate the assets and liabilities from each other, therefore protecting assets from liabilities of other portfolios.</p>\n<p>At this stage, Ergo Sum SPC only manages one segregated portfolio, TFUND (Treasury SP). Any new products launched by Cogito would be offered through a separate segregated portfolio.</p>\n<p>Ergo Sum SPC is a standalone legal entity which is separate from Cogito’s legal structure and therefore, bankruptcy remote.</p>\n<p><strong>What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>As a licensed product under CIMA, TFUND tokenholders have voluntary redemption and repurchase rights. TFUND tokens can be redeemed for USDC, or USDT through the Cogito platform.</p>\n<p>Investors are required to sign a subscription agreement prior to their purchase of TFUND. This document is accessible through Cogito’s onboarding process and contractual rights outlined in the agreement are applicable to all parties.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>None</p>\n<p><strong>Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>None</p>\n<p><strong>Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>There is no tax imposed on returns of the TFUND as it is registered in the Cayman Islands.

Whitelisted addresses are stored onchain in a separate smart contract that can be updated independently of the fund contract. Token transfers may only occur to and from whitelisted addresses.</p>\n<p>Subscription and redemption requests are made to the vault contract. Once the investor completes the offchain processes, the Cogito team will approve the investor’s subscription or redemption transaction and transfer stablecoins to or from the vault contract. For compliance purposes, the Cogito team is able to mint, burn, and transfer investor tokens according to the terms of the PPM.</p>\n<p>Token holders earn a return by holding TFUND, where the token price is expected to increase in value over time. That change in token price directly reflects the returns generated by the underlying portfolio held by the Fund.</p>\n<p>The TFUND token price is calculated as the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per token. The token price can be derived by dividing the NAV of the Fund by the total outstanding supply of TFUND. The TFUND token price was launched with a default value of 1.00.</p>\n<p>The TFUND Vault will use multisig and require multiple private keys, including the Fund’s independent third-party fund manager to authorize and sign off on transactions involving onchain assets. The use of on-ramp and off-ramp services will also be limited to authorized representatives from the Cogito team via multisig operations. Off-chain assets, meanwhile, are held on the Fund’s regulated custodians’ platforms, and all actions initiated by any one core team member will require checking and confirmation by another core team member to be authorized. In addition, the Fund’s independent fund manager will have oversight and governance control over all fund movements involving on-chain and off-chain assets held by the Fund. Even in the event of a smart contract breach or a hack, almost all of the TFUND Vault assets are held with regulated custodians at any given time</p>\n<p><strong>What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>Cogito has successfully undergone a code security assessment for TFUND by <a href=\"https://salusec.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Salus Security</a> on August, 2024</p>\n<p>Salus is a research-oriented security and zk firm, partners of the Binance ecosystem and has a track record of securing over 200 projects with zero exploits.

However, under the previous compensation system, the following rule applied:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h6>2.6.3.4.1</h6>\n<p>An AD buffer stops accumulating when it contains 3 months of an AD’s budget. If an AD with 3 months of PD budget in their buffer moves from PD to RD, their buffer is not reduced but it does not continue to accumulate until it contains less than 3 months of RD budget.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a result, their buffer won’t be reduced, but they won’t continue accumulating funds. We’ll also maintain the restriction limiting their buffer usage to that of a reserve delegate since they haven’t contributed to the Atlas work during August. Next month, everyone will be able to access their buffer contents because we will transition to the new compensation system.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/aligned_delegates\">@Aligned_Delegates</a></p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/august-2024-aligned-delegate-payment-requests/25109\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/august-2024-aligned-delegate-payment-requests/25109","pubDate":"Mon, 16 Sep 2024 17:21:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25109"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/august-2024-aligned-delegate-payment-requests/25109.rss","#text":"August 2024 Aligned Delegate Payment Requests"},"filter":false},{"title":"Sky Organizational Structure","dc:creator":"Shiko","category":"New to MakerDAO","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-98970-sky-organizational-structure-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98970-sky-organizational-structure-1\"></a>Sky Organizational Structure</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/b/6b3443e94d221a67ccea0d834e207a67aa9a4e61.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fin4af8EBtYUyd17PVYrzOfsdgZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"Org chart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/b/6b3443e94d221a67ccea0d834e207a67aa9a4e61_2_690x497.png\" alt=\"Org chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"fin4af8EBtYUyd17PVYrzOfsdgZ\" width=\"690\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/b/6b3443e94d221a67ccea0d834e207a67aa9a4e61_2_690x497.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/b/6b3443e94d221a67ccea0d834e207a67aa9a4e61.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/b/6b3443e94d221a67ccea0d834e207a67aa9a4e61.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F5F5\"></a></div><br>\nIllustration of the high-level roles in Sky<p></p>\n<p>Notable context:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anyone can submit a proposal.

Product Information</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product:</strong> USYC earns short-term risk-free rate returns. Our clients, upon successfully completing KYC/AML, can instantly mint and redeem USYC into their whitelisted wallets 24/7 from USDC and PYUSD. USYC can also be minted and redeemed into USDT and fiat. The token is available as Ethereum ERC20, NEAR, BASE and will soon be integrated with Axelar.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset:</strong> USYC is the on-chain representation of Hashnote’s regulated International Short Duration Yield Fund (iSDYF). iSDYF uses its prime broker Marex and custodian BNY Mellon to invest cash into overnight reverse-repo to ensure minimised market risk, duration risk, and credit risk. Whether the investor chooses to purchase with fiat or stablecoin, the amount of USYC the investor receives is equal to the deposit amount divided by the current price of USYC. Hashnote mints into the investor’s wallet an amount of USYC tokens equivalent to the number of shares the investor has in the iSDYF.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong> We update the price of the token daily to reflect the yield that has been earned overnight.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong> Hashnote International Short Duration Yield Fund Ltd (iSDYF), a mutual fund providing the USYC product, is domiciled in the Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p>It is managed by its investment manager, Hasnote Management LLC, a United States limited liability company formed in Delaware.</p>\n<p>We adhere to strict regulations, ensuring our operations meet institutional investment standards.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong> Our PPM permits investment into T Bills but currently we only invest into reverse repo.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong> No we don’t do any hedging; however, reverse repo can be described as a derivative product.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc).

Hashnote will accept PUYSD, USDT, USDC or fiat as subscription and redemption assets. Upon acceptance as MakerDAO collateral, Hashnote will make DAI a redemption asset.</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong> We aim to enable instant, 24/7 minting and redemption of USYC into more stablecoins. USYC stands out from the rest of the tokenized RWAs as it finds its application across the digital asset ecosystem as a whole. As a treasury management tool and an alternative to holding stablecoins we are already backing the<a href=\"https://usual.money/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Usual</a> stablecoin. As a collateral token used by custodians, centralised and decentralised exchanges, USYC boosts liquidity and collateral efficiency for trading, borrowing, and lending. To expand its reach, we are forming new partnerships, bridging to more chains, and adding market makers. By 2025, we plan to be available on multiple venues and currently adding more market makers.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98951-iv-legal-structure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98951-iv-legal-structure-4\"></a>IV.

Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong> Here’s a summary of the USYC infrastructure, which focuses on scalability, security, and compliance:</p>\n<p><em>On-Chain Overview:</em></p>\n<p>Flexible smart contracts allow for upgrades, with key functions like minting, burning, and managing the Entitlements securely controlled by Hashnote to maintain compliance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entitlements Investors who pass KYC/AML checks have their wallet addresses receive entitlements, enabling them to interact with USYC. Entitlements are the gatekeepers to most of the functionality of USYC. The wallets associated with KYC’ed entities receive a Role that entitles them to mint, hold, transfer, and burn the token.The USYC Smart Contracts queries the Entitlements contract to verify the caller of a transaction has the appropriate permissions to perform a transaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to checking that a wallet is permissioned, the Entitlements contract also performs OFAC sanctions checks by querying an on-chain oracle for matches to sanctioned addresses. The oracle is maintained by<a href=\"https://go.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-oracle-docs.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Chainalysis</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minting &amp; Burning Hashnote mints new USYC tokens when investors subscribe manually (via Fiat or stables). Investors can burn their tokens or submit a request to Hashnote to initiate redemption.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tellers offer 24/7 subscriptions and redemption capability. Redemptions are subject to liquidity (see Teller section for more details)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transfers &amp; Oracle USYC tokens can be transferred between whitelisted addresses, and asset prices are regularly updated via an Oracle feed.

What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong> Hashnote has engaged several independent auditors to review our smart contracts. The audits have been completed by Sentnl and ChainSafe as well as an independent security researcher Anton Cheng.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98951-vi-makerdao-ecosystem-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98951-vi-makerdao-ecosystem-6\"></a>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong> We submitted an <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/usyc-mip6-collateral-application-hashnote-s-us-yield-coin/25050\">application to MakerDao</a> offering USYC instead of <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/wbtc-changes-and-risk-mitigation-10-august-2024/24844\">WBTC</a> addressing the community’s risk concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong> Hashnote is approaching Maker with longevity and stability and mind, and we believe that introducing Hashnote USYC is fully aligned with “<a href=\"https://endgame.makerdao.com/endgame/overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Endgame Plan</a>” proposed by Rune Christensen.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrating Hashnote USYC supports this strategy by increasing the share of Real-World Assets (RWA) as collateral, thereby reducing dependence on USDC and significantly improving the profit and loss margin of MakerDAO. <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/centrifuge-maker-a-partner-s-view-of-real-world-assets/17439\">Dai can best scale its usage and maintain its peg by issuing against non-correlated, yield bearing, and reliable assets. </a></li>\n<li>A strategic partnership with Hashnote expands Maker growth opportunities by tapping into a larger and more stable addressable market: professional and institutional crypto investors and tradfi community alike. Unlike other yield-bearing tokens, Hashnote USYC use-case goes beyond treasury management savings vehicle. USYC is designed and is growing to be the universally accepted collateral token accepted by centralised and decentralised exchanges as well as lending and custody providers and further down the line should be introduced to venues like CME to further enhance collateral efficiency in the tradfi space.</li>\n<li>Through this strategic partnership, Hashnote community and its stakeholders are likely to be attracted to Spark, which would <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600\">positively impact the growth of SparkLend</a>. Hashnote is actively working on launching multiple lending products in collaboration with centralised venues, attracting professional investors and large institutional clients. We anticipate that this will bring a similar user base to the MakerDAO ecosystem, positioning it as a gateway into DeFi for users who haven’t explored DeFi yet.</li>\n<li>Hashnote fully addresses and safeguards the concerns of the Maker community while ensuring legal recognition of their assets. The Hashnote team comes with extensive experience in traditional finance and aims to leverage the transparency and credibility offered by blockchain technology to bridge the gap between on-chain and off-chain asset representations.</li>\n<li>With Hashnote’s expertise in tokenization, Maker Governance can gain a powerful gateway to engage in “real-world” activities. We fully agree that DeFi requires a foundational layer of collateral anchored to more stable, secular supply and demand dynamics, and RWAs are a crucial step toward achieving this vision.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong> Morpho is a lending protocol that enhances capital efficiency by optimising yields on lending pools. Hashnote USYC serves as <a href=\"https://app.morpho.org/vault?vault=0xbEEF02e5E13584ab96848af90261f0C8Ee04722a&amp;network=mainnet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">collateral</a> on the Morpho platform for the <a href=\"https://www.steakhouse.financial/projects/usyc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Steakhouse PYUSD vault</a>, making it the key venue for borrowing and lending PYUSD on Ethereum mainnet and offering one of the most efficient environments for PYUSD lending.</p>\n<p>This partnership allows users to earn higher yields compared to traditional DeFi lending protocols by leveraging the stability and potential returns of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs). Additionally, the collaboration attracts institutional clients to DeFi by combining Morpho’s efficient lending mechanisms with Hashnote’s regulated, tokenized products, providing a strong value proposition for large-scale investors.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong> Yes, Hashnote is a diversified asset manager that continuously launches new products.

Company Details</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Company description</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Spiko</strong> is a Paris-based startup building and operating a platform for issuing, managing, and distributing tokenized funds. Spiko aims to become the foremost financial market infrastructure, enabling the native issuance and management of all types of financial instruments on blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>Throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024, Spiko spearheaded and oversaw the project that led to the launch of the first Ethereum-native USD- and EUR-denominated Money Market Funds (MMFs) approved in the European Union. Shares of the Spiko MMFs, launched to the public in mid-June 2024, are exclusively issued as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks.</p>\n<p>Three months after their launch, the Spiko MMFs have amassed $92M in assets under management, handled $135M in investment and redemption flows, and generated over $300K in interest. Consequently, Spiko has quickly become one of the leading tokenizers of T-Bills, with its tokenized MMFs experiencing the fastest growth in the sector in recent weeks (<a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocols/RWA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">source</a>).</p>\n<p>Spiko developed and maintains the transfer agent software used to manage the Spiko MMFs on-chain. The Funds are distributed by <strong>Spiko Finance</strong>, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spiko that is regulated as an investment adviser in France.</p>\n<p>Both Spiko and Spiko Finance are French simplified join-stock companies (<em>société par actions simplifiée</em> or “SAS” under French law). The Spiko SICAV, which is the legal entity that issues and manages the Spiko MMFs, is completely separate from Spiko and Spiko Finance. The Spiko SICAV is owned by token holders, with each token representing a share in the Spiko MMFs.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/f/4f4afb12c4bc68b4ad974ebe67d7a3df10cc08bc.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bjsmFIKGFjiRba4rnZzzSBECnfe.png?dl=1\" title=\"1.

Product Information</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Describe the product</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund is a sub-fund of the Spiko SICAV.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SICAV\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SICAV</a> (which stands for “Société d’Investissement à Capital Variable”) is a European investment fund structure akin to a U.S. open-end mutual fund, allowing investors to subscribe to and redeem shares while the fund’s assets are professionally managed.</p>\n<p>Incorporated in France under French law, the Spiko SICAV currently manages two sub-funds approved by the French Financial Markets Authority (<a href=\"https://www.amf-france.org/en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Autorité des Marchés Financiers</a>) as short-term variable net asset value MMFs under the UCITS Directive (Directive 2009/65/EC) and the MMF Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1131).</p>\n<p>UCITS (which stands for “Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities”) funds are the European Union’s equivalent to U.S. mutual funds. Before a UCITS can be marketed to investors, its prospectus must be approved by a national competent authority of the European Union. This process is similar to that of a mutual fund’s approval by the SEC in the United States.</p>\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund is the world’s first public money market fund whose shares (USTBL) are natively issued as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. <em>N.B.: in this context, ‘public,’ as opposed to ‘private,’ means that the Fund is approved for distribution to the general public, including retail (i.e. non-professional, non-accredited or non-qualified) investors.</em></p>\n<p>The Fund’s prospectus references the smart contract that officially serves as the shareholder register: 0xe4880249745eAc5F1eD9d8F7DF844792D560e750. As a result, the blockchain acts  as the definitive source of truth for the shareholder register, rather than simply being an on-chain copy of a separate centralized database. The Fund’s shares (USTBL) can be custodied at investors’ discretion using any wallet technology compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the key characteristics of the Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th><strong>Spiko US T-Bills MMF (USTBL)</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ISIN</strong></td>\n<td>FR001400ODM9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bloomberg ticker</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPKUSMM:FP\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SPKUSMM</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Currency</strong></td>\n<td>$ USD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Type of fund</strong></td>\n<td>UCITS short-term VNAV Money Market Fund under EU law</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fund domicile</strong></td>\n<td>France</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>National competent authority</strong></td>\n<td>French Financial Markets Authority (<a href=\"https://www.amf-france.org/en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AMF</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Legal structure</strong></td>\n<td>SICAV</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Investment policy</strong></td>\n<td>T-Bills issued by the U.S. Treasury</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Benchmark</strong></td>\n<td>Effective Federal Funds Rate (<a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EFFR</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Maximum weighted average maturity</strong></td>\n<td>60 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Use of income</strong></td>\n<td>Accumulating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fees</strong></td>\n<td>Management fees: 0.30% (per annum, deducted daily on a prorata basis).

Investors’ funds are fully safeguarded from the risk of Twenty First Capital’s bankruptcy. If Twenty First Capital were to go bankrupt, the Spiko SICAV would seek a new asset manager to take over the management of the Fund.

It must also ensure that, in the event of its own insolvency or that of any of its sub-custodians, the UCITS assets held in custody are ring-fenced, meaning they are protected from being used to satisfy the creditors of the depositary or its sub-custodians.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bankruptcy of CACEIS Fund Administration (Valuator)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event of CACEIS Fund Administration’s bankruptcy, the Spiko SICAV would appoint a new fund valuator.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bankruptcy of PricewaterhouseCoopers (Auditor)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event of PwC’s bankruptcy, the Spiko SICAV would appoint a new fund auditor.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><em><strong>What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>USTBL are shares of the Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund.</p>\n<p>Ownership of USTBL confers voting rights at Spiko SICAV’s general shareholders’ meeting.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Investors in the Spiko MMFs include numerous Web3 for-profits and non-profits that use USTBL and/or EUTBL to earn daily returns at the USD or EUR risk-free rate on their treasury holdings, and manage on/off-ramps between traditional banking and modern blockchain rails.

USTBL is operated by top-tier financial services firms, with assets held with the world’s largest custodians. Owning a portfolio of T-Bills held in custody, rather than being exposed to the counterparty risk of an issuer (whether it’s a stablecoin issuer or an SPV), would be valuable for the Sky ecosystem. Importantly, USTBL is also completely insulated from crypto market dynamics because the Fund does not hold crypto-assets on its balance sheet. For instance, USTBL is entirely shielded from the risk of a stablecoin depegging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Secondly, <strong>USTBL would provide the Sky ecosystem with exceptional legal protection and regulatory clarity on its reserves</strong>. USTBL is a regulated product, approved in the largest asset management jurisdiction in continental Europe, and governed by some of the most protective investor rules globally (e.g. the UCITS Directive and the MMF Regulation). USTBL is authorized for public distribution, ensuring the highest level of disclosure through a prospectus that cannot be modified without the regulator’s approval. Importantly, USTBL is also issued in a jurisdiction that recognizes  blockchains (incl. public ones such as Ethereum) as the primary source of truth for the shareholder register.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thirdly, <strong>USTBL would provide the Sky ecosystem with oversight and voting rights in the governance of the tokenized T-Bills held in its reserves</strong>. Sky would indeed have voting rights at the Spiko SICAV’s general shareholders’ meeting in proportion to its USTBL holdings. Besides, a representative from the Sky ecosystem could join the board of the SICAV issuing USTBL if elected by the general assembly of shareholders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, <strong>UTSBL would grant Sky direct access to the issuer of a key asset in its reserves for subscriptions and redemptions in both fiat (USD) and stablecoins (USDC, USDT, USDS)</strong>. USTBL are minted or burned once per business day around 10:30 AM CET at the previous day’s NAV.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><em><strong>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Currently, USTBL (as well as EUTBL, our EUR-denominated tokenized MMF) is held in the treasury of many Web3 organizations but are not yet integrated into DeFi protocols.

Describe the underlying asset</h3>\n<p>The Fund will seek to provide a liquid, low risk portfolio through exposure to U.S Treasury Bills (T-bills) with maturities of between 0-3 months. The portfolio is carefully structured to manage yield curve, duration, and liquidity risks.</p>\n<p>T-Bills are highly rated short-term debt securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, with maturities of up to one year. They are widely recognized as one of the safest investment vehicles due to their high credit quality supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Furthermore, interest rate risk and volatility are low due to the short-term maturity of the instrument.</p>\n<p>The fund started with a portfolio T-bills with maturities of between 0-6 months.

This daily accrual ensures that the token price accurately represents the cumulative interest earned by the underlying T-Bill portfolio.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-4-what-is-the-jurisdiction-of-the-issuer-and-key-entities-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-4-what-is-the-jurisdiction-of-the-issuer-and-key-entities-10\"></a>4.

Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</h3>\n<p>The Fund is established as a BVI professional fund. This legal structure provides the best possible investor protection of any tokenized treasury product currently available. It is the same legal structure used by Blackrock, although that offering has been adapted to be open to US investors while Anemoy is exclusively offshore to avoid potential regulatory risk from the SEC or other US regulators.</p>\n<p>The BVI professional fund structure provides direct recourse for investors to the segregated and ring-fenced assets of the Liquid Treasury Fund (i.e., US T-Bills and USD cash) in case of liquidation of the Fund.</p>\n<p>Importantly, this direct recourse is <em><strong>enshrined in law</strong></em> rather than a mere contractual right.</p>\n<p>This structure is more advantageous for investors than other tokenized treasury products such as SPV/debt offerings or exempt US 3(c)(7) funds.</p>\n<p>In the case of products structured as debt offerings issued by an SPV, the investors have no exclusive claim to the assets and will need to prove their claim as against other potential creditors such as tax and other governmental authorities that may have priority. Moreover, as the investors do not have a perfected security interest in the treasuries, the claim may be challenged in court causing an extended timeline for recovery of potentially many years.</p>\n<p>In the case of a 3(c)(7) fund, unlike a BVI fund, this is an exempt offering with no oversight by any regulatory authority.

Describe the technical implementation of your product</h3>\n<p>The Centrifuge protocol has a few key components:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Asset-level tokenization</strong>: Centrifuge asset pools are made up of individually tokenized real-world assets. This supports a range of asset types, from Treasury bills such as with the LTF pool, to real-estate assets such as the New Silver pool and ABS such as BlockTower, to any other asset. The asset-level tokenization enables a deep level of transparency and automated reporting for funds building on Centrifuge.<br>\n<strong>2. Liquidity pools</strong>: For each asset pool, there can be liquidity pools, deployed on multiple blockchain networks, and with multiple assets. Today, LTF is live on Ethereum, Base and Celo (more coming), and supports USDC and FRAX. Through this architecture, other assets including USDS can easily be added.<br>\n<strong>3. ERC-7540 support</strong>: Each liquidity pool is fully compliant with the recently finalized asynchronous version of ERC-4626. This standardizes asynchronous investments and redemptions, perfect for RWAs. On top of this, features can be built such as automated allocation management across asset classes, or automated redemptions.</p>\n<p>Each fund share is tokenized as a standard ERC-20 token, with transfer restrictions built in (based on the ERC-1404 standard). The restrictions are managed by the fund administrator and stored onchain in a member list contract.</p>\n<p>Onchain smart contracts are also used for the entire flow-of-funds, ensuring that funds can only be transferred between investors, the Centrifuge protocol, and the fund’s on/off-ramp accounts.</p>\n<p>The price of the ERC-20 token is based on an onchain NAV calculation, which uses the asset-level tokenization to aggregate the prices from the individual assets. The prices are set directly by the fund administrator. Soon, Chronicle will also launch the RWA oracle for the LTF token, which will add additional third-party verification to the NAV &amp; onchain prices.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-38\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-38\"></a>5.

This capability can be harnessed for advanced reporting within the Sky ecosystem, automating liquidity management, and integrating directly with Atlas components, such as onchain Asset-Liability Management structures.</li>\n<li><strong>Active Ecosystem Contributor</strong>: As an active partner within the Web3 space and a long-standing contributor to DeFi, Centrifuge is well-positioned to support the development and success of the Sky ecosystem. Whether through smart contracts, backend infrastructure, or user interfaces, we are committed to using our technical resources and domain expertise to augment and strengthen the capabilities of Sky’s RWA SubDAO/Star initiatives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We already have active partnerships with key participants in the ecosystem, such as Chronicle Labs, Ankura Trust Company, and many of the third-party RWA service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Centrifuge as a Product Partner</strong></p>\n<p>Centrifuge is uniquely capable and familiar with building products alongside not only DAOs, but specifically with Sky. This deep experience positions us as the ideal partner to craft RWA related products, features, and internal systems that align with the goals of Sky.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We are fully committed to dedicating Centrifuge’s resources—including our legal, marketing, business development, product, and engineering teams—to these efforts.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Lucas Vogelsang, Centrifuge</em></p>\n<p>When developing new products, our focus is on key objectives: increasing demand for DAI/USDS, enhancing utility for DAI/USDS, and growing the SparkLend user base. Leveraging our team of domain experts and strong relationships across both DeFi and traditional finance sectors, we bring these products to market in sustainable and impactful ways. Our goal is to create solutions that not only address immediate needs but also foster long-term growth and stability within the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Below are a series of proposals that we would like to develop with Sky/Spark, this includes:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Proposal</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Function</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>PSM INTEGRATION TO SUPPORT RWA TOKENS</td>\n<td>Centrifuge proposes an enhanced “PSM-like” structure that allows RWA tokens to be swapped for DAI/USDS at the current market price minus a fee. This structure would provide users with instant liquidity, enabling any holder to immediately access DAI or USDS, or convert their DAI/USDS into RWA tokens. By integrating this feature, Centrifuge could significantly enhance liquidity and flexibility within the Sky ecosystem, making it easier for users to interact with real-world assets.</td>\n<td>Add DAI/USDS utility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DAI/USDS ENABLED SUBSCRIPTIONS AND REDEMPTIONS</td>\n<td>Enable DAI/USDS for all Centrifuge subscription and redemption activities, streamlining the process for users to engage with RWAs. This feature would simplify transactions within the ecosystem, further integrating DAI/USDS into the broader financial operations of real-world asset management.</td>\n<td>Add DAI/USDS utility and grow demand</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DIVERSIFIED YIELD SOURCES FOR sDAI (RWA sDAI 2.0)</td>\n<td>Introduce a revamped version of the sDAI savings product, which blends yields from both liquid and illiquid RWA products. This new product, designed with institutional buyers in mind, would be KYC-compliant, allowing Sky to tap into a different segment of capital that requires regulated investment avenues. By expanding the yield offerings in a sustainable and diversified manner, Centrifuge could drive increased demand for DAI/USDS, particularly among institutional investors.</td>\n<td>Grow demand for DAI/USDS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sDAI TERM BONDS</td>\n<td>Offer a savings-like structure that locks DAI/USDS for a specified duration, providing a higher yield in return. sDAI Term Bonds would drive demand for DAI/USDS by offering users an attractive, secure investment option with a fixed term. This product would not only diversify the savings options available within the Sky ecosystem but also ensure a steady demand for DAI/USDS over a longer period.</td>\n<td>Grow demand for DAI/USDS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RWA INTEGRATIONS WITH SPARKLEND</td>\n<td>Following the success of our Morpho deployment, we propose bringing both similar and unique products to SparkLend to integrate with consumer facing fintechs, and allow Spark to collateralize DAI/USDS with higher yielding assets indirectly through lending markets that otherwise may be too volatile to directly hold. This accomplishes all three of the key objectives and attributes TVL to SparkLend itself.</td>\n<td>Grow SparkLend user base, add DAI/USDS utility, and grow DAI/USDS demand</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Through these product offerings, Centrifuge aims to elevate the Sky/Spark ecosystems by integrating real-world assets in ways that are efficient, transparent, and aligned with the long-term goals of both Sky/Spark and its users. Our commitment to leveraging our extensive experience and resources ensures that these products are not just theoretical but can be successfully implemented to drive meaningful value for the entire ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-42\"></a>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</h3>\n<p>Centrifuge has been a leading force within the industry for RWA integrations, consistently at the forefront of DeFi capabilities. We were the first to launch a tokenized integration with DeFi with the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/rwa-market-recap/10888\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWA Market</a> back in 2021. Our latest lending market with Morpho, launched in collaboration with other RWA providers, exemplifies our continued commitment to structuring institutional RWA DeFi arrangements onchain.</p>\n<p>Some highlights of our integration work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Morpho Market</strong>: Our <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/08/27/tokenization-pioneer-centrifuge-unveils-lending-market-with-morpho-coinbase/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWA Lending Market on Morpho</a> represents a groundbreaking deal in DeFi, bringing together a range of technologies from tokenization to identity verification, a mix of RWA providers and assets, and a mix of ecosystem capabilities covering L2 <strong>networks</strong>, externalized risk curation, and DeFi primitives. Built on Coinbase’s Base Layer-2 network, this market allows for the seamless collateralization of RWAs for borrowing. What sets it apart from other efforts in this field is its ability to provide compliant, reliable yield and asset opportunities, in a secure package that appeals to institutional and retail users alike. Built into the market are Coinbase Verifications, a KYC checker built into the Base network, that gate-keep U.S and sanctioned users from lending into the market. This is the first use-case for Verifications in DeFi, furthering the institutional case for finance on smart contract rails.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Morpho and Centrifuge integration exemplifies the best our industry has to offer. It successfully combines all of the technologies that we’ve been working for years to bring together - real-world assets, decentralized lending, onchain identity, smart accounts, and open risk curation - it really is the future of finance.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Paul Frambot, Morpho</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trident Trust</strong>: Our latest <a href=\"https://centrifuge.mirror.xyz/pn5NlZ5UY5pdtOy_FFZ1cNWr0Dn1QBk2yCeJ6ZXQQoc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fund management platform</a> is designed to offer a total solution for credit funds, that seamlessly integrates onchain and offchain data into a unified control panel. Our integration with Trident Trust, an industry leading fund administrator, underscores our <strong>platform’s</strong> ability to automate reporting, streamline operations, and enhance transparency, making it easier for asset managers to transition to onchain finance. With an integration pipeline that covers custodians, other fund administrators, and more third-parties, our fund management platform is how Centrifuge unlocks transparency and operational efficiencies and brings it to the market.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We’re excited to work with Anemoy to build one of the first tokenized, regulated funds that maintains an onchain record of portfolio data and net asset valuations. This increases transparency while streamlining typically burdensome reporting and reconciliation processes.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— David Mungall, Trident Trust</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chronicle</strong>: The Chronicle RWA oracle has been integrated to provide the most credibly verifiable and transparent price feeds for assets on the Centrifuge platform. Our integration <strong>creates</strong> verifiability, not just into the total NAV of the fund, but to the entire portfolio of the fund, including granular asset-level details. This enables stakeholders to continuously track, in a trustless manner, the full movements of cash from the onchain USDS and USDC holdings, to offchain cash balances, to the detailed list of holdings at the LTF’s custodian. This creates a level of transparency that is groundbreaking for RWAs in DeFi.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Our partnership with Centrifuge and Anemoy demonstrates how decentralized oracles can bring a new level of trust and transparency to real-world assets. With Chronicle’s RWA Oracle, investors gain an unopinionated, verifiable view of the LTF, improving their confidence in the asset’s security and stability.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Nik Kunkel, Chronicle</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Archax</strong>: Anemoy has entered into an agreement to integrate LTF in the institutional platform of Archax. Archax is the first ever digital securities exchange regulated by the FCA in London. <strong>Targeted</strong> at institutions, Archax institutional clients will be able to access LTF in the first distribution partnership undertaken by Anemoy. Archax also has its FCA brokerage, custody and crypto permissions.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We are thrilled to be working with Anemoy, Centrifuge and Janus Henderson to offer our users access to tokenized treasury bills. This collaboration reflects our ongoing mission to integrate real-world assets into the onchain ecosystem, empowering our users to diversify their portfolios with institutional-grade products.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Simon Barnby, Archax</em></p>\n<p>We are excited to continue building on this work with Sky. We believe only the Centrifuge platform has proven the capability to unlock RWA and DeFi at a deep foundational level, and our work with our integration partners proves so.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-4-do-you-offer-or-plan-to-offer-other-products-that-could-be-appropriate-for-spark-or-other-subdaos-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-4-do-you-offer-or-plan-to-offer-other-products-that-could-be-appropriate-for-spark-or-other-subdaos-43\"></a>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Centrifuge is proud to share that we have lined up several product opportunities that are a strong fit for the Spark portfolio.</p>\n<p>These products are rooted in our experience with the Maker/Spark ecosystem, with a deep understanding of Spark’s preferred risk tolerances, and aligned around partnerships that accentuate</p>\n<p>In the supplementary documents sent privately to the submissions panel, we offer two new funds specifically tailored to the future investment objectives of Spark.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AAA Highly Liquid Bond Fund targeting returns in excess of Treasuries</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BBB+ Enhanced-Yield Public Credit Fund targeting higher returns for more diversification along the risk curve</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These funds aim to offer forward-looking solutions that help Spark navigate a volatile rate environment and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our objective is to position Spark to capitalize on potential market dislocations over the next 12 to 36 months, and support Spark’s own aspirations to diversify beyond the risk-free rate.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98933-in-summary-44\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-in-summary-44\"></a>In summary</h2>\n<p>Centrifuge, Anemoy, and their partners are uniquely positioned to provide Sky with an innovative, fully integrated, and compliant tokenization solution. Our proven track record, combined with the expertise of strategic partners like Janus Henderson, ensures that we can meet Sky’s current needs and adapt and grow as the market evolves. By leveraging our decentralized infrastructure and deep knowledge of traditional finance, we are confident that this proposal will set a new standard for onchain asset management.</p>\n<p>We are excited about the opportunity to deepen our partnership with Sky and pioneer the next chapter of real-world asset adoption together.

What is the project name?</strong></p>\n<p>Sky Dollar</p>\n<p><strong>2. What is the USDS token?</strong></p>\n<p>USDS is an upgraded version of the DAI token. Upgrading is optional. It is an ERC-20 token with permit functionality and EIP-1271 signature validation. The USDS token also enables two-way conversions between DAI and USDS tokens, using the mint and burn functions of both tokens. The conversion rate of the stablecoin is 1 DAI to 1 USDS.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What is the governance structure of the Sky Protocol and its USDS token?</strong></p>\n<p>The USDS token is the stablecoin token of the Sky Protocol, a decentralized and permissionless protocol formerly known as the Maker Protocol, governed entirely by its community, the Sky Ecosystem (formerly known as MakerDAO). Post dissolution of the Maker Foundation in 2021, the ecosystem continues to remain decentralized.</p>\n<p><strong>4. When will the token migration take place?</strong></p>\n<p>The start of the token migration from DAI to USDS is scheduled for September 18</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the process for migrating from DAI to USDS?</strong></p>\n<p>The migration is conducted using the DAI-USDS Converter contract, which allows two-way conversions between DAI and USDS using the mint and burn functions of both tokens. This process is non-custodial and permissionless, meaning that users retain full control of their assets throughout the conversion.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What is the project website?</strong></p>\n<p>The project is a decentralized and permissionless protocol, meaning there are no official websites; it can be accessed through various gateways including Sky.money and <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\">Spark.fi</a>, while anyone is free to develop new front ends, and users can always interact with the protocol directly through its smart contracts, including those contracts governing the Sky native tokens.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98920-tokenomics-and-supply-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98920-tokenomics-and-supply-2\"></a>Tokenomics and Supply</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Will the migration introduce new tokenomics?</strong></p>\n<p>USDS is meant to replace DAI as the stablecoin of the Sky Protocol, so its function remains the same with the added ability to earn token rewards and to access the Savings Rate.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Are there any jurisdictional restrictions for using the Sky Protocol and its USDS stablecoin?</strong></p>\n<p>As a decentralized and permissionless protocol, the Sky Protocol itself, including the contracts for its native stablecoin, USDS, and native governance token, SKY, have no inherent jurisdictional restrictions. USDS tokens, and the Sky Protocol, are by design, borderless and accessible to anyone with an internet connection and the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>Independent interfaces that serve as gateways to the Sky Protocol may, at their own discretion, choose to implement their own access restrictions in light of regulatory considerations. However, these restrictions are specific to those interfaces and do not reflect any jurisdictional restrictions imposed by the Sky Protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Some interfaces, such as Sky.money, geo-block or restrict a number of jurisdictions, for some or all of the functions provided by the Sky Protocol. Please see the Sky.money Terms of Use for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Having launched the Fund in April 2023, The TBILL Fund has a 18 months live track record which ranks amongst the longest in the market. The Fund is also an on-chain native vault that utilises smart-contract technologies for settlement.</p>\n<p><strong>A Robust Regulatory-First Approach for a Global Audience</strong><br>\nOpenEden’s TBILL tokens (“<strong>$TBILL</strong>”) are issued by Hill Lights International Ltd (“<strong>TBILL Fund</strong>”), which is a British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission (“<strong>BVIFSC</strong>”) regulated professional fund established under the British Virgin Islands Securities and Investment Business Act 2010. The bankruptcy-remote TBILL Fund is managed by OpenEden’s affiliated entity, Adam Eve Capital Pte Ltd (“<strong>AEC</strong>”) which is a licensed fund management company (LFMC) that holds a Capital Markets Services License under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 and is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“<strong>MAS</strong>”). The investment manager of the TBILL Fund, AEC operates under an investment mandate to invest in short-dated T-Bills. $TBILL tokens of the Fund can be offered to Non-U.S Professional Investors defined under BVI SIBA Act and to U.S Accredited Investors defined under U.S Securities Act of 1993 Rule 501a (the Fund had filed a SEC Form D Notice to offer under Reg D 506c).</p>\n<p><strong>Institutional-grade Foundation with Best-in-Class Partners</strong><br>\nThe TBILL Fund’s portfolio of T-Bills are bought, sold and custodised through the Fund’s licensed Prime Broker, UK FCA registered StoneX Financial Limited, and custodised in the Prime Broker’s licensed sub-custodian, being BNP Paribas Bank, New York in segregated accounts in compliance with UK FAC’s CASS rules. As the Token Issuer is a regulated fund managed by a licensed fund manager, there are stringent regulatory requirements including the appointment of an independent fund administrator to (i) provide independent daily valuation of the $TBILL token’s Net Asset Value (“NAV”); and (ii) participate as an independent multi-sig party for all fund asset transfer transactions as an additional safeguard against fraud. The Fund has also appointed KPMG as its tax advisor and is subject to annual audits on its balance sheet and financials. More recently, the TBILL Fund was awarded an <strong>“A-bf” Bond Fund Rating by Moody’s</strong>, the first and only of any tokenized T-BIlls product globally to receive an “investment-grade” credit rating. The “A” rating from Moody’s is a validation of OpenEden’s dedication to building a reliable primitive for the DeFi ecosystem to access tokenized T-Bills as a source of on-chain yields. <strong>Ernst &amp; Young also completed an independent audit</strong> on the OE TBILL Vault’s critical processes and controls in relation to the TBILL Fund’s KYC/AML procedures, valuation methodologies and the Fund’s asset transfer and custody procedures and controls. OpenEden is proud to have achieved the second highest rating with no critical or high risk findings.</p>\n<p><strong>Truly Crypto-native, Transparent and 24/7/365 Real-time Access</strong><br>\n$TBILL tokens can be minted instantly 24/7/365 on-chain via the OE TBILL Vault using USDC, and $TBILL tokens are held in the investor’s self-custodial wallet. The OE TBILL Vault platform offers real-time, instant on-chain minting of T-Bill backed tokens, thus removing settlement risks and allowing investors to earn yield from the point of minting till the point of redemption, maximising capital efficiency.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Project name: OpenEden Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product name: TBILL (OpenEden Tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills Fund)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product type / underlying asset: U.S. Treasury Bills</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Issuer jurisdiction: British Virgin Islands (Issuer), Singapore (Investment Manager)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product website: <a href=\"https://openeden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://openeden.com/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Primary contact name, title, and method of contact:</p>\n<p>Contact name: Jeremy Ng<br>\nTitle: Co-Founder<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:jeremy.ng@openeden.com\">jeremy.ng@openeden.com</a><br>\nTelegram: <span class=\"mention\">@ly3333</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98909-ii-company-details-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-ii-company-details-2\"></a>II.

Describe the product:</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Proposed Product : OpenEden $TBILL</strong></em><br>\nAs previously explained above in this RFP, the issuer of the $TBILL, being the TBILL Fund, is a registered professional fund (“<strong>Fund</strong>”) established under the British Virgin Islands Securities and Investment Business Act 2010 (“<strong>SIBA</strong>”) and regulated by the BVIFSC. The TBILL Fund is managed by AEC (as defined above), a wholly owned subsidiary of the OpenEden Group, which is a licensed fund management company (LFMC) that holds a Capital Markets Services License (CMSL) under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 and is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The TBILL Fund is rated “A” by Moody’s.</p>\n<p>The TBILL Fund operates the OE TBILL Vault, a smart contract vault that provides investors with direct exposure to a pool of short-dated U.S. T-Bills and overnight reverse repurchase agreements through the minting of the $TBILL. $TBILL is backed 1:1 by short-dated U.S. T-Bills and a small portion of U.S. Dollar (“<strong>USD</strong>”) held in bankruptcy remote segregated accounts in the Fund’s name. $TBILLs can be minted instantly 24/7/365, allowing investors to earn yield backed by the U.S. government on their USDC subscription at the point-of-mint itself, rather than having to wait up to T+2 business days as compared to traditional funds.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault operates on a zero-trust protocol, ensuring that all transactions are fully atomic, automated, transparent and managed on-chain without manual intervention. The protocol smart contract dictates that $TBILL can only be minted in the presence of the underlying asset, USDC, thus ensuring each token is always backed by actual assets. This minimises reliance on trust, making our system more secure and transparent than traditional incumbents. The OE TBILL Vault does not have the capability to freely mint tokens, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised token creation.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault is a permissioned protocol, which means that an investor has to meet specific criteria before the investor is eligible to hold $TBILL issued by the Fund. The OE TBILL Vault is currently only accessible to “Professional Investors’’ as defined under SIBA and to U.S. “Accredited Investors’’ within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act. $TBILL can only be minted and redeemed via the OE TBILL Vault by whitelisted wallets that have been fully onboarded after completing the Fund’s KYC/KYB process. As a permissioned token, $TBILL are transferable between whitelisted wallets.</p>\n<p>The $TBILL token is an EIP-20-compliant representation of an investor’s economic interest in the Fund. By depositing USDC and minting $TBILL, the investor will have legal rights to the redemption value of the net assets held by the Fund, proportional to the amount of $TBILL the investor holds relative to the total outstanding supply of $TBILL. The $TBILL minted by the investor are held in the investor’s whitelisted self custodial wallet.</p>\n<p>Whitelisted investors are also provided with access to the investor dashboard visible on the OE TBILL Vault dApp. The dashboard provides the investor with a real-time view of their $TBILL balance and their realised and unrealised P/L. Please find the sample screenshot of the investor dashboard displayed below.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/A7En9msFzoJcuK6zaU0QmlgBkUB.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_602x499.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"A7En9msFzoJcuK6zaU0QmlgBkUB\" width=\"602\" height=\"499\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_602x499.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_903x748.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_1204x998.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8FAF9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em><strong>Investment strategy</strong></em><br>\nThe Fund aims to provide the highest possible level of income generation while maintaining liquidity and maximum safety of principal.

The 2023 audited financial statements are available upon request.</p>\n<p>A very important point we wish to highlight is that OpenEden has recently completed an independent audit by Ernst &amp; Young LLP who performed a thorough review of critical aspects of the OE TBILL Vault, which included the investment manager’s policies, controls and procedures concerning AML/KYC, custody and valuation of the Fund’s assets (both digital and TradFi) in accordance with applicable Monetary Authority of Singapore (“<strong>MAS</strong>”) guidelines and leading industry practice for asset managers.</p>\n<p>The design and operations of the following internal controls were reviewed –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Adherence with applicable/relevant MAS Notice and Guidelines on Prevention of Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (“AML/CFT”), including sufficient AML risk assessment methodology focusing on the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Customer due diligence during onboarding and ongoing basis including corroborating source of funds and source of wealth (where applicable)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate Transaction Monitoring processes including transactions involving transfer of digital asset/ stable coin as well as adherence to travel rule (where applicable)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate Name Screening controls (including wallet screening where applicable)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate Suspicious Transaction reporting controls focusing on maintenance of records and timeliness of reporting procedures</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate policies and procedures on the methodology to identify, assess and monitor the enterprise-wide ML/TF risk</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Custody arrangement policies and procedures in place to demonstrate sufficient governance and oversight by Board of Directors /senior management as well as ensuring that independent custodians are suitably licensed, registered or authorised in their respective jurisdictions in line with the requirements from MAS Guidelines on Licensing, Registration and Conduct of Business for Fund Management Companies as well as Securities and Futures (Licensing And Conduct Of Business) Regulations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate controls and oversight is in place for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>the deposit process (i.e. depositing USDC token from customer’s private wallet into custodian account) with appropriate assessment to ensure that custody service provider maintains adequate risk management controls to ensure integrity and security of customer’s digital payment token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the transfer from custodian account to brokerage account process (i.e. transfer of US dollar from custodian account to brokerage account).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the withdrawal process (i.e. USDC token withdrawal from custodial account to customer’s private wallet).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for segregation of customer’s assets from their own assets to mitigate loss or misuse of customer’s assets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate disclosure of custody arrangements, terms and conditions and attendant risks to customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Appropriate segregation of duties to prevent conflict of interests (if applicable), including adherence with limits of authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Valuation policies and procedures in place to demonstrate sufficient governance and oversight by Board of Directors /senior management.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assets under management are subject to independent valuation and customer reporting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate controls and oversight is in place for the calculation of Net Asset Value (“NAV”) by the Fund in accordance with AEC’s Pricing Policy focusing on the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Review the appropriateness of the governance, controls and oversight of the valuation methodology in AEC’s Pricing Policy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review the source of valuation (i.e., the fair value) of each of the three asset components (i.e., US dollar, USDC and US Treasury Bills) that make up the NAV of the TBILL token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate controls and oversight is in place for the review of Net Asset Value calculated by the Fund, including review of the daily reconciliation of the calculation of the NAV by the fund manager which includes reconciliation of the number of TBILL tokens at the Valuation Point.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fund performance reports on Net Asset Value (if applicable) are timely and adequately prepared, reviewed and approved prior to presentation to stakeholder(s).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Upon completion of the review, Ernst &amp; Young assigned a <strong>Satisfactory</strong> rating (being the 2nd highest rating possible) to the independent audit report. Ernst &amp; Young were satisfied that elements of the internal control structure provide reasonable assurance that the relevant risks to the Investment Manager’s operating activities are adequately controlled.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-4-describe-the-technical-implementation-of-your-product-38\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-4-describe-the-technical-implementation-of-your-product-38\"></a>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product</h3>\n<p><strong>OE TBILL Vault</strong><br>\nThe OE TBILL Vault is developed based on the ERC-4626 Tokenized Vault standard, which is the industry standard for tokenized vaults. Subscriptions and redemption requests are seamlessly and transparently carried out on-chain through the OE TBILL Vault smart contract, which retrieves the latest price from the TBILL price oracle to process the request without manual intervention.</p>\n<p>The smart contract necessitates that $TBILL can only be minted in the presence of the underlying asset, USDC, thus ensuring that each $TBILL token is backed by actual assets. No $TBILL can be minted freely by the smart contract, which eliminates the risk of unauthorised token creation.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault smart contract has the whitelist feature that only allows wallet addresses that have been whitelisted with the smart contract to interact with the smart contract. Consequently, only whitelisted wallets can hold $TBILL. $TBILL can only be transferred between whitelisted wallets.</p>\n<p><strong>$TBILL Token and Token Price</strong><br>\nThe $TBILL is developed based on the ERC-20 token standard, and is minted or burned when USDC is deposited or redeemed from the OE TBILL Vault respectively.</p>\n<p>Token holders earn a return by holding $TBILL, where the token price is expected to increase in value over time. That increment in token price directly reflects the returns generated by the underlying T-Bills portfolio held by the Fund.</p>\n<p>The $TBILL token price is calculated as the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per token. The token price can be derived by dividing the NAV of the Fund by the total outstanding supply of $TBILL. The $TBILL token price was launched with a default value of 1.000000.</p>\n<p><strong>On-Chain Price Oracle</strong><br>\nThe price feed is a service responsible for consolidating and disseminating financial market data to the on-chain price oracle. Its primary function is to precisely calculate the $TBILL token price and transmit price data onto the on-chain price oracle. The integrity of the price feed is ensured through the price guards mechanism.</p>\n<p>Price guards are a circuit breaker mechanism designed to monitor the price of an asset or token and take appropriate actions when the price deviates unexpectedly beyond a predefined threshold. The purpose of the price guard is to protect the OE TBILL Vault or any other system from price manipulation or extreme price fluctuations by halting the OE TBILL Vault.</p>\n<p><strong>On-Chain Governance and Controls</strong><br>\nOpenEden has put in place a robust system of internal controls to uphold the safety of the OE TBILL Vault. These include the implementation of a consensus-based approval mechanism to move the OE TBILL Vault’s assets between venues, timelock, a role-based governance protocol, and multi-layered physical security, among others.</p>\n<p><strong>Timelock</strong> – Timelock implements a safety mechanism during the process of changing the OE TBILL Vault’s treasury wallet address. This is done as a precaution to protect the funds from being drained by a malicious user in the rare occasion when all the multisig wallets are compromised and the hacker is able to switch the address to offramp the funds. This timelock mechanism will give admins a 24-hour window to offramp the funds if the change in treasury address is an unintended one.</p>\n<p><strong>Multisig</strong> – The TBILL Vault is multisig, requiring multiple private keys, including the Fund’s independent third-party fund administrator to authorise and sign off on transactions involving on-chain assets. The use of on-ramp and off-ramp services will also be limited to authorised representatives from the OpenEden team via multisig operations. Off-chain assets, meanwhile, are held on the Fund’s regulated custodians’ platforms, and all actions initiated by any one core team member will require checking and confirmation by another core team member to be authorised. In addition, the Fund’s independent fund administrator will have oversight and governance control over all fund movements involving on-chain and off-chain assets held by the Fund. Even in the event of a smart contract breach or a hack, most of the OE TBILL Vault assets are held with regulated custodians at any given time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-39\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-39\"></a>5.

Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</h3>\n<p>The OpenEden team has been recently selected as one of six tokenized T-Bills service providers (out of more than thirty applicants) by the Arbitrum Foundation as part of the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program. The selection process was vetted by an expert committee that focused on product structuring, quality, regulatory compliance and transparency. The selection of OpenEden as a service provider amongst 30 other participants is testament to the superior product offering, and strong commitment towards supporting DAO communities and to provide high-quality treasury management services.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our Co-Founder Eugene has been investing and supporting crypto-native projects since 2017, and advisor to HFT firm DWF Labs has since amassed more than 700 crypto projects with a number of DAO foundations. Through his extensive network of crypto-native connections, he would be able to bring much value and expertise in any formal DAO engagement. He was also a core member of a relatively small DAO called DAOvergence.</p>\n<p>OpenEden has onboarded multiple DAOs as users and thus is familiar and comfortable working with the often unique structures associated with DAOs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-2-beyond-yield-how-might-your-product-benefit-the-sparkdao-andor-makerdao-ecosystem-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-2-beyond-yield-how-might-your-product-benefit-the-sparkdao-andor-makerdao-ecosystem-42\"></a>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</h3>\n<p>The investment into OpenEden’s $TBILL is a strong step forward in demonstrating SparkDAO’s and Sky’s commitment towards diversifying its reserves into industry-leading tokenized money market funds that have excellent product structuring, regulatory compliance and transparency. OpenEden’s $TBILL is currently the only product on the market with an “A” rating by Moody’s and the largest Asia-based issuer of tokenized T-Bills. Furthermore, an allocation into $TBILL would entitle SparkDAO to additional token incentives as OpenEden Group consolidates its plans to launch a governance token in the coming months.</p>\n<p>OpenEden has a network of institutional partners such as State Street, Moody’s etc that can be aligned for an institutional adoption of SparksDAO and its product offerings.</p>\n<p>OpenEden group is very active and dominant in the regions of Asia and Europe, which positions us as the leading non-U.S. tokenized firm that can aid SparksDAO’s international expansion, especially in Asia.</p>\n<p>As the partnership with SparkDAO scales, OpenEden is well-positioned to collaborate with particularly on the launching of new products with an RWA focus due to its end-to-end tokenization suite of services such as issuance, tokenization, portfolio management, and distributions across a variety of blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>OpenEden group also owns a Singapore MAS Licensed Fund Management Company which allows us to be an investment advisor and manager to guide any DAOs, Sub-Daos or treasuries with regulatory-compliance.</p>\n<p>Finally, as tokenized RWAs continue to gain traction, this investment by SparkDAO could galvanise other projects and users in the Sky ecosystem to participate in the growth of tokenized RWAs within the ecosystem, either through direct investments or partnership integrations. The Sky ecosystem could be well-positioned to become the leading ecosystem for supporting tokenized RWAs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-43\"></a>3.

What is the project name?</strong></p>\n<p>Sky Protocol</p>\n<p><strong>2. What is the SKY token?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY is an upgraded version of the MKR token. Upgrading is optional. It is an ERC-20 token with permit functionality and EIP-1271 signature validation. The SKY token also enables two-way conversions between MKR and SKY tokens, using the mint and burn functions of both tokens. The conversion rate is 1 MKR to 24,000 SKY.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What is the governance structure of the Sky Protocol and its SKY token?</strong></p>\n<p>The SKY token is the governance token of the Sky Protocol, a decentralized and permissionless protocol formerly known as the Maker Protocol, governed entirely by its community, the Sky Ecosystem (formerly known as MakerDAO). After the dissolution of the Maker Foundation in 2021 the ecosystem has remained decentralized and no legal entity is in charge.</p>\n<p><strong>4. When will the token migration take place?</strong></p>\n<p>The start of the token migration is scheduled for September 18.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the process for migrating from MKR to SKY?</strong></p>\n<p>The migration is conducted using the MKR-SKY Converter, which allows two-way conversions between MKR and SKY using the mint and burn functions of both tokens. This process is non-custodial and permissionless, meaning users retain full control of their assets throughout the conversion.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What is the project website?</strong></p>\n<p>The project is a decentralized and permissionless protocol, meaning there are no official websites; it can be accessed through various gateways including <a href=\"https://Sky.money\">Sky.money</a> and <a href=\"https://Spark.fi\">Spark.fi</a>, while anyone is free to develop new front ends, and users can always interact with the protocol directly through its smart contracts, including those governing the Sky native tokens. Maker/Sky features are commonly adopted across the DeFi and crypto space.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98899-tokenomics-and-supply-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98899-tokenomics-and-supply-2\"></a>Tokenomics and Supply</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Will the migration introduce new tokenomics?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY is meant to replace MKR as the governance token of the Sky Protocol (formerly known as the Maker Protocol), so its function remains the same with some added perks to incentivize governance participation. The migration introduces some new tokenomics on top of that. For example, the Sky Protocol will distribute 600 million SKY (approximately 2.56% of the current total supply) per year as rewards to eligible users. This new reward structure incentivizes participation in the protocol and helps to align token holders’ interests.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

What is the token/coin address?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY : <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x56072C95FAA701256059aa122697B133aDEd9279\">0x56072C95FAA701256059aa122697B133aDEd9279</a></p>\n<p><strong>2. What platform(s) is your token built on?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY is built on <strong>Ethereum</strong>, as an ERC-20 token.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Where can I find the smart contract code for SKY tokens?</strong></p>\n<p>The smart contract code can be found in the<a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sky\"> GitHub repository for MakerDAO</a> .</p>\n<p><strong>4. If you are able to provide a security audit report by a third-party security firm, please provide the URL.</strong></p>\n<p>The audit reports can be accessed<a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sky/tree/dev/audit\"> here</a> .</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98899-regulatory-and-compliance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98899-regulatory-and-compliance-4\"></a><strong>Regulatory and Compliance</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>1. Are there any jurisdictional restrictions for using the Sky Protocol and its SKY token?</strong></p>\n<p>As a decentralized and permissionless protocol, the Sky Protocol and its native governance token, SKY, have no inherent jurisdictional restrictions. The SKY token and the Sky Protocol are, by design, borderless and accessible to anyone with an internet connection and the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>Independent interfaces that serve as gateways to the Sky Protocol may implement access restrictions in light of regulatory considerations. However, these restrictions are specific to those interfaces and do not reflect any jurisdictional restrictions imposed by the Sky Protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Some interfaces, such as Sky.money, geo-block a number of jurisdictions, including the U.S and the U.K, for some or all of the functions provided by the Sky Protocol. Please see the Sky.money Terms of Use for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Is the token designed to facilitate anonymous, obscured, or privacy-enhancing transactions?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY tokens, being standard ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, have the same level of pseudonymity as any other Ethereum transaction. The Sky Protocol does not add or remove any anonymity features, maintaining the base level of transaction transparency inherent to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the token e-money or a digital representation of fiat currency?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the SKY token is not e-money or a representation of fiat currency. The SKY token is the native governance token of the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://sky.money/\">Sky.money</a> - An independent frontend user interface providing general access to the Sky Ecosystem and product features</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sky\">Sky Token Smart Contract on GitHub</a> - Smart contract code for SKY</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sky/tree/dev/audit\">Audit Report on GitHub</a> - Third-party security audit</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/information-for-sky-integrators/25072\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/information-for-sky-integrators/25072","pubDate":"Thu, 12 Sep 2024 03:54:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"Yes","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25072"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/information-for-sky-integrators/25072.rss","#text":"Information for SKY integrators"},"filter":false},{"title":"New Silver Monthly Report August 2024","dc:creator":"prankstr25","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-002-new-silver-restructuring-risk-and-legal-assessment/21417\">RWA-002 New Silver Restructuring and Risk Assessment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/new-silver-requesting-debt-ceiling-increase/18752\">New Silver Debt Ceiling Increase</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>\n<p>During this reporting period August 1 to August 31, 2024, we financed 16 new loans for the total value of DAI 3,739,171 and repaid 6 loans for total value of DAI 2,367,280.</p>\n<p><strong>Pool-Level Metrics:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of New Loans: 16</li>\n<li>Total New Collateral Funded (DAI): 3,739,171</li>\n<li>Total Collateral Value (DAI): 28,107,201</li>\n<li>Total Number of Assets: 101</li>\n<li>Average Finance Fee (%): 8.47%</li>\n<li>Current Maker Debt Ceiling (DAI): 50M (~56% utilized)</li>\n<li>TIN Subordination / Minimum Subordination: 22.16%/20%</li>\n<li>Number of Loans Repaid (DAI): 6</li>\n<li>Value of Loans Repaid (DAI): 2,367,280</li>\n<li>Cases of Facility EOD: 0</li>\n<li>Cases of Facility In Covenant or Concentration Limit Breach: 0</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Financial Reports</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/4/a479f17813062a8d88c3d41f1da77927b11635bd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nt1zaQjbG0FtMd09Cs1MfBcPARf.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/4/a479f17813062a8d88c3d41f1da77927b11635bd_2_690x371.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"nt1zaQjbG0FtMd09Cs1MfBcPARf\" width=\"690\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/4/a479f17813062a8d88c3d41f1da77927b11635bd_2_690x371.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/4/a479f17813062a8d88c3d41f1da77927b11635bd_2_1035x556.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/4/a479f17813062a8d88c3d41f1da77927b11635bd_2_1380x742.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F2F1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Note</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Values reported above and in the Financial Reports may differ slightly due to the time of recording and per second interest accrual method</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disclaimers</p>\n<p>This information is not investment advice, not an offer or solicitation to sell securities.

This meant the development of a new platform that could create customizable interactions for organizational data input, along with tools and applications that repurposed, visualized and automated organizational data. This led to the development of Powerhouse’s “document models”, the fundamental data unit of the Powerhouse network, a decentralized synchronization protocol (DocSync), and four applications that leverage these technologies and work seamlessly together.</p>\n<p>As part of our work for Endgame, <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ea-status-update-2-3-powerhouse-work-for-makerdao/24712#rwa-reporting-tool-for-ba-labs-2\">Powerhouse built the RWA Reporting Tool</a> and now the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010\">Atlas Explorer pilot</a>, currently hosted at <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/\">https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/</a> .<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zDDaVoShfz21zsLGOzhRZyV9SmS.png?dl=1\" title=\"Atlas Portal displaying Atlas v2\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_345x272.png\" alt=\"Atlas Portal displaying Atlas v2\" data-base62-sha1=\"zDDaVoShfz21zsLGOzhRZyV9SmS\" width=\"345\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_345x272.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_517x408.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_690x544.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0EEF4\"></a></div><br>\nBoth of these tools make it easier for the broader community to understand granular details about different aspects of Sky’s operations beyond expense reporting - Powerhouse’s first use case. These two new tools show the flexibility of Powerhouse’s document model architecture and the need for customized operational software that can improve the efficiency and transparency of open organizations.<p></p>\n<p>Building on this experience, Powerhouse has begun to find product-market-fit outside of Sky with the launch of <a href=\"http://Arbgrants.com\">Arbgrants.com</a> (more in next section below). The needs of ArbitrumDAO were similar to the Sky Ecosystem albeit in a different operational domain (grants management). For both, there was a need to upgrade their operations, transparency, and data entry and monitoring. Specifically, moving from forums and spreadsheets to a customized web app with native authentication that does not create lock-in through a centralized data provider.</p>\n<p>Building out the grants management for Arbitrum is the beginning of productizing the Powerhouse platform. Yet, grant programs are only one segment of DAO operations. Powerhouse has found reception from other projects on building customized software to optimize their operations. Financial professionals, in particular, <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/ea-status-update-2-3-powerhouse-work-for-makerdao/24712/2\">have responded positively</a> to the availability of the complete revision history for any file, made possible by Powerhouse’s events-based architecture.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98841-arbgrants-enabling-accountability-for-arbitrum-dao-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98841-arbgrants-enabling-accountability-for-arbitrum-dao-3\"></a><strong>ArbGrants: Enabling accountability for Arbitrum DAO</strong></h2>\n<p>With the experience of building the RWA Reporting Tool for Sky, Powerhouse teamed up with StableLab to launch <a href=\"http://ArbGrants.com\">ArbGrants.com</a> in June to monitor Arbitrum’s Long Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP) and in August added the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). Arbitrum has been a leader in the DAO space in distributing grants to projects to encourage building on the protocol.</p>\n<p>Hoping to spur growth on Arbitrum, the DAO approved almost $100m to be distributed to participating projects through LTIPP and STIP, but did not yet have the necessary operational infrastructure to track how these funds were used and their effectiveness. <a href=\"https://stablelab.xyz/\">StableLab</a>, an active governance participant, was tasked with administering these programs. StableLab sought a solution more robust than spreadsheets and forum posts, and thought Powerhouse was the ideal partner.</p>\n<p>Powerhouse had been building a new set of applications to create process-oriented workflows to gather data in a simple and standardized UX, so this project presented an opportunity to build the second use case on the Powerhouse stack (the first being the RWA Reporting Tool for Sky)</p>\n<p>ArbGrants uses <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/renown\">Powerhouse’s Renown product</a> for authentication to ensure that only authorized users can submit ARB incentive reports. It generates a Decentralised Identifier (DID) based on one’s  Ethereum address and issues a credential on Ceramic. Project teams then submit their reports through <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/connect\">Powerhouse’s Connect product</a>, which uses the DocSync protocol to ensure the latest version of documents are displayed across the network for the grant program manager and community.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/a/6a0bfc008b104340fe9d9c3360a3c7a0fb1aacc0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/f88hSbFu0A5cCgJYKqImext4Ep2.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/a/6a0bfc008b104340fe9d9c3360a3c7a0fb1aacc0_2_690x387.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"f88hSbFu0A5cCgJYKqImext4Ep2\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/a/6a0bfc008b104340fe9d9c3360a3c7a0fb1aacc0_2_690x387.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/a/6a0bfc008b104340fe9d9c3360a3c7a0fb1aacc0_2_1035x580.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/a/6a0bfc008b104340fe9d9c3360a3c7a0fb1aacc0_2_1380x774.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CBCED4\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<p>Close to 100 projects have used <em>Renown</em> and <em>Connect</em> to submit biweekly reports.

They need legal infrastructure and a business model that can be sustainable for all parts of the ecosystem. We refer to this broader web of legal entities and value flows as a Scalable Network Organization (SNO).</p>\n<p>We have begun validating the SNO model by dogfooding with Powerhouse itself. We have recently set up an Operational Hub for Powerhouse contributors. This legal entity can accept funds from an unincorporated DAO or multisig and pay the service providers of the DAO or SNO. This makes it easy to recruit contributors and easily pay them in crypto or fiat. This new entity is an important first step to demonstrating the SNO model.</p>\n<p>We have also been working on other open-source legal templates to help projects streamline their early operations. We have completed work on an entity with membership conditions tied to a multisig participation agreement (MPA). This means that the members of our Operational Hub can be legally determined by signers of a multisig, an important liability step for an early project wanting to do onchain operations.</p>\n<p>We’ve started initial discussions with potential projects who are interested in applying the SNO model to their organization</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98841-powerhouse-outreach-and-next-opportunities-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98841-powerhouse-outreach-and-next-opportunities-6\"></a><strong>Powerhouse Outreach and Next Opportunities</strong></h2>\n<p>Powerhouse’s broad ambitions make it challenging to hone a message, but we are making progress.</p>\n<p>We have started to spread the Powerhouse message and build a community around optimizing operations and sustainability for open organizations. In May, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GnRqdoXt8o\">we organized Powerbrunch</a>, an event at Full Node in Berlin to showcase our work. And in July, in preparation for ETHCC, we <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/\">updated our website</a> and unveiled individual pages for each of our four products. In the next month, we will publish a series of blog posts on our core technologies (Document Models and our decentralized synchronization protocol, DocSync) and our public legal infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Now our focus is on reaching more builders and those in the trenches of operations for open organizations. On the development side, we are focused on reducing the cost of creating custom solutions for projects by enhancing the builder experience and improving the system’s stability performance.</p>\n<p>We are planning a side event in Bangkok alongside Devcon to provide an opportunity to grow our developer community by helping builders to play around with document models and DocSync.

Where does exchange for the asset occur?</strong></em></p>\n<p>For USDC and PYUSD one can mint via Hashnote’s “Teller” smart contracts for an atomic on-chain mint of USYC. Burning (redemption) can occur the same way via smart contract back into USDC or PYUSD.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, onboarded users can use a “manual” method of sending Hashnote fiat, USDC, USDT or PYUSD. Hashnote then mints into the investor’s wallet an amount of USYC tokens equivalent to the number of shares the investor has in the SDYF. Again, burning (redemption) occurs through the same path of the customer burning USYC and then being sent back their stablecoin or fiat.</p>\n<p>Instructions for above can be found at: <a href=\"https://usyc.docs.hashnote.com/overview/subscription-and-redemption\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Subscription &amp; Redemption | USYC</a></p>\n<p>The amount of USYC the investor receives is equal to the deposit amount divided by the current Price of USYC.

If Maker takes USYC as collateral, it gives an avenue for DAI inclusion in CEX market collateral.</p>\n<p><em><strong>15. What is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline?

What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral?</strong></em></p>\n<p>USYC is being included in major exchanges. By being able to take USYC into treasury, and being an asset that can mint DAI, there appears additional pressure for exchanges to accept DAI as collateral.</p>\n<p>Hashnote will support Maker’s long-terms goals, as we effectively combine the “real” and “decentralized” worlds as well.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98839-legal-questions-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98839-legal-questions-7\"></a><strong>Legal Questions</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>17.

Years in operation</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock, a subsidiary of Matrixport established in 2022, is dedicated to bringing high-quality real-world assets on-chain.</p>\n<p>Matrixport, founded in 2018, has built a strong reputation over the past six years as a leading digital asset financial services platform. It is recognized for its innovative solutions and strong market presence, delivering a broad range of services in the digital asset space. Matrixdock leverages this expertise to bridge traditional finance and DeFi, making real-world assets accessible through blockchain technology.</p>\n<h1>III. Product Information</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock Short-term Treasury Bill Token (STBT) is designed for accredited investors seeking exposure to US treasury yields. STBT is the first tokenized T-bill token issued in Asia, and currently yields approximately 5.10-5.30% APY on average (gross yield including fees, as of Aug 2024).</p>\n<p>Each STBT is pegged to 1 USD and is collateralized by a combination of the following instruments</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Matrixdock sources from a wide range of independent sources to ensure diversification. Allocations are made dynamically to optimize for stability and liquidity.</p>\n<p>STBT is an ERC-1400 token that distributes yield on a daily basis via re-basing, with T+1 minting and T+0 redemption. T+0 redemption is supported directly by Matrixdock and in secondary venues such as Curve.</p>\n<p>STBT is also the first to accept multiple stablecoins as deposit and redemption options, and <strong>the first to accept minting with DAI directly.</strong></p>\n<p>For STBT, Matrixdock works closely with Chainlink to deliver the best UX on DeFi</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proof of Reserves:</strong> STBT is the market’s first tokenized treasury token adopting Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves, enforcing the number of tokens minted is always less than or equal to the underlying NAV by smart contract, assuring investor confidence on-chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Data feed:</strong> STBT NAV data is recorded publicly on-chain and verified by Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network</li>\n<li><strong>CCIP:</strong> STBT is multi-chain enabled, available on Ethereum and Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>STBT is also committed to driving innovation in token utility. It serves as collateral for borrowing and lending, as well as for leveraging on selected platforms in both DeFi and CeFi, including Term Finance and <a href=\"http://bit.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bit.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>US Treasuries are considered the safest USD-denominated asset. STBT is built upon a basket of on-chain and off-chain instruments, which include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The inclusion of on-chain assets is designed to enhance liquidity and provide added flexibility to the portfolio, complementing the stability of off-chain assets. Based on Matrixdock’s professional asset management experience, allocations are made dynamically to optimize for product yield, stability and liquidity. A small amount of cash is kept to facilitate basic liquidity needs.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the token holder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock distributes yield daily through the rebase of STBT in holders token balances. STBT is pegged to 1 USD, and total STBT supply is increased to reflect increasing NAV.</p>\n<p>Total STBT supply is equivalent to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying asset portfolio, which equates to the sum of the market value of US T-bills, reverse repos, BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and cash.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT adopts a bankruptcy remote SPV structure, where issuer and custodian are separate entities with token holders owning complete legal rights to claim against custodied assets, to ensure 100% fund segregation and investor protection for all token holders.</p>\n<p><strong>Trust:</strong> Prometheus Solutions Purpose Trust (Seychelles)</p>\n<p><strong>Issuer:</strong> Prometheus Solutions Ltd (Seychelles)</p>\n<p><strong>Custodian:</strong> Epimetheus Technologies SPC (Cayman)</p>\n<p><strong>Enforcer/Protector:</strong> Hamilton Services Limited (United Kingdom)</p>\n<p><strong>Brokers:</strong> StoneX (United States), UBS (United Kingdom), Securitize (United States - for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) by BlackRock)</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock sources T-bills from multiple sources off-chain and on-chain. Based on extensive professional asset management experience, Matrixdock allocates dynamically based on asset characteristics to optimise for yield, stability and liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Asset eligibility:</strong> Only assets that are US Treasuries within 3 month maturities, tokens representing US Treasuries, Repos and Cash are eligible for STBT.</p>\n<p>Currently, STBT accepts the following assets</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the use of hedging or derivatives is not permitted. The underlying portfolio only accepts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A small amount of cash is kept to facilitate basic liquidity needs.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

The user can either;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Submit OTC request and send stablecoins to designated deposit address</li>\n<li>Deposit eligible ERC20 stablecoin on <a href=\"https://app.matrixdock.com/swap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Matrixdock Web App</a></li>\n<li>Swap on <a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-279/deposit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">STBT Curve-3pool</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>For large quantities ($1M+), we recommend option 1. After receiving the deposit, the STBT Issuer converts stablecoin into USD and transfers it to the Custodian’s bank / broker account. Once the T-bill order is confirmed, STBT NAV is updated, concurrently STBT is minted and sent to the user’s whitelisted wallet address.</p>\n<p><strong>Proof of Reserves:</strong> STBT users are assured that every STBT minted is backed by at least 1 USD of real assets - enforced by smart contract safeguards using Chainlink Oracles and NAV data feeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Redemptions</strong></p>\n<p>Similarly, the user has multiple routes for redeeming STBT.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Submit OTC request</li>\n<li>Use the swap widget on <a href=\"https://app.matrixdock.com/swap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Matrixdock Web App</a></li>\n<li>Swap on <a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-279/deposit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">STBT Curve-3pool</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the Issuer receives the redemption request from the user, open T-bill / repo positions are closed and settled. After bank/broker confirmation, the settled USD is converted into eligible ERC 20 stablecoins. STBT is burned and stablecoins are transferred to the user’s whitelisted address.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the graphic below for fund flow.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/7/f74343547ea21983c8cc14f49b431c9d997eb3e8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zho2P1jpzciDvY25QymtFMe259m.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/7/f74343547ea21983c8cc14f49b431c9d997eb3e8_2_624x349.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"zho2P1jpzciDvY25QymtFMe259m\" width=\"624\" height=\"349\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/7/f74343547ea21983c8cc14f49b431c9d997eb3e8_2_624x349.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/7/f74343547ea21983c8cc14f49b431c9d997eb3e8_2_936x523.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/7/f74343547ea21983c8cc14f49b431c9d997eb3e8_2_1248x698.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E6E4E6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>15. Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, Matrixdock adopts a hybrid allocation approach to optimize for STBT yield, stability and liquidity. Matrixdock has partnered with the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency - supporting T+1 minting and T+0 redemptions.</p>\n<p>For instant redemption, redeemed STBT are swapped into the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on-chain then into USDC (rather than settled off-chain from T-bills).</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, Matrixdock supports a $3M STBT-3pool on Curve to facilitate immediate swaps.</p>\n<p>One advantage with Matrixdock is its established network of relationships with liquidity providers, market makers and institutions. Matrixdock has a proven track record of supporting significant single day redemptions of up to $50M even outside market hours.</p>\n<p><strong>16. With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock supports USDC, USDT and DAI for subscriptions and redemptions. Fiat is also accepted, subject to OTC terms and fees. Matrixdock can also support licensed legally-compliant third party OTCs.</p>\n<p>Matrixdock acknowledges that MakerDao has rebranded into Sky, and will be upgrading DAI to USDS. With a successful DeFi treasury allocation, Matrixdock can accelerate USDS support within the Matrixport ecosystem and directly as a subscription/redemption currency for STBT.</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is increasingly being used in treasury management by institutional investors and DAOs.</p>\n<p>For future development, Matrixdock will focus on four fronts</p>\n<p><strong>i. Greater Efficiencies:</strong></p>\n<p>By partnering with top-tier custodians, Matrixdock will enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and mitigate risk. This global approach ensures that our assets are safeguarded across multiple jurisdictions, delivering superior security standards while optimizing asset management processes.</p>\n<p><strong>ii. More Diverse User Base:</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock will grow the STBT user base by forming strategic partnerships with top-tier institutional platforms and digital exchanges. As the user base expands, the whitelist pool will grow, allowing more users to transact with each other. This whitelisting mechanism ensures that only approved users can hold and trade STBT tokens within the secure, compliant ecosystem. By broadening the pool of whitelisted users, we aim to enhance the liquidity and accessibility of STBT, fostering a more dynamic and diverse marketplace. By expanding the network of compliant users, Matrixdock aims to foster collaboration and unlock additional growth potential within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>iii. Deeper Liquidity:</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock is committed to deepening liquidity by increasing partnerships with top liquidity providers and market makers. Additionally, we plan to scale our Curve pool and raise transaction caps, ensuring seamless liquidity, even during periods of heightened demand.</p>\n<p><strong>iv. Greater DeFi Utility:</strong></p>\n<p>To expand DeFi utility, Matrixdock plans to integrate STBT with leading decentralized protocols, positioning it as a strong collateral option for lending and perpetual markets. Additionally, we envision STBT being used as an underlying asset for other innovative products, such as yield-generating strategies and structured financial instruments, further enhancing its versatility and value across the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<h1>IV.

This means that, even in the unlikely event of Matrixdock’s insolvency, the assets held by the STBT entities would remain fully protected and would not be subject to any claims from Matrixdock’s creditors.</p>\n<p>The STBT entities are designed as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that exclusively manage the STBT program. These entities incur no liabilities other than their obligations to STBT token holders, which are their sole focus. Additionally, the number of STBT tokens issued will always be less than the value of the underlying reserves held by these entities.</p>\n<p>With these safeguards in place, the STBT entities are considered bankruptcy remote, ensuring maximum security for token holders. This legal structure provides a robust level of protection, isolating the assets backing the STBT tokens from any potential risks associated with Matrixdock.</p>\n<p>For further details about these entities, please feel free to request additional information via email.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Holders of STBT tokens have a right to a debt obligation from the token issuer. Each STBT token is redeemable for an amount equivalent to one U.S. dollar, minus any applicable fees, trading losses, or transactional costs. The redemption value reflects the pro rata value of the underlying assets at the time of redemption.</p>\n<p>When you redeem your STBT tokens, the amount you receive will be based on the value of the underlying assets at that time, after accounting for any necessary fees and costs associated with the sale of these assets. Please note that there may be additional redemption restrictions that apply.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No, there are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is subject to taxation at the user’s applicable tax rate, which depends on the user’s jurisdiction and legal setup. Primary tax consequences originate from redemption.</p>\n<p>Users are responsible for fulfilling their tax obligations and advised to consult a tax advisor. Matrixdock may assist in connecting relevant tax advisors if needed.</p>\n<h1>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark</strong></p>\n<p>STBT has historically yielded approximately 4.8-5.0% APY post fees, or 5.1-5.3% pre fees. Our performance tracks closely with the Federal Funds Rate with little to no deviation. (FFR <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Effective Federal Funds Rate - FEDERAL RESERVE BANK of NEW YORK</a>)</p>\n<p>The average APR per month post fees, year to date is presented in the table below.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Month</th>\n<th>Average APY</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 2024</td>\n<td>5.15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Feb 2024</td>\n<td>4.98%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mar 2024</td>\n<td>4.97%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Apr 2024</td>\n<td>4.98%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>May 2024</td>\n<td>4.96%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jun 2024</td>\n<td>4.95%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jul 2024</td>\n<td>4.80%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>2.

Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is the first RWA tokenization project integrated with Chainlink’s Proof-of-Reserve (PoR). This integration ensures that STBT is sufficiently backed by US Treasury securities and verifiable 24/7. PoR safeguards user funds by enforcing mint &lt; NAV via smart contract, this is coded into the STBT contract itself.</p>\n<p>Harris &amp; Trotter are responsible for uploading NAV data on-chain for verification by Chainlink’s decentralized network of oracles.</p>\n<p>STBT PoR feed can be found <a href=\"https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/stbt-por\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract Framework</strong></p>\n<p>The permission framework of the STBT contract is broadly classified into three distinct roles: ControllerRole, IssuerRole, ModeratorRole. The proposal is to designate a single smart contract with a timelock function as the controller contract for all three roles. All STBT administrator activities are carried out via this controller contract, with each operation subject to two stages of proposing and executing, and the execution must conform to the delay specified by the timelock. The overall structure is as follows:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uqnHKuANHGaxVE9y1XMcwsk1uRW.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_624x351.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uqnHKuANHGaxVE9y1XMcwsk1uRW\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_624x351.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_936x526.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_1248x702.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F6FC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Timelock contract: There is a single external control smart contract with a timelock function as the controller contract, through which all STBT administrator activities are carried out. Each operation must go through two stages of proposing and executing, with execution conforming to the 4-hour delay specified by the timelock.</p>\n<p>The timelock contract is the only admin, and the security of the STBT contract is normalized to the security of each role involved in the timelock controller: proposer, executor, and canceller. The canceller is one self-hosted hardware wallet that is authorized to cancel an operation scheduled during the timelock period by calling the timelock controller.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Standard</strong></p>\n<p>ERC1400 standard is split into several modular sub-standards：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ERC1410 defines partially fungible tokens where balances of tokens can have an associated metadata</li>\n<li>ERC1594 defines transfer restrictions and core security token functionality</li>\n<li>ERC1643 defines document management functionality.</li>\n<li>ERC1644 defines controller operation functionality</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular, the STBT token contract implements the ERC1594 transfer restrictions specs, and the ERC1644 controller operations specs. STBT utilizes the whitelist mechanism to determine whether transmission and reception of addresses are authorized.</p>\n<p><strong>STBT Risk Mitigation and Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>STBT mitigates contract and operational risks through the implementation of a whitelist mechanism, time-lock contracts, and an independent real-time monitoring system, ensuring the highest level of safety and security.</p>\n<p>In order to further prevent operational and hacking risks, Matrixdock has implemented two separated sets of monitoring systems:</p>\n<p>A. The first system monitors the difference between the business order data and the contract activity data to detect any unauthorized minting of STBT tokens. Any suspicious activity can be immediately canceled, and emergency plans activated.</p>\n<p>B. The second system monitors the difference between the confirmation fiat wiring amount and the contract activity data. This monitoring service is independently maintained and monitored to identify any anomaly.</p>\n<p>The STBT minter contract only allows whitelisted wallets to call this contract directly and mint/redeem STBT. In this way, all key actions initiated through the minter contract, such as Mint, Burn, Settle, will be transparently tracked on-chain, ensuring full transparency and allowing for the tracking of all capital flows and information related to the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT’s smart contract has been audited by BlockSec (Jan 2023) and <a href=\"http://Zellic.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Zellic.io</a> (Feb 2023). Audit reports can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Matrixdock-STBT/STBT-contracts/tree/main/audit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>While Matrixdock itself has not yet engaged directly with MakerDAO in formal partnerships, our parent company, Matrixport, has a deep-rooted history in the crypto and blockchain space. Matrixport’s extensive experience in managing complex crypto financial products and infrastructure has provided Matrixdock with valuable insights into the operational dynamics of decentralized platforms. Over the years, Matrixport has maintained a positive relationship with MakerDAO, entering exploratory discussions on multiple fronts, including but not limited to Real-World Assets (RWA).</p>\n<p>Recognizing MakerDAO’s significant influence in the DeFi space, we have made the strategic decision to accept DAI as the token for minting STBT. This decision underscores our commitment to aligning with MakerDAO’s ecosystem and catering to its extensive user base.</p>\n<p>With our team’s expertise in navigating both traditional finance and digital assets, we are well-positioned to collaborate with DAOs. Our proven track record with other reputable DAOs demonstrates our ability to navigate DAO governance, meet KYC requirements, and deliver financial products that uphold the high transparency and security standards demanded by decentralized organizations like MakerDAO. Matrixdock also has experience working with a wide range of legal structures, including LLPs, corporations, trusts, and other legal entities, further reinforcing our capability to support MakerDAO’s strategic objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT brings more than just yield to the MakerDAO ecosystem. By integrating STBT into MakerDAO’s treasury, MakerDAO gains access to a robust, real-world asset-backed product that enhances overall treasury stability and liquidity. Our industry-leading transparency practices, including the unique Transparency Panel and Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves, reinforce the trust and reliability that MakerDAO’s stakeholders expect.</p>\n<p>Importantly, STBT can also be minted using DAI, MakerDAO’s stablecoin. This creates a seamless integration that not only strengthens the utility and demand for DAI but also allows MakerDAO to leverage its own stablecoin in acquiring STBT, further solidifying its role in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In addition to STBT, Matrixdock is committed to expanding its portfolio of real-world asset (RWA) products, further deepening our collaboration with MakerDAO in the future. By launching new RWA offerings tailored to the needs of decentralized ecosystems, we aim to provide MakerDAO with a broader range of asset-backed products that enhance stability and liquidity. This evolving suite of RWA solutions will not only support MakerDAO’s treasury diversification goals but also create new opportunities for long-term cooperation and growth within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Integrating STBT can also attract a broader range of institutional and retail participants from Matrixport’s ecosystem, who prioritize the security and stability of RWA-backed assets. Additionally, MakerDAO can leverage Matrixdock’s extensive RWA network in Asia, gaining access to traditional finance resources like Asia OTC, asset sourcing, and community building.</p>\n<p>This broader participation could help to further diversify and strengthen MakerDAO’s treasury, aligning with long-term strategic goals of risk management and capital efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is designed with secure interoperability in mind, and it is already integrated into different DeFi verticals such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DEX for swaps and liquidity provisioning ie Curve</li>\n<li>Collateral for stablecoins ie Verified USD</li>\n<li>Collateral for borrowing/lending ie Term Finance</li>\n<li>Multi-chain mobility ie CCIP including Ethereum and Arbitrum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond DeFi, STBT’s compatibility with traditional financial systems is facilitated through our OTC network and a growing range of RWA products, which is part of our broader strategy to create a seamless interface between fiat and crypto worlds. Matrixdock’s infrastructure is built to support easy integration across multiple platforms, ensuring that STBT remains a versatile and secure asset within both DeFi and traditional finance ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Matrixdock is committed to bringing the best-in-quality real-world assets on-chain, with the T-bill token being just the beginning of our journey in RWAs. We are actively developing a suite of tokenized RWAs designed to meet the specific needs of decentralized ecosystems. Our vision is to expand our offerings with a range of products tailored to the diverse risk preferences of MakerDAO ecosystem participants.</p>\n<p>These upcoming products will provide portfolio managers with a broader spectrum of investment options, making them ideal for SparkDAO and other MakerDAO subDAOs seeking to diversify their treasury assets, optimize returns, and enhance capital efficiency. Our dedication to security, transparency, and seamless integration of real-world assets positions us as a key partner in supporting MakerDAO’s treasury management with the highest standards of innovation and stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Supplementary</strong></p>\n<p>STBT Transparency Panel is the first in the industry to leverage on recognized third-party independent oversight to enhance greater transparency. The panel consists of reputable members from Verified USD Foundation, LayerZero Labs and Curve Finance. Panel members provide third-party verification of off-chain assets through direct view-only access of STBT’s bank and broker accounts. Monthly updates are published on the STBT website transparency page.</p>\n<p>Should STBT be a successful inclusion to the Spark Grand Prix, it would be possible for an appointed member of MakerDAO to join the Transparency Panel.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-matrixdock-stbt/25048\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-matrixdock-stbt/25048","pubDate":"Tue, 10 Sep 2024 14:31:33 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25048"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-matrixdock-stbt/25048.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Matrixdock STBT"},"filter":false},{"title":"SPARK impact in MKR Valuation","dc:creator":"Jesus_Perez","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>I’d like to share a reflection on the impact of SPARK on the valuation of MKR (SKY), and I’m happy to receive any feedback.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://mirror.xyz/0x3e0cf03f718520F30300266dcF4DB50bA12d3331/_6xssoujIjPqNParNAZWY59iGoCPNjRDJSRfC3z0osc\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/6/16c62f0ed3507d33fc3bb5ce36fb77f047d33f7a.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"489FFF\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0x3e0cf03f718520F30300266dcF4DB50bA12d3331/_6xssoujIjPqNParNAZWY59iGoCPNjRDJSRfC3z0osc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">mirror.xyz</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/345;\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/1/8130bb0f6012bc34e644ea9d6ef925df1278b574_2_690x345.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"6371DF\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0x3e0cf03f718520F30300266dcF4DB50bA12d3331/_6xssoujIjPqNParNAZWY59iGoCPNjRDJSRfC3z0osc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark and MakerDAO</a></h3>\n\n  <p>While performing the exercise of valuing MKR tokens ahead of the SKY launch, one of the key questions to ask is what value the token captures from the launch of all these projects.
