This incorporates elements from our risk analysis posts, as well as additional mechanisms for rate targeting to ensure the vault achieves an adequate risk adjusted return.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"exposure-limits-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#exposure-limits-1\"></a>Exposure Limits</h3>\n<p>From our previous reports, we recommended to limit exposure to Ethena according to the following heuristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10% of perpetual futures open interest</li>\n<li>20% of DAI circulating supply</li>\n<li>30% of total USDe supply</li>\n<li>Maintaining tail risk exposure within acceptable limits</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that Ethena recently added Bitcoin as a collateral asset for delta neutral strategies, the constraint on total share of open interest has become less prominent. DAI supply is just below 5 billion, indicating a limit of roughly 1 billion DAI exposure to USDe. Similarly, with 200 million DAI current exposure and 2.3 billion USDe supply, the USDe supply constraint also yields a maximum limit of roughly 1 billion DAI exposure. This makes tail risk mitigation the primary constraint for Maker’s USDe exposure growth.</p>\n<p>The recently posted <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/susde-usde-exposure-increase-analysis/24074\">exposure increase analysis</a> provides data on the levels of bad debt incurred at various USDe haircuts, depending on how much additional capital is deployed to the vault. Generally speaking, bad debt is minimal unless USDe falls at least 10%, and with moderately higher haircuts of 20-30% bad debt remains manageable even as exposure grows significantly. Higher USDe loss rates begin to present a more serious problem with high exposure; for example Maker could incur roughly 200-250 million of bad debt with a 50% USDe haircut at 600 million DAI total exposure. For now, we believe the 600 million DAI maximum deployment remains appropriate to balance revenue growth vs resilience, with actual amounts deployed dependent on market conditions and continued improvements in Ethena fundamental risks.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"vault-return-benchmarks-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#vault-return-benchmarks-2\"></a>Vault Return Benchmarks</h3>\n<p>We can judge the risk/reward of supplying to the Morpho vault by comparing the weighted average borrow rate of the vault’s supplied assets to Maker’s marginal cost of capital (DSR). The spread between these values should be sufficiently large to justify the tail risk exposure of Ethena exposure.</p>\n<p>We consider borrow rates rather than the vault supply yield because only funds that are actively borrowed enter circulation and impact Maker’s cost of capital. Additionally, fluctuations in liquidity utilization ratio on Morpho can introduce unnecessary noise into risk/return calculations, and lead to a negative feedback loop where the vault continuously withdraws funds keeping utilization artificially elevated and preventing the pools from achieving rate equilibrium.</p>\n<p>The below chart shows our initial recommended rate benchmarking strategy for managing allocations to the Spark DAI vault. We derive a target borrow rate based on a spread vs the DSR, with the spread increasing as a function of exposure. The equation for calculating target borrow rate is implemented twice, with one version using fixed values for base and slope while the other uses proportional values referencing the DSR. This should ensure that the spread between DSR and target rates is sufficiently large even in low DSR environments, and scales up when the DSR is elevated. We expect to make iterative changes to the target rate benchmark formula over time: changing base and slope parameters, adding other input variables, and potentially changing the reference rate from DSR to value.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/7/977106c5affdce4348527e3abe41f93804ad69f0.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lBIfSrtfEIqbBpEfGpXNSfe1B9S.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/7/977106c5affdce4348527e3abe41f93804ad69f0_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"lBIfSrtfEIqbBpEfGpXNSfe1B9S\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/7/977106c5affdce4348527e3abe41f93804ad69f0_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/7/977106c5affdce4348527e3abe41f93804ad69f0_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/7/977106c5affdce4348527e3abe41f93804ad69f0.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pz7ugki9pD_ITHdRgF258VvXEGYg20gGG9m-5OVzKqI/edit?usp=sharing\">USDe Morpho Benchmarks</a></p>\n<p>Target borrow rate increases as exposure grows; this ensures that Maker gains increasing levels of risk compensation with higher Ethena exposure, which places a larger burden on Maker’s capital reserves. If exposure weighted average borrow rates consistently exceed the “max borrow rate” target for a multi-day period, this justifies increasing the amount of DAI deployed to the vault (within relevant maximum exposure limits). On the other hand, rates falling below the “min borrow rate” target would justify a reduction in exposure. Our current implementation of rate benchmarking targets a base of 120% higher than the DSR at 0 exposure, and roughly 1% borrow rate increase per 50 million DAI allocated.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pool-selection-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#pool-selection-3\"></a>Pool Selection</h3>\n<p>Borrowers’ willingness to pay for leverage, and by extension individual pools’ equilibrium borrow rates, should depend primarily on their expected all-in returns from the leveraged position.

The optimal rate is slowly adjusted when utilization is above or below the 90% target, so it effectively integrates average borrowing demand over time. The only exception where an asset has a higher optimal rate for a lower LLTV pool is the sUSDe 91.5% pool having higher rate than 94.5% pool.

This is demonstrated in the above data for optimal borrow rate divided by LLTV, with the 91.5% and 86% pools showing strong efficiency (sometimes even exceeding 94.5% LLTV pools) while the 77% pools drop off a bit. We recommend the majority of additional funds should be allocated into the moderate 86% and 91.5% LLTVs.</p>\n<p>Based on a review of borrow rates across pools, and assuming borrowers are targeting roughly 100-200% APY equivalent total return regardless of the pool LLTV or collateral asset (USDe vs sUSDe), we find that the market seems to be valuing sats at around 2-4% APY per sat per day (eg. 10 sats per day is equivalent to earning 20-40% APY). This means that sUSDe would need to earn between 30-60% in cash yield to deliver an equivalent total return to USDe in current conditions. This level of funding yield seems unlikely to be sustained over significant periods. For this reason, along with current user preferences for USDe collateral as demonstrated by higher borrowing rates, we recommend to focus new allocations solely into the USDe pools. However, we will reevaluate this relative split regularly, as users’ return expectations from the sats campaign may shift quickly depending on ENA token price and other factors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#next-steps-4\"></a>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>We expect to make improvements to the overall vault rate benchmarking methodology over time to account for additional relevant variables. Additionally, as we continue to gain more data on relative pool rates and performance, we will implement some intra-vault optimization heuristics to ensure the Spark DAI vault is achieving optimal risk/reward (eg. methods to judge when the vault should reallocate funds between pools). We also plan to define milestone based framework linking increases in exposure beyond certain total capital thresholds to improvements in Ethena transparency, resilience, and fundamental risk factors.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/usde-and-susde-allocation-benchmarks/24076\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/usde-and-susde-allocation-benchmarks/24076","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Apr 2024 13:29:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24076"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/usde-and-susde-allocation-benchmarks/24076.rss","#text":"USDe and sUSDe Allocation Benchmarks"},"filter":true},{"title":"RWA Foundation/HVB - Monthly Reporting (March 2024)","dc:creator":"InfoAgent","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>Please find the Monthly Summary Cash Report for the period ending March 31, 2024 below:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/c/3cc93d59ed375fd976f63c3e06bba285e1ae9152.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8FJNJDKIjwgA6jN8xG1TQEk97YS.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/c/3cc93d59ed375fd976f63c3e06bba285e1ae9152_2_390x800.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"8FJNJDKIjwgA6jN8xG1TQEk97YS\" width=\"390\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/c/3cc93d59ed375fd976f63c3e06bba285e1ae9152_2_390x800.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/c/3cc93d59ed375fd976f63c3e06bba285e1ae9152_2_585x1200.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/c/3cc93d59ed375fd976f63c3e06bba285e1ae9152_2_780x1600.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EFEFEF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The report is also available on Pinata in both PDF and Excel formats <a href=\"https://app.pinata.cloud/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.pinata.cloud/</a></p>\n<p>CIDs on Pinata are:<br>\nQmQh5reLMR6qNkW9VfJVJgiVbBcU5dNjh1sjoep5qauksb<br>\nQmXBJhzWBPgzqrP6KfHXoEiMDda9ydM6nf1GFLHfa7crCD</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-foundation-hvb-monthly-reporting-march-2024/24075\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-foundation-hvb-monthly-reporting-march-2024/24075","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Apr 2024 11:19:56 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24075"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-foundation-hvb-monthly-reporting-march-2024/24075.rss","#text":"RWA Foundation/HVB - Monthly Reporting (March 2024)"},"filter":false},{"title":"sUSDe & USDe Exposure Increase Analysis","dc:creator":"DeFlamiingo","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In March, article <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104#5-3-2-morpho-overcollateralized-susde-or-usde-ddm\">5.3.2: Morpho overcollateralized sUSDe or USDe DDM</a> was <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmbndmkr#poll-detail\">ratified for inclusion</a> in the Stability Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact.

The total debt exposure at the time of the analysis measured ~185 million DAI. Also note that users with less than 1,000 DAI debt have been omitted from the reviewed data. These users make up a significantly smaller share of the sample size (10M USD worth of collateral deposited by borrowers borrowing less than 1,000 DAI) and were excluded for the sake of analysis simplicity.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"markets-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#markets-3\"></a>Markets</h1>\n<p>The Morpho Spark DAI Vault currently consists of eight markets, split into two collateral asset categories (USDe and sUSDe) across four different “liquidation loan-to-value” (LLTV) parameter values, respectively.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows the total borrowed USD per market as of April 9, 2024. DAI debt exposure from USDe markets was ~122M, while sUSDe debt exposure measured ~63M Dai. This discrepancy is mainly driven by Maker’s current strategy of allocating a greater share of DAI towards USDe pools. However, by reviewing pool utilization levels, the USDe pools seem to attract more borrowing, which further supports our previous <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/morpho-spark-dai-vault-update-1-april-2024/24006\">speculation</a> – that users’ are currently prioritizing Ethena points and ENA tokens, and therefore opting for USDe pools with higher incentives.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/6/46f2b86f20e11458b1bab27ae632bf6c3510c04d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/a7DrQieSBO09ayoQZKvuxFkCTlH.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/6/46f2b86f20e11458b1bab27ae632bf6c3510c04d_2_624x435.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"a7DrQieSBO09ayoQZKvuxFkCTlH\" width=\"624\" height=\"435\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/6/46f2b86f20e11458b1bab27ae632bf6c3510c04d_2_624x435.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/6/46f2b86f20e11458b1bab27ae632bf6c3510c04d.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/6/46f2b86f20e11458b1bab27ae632bf6c3510c04d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D3DAED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>When looking at how median health rates differ across markets, we can see that the sUSDe 0.77 is the one exhibiting the highest health rate across its positions (1.26), while the USDe 0.945 is the one with the lowest health rate (1.03). It is interesting to point out that while the LLTV might play a role in determining the health factors (e.g. both health rates for 0.77 LLTV markets are above 1.15) it is important to monitor the variability of users’ positions across markets. Specifically, the health rates for the 0.945 LLTV markets differ significantly, since the sUSDe market has a health rate of 1.12. While their overall weight is not significant (both around $10M) it is still necessary to closely monitor the active positions in the market. This is also true for the median buffer over health rate, with 0.77 LLTV markets being more-than-well protected versus bad debt. Again, the USDe 0.945 market has a median buffer over bad debt of ~8%, requiring additional monitoring. What is very important to point out is that the largest market (USDe 0.86) is well protected against bad debt (22% buffer) and with relatively safe positions (1.11 health rate).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/a/cab15e78e354075e9147685d3e3481fc38fd4f72.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sV6sxTdv4MXUD4B9Cpnd1L4Pv5U.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/a/cab15e78e354075e9147685d3e3481fc38fd4f72_2_624x376.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"sV6sxTdv4MXUD4B9Cpnd1L4Pv5U\" width=\"624\" height=\"376\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/a/cab15e78e354075e9147685d3e3481fc38fd4f72_2_624x376.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/a/cab15e78e354075e9147685d3e3481fc38fd4f72_2_936x564.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/a/cab15e78e354075e9147685d3e3481fc38fd4f72.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F5F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"users-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#users-4\"></a>Users</h1>\n<p>USDe currently makes up a larger amount of total debt exposure.

In reality, certain users would want to maximize their yield and abandon positions by withdrawing available collateral up to the LLTV threshold. This holds true whenever the haircut is larger than 1 - LLTV.</p>\n<p>This analysis with more likely user behavior shows that at 20% haircut the bad debt would be slightly higher ($96M) while at 30% haircut the bad debt would be equal to $200M for exposures of $1B. Supposing the same $100M theoretical threshold, Maker would be able to sustainably cover all realized bad debt for $1B exposure at 20% haircut. For a $600M overall exposure, bad debt would be covered up to a ~25% haircut.</p>\n<p>However, this scenario is more likely for users in markets with higher LLTVs, but it is not a universal behavior for all users. Since MakerDAO would decrease its position in the market, interest rates would likely skyrocket. Consequently, the accrual of higher rates should begin to liquidate users or reduce their collateralization levels, also potentially making them unable to withdraw the remaining available collateral.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/a/7ae87c4abd93e289becbd74523be17e53654e8e1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hxilELpr4rr7qh8XsglTeklkpGx.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/a/7ae87c4abd93e289becbd74523be17e53654e8e1_2_624x425.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hxilELpr4rr7qh8XsglTeklkpGx\" width=\"624\" height=\"425\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/a/7ae87c4abd93e289becbd74523be17e53654e8e1_2_624x425.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/a/7ae87c4abd93e289becbd74523be17e53654e8e1_2_936x637.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/a/7ae87c4abd93e289becbd74523be17e53654e8e1.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F8FA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The analysis has assessed the status of the Morpho Spark DAI Vault as of April 9, 2024, emphasizing individual user and market metrics, while also providing some additional insights into possible future scenarios.</p>\n<p>In general, it seems that users prefer USDe over sUSDe exposure. This is likely driven by higher incentives directed towards USDe. However, it may still be too early to definitively judge, since perhaps more time and liquidity is needed before a stable equilibrium can be reached. Furthermore, the analysis may be biased as a result of Maker’s current allocation strategy, which supplies 65% of the total vault target debt to USDe pools. There are some signs pointing towards smaller users preferring sUSDe, but with higher leverage. Finally, this trend might change if Ethena decides to reallocate incentives. USDe markets have a total of 122 million in exposure, versus 63 million for sUSDe, with an almost equal amount of wallets across USDe and sUSDe collateral categories.</p>\n<p>There is a relatively low concentration of borrowers. Furthermore, positions are well collateralized, with a median health factor across all markets of 1.13, and debt weighted protection buffer before bad debt of ~22% across all positions.</p>\n<p>The scenario analysis highlights that Maker is currently able to sustainably cover bad debt up to 20% haircuts for any given exposure level up to $1B through the surplus buffer and protocol owned liquidity. The analysis of the vault’s behavior in case of additional deposits shows how different strategies can be pursued based on the risk tolerance to USDe haircuts.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"future-plans-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#future-plans-11\"></a>Future Plans</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"allocation-framework-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#allocation-framework-12\"></a>Allocation Framework</h2>\n<p>In our opinion, Maker governance should consider the risk related data (covered above) as well as the weighted average borrow rates of the Spark DAI Vault when deciding on what returns justify continued DAI allocation. <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> will only provide additional recommendations if the risk/return is favorable and the overall exposure is sustainable.

For example, we recently requested that a more formal bug bounty and responsible disclosure program be put in place.

The solution can only be used in cases of extreme emergencies such as potential code exploits which have existential threat potential.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-and-argumentation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#motivation-and-argumentation-3\"></a>Motivation and Argumentation</h2>\n<p>SparkLend is based on Aave v3 code base, which implies that technical exploits or malfunctions can be replicated between the protocols in some cases. SparkLend strategy has been much more risk-averse compared to Aave, since only blue-chip highly liquid asset are considered and non-essential features are disabled, which will likely continue to be the case, as Aave is adding additional features in the upcoming V3.1 while SparkLend is continuing to remove them in addition to development of new safety features. Nevertheless, since Aave governance has the ability to pause the markets in the form of <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/governance/master/aave-guardians\">Aave Guardians</a> while SparkLend is currently subject to governance spell process, the potential exploit time window is much longer in SparkLend. For this reason, we believe it is important to have an emergency access ability to react in a timely manner in the case there is a known exploit identified and prevent potential existential threat to the Maker Ecosystem and users of SparkLend.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"technical-ability-and-maker-governance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#technical-ability-and-maker-governance-4\"></a>Technical Ability and Maker Governance</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x44efFc473e81632B12486866AA1678edbb7BEeC3\">multisig</a> can enable or disable the GSM delay exception <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x237e3985dD7E373F2ec878EC1Ac48A228Cf2e7a3\">SparkLend Freezer Mom</a> without a governance spell while the Maker governance can reverse the action via a spell or entirely remove the multisig access in case there is a suspicion that it could or did act maliciously, which means that governance preserves full control.</p>\n<p>In the case of malicious use of the multisig access, the governance would therefore execute an emergency spell to reverse the action and remove the multisig access, and additionally make the decision of potentially reinstating the multisig and replacing the rogue or compromised signers.</p>\n<p>The multisig at launch would be 2/n, the n being 5 with intention of increasing the amount of signers later in time. Initial list of signers consists of two members from Governance Facilitators, BA Labs as a member of Stability Scope Advisory Council and finally one member from Phoenix Labs, the development team behind SparkLend.

This includes the activate/disable pause or freeze function. Any changes to the signers of the multisig, either addition or removal are subject to the governance poll. Only exception is, when a signer self-reports a loss of access to their private key due to any reason or explicitly expresses their wish to be removed in the form of a comment under this forum post or a separate forum post. In such instances Maker governance should replace this specific signer as soon as possible. Any other changes, which were not executed due to self-reporting by individuals or ratified by the governance should be questioned immediately and likely considered malicious, at which point governance should consider executing a spell to remove access from the multisig.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conditions-and-guidelines-for-activation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conditions-and-guidelines-for-activation-5\"></a>Conditions and Guidelines For Activation</h2>\n<p>Since this access is a great responsibility, it is vital that conditions for activation of the pause and/or freeze are predefined to the extent which is possible.

They claimed to have evidence of an operational security breach involving the Aligned Delegate <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/truename\">@truename</a>.</p>\n<p>Endgame Edge has implemented a protocol to protect the sensitive information of ADs. We requested that the informant and the AD establish a secure communication channel so that the evidence could be presented and discussed privately. After the evidence was sent to True Name, the AD asked us to review the evidence and apply our judgment to evaluate the situation.</p>\n<p>The evidence, sent to me, consisted of on-chain transactions that showed a multisig, set up by True Name, that contained a signer who was also a signer of the multisig of one AVC Member, ACRE DAOs.</p>\n<p>I involved <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/jansky\">@JanSky</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/ldr\">@ldr</a> to assist with the investigation, and we confirmed that the evidence was accurate. We verified that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The multisig was created by True Name’s EA address on 7/4/2023.</li>\n<li>The signers of the multisig were True Name’s EA address and one of the current signers of ACRE DAO’s multisig.</li>\n<li>On the same day, 10 MKR were received from Coinbase and delegated to True Name.</li>\n<li>On 8/16/2023, the MKR were undelegated and transferred to Coinbase.</li>\n<li>The address was removed as a signer of the multisig by True Name’s EA address on the same day the whistleblower sent the evidence to the AD.</li>\n<li>The signer shared by both multisig wallets was recently added to ACRE DAO’s multisig on 2/2/2024.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then asked True Name and ACRE DAOs to provide explanations. The explanations we received indicated that an external entity related to the AVC member, contacted the AD, offering to delegate MKR and asking True Name to set up a multisig where both could be signers. We verified that this multisig was indeed used to receive MKR and self-delegate it to True Name.</p>\n<p>MKR delegation can be done completely anonymously and permissionlessly. There was no need for True Name to set up a multisig and handle MKR from an MKR holder. True Name should have been more cautious, as this is at least an operational security error or a failure to follow best practices. Under <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-operational-security\">MIP101 Section 2.6.6</a>, this situation requires the facilitator to immediately derecognize the AD. We also believe that this behavior could be considered against <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-5-aligned-delegate-alignment-risk-mitigation\">MIP101 Section 2.6.5</a>.</p>\n<p>At the time True Name created the multisig to receive the MKR, the sections of the Atlas were different, but the spirit of the sections was similar. For instance:</p>\n<p><strong>Section 2.6.5:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ADs are generally not allowed to engage directly with Ecosystem Actors and other counterparts to the DAO, or engage in other operational activities. They must remain focused on their job of using their physical voting power over the protocol to safeguard its alignment. Additionally, they must publicly provide governance information and research material to AVCs and can interact with ecosystem participants for this purpose. They are also not allowed to provide ‘kickbacks’ from their compensation to MKR holders that delegate to them. Any violation of these requirements constitutes breaching the Alignment Conserver requirements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Section 2.6.6.1:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>FacilitatorDAOs must err on the side of caution and act in case there is any kind of real possibility that the privacy of an AD is compromised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Section 2.6.5.1:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a FacilitatorDAO finds that an AD has performed a misaligned act or breached their requirements, they can derecognize the AD and confiscate their AD Buffer. The AD Buffer can be used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor provided useful data, information, or evidence that led to the derecognition of the AD. GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of the whistleblower bounty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, as the purpose of these sections is to protect the protocol, we interpret that they must be applied <strong>retroactively in their current status</strong>. This is because if the operational security of the AD was compromised before the introduction of the rule, it creates the same harm as if it were compromised afterward, resulting in an AD with poor operational security.</p>\n<p>After carefully discussing the situation and considering the on-chain evidence and explanations from both parties, we (JanSky, Ldr, and VoteWizard) have unanimously decided that the situation warrants the derecognition of True Name.</p>\n<p>We have also decided to issue an <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-4-1\">official warning</a> to ACRE DAOs, as the address added as a signer to True Name’s multisig was also a signer of ACRE DAOs’ multisig. We have received and understood their explanation, which mentioned that this is a different legal person and not the same entity as ACRE DAOs. However, the address was connected to ACRE DAOs as it was the singer of its multisig, and we do not want to set a precedent in which an AVC member can collaborate with an AD to set up a multisig to handle MKR for them.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"whistleblower-bounty-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#whistleblower-bounty-1\"></a>Whistleblower Bounty</h2>\n<p>As per <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-operational-security\">MIP101 Section 2.6.6</a>, part of the AD’s buffer is designated as a whistleblower bounty to the informant, under specific conditions. We believe that these conditions have been satisfied, but we will provide confirmation in a subsequent post.</p>\n<br>\n<p>To conclude, Endgame Edge extends our deepest gratitude to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/truename\">@truename</a> for their invaluable contributions to MakerDAO</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ad-derecognition-due-to-operational-security-breach-april-5-2024/24043\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ad-derecognition-due-to-operational-security-breach-april-5-2024/24043","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 23:45:04 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24043"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ad-derecognition-due-to-operational-security-breach-april-5-2024/24043.rss","#text":"AD Derecognition due to Operational Security Breach - April 5, 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"BlockTower Credit - Monthly Report (03/01/24 - 03/31/24)","dc:creator":"BlockTower","category":"General Discussion","description":"<h3><a name=\"preamble-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#preamble-1\"></a>Preamble</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">Title: BlockTower Credit Monthly Arranger Report\nPeriod: 02/29/24 - 03/31/24\nPosted: 04/05/24\nAuthor: @BlockTower\nTags: @Recognized-Delegates @Aes @roo\nIlks: RWA012-A, RWA013-A\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a name=\"references-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#references-2\"></a>References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-collateral-onboarding-application-blocktower-credit-arranger/16900/1\">BlockTower Credit (Arranger) Collateral Onboarding Application</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocktower-credit-commercial-and-legal-risk-assessment-part-i/18790\">BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part I</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocktower-credit-commercial-and-legal-risk-assessment-part-ii/18791\">BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part II</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-blocktower-credit-transaction-documents/19019\">BlockTower Credit Legal Transaction Documents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"executive-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#executive-summary-3\"></a>Executive Summary</h3>\n<p>During this reporting period, we sourced and settled 3 new assets.

In this article, let’s look under the hood with a money-view lens.</p>\n<p>Ethena is more or less a tokenized cash-and-carry trade product where they hold a long spot crypto position (e.g. ETH) and short it on the future market. There are a few twists (we are in crypto after all), but it is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.financialresearch.gov/working-papers/files/OFRwp-21-01-hedge-funds-and-the-treasury-cash-futures-disconnect.pdf\">Treasury cash-futures basis trade</a> from TradFi. The crypto cash-future arbitrage isn’t new. It was nicknamed as the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-18/crypto-s-money-printing-machine-has-turned-back-on-for-now?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;sref=QrVPDIHG\">“the closest thing to a risk-free bet”</a> by Bloomberg in 2021, it’s back. I would suggest reading the excellent BIS paper <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1087.pdf\">Crypto-Carry</a> . As we are in the middle of a bull market the yield of such a strategy generally increases with upward volatility and has ranged from <a href=\"https://app.ethena.fi/dashboards/yields\">20-120% APY</a>. This is a significant yield for a “close to risk-free bet” which has attracted significant interest with Ethena growing from $100mm in deposits in early January 2024 to nearly $2B as of this writing (April 3rd, 2024).</p>\n<p>Given the attractive risk/reward, MakerDAO voted to take an indirect exposure to it through collateralized loans backed by sUSDe. What happened is depicted in the diagram below. Starting with assets like T-Bills earning around 5% (as always there are some simplifications), Maker decided to finance crypto-backed loans instead. As you can expect, there were some speculators that wanted more exposure to the 60% organic yield of sUSDe, and were more than happy to use leverage (which even at a funding cost is below the sUSDe yield). The operation didn’t change the balance sheet size of MakerDAO nor its liabilities. It was simply an asset swap. It doesn’t directly impact the DAI holders balance sheet. The US government loses some funding for the benefit of speculators, but I doubt it makes a difference.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptobanking.network/?attachment_id=537\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/4/446462e06f990b6d786a59e03a100e9456cfba6f.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9L1xL6n0t3CyNCVM9oYH2GRneIT\" width=\"690\" height=\"507\" role=\"presentation\"></a></p>\n<p>MakerDAO has been doing crypto-backed loans since its creation, it’s the bread and butter of the Maker Protocol. What is new is that Morpho was used instead of Maker vault or the newest Spark lending protocol. While Morpho is newer, it is considered by some more secure due to its small and immutable codebase.</p>\n<p>Like any highly leveraged loan, the issue is the price feed. Contrary to TradFi, crypto doesn’t wait to liquidate when the collateral is no longer sufficient. Nonetheless, fast liquidations can sometimes be more of a problem than a solution. If there is stress in the market and people start to dump sUSDe, it will quickly depeg from its underlying price (or net asset value), leading to more liquidation and a larger depeg. This could easily lead to liquidation at a price lower than the loaned amount even if there is just a short time of market dislocation. It relates to the very old question about mark-to-model vs mark-to-market.</p>\n<p>High leverage and fixed price is not unprecedented, Maker previously had a <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/collateral/GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A\">loan facility for DAI/USDC liquidity pool</a> which let people take a 50x leverage position. The USDC price was fixed at par with DAI. This means the market price didn’t have any influence on liquidations.</p>\n<p>With a fixed price oracle, liquidation only happens when the interest accrued puts the position as liquidable. It is a slow process. One has then a few days, maybe even weeks, to process the liquidation before incurring bad debt. That is at the fixed price. The actual real price might be another story. This is where it becomes asset transmutation.</p>\n<p>Let assume sUSDe loses 10% of value during a sustained period of negative funding rates. Lets also assume that the loan-to-value was just below 95%, and that a position gets liquidated at 95% and that there is no liquidation penalty (a bounty for people doing liquidation). The speculator is therefore wiped out and loses everything. The position can’t be liquidated because at this stage Morpho still considers that everything is fine due to the fixed price.</p>\n<p>What will happen is that interest will accrue, increasing the size of the crypto-backed loan (both on the liabilities of the speculator and on the asset side of MakerDAO). In the diagram below, the impairment red box represents the difference in sUSDe and for the crypto-backed loan due to the price discrepancy. Notice that as interest accrues, the equity of the speculator shrinks (even with the fixed price) and MakerDAO equity increases (all fictitious in reality). At some point, even with the wrong price, the speculator will be wiped out and liquidation will be possible. One must notice that the liquidation price will still be in a non-impaired position. Therefore, no one will have any economic incentive to liquidate the position. No one but MakerDAO. MakerDAO just has to mint some DAI to repay the crypto-backed loan that it owns (the minted DAI being burned at the end). This is an atomic transaction that will delete the crypto-backed loan and move the collateral (sUSDe) from the speculator to MakerDAO. Assuming sUSDe on the MakerDAO balance sheet is valued at mark-to-market, it will realize the losses on the MakerDAO equity position (and revert all fictitious interest accrued).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptobanking.network/?attachment_id=539\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/2/626fc8a8aa26dc6148150fd7f82038e1d7e27df9.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"e2OhQsHI2YztxRqWgswvyZdeGvf\" width=\"683\" height=\"800\" role=\"presentation\"></a></p>\n<p>As one can see, from a secured lender, MakerDAO is now directly invested in sUSDe. Depending on the loss on sUSDe and the equity buffer of MakerDAO at the time, DAI holders may or may not be impacted.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, what is better a crypto-backed loan or investing directly in sUSDe? It’s actually nuanced. Crypto-backed loans allow to trade a slice of the yield for a junior tranche that will take first losses. In case of some negative funding rates and/or small operational losses, it will protect MakerDAO completely. In case of a more significant loss, this protection will be less effective. One can also consider the evolution of MakerDAO liquidity. Is a crypto-backed loan more or less liquid than a direct position in sUSDe? It is difficult to determine. Crypto-backed loans in DeFi have (for most) no maturity and liquidity is achieved by increasing interest rate, at worst until liquidation. sUSDe liquidity seems to be seven days. Therefore, it is hard to say which one is truly more liquid.</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/money-view-of-the-makerdao-morpho-ethena-drama/24026\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/money-view-of-the-makerdao-morpho-ethena-drama/24026","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Apr 2024 18:36:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24026"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/money-view-of-the-makerdao-morpho-ethena-drama/24026.rss","#text":"Money view of the MakerDAO/Morpho/Ethena drama"},"filter":false},{"title":"Stability.makerendgame.com: Dashboard & Alerts","dc:creator":"ecosystem-team","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Ecosystem acting as the Stability Scope Facilitator has replaced <a href=\"http://psm.makerendgame.com\">psm.makerendgame.com</a> with <a href=\"http://stability.makerendgame.com\">stability.makerendgame.com</a>.

The AVCs impact on Maker Governance is to make marginal improvements to the Alignment Artifacts that strengthen them</em>.” And for this purpose they must hold weekly meetings to analyze and discuss the scopes and present a final quarter document proposing improvements for them” Likewise, according to<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-4-alignment-conserver-ac-bootstrapping-focus\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> MIP113 12.4</a> during the Bootstrapping stage: “<em>AVCs must devote the majority of their time and energy towards discussing, understanding and assisting in the creation of the Next Generation Atlas and how to incorporate AI efficiently into governance, and this priority supersedes their other responsibilities</em>”.</p>\n<p>From Sovereign Finance AVC, we remain fully committed to support the vision and roadmap drawn for the Endgame, MakerDAO continues to have our full support and commitment to that goal. While we anticipate beginning our responsibilities as reviewers of the new Atlas, as outlined in <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/le_bateleur\">@Le_Bateleur</a>’s proposed workflow (Atlas Axis), as well as proposing improvements for the Scopes, we are consistently evaluating the most effective role for AVCs in Maker’s current ‘pre-game’ stage. I’m constantly asking myself how we can be most helpful, how we can work well with the ADs, Ecosystem Actors, and other AVCs to support the protocol as it moves toward the Endgame.</p>\n<p>In this search, since the beginning of Sovereign Finance AVC and during this quarter we have promoted various measures to bring these issues to debate, to this purpose in all previous proposal documents we have focused on making concrete structured proposals to, for example, regulate procedures established in the Atlas and in the Scopes that required development, understanding that this will have a positive impact on the governance processes of the protocol. Some of these proposals were voted on and approved following the governance process, which makes us very proud and we are expecting these rules will be tested in practice to see if the design has been correct or if they deserve some improvement. We have also invited several relevant MakerDAO stakeholders and outsiders to our subcommittee meetings in order to encourage the discussion of different aspects of the protocol. But also, both during the meetings and in Sovereign Finance AVC Discord channel we have promoted the above mentioned debates on what should be the role of the AVCs, its working methodology, and its relationship with the ADs and other actors, both in the Next Generation Atlas development and in the regular tasks of scope improvement proposals. We have even promoted debates in the forum that have received valuable feedback from some ADs (<a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/participation-requirements-for-ads-that-follow-sovereign-finance-avc/21800/26\">participation rules</a> and<a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sovereign-finance-avc-year-review-and-request-for-feedback/23238\"> final balance of 2023 and request for feedback</a>) that have strengthened concepts that we had and provided a different view on others, forcing us to review them, and have triggered new questions and issues that we have addressed in our meetings and in the forum and that we have not yet answered.</p>\n<p>I’m convinced that the role of the AVCs is not to be mere spectators and commentators of the forum, nor to fulfill the minimum requirements of participation without causing concrete impact, that the mere presentation of the proposal documents in each quarter is not the most adequate way to cause a real impact, since I wonder how many actors of the Maker Governance read them in detail and take concrete actions on that (the last months have demonstrated that if the AVCs are not the ones who promote the presentation of their own proposals, the proposal documents do not cause any real and concrete impact). I also wonder if MakerDAO is still interested in developing the role of the Advisory Council (Scope Advisor) and in designating its members. In the <a href=\"https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Q4-2023-Sovereign-Finance-AVC-Aligned-Scope-Proposals-Document-48b82f0fe66e492c8de7e51f968c86f8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Q4 2023 Sovereign Finance AVC Proposal Document</a>, and based on the great contribution made by the PD <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/blue\">@BLUE</a>, we have developed a proposal to hire by Peer-to-Peer Recruitment Process, as one of our objectives is to address the issue of the shortage of candidates for all the available positions, particularly within the Advisory Council, and the proposal introduced we understood that it provided a solution through a system that would allow MakerDAO access to a wider pool of potential candidates, increasing the chances of finding the right talent, encourages community members to actively participate in the recruitment process, fostering greater collaboration and knowledge exchange within the ecosystem, diversifies the talent pool, potentially leading to more innovative ideas and perspectives. But this proposal has not had any impact. As a counterpart, and with our permanent search to test the limits and processes, like I said before, we have also worked and submitted other proposals to regulate processes outside Article 1 that have had an impact, have been voted and approved according to the governance processes (as you can see approved proposals <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmXGpSg6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmcfSMLd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWysdwh\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>, which respectively have been based on Sovereign Finance’s<a href=\"https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Q2-2023-Sovereign-Finance-AVC-Aligned-Scope-Proposals-Document-c6fd67db5a8d4ad9b79ddac32e9931ce\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Q2 2023</a> and<a href=\"https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Q3-2023-Sovereign-Finance-AVC-Aligned-Scope-Proposals-Document-b30afb0b07d5467f877be31ba7598dd6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Q3 2023</a> proposal documents). We persist in this search, questioning whether the activity carried out by the AVCs, including our own, aligns with Maker’s objectives. From Sovereign Finance AVC, we contemplate alternative approaches and visions for our work, aiming to determine the most effective and productive means of collaboration with our ADs.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback received</strong></p>\n<p>I thank the Aligned Delegates following Sovereign Finance AVC, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/blue\">@BLUE</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/cloaky\">@cloaky</a>, for their valuable feedback provided in response to our<a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sovereign-finance-avc-year-review-and-request-for-feedback/23238\"> request for feedback made in the forum</a> on the role of the AVCs and ours in particular. I highly appreciate their input, have thoroughly reviewed and analyzed it, and have taken appropriate action accordingly. Moving forward, Sovereign Finance AVC is contemplating implementing certain modifications to our workflow based on their suggestions during the next quarter. Additionally, we reaffirm our commitment to retaining aspects with which they felt comfortable and at ease.</p>\n<p>In this sense, Sovereign Finance AVC will continue inviting experts from MakerDAO and outsiders to analyze different aspects of the protocol with the intention of contributing different visions and perspectives. While Atlas’s workload remains a top priority for MakerDAO, we will persist in offering concrete proposals to enhance different scopes. Additionally, we will make adjustments based on accumulated experience, feedback from stakeholders, and observations from other AVCs. In the immediate future, following the suggestion of our delegate <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/blue\">@BLUE</a>, we will consider sharing the agenda in advance with the ADs. This will enable the ADs to prepare relevant questions or comments for the meeting. However, it’s important to note that sometimes this may pose challenges due to last-minute confirmations from our guests, which can complicate our ability to communicate the agenda effectively. Additionally, we will endeavor to provide the ADs following our AVC with advance information regarding potential questions and answers on topics slated for discussion. This will afford them adequate time to reflect and prepare responses to assist us in our work.</p>\n<p>We agree with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/cloaky\">@cloaky</a>’s insight. We will continue to propose concrete solutions and express our clear stance on different issues. We will seek support from ADs following Sovereign Finance AVC to reinforce our positions, as this has been our guiding vision from day one. Furthermore, we are committed to fostering deeper engagement in this regard. We will persist in encouraging active participation and feedback from our delegates, in accordance with our<a href=\"https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Sovereign-Finance-AVC-Operational-Manual-289ed64373574a49bb0ea14c2ffbe706\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Operations Manual</a>, which initially proved effective. However, I have observed a degree of laxity over time, both from the delegates’ side and in our requirements of them, particularly in terms of presenting opinions, providing feedback, and contributing to the development and enhancement of our proposals ahead of meetings.</p>\n<p>I also share the opinion of the AD <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/blue\">@BLUE</a> that the nature of the AVC allows great adaptability and flexibility and based on this, the debate that we are having internally in the AVC as well as promoting it externally will inevitably lead to changes in Sovereign Finance AVC’s working methods over time, as we have done so far, we will continue testing the processes, we will continue testing the limits, we will continue always in the search of making the biggest positive impact for MakerDAO, adapting to the changes, and with a view to these objectives, we are analyzing and we do not discard to try new mechanisms of participation and development of the weekly meetings, which obviously will be properly announced to our ADs and to the Maker Community in general.</p>\n<p><strong>Address the debate on some of the AVCs powers</strong></p>\n<p>Picking up the thoughts that <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/libertas\">@Libertas</a> (KISS AVC Member) <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/some-thoughts-on-the-role-of-avcs-in-makerdao/23724\">proposed to discuss</a>, I kindly request AVCs and ADs, whether or not they are involved as “Drafters” in the development of the Next Generation Atlas, to a discussion to think about different solutions and propose improvements in the Alignment Artifacts related to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>What information gathering power should AVCs have? Should Ecosystem Actors and Scope Advisor be obliged to respond? These days, AVCs often run into situations where we don’t get responses to our information requests from Ecosystem Actors. This poses a challenge for AVCs because we often need specific information, context, or input to draft our Proposal Documents. How can we fulfill our tasks as outlined by the Atlas if we can’t effectively request information? The Atlas grants AVCs a role of significant importance, even formal power, though in practice their power and influence may seem limited. Situations like the inability to request information are precisely what undermine the power bestowed upon AVCs by the Atlas. I believe it’s crucial to establish clear procedures, effective mechanisms, and reasonable deadlines for both Ecosystem Actors and Scope Advisors to provide necessary information when formally requested by registered AVCs (not necessarily to everyone in the forum). Additionally, I believe that sanctions should be considered if they fail to fulfill this responsibility. I kindly request AVCs and ADs to address this debate and propose clear rules for this key circumstance so that AVCs can effectively fulfill the role assigned to them by the Atlas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How should the relationship between AVCs and ADs be? Could AVCs ban ADs who vote contrary to their opinions or to a proposal elaborated by the AVC they follow? This subject has been hotly debated during this Q1 and I understand that it is a debate that remains open and deserves to be addressed. At Sovereign Finance AVC we have not reached a common and consensual position on this issue. My strictly personal view on this is: During Bootstrapping stage: According<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-4-alignment-conserver-ac-bootstrapping-focus\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> MIP 113 12.4</a>, unless it’s about proposals from Article 1, I believe an AVC shouldn’t have the authority to enforce disciplinary measures, such as bans, on ADs who vote against their proposals. However, I believe that it’s essential for ADs to communicate their voting intentions beforehand, justify their decisions, and be open to discussion that could lead to a change of opinion. Post-bootstrapping: According<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-2-aligned-governance-strategy-links-gsls-\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Atlas 2.6.2</a>, if an AD votes against the AVC proposal that is related to their Aligned Governance Strategy, they could be subject to a ban. However, if the AD believes that voting in favor might lead to a misaligned action, being this a serious accusation against the following AVC, the AD must provide a clear and justified explanation for their dissent. Therefore, I believe it’s important for the AD to have the opportunity to explain their vote and provide proper justification. The situation is different if the ADs infringe the rules of participation set out by the following AVC, in which case I believe the AVC could ban them for that reason. I kindly request AVCs and ADs to think and analyze these topics in order to propose improvements in the Alignment Artifacts or in the drafting of the Next Generation Atlas that will give clarity and certainty to how the interaction between AVCs and ADs should be.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Addressing the debate on strengthening certain aspects of Maker Governance</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, I also wonder if the governance processes deserve a modification and how AVCs can contribute in this area. I notice that there is not enough debate and participation in each proposal presented in the forum, and that, in part, may be due to certain practices that are commonly repeated and that I understand should be corrected.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We all noticed a use of the GOV12.1 mechanism to bypass the normal discussion periods for executing proposals that generates many concerns and questions both for us and for different governance actors with whom we have debated this topic in our meetings. I understand that this is a necessary mechanism for certain circumstances that justify it, but its abuse should be avoided.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have also all noticed how it has been lately a usual way of presenting proposals in the forum, presenting blank proposals and posting the content of a MIP 102c2 Sub Proposal the last day of the RFC, shortly before the Minimum Frozen Period begins and just moving it to formal submission, which fulfills the formal requirements established in the <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP0#resumen-largo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MIP0</a> and <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP102\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MIP102</a> but brings important limitations to the debate.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I wonder about this last topic. Since<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-5-1-1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> ATLAS 2.5.1.1</a> establishes that “<em>AVC act through proposing modifications to the Scope Artifacts</em>”, is it appropriate for the ACVs to propose modifications to the MIP102 to establish guidelines that address the circumstance detailed above or would this a misaligned conduct for exceeding its scope of competence? Could the AVCs develop proposals on this topic, but not include them in their quarterly Proposal Documents, but present them in the forum for discussion and voting? Could the AVCs at least propose and participate in the debate on this topic and collaborate with other governance actors such as the ADs to develop concrete proposals?

1 April 2024","dc:creator":"monet-supply","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<p>In this post, we review early performance data from the Morpho Spark DAI vault and make recommendations for parameter and allocation adjustments.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"performance-and-pool-selection-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#performance-and-pool-selection-1\"></a>Performance and Pool Selection</h3>\n<p>The Spark DAI vault saw strong demand almost immediately upon launch. While it is too early to definitively judge relative efficiency of various LLTV pools, as they have not yet had time to reach stable equilibrium, we saw a few clear trends of user demand based on the order of pools becoming fully utilized. Users showed a strong preference for USDe over sUSDe pools, and also showed a preference for higher over lower leverage, particularly preferring pools with LLTV of 86% and above.</p>\n<p>Users’ preference for USDe (offering 7x points currently) over sUSDe (offering 5x points plus ~30% yield) suggests they are highly valuing Ethena points and opportunity to earn ENA tokens. While the points program is being <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0xF99d0E4E3435cc9C9868D1C6274DfaB3e2721341/GTbzFynrve4gzSjIEKL0vz7Kq0UHkIiekHkup0EXgjU\">updated today</a>, there will still be significant incentives for using USDe and sUSDe collateral on Morpho. Given this preference for points over cash yield, it may be prudent to allocate a greater share of DAI towards USDe pools going forward. This comes with an additional benefit of slightly lower liquidity risk for the collateral, as USDe can be redeemed via Ethena immediately while sUSDe must wait for a 1 week unstaking period before redemption. Allocation to USDe also allows Ethena to retain a greater share of revenue for their insurance fund, which over time can improve the risk profile of Maker’s Ethena allocation. Ethena’s revised points program (“sats” program) will continue to favor USDe over sUSDe, with 20x daily sats per USDe collateral vs 5x sats per sUSDe collateral.</p>\n<p>We’ve also seen the 77% LLTV pools fill up significantly more slowly versus other pools. Based on this, we anticipate that the equilibrium borrow rates supported by these pools will be lower than alternatives, and overall efficiency (borrow rate paid divided by LLTV) may also lag higher LLTV pools.</p>\n<p>Given the above factors, and to help reduce UX complexity caused by offering many different pools, we believe the Spark DAI vault should focus future allocations into the 86% and 91.5% LLTV pool, and more heavily weight USDe versus sUSDe collateral. The 77% and 94.5% LLTV pools can continue to see allocations but at a somewhat lower proportion of deployed assets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"vault-risk-factors-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#vault-risk-factors-2\"></a>Vault Risk Factors</h3>\n<p>We conducted a review of vault risk in our previous post <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-usde-morpho-lending-integration/23924\">here</a>. In this section we review the previously identified risk factors in light of current vault and Ethena protocol status, and consider a few additional risk factors that impact the vault’s risk profile as allocation size increases.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"morpho-rate-models-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#morpho-rate-models-3\"></a>Morpho Rate Models</h4>\n<p>Currently the Spark DAI vault’s pools are all essentially fully utilized, with borrow rates below users’ willingness to pay. After the ENA token generation event and adjustment of points programs, we expect willingness to pay to drop somewhat, and potentially stabilize below the then current optimal borrow rate for the pools (expected to be 50%+ for most pools by mid next week). If this is the case, utilization will fall and Maker’s overall revenue will decline, while the maximum potential losses in a tail risk event will remain the same (up to the full amount deployed to the pool). Given that the next Ethena points season will run until the earlier of September or when USDe reaches $5 billion market capitalization, this potential disruption caused by changes to the points program isn’t expected to recur frequently.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"custody-and-exchange-transparency-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#custody-and-exchange-transparency-4\"></a>Custody and Exchange Transparency</h4>\n<p>Ethena’s dashboard shows a breakdown of collateral by asset and which exchange it is currently pledged to, data as of 30 March is shown below. This breakdown is expected to closely track the distribution of Ethena’s perp hedge positions across exchanges, but may not be 100% aligned as certain positions could use more or less than 1x leverage. We would like to see deeper transparency into futures hedging positions, ideally including dollar value of positions per exchange and per product (eg. linear vs inverse perpetuals, dated futures, etc). This will become more important as Ethena begins to use additional assets such as BTC for delta neutral positions, or potentially allocates a portion of backing to dated futures.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/e/8e77be5066ded83566750240b55aa0de381442e1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kkklGXzVUtLZf4bLc8VvMlREFGx.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/e/8e77be5066ded83566750240b55aa0de381442e1_2_624x291.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"kkklGXzVUtLZf4bLc8VvMlREFGx\" width=\"624\" height=\"291\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/e/8e77be5066ded83566750240b55aa0de381442e1_2_624x291.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/e/8e77be5066ded83566750240b55aa0de381442e1.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/e/8e77be5066ded83566750240b55aa0de381442e1.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1D232B\"></a></div><br>\n<a href=\"https://app.ethena.fi/dashboards/positions\">Ethena Dashboard</a><p></p>\n<p>While Ethena discloses deposit addresses for off exchange custody providers, funds are currently not held in individual onchain addresses after being deposited. This limits transparency for custody balances after the point of initial deposit, and a breakdown of funds per custodian is currently not provided by either Ethena or the custodians themselves. We’d like to see improvement in transparency here as well, including live or near live data provided by Ethena and periodic (at least weekly) assertions from the custodians of AUC attributable to Ethena. Implementation of segregated onchain addresses to hold Ethena collateral would significantly improve transparency.</p>\n<p>We can assume that roughly 50% of collateral is held with Ceffu based on the fact that Copper and Cobo are not approved for trading on Binance, but a more thorough breakdown would be helpful for assessing overall risk to the structure. Greater transparency would also help Maker understand differences between reported collateral balances and USDe in circulation, where there is frequently a discrepancy of tens of millions of dollars, likely caused by assets under custody that have not been pledged to an exchange or delays in data reporting.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"custody-and-exchange-counterparty-risk-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#custody-and-exchange-counterparty-risk-5\"></a>Custody and Exchange Counterparty Risk</h4>\n<p>Currently (as of 30 March), Ethena reports 51% of exchange collateral (48% of total USDe backing) is pledged to Binance, by implication held at Ceffu. With Binance and Ceffu sharing the same ultimate beneficial owner, our current assessment is that they may be under common control and should not be considered independent for the purposes of assessing counterparty risk. Other custodians are independent of exchanges, and provide a higher level of assurance against misappropriation or impairment in the event of exchange failure.</p>\n<p>We also note $185 million of wbETH collateral (~12% of backing) on Binance and $80 million of mETH collateral (~5% of backing) on Bybit. wbETH is a fully custodial managed product so has essentially 100% counterparty exposure to Binance. While mETH is a decentralized product managed under Mantle DAO and a security council multisig with 6 of 13 threshold, we have seen Bybit exert significant pressure on Mantle governance in the past; for example Mantle DAO voted to prevent FTX from converting BIT tokens to MNT, linked with a wider dispute between the FTX trustee and Mirana. So while mETH’s Bybit exposure isn’t as concrete as wbETH and Binance, there remains a non-negligible counterparty risk from using mETH as collateral while trading on Bybit.</p>\n<p>We also note a <a href=\"https://archive.is/hiUm0\">news report</a> about a party hosted by custodian Copper after the recent DAS conference. While this doesn’t have a direct bearing on risk, it can potentially demonstrate weak management and internal company culture, and bears some similarities to the <a href=\"https://x.com/zoeSaintBernard/status/1486123668342116353?s=20\">culture issues</a> present at Prime Trust. Custodians should be expected to have better judgment and higher standards of professional conduct.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"lst-collateral-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#lst-collateral-6\"></a>LST Collateral</h4>\n<p>LST exposure at Ethena represents one of the key systemic risks of the project. If derivatives funding rates fall into the negative range and Ethena is forced to unwind delta neutral positions (either due to users redeeming USDe, or to reallocate to other collateral backing), they may end up selling a significant amount of LST collateral, pushing these assets below peg and creating a long staking exit queue. Large discounts would then tend to create further downward pressure on funding rates, as arbitrageurs would use short derivatives positions to hedge their ETH exposure when buying LSTs below peg. The presence of positive feedback loops here could severely impact LST secondary market liquidity in concentrated liquidity AMMs and destabilize defi protocols that rely on LST collateral.</p>\n<p>Presently, liquid staking tokens comprise roughly 22% of total Ethena backing. This proportion has been falling steadily as USDe’s circulating supply has grown over the past weeks, and now represents a fairly small level of exposure. The Ethena Labs team has communicated they intend to continue to reduce proportional exposure as they grow, and view LST collateral as more helpful in bear market conditions when the collateral yield is important to offset low or negative funding rates. Reduction in LST backing is positive from a risk perspective as this reduces USDe’s exposure to hacks, slashing, LST custody and counterparty risks, potential discount and depegs due to liquidity constraints, and overall systemic risk to the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We also note that the exposure to LST collateral is now significantly below the amount of staked USDe. Given that sUSDe has a 7 day period for unstaking before it can be redeemed, this may help buffer Ethena’s liquidity and duration risk from holding LSTs, as they may be able to directly redeem LST collateral if they see a rush of unstaking requests, rather than being forced to sell on the secondary market.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"stablecoin-collateral-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#stablecoin-collateral-7\"></a>Stablecoin Collateral</h4>\n<p>Based on reported exchange collateral data, Ethena has at least 21% exposure to USDT collateral. USDT is also the primary quote and settlement asset used for linear perpetual contracts across exchanges, and the most frequently used asset for primary market minting and redemptions of USDe. Given these exposures and touchpoints, we conclude that Ethena has existential levels of risk exposure to Tether. A significant depeg or impairment to USDT would cause severe impact on primary market liquidity for USDe and may also cause capital losses. Once the current high growth phase subsides, Ethena is expected to shift towards smaller USDT balances in the 3-5% range, just enough to cover primary market liquidity needs and PNL settlement. Shifting a portion of stablecoin collateral from USDT to USDC may help improve USDe’s risk profile from Maker’s perspective, as Maker already has significant direct exposure to USDC but has remained fairly insulated from Tether. Additionally, trading with inverse perpetuals or linear perpetuals with USDC rather than USDT margin may reduce this indirect Tether exposure.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"risk-evaluation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#risk-evaluation-8\"></a>Risk Evaluation</h3>\n<p>Evaluating risk for Ethena requires subjective judgment, as the overwhelming majority of relevant risk factors are qualitative in nature. For example, the likelihood of counterparty risks emerging is fundamentally a qualitative assessment about creditworthiness and competence of various entities involved in the product. We have created a workbook to aggregate loss probability distributions of various risk factors to USDe, and provided reference inputs based on our best judgement of the likelihood of various types of failures. Users are welcome to test their own assumptions for inputs to derive different outputs.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/7/d733f38dfc0fdd7cbf593ca93456932f881c6315.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uHLXBUGtxkNKth9Tq9SLPObomUZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/7/d733f38dfc0fdd7cbf593ca93456932f881c6315_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"uHLXBUGtxkNKth9Tq9SLPObomUZ\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/7/d733f38dfc0fdd7cbf593ca93456932f881c6315_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/7/d733f38dfc0fdd7cbf593ca93456932f881c6315_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/7/d733f38dfc0fdd7cbf593ca93456932f881c6315.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F6F5\"></a></div><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfKr-haq1AIlFha_4DoIO3sRdk7BG7Xu7_CZMwc88R8/edit?usp=sharing\">sUSDe Review - 1 April 2024</a><p></p>\n<p>The primary model outputs are values for <code>risk premia</code> (an annualized measure of expected losses) and <code>probability of catastrophic loss</code> (potential for Maker to face losses exceeding the capacity to recapitalize through surplus buffer and debt auctions). Risk premia is useful to assess whether returns are adequate, and funds should be removed from allocation to USDe if returns are not at least high enough to cover Maker’s cost of capital (DSR), the risk premia, plus a spread for profitability and to account for uncertainty of risk premia. Probability of catastrophic loss figures can help set overall exposure limits, as this value should be kept to an acceptably low limit. However, the above risk metrics are only a rough estimate, and may over or underweight certain risk factors.</p>\n<p>When evaluating probability of catastrophic losses, we judge Maker’s loss absorbing capacity to be the expected surplus buffer balance (surplus buffer upper limit) plus 5% of outstanding DAI supply; we’ve seen other protocols such as Frax Finance have been able to manage negative equity well above this amount for prolonged periods without facing a bank run, so this threshold seems like a conservative but reasonable estimate of Maker’s financial capacity. We believe that debt ceiling should be constrained to ensure no more than 2% likelihood of exceeding this threshold, which puts catastrophic risk attributable to Ethena on par with other tail risk exposures at Maker including the protocols’ internal technical risk and risks attributable to the Ethereum base layer.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"parameter-recommendation-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#parameter-recommendation-9\"></a>Parameter Recommendation</h3>\n<p><strong>BA Labs recommends the Stability Facilitator to propose increasing the Spark MetaMorpho Vault DDM DC-IAM Line, corresponding MetaMorpho Vault supply caps and recommended dai allocation across the markets, which can go directly to the upcoming executive vote according to the language of the Stability Scope article 5.3.2;</strong></p>\n<h4><a name=\"parameter-summary-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#parameter-summary-10\"></a>Parameter summary:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>DDM DC-IAM Parameters:\n<ul>\n<li><code>line</code>: 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li><code>gap</code>: 100 million DAI</li>\n<li><code>ttl</code>: 24 hours</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Metamorpho Vault Parameters:\n<ul>\n<li>Market Caps:\n<ul>\n<li>USDe 77% LLTV pool cap: 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 86% LLTV pool cap: 500 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 91.5% LLTV pool cap: 200 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 94.5% LLTV pool cap: 10 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 77% LLTV pool cap: 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 86% LLTV pool cap: 200 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 91.5% LLTV pool cap: 50 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 94.5% LLTV pool cap: 10 million DAI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Recommended Vault DAI allocations:\n<ul>\n<li>Total allocation across all pools: 600 million DAI (+ 500 million DAI)</li>\n<li>USDe 77% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI (+ 5 million DAI)</li>\n<li>USDe 86% LLTV allocation: 330 million DAI (+ 320 million DAI)</li>\n<li>USDe 91.5% LLTV allocation: 150 million DAI (+ 120 million DAI)</li>\n<li>USDe 94.5% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI (+ 5 million DAI)</li>\n<li>sUSDe 77% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI (+ 5 million DAI)</li>\n<li>sUSDe 86% LLTV allocation: 50 million DAI (+ 40 million DAI)</li>\n<li>sUSDe 91.5% LLTV allocation: 30 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 94.5% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI (+ 5 million DAI)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"reasoning-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#reasoning-11\"></a>Reasoning</h4>\n<p>In our previous risk assessment, we recommended some general guidelines to constrain total allocation to USDe and sUSDe, limiting exposure to the lower of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10% of total ETH perp OI - roughly 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li>30% of USDe supply including Maker exposure - 600 million DAI</li>\n<li>20% of DAI supply - 980 million DAI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that Ethena is expected to begin allocating to BTC based delta neutral positions in the near future, so futures positions will be spread across a much larger asset base and the total OI threshold will become less of a constraint. Generally, if Ethena collateral base, operations, or other key factors chance, then the assessment of suitable exposure limits will also need to be revisited.</p>\n<p>Using the lowest of the above thresholds yields 600 million maximum recommended exposure to USDe. This will scale up gradually as Ethena grows, but for the time being we believe it is prudent to cap total allocation at this level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we recommend limiting allocation to an amount and configuration that keeps the risk of severe losses to an acceptably low level. This minimizes the risk that Maker itself could face insolvency due to problems with USDe. The return earned on USDe collateral should also be at least high enough to compensate for Maker’s marginal cost of capital (DSR) and annualized expected losses from USDe exposure (risk premium). These metrics are estimated in the risk evaluation section above. Based on our reference loss probability distribution and loss absorbing capacity estimates, we assess that Maker could allocate up to ~800 million to USDe through the Morpho vault within acceptable risk thresholds.</p>\n<p>Based on the above metrics, we recommend limiting allocations to a maximum of 600 million DAI total for the time being. However, we recommend setting the DDM <code>line</code> parameter to 1 billion DAI, to reduce the amount of governance overhead required to increase exposure in the future if relevant constraints change (for example, if USDe circulating supply increases).</p>\n<p>While we recommend to focus deployment on the 86% and 91.5% LLTV pools based on expected risk/reward efficiency, we also recommend to marginally increase funds deployed to the 77% and 94.5% pools to 10 million DAI each (an increase of 5 million DAI per pool). Increased deposit size will ensure pools are large enough for users to efficiently manage their positions and respond to changing interest rates and collateral return. This allows Maker to gather continuing performance data from these pools with greater validity, and ensures that the interest rate models will be properly calibrated based on supply and demand if Maker chooses to allocate more funds to any of these pools in the future.</p>\n<p>As a final note, the recently revealed Ethena points program for season 2 caps total USDe and sUSDe collateral eligible for incentives on Morpho at $500 million. If demand to borrow DAI through the vault drops off after this threshold, the multisig should be empowered to reduce allocations below $600 million until reaching a reasonable supply/demand balance and return profile that aligns with expected return on collateral (this can be roughly estimated by looking at Pendle YT vs PT pricing dynamics).</p>\n            <p><small>10 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/morpho-spark-dai-vault-update-1-april-2024/24006\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/morpho-spark-dai-vault-update-1-april-2024/24006","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 16:55:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24006"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/morpho-spark-dai-vault-update-1-april-2024/24006.rss","#text":"Morpho Spark DAI Vault Update - 1 April 2024"},"filter":true},{"title":"Offering cash bonus for successful employment referrals","dc:creator":"cloaky","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>I am pleased to announce a monetary incentive for referrals. Should you introduce an individual who subsequently becomes a full-time member of my team, a reward of 1000 DAI awaits you. For those who refer candidates seeking part-time engagements, contributing at least 20 hours weekly, the reward is 500 DAI.</p>\n<p>I have composed a job description that elucidates the nature of the support I am seeking, which aims to contextualize the work drafters at Maker do in such a way that is comprehensible to the uninitiated. Below, you’ll find the job description, which you can use when sharing this opportunity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am reaching out to extend an invitation to those who harbor a profound enthusiasm for decentralized governance and/or game theory. This is an opportunity to deeply engage with the sphere of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), particularly to gain practical experience with MakerDAO, one of the most prominent DAOs in existence. MakerDAO, a multi-billion dollar protocol, is at the forefront of an unparalleled governance experiment designed to surmount the typical challenges encountered in decentralized governance systems. Your contribution could be pivotal.</p>\n<p>MakerDAO is evolving to align the self-interest of each participant within the ecosystem with MakerDAO’s objectives. This is achieved through the Atlas, a comprehensive governance document that delineates the actions and repercussions for various participant roles. Utilizing game theory to its maximum potential, the Atlas is structured to ensure that participants’ incentives are in harmony with the ecosystem’s best interests. Within this framework, a group known as Alignment Conservers is tasked with refining and implementing the Atlas to maintain this alignment. A subgroup, the Aligned Delegates, of which I am a member, exercises direct influence over voting and contributes to the Atlas’s enhancement through research and the development of amendments. I am equipped with budgetary resources to integrate additional support into my platform.</p>\n<p>The current focus of the Aligned Delegates is the development of the next-generation Atlas. To function effectively, the Atlas must be intricately detailed and descriptive, minimizing any ambiguity that could be exploited. To this end, Aligned Delegates are incorporating extensive supporting “data” in the form of structured text. We are specifically working on integrating two types of text data: Annotations and Action Tenets. Annotations clarify the context of terms with less apparent semantic meanings, and Action Tenets provide concrete, detailed legal instructions for the interpretation and execution of the Atlas’s components.</p>\n<p>This enhancement will significantly bolster the Atlas’s efficacy. Following this initial upgrade, the Atlas will be subject to continuous refinement, via a process outlined within its own framework. Artificial intelligence will be utilized in this ongoing process where feasible, and eventually, the Atlas will become so expansive and intricate that AI tools will be essential for its interpretation. These AI tools are currently under development. At this juncture, the Atlas will represent a fully operational, self-evolving autonomous organization without a central authority. The implications of such a system are vast, akin to AGI: a system - comprised of both human and AI elements - operating autonomously to perpetually self-improve, accumulate ecosystem intelligence, and strive towards shared objectives.</p>\n<p>I am involved in the drafting of this next-generation Atlas and am seeking to employ one or more individuals to support my initiatives. If this prospect excites you, I encourage you to make contact so we can discuss further. The potential for long-term engagement and professional development in this domain is substantial, and the experience gained would be highly esteemed within any protocol that employs decentralized governance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/offering-cash-bonus-for-successful-employment-referrals/24003\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/offering-cash-bonus-for-successful-employment-referrals/24003","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 15:06:24 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24003"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/offering-cash-bonus-for-successful-employment-referrals/24003.rss","#text":"Offering cash bonus for successful employment referrals"},"filter":false},{"title":"GOV12.1.2 Bootstrapping Edit Proposal - GOV10.2.3.1A Edit","dc:creator":"rema","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>Please consider adding the following language change to the Governance Scope element 10.2.3.1A, it is an extention of the Debt Ceiling Breaker GSM delay excaption for all crypto collateral vault types.

Some of the most notable progress has been made in developing network effects to boost crowdfunding of public goods, decentralizing and democratizing funding decision-making, and creating potential investment funnels in public goods based on retroactive funding.</p>\n<p>Quadratic Funding:</p>\n<p>QF is an application of quadratic voting that is designed to optimize the distribution of matching funds according to the preferences of the community. This is achieved by giving more weight to the number of people who support a cause over the total monetary amount going toward the cause. By democratizing the fund matching process QF incentivizes small donors to participate in the process and get an outsized influence over which projects get more funding. Meanwhile, large donors get social capital for funding the projects that the community wants to support.</p>\n<p>Retroactive Funding:</p>\n<p>Since it’s much easier to determine the impact of a public good after the fact instead of predicting expected impact, the idea of RF is to guarantee funding for successful public goods projects retroactively — once the impact is already assessed. By guaranteeing funding, an organization can create a market for VCs and individuals to invest in public goods based on their expected impact (instead of expected profitability).</p>\n<p>Impact Certificates:</p>\n<p>While both Quadratic Funding and Retroactive Funding require an external source of funding that can later create network effects around public goods funding, impact certificates attempt to create a market for public goods through speculation on the expected value of an NFT representing the impact of a public good. At the time of writing, this mechanism is still in early stages of development, and questions remain regarding the demand for such certificates (and whether market forces will drive investment based on actual impact, instead of distorting that market) but it shows how far the thinking in the field of regenerative economics has advanced compared to traditional funding models.”</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-4-articulating-a-clearer-vision-of-what-makers-public-good-purpose-system-could-look-like-based-on-the-spirit-of-the-rules-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-4-articulating-a-clearer-vision-of-what-makers-public-good-purpose-system-could-look-like-based-on-the-spirit-of-the-rules-12\"></a><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> Articulating a clearer vision of what Maker’s Public Good Purpose System could look like, based on the spirit of the rules.</h3>\n<h1><a name=\"refi-aligned-scope-proposals-q1-2024-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#refi-aligned-scope-proposals-q1-2024-13\"></a>ReFi Aligned Scope Proposals Q1 2024</h1>\n<h1><a name=\"regenerative-finance-aligned-voter-committee-refi-avc-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#regenerative-finance-aligned-voter-committee-refi-avc-14\"></a>Regenerative Finance Aligned Voter Committee (ReFi AVC)</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-of-proposals-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#summary-of-proposals-15\"></a>Summary of Proposals</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Maker Atlas Immutable &amp; Mutable Alignment Artifacts (the “Atlas”), Aligned Voter Committees (AVCs) are instructed to draft an Aligned Scope Proposal for each of the five (5) Scopes, specifically focusing on the Advisory Council Articles.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge the current effective version of <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-4-alignment-conserver-ac-bootstrapping-focus\">MIP113 : Alignment Conserver (AC) Bootstrapping Focus</a> provision pertaining to additional AVC requirements::</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AVCs must devote the majority of their time and energy towards discussing and understanding how the Next Generation Atlas will work and how to incorporate AI efficiently into long term governance and AVC operations, as well as assisting in the creation of the Next Generation Atlas. This priority supersedes their other responsibilities, and if an AVC Member has been deeply involved in Atlas creation and improvement, they can be made completely exempt from other AVC duties, when qualifying for AVC Member compensation. This exemption is determined retroactively by a Governance Facilitator when calculating AC compensation, and guidance for obtaining the exemption can be provided in advance given specific, Atlas-related KPIs, published by a Governance Facilitator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Members of ReFi AVC devoted the majority of their time and energy in Q1 2024 towards discussing and understanding how the Next Generation Atlas will work and how to incorporate AI efficiently into long term governance and AVC operations. ReFi AVC Member participants attended all meetings held by Atlas Axis during the quarter and devoted significant time during subcommittee meetings to explore what was shared in greater depth, with specific focus on the emerging Strategic Perspective of Regenerative Finance AVC.</p>\n<p><strong>Based on our participation, we believe the purpose and function of AVC Aligned Scope Proposals as defined in the current version of the Atlas should fit in as content inputs through the AVC Member “Reviewer” role in upcoming Atlas Axis workstreams set to begin after a core group of “Drafters” prepares Documents for our review.</strong></p>\n<p>As the practical and hands-on work ramps up on next phases of crafting the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-next-generation-atlas-and-governance-ai-tools/21686\">Next Generation Atlas and Governance AI Tools (GAITs)</a>, we expect the AVC Scope Proposal requirement and AVC Member role will be further clarified via Atlas amendment and shift away from unilateral Advisory Council Article proposals amending the static existing text of the Atlas MIPs set.</p>\n<p>How proposals become part of the Atlas will look entirely different from the current MIP102 monthly governance cycle voting. ReFi AVC believes it is time to focus our efforts on what that future process will look like and accept that progress on Advisory Council (aka “Scope Advisors”) can and should occur within the advanced rule sets and processes being developed through the Next Generation Atlas work streams.</p>\n<p>Accordingly we conclude it is appropriate to reiterate our limited Scope Proposals below, which have remained unchanged since the first pregame quarter-end (Q2 2023). No action or engagement with these proposals in their current form has occurred over the preceding quarters, nor has any consensus emerged on how the publication of this document can be useful, actionable or effective toward a particular end result. What has emerged instead is an impressive adjacent effort regarding the development of the AI-enabled Next Generation Atlas.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"advisory-council-articles-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#advisory-council-articles-16\"></a>Advisory Council Articles</h2>\n<p>Regenerative Finance (ReFi) AVC seeks a work product written by an Advisory Council member from each of the Scopes. This work product will establish the “starting point” that allows ReFi AVC to translate its <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VTd20IGDEX6IKtNUNh2z29P53LUXx7aFEFWdCAwYhtM/edit?usp=sharing\">Strategic Perspective</a> into position documents suited for ratification at the end of Q2 2024.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"introduction-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-17\"></a>Introduction</h3>\n<p>AVCs are tasked with 1) the improvement of the<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#scope-bounded-mutable-alignment-artifact-scope-artifact-\"> Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifacts</a> (Scope Artifacts) via 2) proposing updates to the Advisory Council Articles.</p>\n<p>At this early stage of the Pregame, we are generally aligned with the Atlas requirements that AVCs focus on building a self-sustainable, continuous improvement process for the Scopes, specifically by retaining appropriate<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-8-1-advisory-council-member-ecosystem-actors\"> Advisory Council Member Ecosystem Actors</a>.</p>\n<p>Yet it is not currently possible for AVCs to design an effective protocol for recruiting Advisory Council Members and prioritizing related projects. Such a task presupposes a significant range and depth of professional and experiential expertise in decentralized finance, traditional finance, and the MakerDAO ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The Atlas provides that such expertise should be procured through<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#scope-advisory-councils\"> Scope Advisory Councils</a> and not AVCs. Further, while Advisory Council Members can be domain experts in traditional or decentralized finance, it is not likely that they will have the needed expertise in the MakerDAO/NewDAO ecosystem. Indeed, given the innovative nature of Endgame, the core contributors, Facilitators and engaged Ecosystem Actors are likely the sole ecosystem actors who possess the requisite level of context and expertise in MakerDAO/NewDAO to provide a starting point for effective and helpful contributions by AVCs.</p>\n<p>Notably, the Atlas provides that AVCs may get professional input regarding possible improvements in Scope Artifacts from either Advisory Council Members or FacilitatorDAOs.</p>\n<p>ReFi AVC is not well positioned, nor is it permitted per the Atlas, to micromanage governance.</p>\n<p>In our interpretation, the explicit prohibition against “micromanagement” means that AVCs and AVC Members should not be involved with the day-to-day operating and management decisions being performed by the decentralized workforce of professional Ecosystem Actors, including at this stage defining at a granular level what processes, budgets and requirements should be upheld for Advisory Council hires.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposal-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposal-18\"></a>Proposal</h3>\n<p>A. Appoint Advisory Council Members to Identify High-Value Areas for Improvement in Scopes</p>\n<p>Our key proposal is that the relevant current Facilitators of each Scope Artifact use their powers to appoint one Ecosystem Actor for each Advisory Council. These Advisory Council Members will consult with the respective Scope Facilitators, as the latter are currently the most knowledgeable ecosystem actors and are intimately involved in the day-to-day of the Endgame transition.</p>\n<p>With the assistance of Scope Facilitators, the Advisory Council Members will deliver a report to AVCs that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>identifies the immediate areas for improvement within the Scopes that are most valuable to MKR holders and sets out the reasoning behind this selection; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>presents a proposal in the form of an Amendment to each of the Advisory Council Articles detailing:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(a) the process and objective requirements to guide FacilitatorDAOs in onboarding additional Advisory Council members to address the high-value areas requiring immediate improvement; and</p>\n<p>(b) the process and objective requirements to guide FacilitatorDAOs in allocating resources among the possible Advisory Council projects.</p>\n<p>B. Finding Suitable Advisory Council Members</p>\n<p>Using the Article references in the Governance Scope as an example, ReFi AVC proposes that effective April 1, 2024, Facilitators solicit proposals and find one suitable Advisory Council Member to deliver the above-described work product to the AVCs by June1, 2024.</p>\n<p>C. Timeline</p>\n<p>Facilitators should determine a limited process that meets the requirements of the relevant Scope Artifacts Scope Improvement Articles, and trigger the necessary Governance votes and forum posts in order to have a budget and Ecosystem Actors approved to start work on producing their work output deliverable by May 1, 2024.</p>\n<p>Facilitators should be mindful of the time constraints involved to deliver a useful work product to AVCs by June 1, 2024 giving us one month to incorporate the proposal information into our quarterly Scope Proposals. Thus, the requirements and process for soliciting applicants must be narrowly tailored to meet these constraints to the extent permitted by current versions of the Atlas. Such a process can be improved in later amendments that iterate on what was learned.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-19\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The above Scope Proposal meets the requirements of<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-9-interaction-of-aligned-voter-committees-avcs-aligned-delegates-ads-facilitatordaos-and-advisory-council-gov9\"> GOV 9</a>, as well as the AVC requirements regarding<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-4-avc-advisory-council-focus\"> Scope Bootstrapping</a>:</p>\n<p>Considering the totality of relevant Atlas Scope Artifact provisions, as well as our mandate as stewards of the “spirit of the rules,” we propose that a foundation must first be laid before AVCs can fruitfully drive forward movement on the Advisory Council Articles.</p>\n<p>As set out above, domain experts should be brought on who can collaborate with Scope Facilitators to hone in on the high-value areas of improvement in the Scopes - starting with Article 1 and in a manner compatible with work underway on <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-next-generation-atlas-and-governance-ai-tools/21686\">the next generation Atlas and governance AI tools</a>. Once this foundation has been laid by the ecosystem actors with the most relevant domain knowledge, AVCs can step in to be more active in steering the quarterly improvement process.</p>\n<p>cc <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/fhomoney\">@fhomoney</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/abundance\">@Abundance</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/christiancdpetersen\">@christiancdpetersen</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/votewizard\">@votewizard</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/ldr\">@ldr</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/jansky\">@JanSky</a></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/refi-avc-2024-q1-aligned-governance-strategy-aligned-scope-proposals/23997\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/refi-avc-2024-q1-aligned-governance-strategy-aligned-scope-proposals/23997","pubDate":"Sun, 31 Mar 2024 22:59:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-23997"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/refi-avc-2024-q1-aligned-governance-strategy-aligned-scope-proposals/23997.rss","#text":"ReFi AVC 2024 Q1 Aligned Governance Strategy & Aligned Scope Proposals"},"filter":false},{"title":"Spark MetaMorpho DAI Vault Allocation","dc:creator":"rema","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<p>This forum thread will be used for communication in regards to the Spark MetaMorpho DAI vault allocation, according to <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104#5-3-2-2-management-of-metamorpho-vault\">Stability Scope 5.3.2.2</a>.</p>\n<p>The initial risk assessment of factors related to Ethena and Morpho protocols can be seen <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-usde-morpho-lending-integration/23924\">here</a>, but the analysis itself is ongoing and will be expanded through time as new information is obtained or due to possible changes to Ethena and Morpho protocols.

Their synthetic dollar, USDe, is created and backed with staked Ethereum and delta-hedging techniques implemented via futures and perpetual futures contracts. This collateral backing is intended to provide a stable and scalable alternative to existing fiat backed and CDP stablecoins. USDe can be minted through the Ethena front-end by whitelisted users who have passed KYC/AML checks or purchased permissionlessly in the secondary market from AMMs and DEXs.</p>\n<p>Unlike most delta-neutral strategies which use spot ETH as the primary collateral, the Ethena protocol generates yield from two sources: the staking yield from Ethereum collateral and the funding rate from short perpetual futures and/or basis spread from expiry futures contracts. The yield from staked ETH has been relatively steady around 5%, and while the yield from short futures positions varies considerably based on market conditions, there has historically been a positive funding rate and basis spread. The collective yield generated by the Ethena protocol collateral and futures contracts is passed to users who stake their USDe for sUSDe. Yield accumulates in the staking contract, increasing the value of sUSDe over time. Ethena maintains a growing reserve fund (currently $25.2M) from protocol surplus created by unstaked USDe to compensate sUSDe holders in the event of negative funding rates.</p>\n<p>Ethena accesses the futures market through a number of different centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget, Deribit, and Okx. In order to mitigate exchange failure risk, Ethena deposits all collateral with off-exchange settlement providers (e.g. Copper Clearloop). In the event of an exchange failure or bankruptcy, the collateral held with the off-exchange settlement provider can be transferred to open new futures positions in a different market. If there is a precipitous drop in the price of ETH and the exchange fails prior to a periodic settlement with the off-exchange settlement provider, it is possible for losses to occur. Ethena will utilize its reserve fund to absorb losses in these events. More information about the reserve fund can be found <a href=\"https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/solution-design/reserve-fund\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>While the Ethena protocol aims to provide a stable, market neutral yield, there remains a series of risks which are discussed in the section titled “<em>Risks</em>” below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"taco-foundation-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#taco-foundation-11\"></a>TACO Foundation</h2>\n<p>TACO Foundation (the “Parent”) is a Cayman Islands exempted limited guarantee foundation.

In May 2023, the Parent was also used in connection with <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/project-andromeda-risk-legal-assessment/20969\">Project Andromeda</a>. Similar to James Asset (PTC) Limited and the RWA Foundation, the Parent serves as an entity through which Maker Governance can conduct activity in the  “real world.”</p>\n<p>The Parent’s operations are governed according to its Articles of Association (the “Articles”), which provide that the Director of TACO may only make certain decisions on certain matters with the prior approval of Maker Governance via a DAO Resolution.  Specifically, clause 4.16 of the Articles requires that the director of the Parent must implement all MakerDAO resolutions (subject to applicable law). This makes the Parent highly responsive to directions from Maker Governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"taco-subs-llc-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#taco-subs-llc-12\"></a>TACO &amp; SUBS, LLC</h2>\n<p>TACO &amp; SUBS, LLC (the “Subsidiary”) is a Cayman Islands limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent.  The Subsidiary was registered in March 2024 to facilitate the proposed transactions set forth in Project Ethena. The Subsidiary’s operations are governed according to its Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “LLCA”), which provides that management of the Subsidiary shall be vested exclusively in the Subsidiary’s manager (the “Manager”), who shall have the exclusive power and authority, on behalf of the Subsidiary to take any action of any kind not inconsistent with the LLCA (or applicable law) and to do any and all acts which are deemed necessary or convenient to or for the furtherance of the purposes of the Subsidiary. Accordingly, given that the Parent serves as the Subsidiary’s Manager and is its sole member, both the Parent and the Subsidiary are equally responsive to directions from Maker Governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"blocktower-capital-advisors-lp-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#blocktower-capital-advisors-lp-13\"></a>BlockTower Capital Advisors LP</h2>\n<p>BlockTower Capital Advisors LP (“BlockTower”) is an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.** BlockTower commenced its operations as an investment manager in August 2017 and was founded by Ari Paul (BlockTower’s Chief Investment Officer) and Matthew Goetz (BlockTower’s Chief Executive Officer). BlockTower provides its advisory services to privately offered pooled investment vehicles (“Funds”) as well as individual investors pursuant to separately managed accounts (“SMA Clients,” and together with the Funds, the “Clients”).  In rendering its advisory services, BlockTower draws from its personnel’s decades of combined experience across professional investing and trading, venture capital underwriting and investing and credit underwriting and investing.</p>\n<p>BlockTower generally invests with a focus on various cryptocurrencies, cryptocommodities, blockchain-based assets and networks, and decentralized platforms or protocols that are based on the blockchain, distributed ledger, directed acyclic graph or similar technologies (collectively, “Digital Assets”) as well as non-Digital Asset markets such as traditional credit underwriting, structuring and investing. BlockTower’s advisory services consist of investigating, identifying, and evaluating investment opportunities, structuring, negotiating, and making investments, managing and monitoring asset performance and monetizing such investments.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the proposed Separately Managed Account Agreement by and between the Subsidiary and BlockTower (the “Project Ethena SMA”), BlockTower will manage, supervise and direct the assets in the Subsidiary’s managed account based on guidelines and instructions provided by the Subsidiary to BlockTower and the Paying Agent. As noted above, the Project Ethena SMA contemplates a series of transactions whereby Digital Assets from the Andromeda Vault are deployed to acquire USDe and stake such USDe into sUSDe. The guidelines and instructions related to the deployment/return of such Digital Assets can be found in Exhibit A of the Project Ethena SMA and are summarized in “The Transactions and Flow of Funds–Deployment” below.</p>\n<p>For services provided on Project Ethena, BlockTower will be paid Management Fees of 250 basis points (the “Management Fees”).  The Management Fees will be paid on a monthly basis and calculated using the average net asset value of the assets of the Subsidiary’s managed account during the applicable calendar month.  Under the Project Ethena SMA, BlockTower is guaranteed a total minimum fee of $2,500,000 over a one year period.  In recognition of the uncertain crypto regulatory environment in the United States, BlockTower will also have access to an indemnity that is capped at $2,500,000 and will remain available for 48 months following the Inception Date.  In the event that BlockTower needs to access the Indemnity Amount, the Paying Agent is authorized to provide the necessary amount of funds from TACO’s bank account.</p>\n<p>BlockTower brings the professional expertise required to implement Project Ethena and execute strategies related to fund funding rate arbitrage and/or delta neutral investment strategies. Such expertise include executing investment strategies related to digital assets, trading derivatives like futures and perpetual contracts, and managing yield-bearing, staking products. BlockTower and it’s investment professionals demonstrate this expertise through the operation of its Flagship Fund, which invests in the same spot and/or derivative markets that the Ethena Protocol operates on, and previous operation of its Market Neutral Fund, which primarily focused on funding rate arbitrage on major exchanges similar to Ethena.</p>\n<p>** <em>Please note that such registration does not imply a certain level of skill or training.

The Paying Agent will be responsible for the payment of Management Fees and expenses as well as assisting with Deployment Requests and Return Requests.</p>\n<p>The Paying Agent Agreement also provides the flexibility for the Paying Agent to make payments that are not enumerated in the agreement. However, such payments will require jointly issued instructions from both the Arranger and TACO via Maker Governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"coinbase-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#coinbase-15\"></a>Coinbase</h2>\n<p>Coinbase will be the primary exchange and custodial platform for executing transactions associated with Project Ethena. All accounts within Coinbase will be owned by TACO and operated by the Directors of TACO, BlockTower, and/or Ankura. Coinbase Prime is marketed as an institutional grade platform for digital assets. In the context of Project Ethena, the Coinbase Prime Web3 Wallet (“W3W”) platform will be used as the custodial platform for holding assets like USDC, USDe, and sUSDe and executing onchain functions.</p>\n<p>The Coinbase Prime Web3 Wallet is a full feature MPC wallet platform with the ability to whitelist onchain addresses, require 2FA for interactions, and enforce a multiparty approval workflow. The Coinbase Prime and Web3 Wallet platform will be setup with proper user-specific permissions, with the Director of TACO having Administrator privileges, but still be subject to a multiparty approval process for executing transactions and/or making changes to the account. BlockTower and Ankura are expected to have Full Trader and/or Approver privileges, which means they can either initiate and/or approve transactions but not initiate account-level changes. Overall, Coinbase Prime provides the capabilities and security for executing on Project Ethena.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-transactions-and-flow-of-funds-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#the-transactions-and-flow-of-funds-16\"></a>The Transactions and Flow of Funds</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"portfolio-risk-monitoring-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#portfolio-risk-monitoring-17\"></a>Portfolio &amp; Risk Monitoring</h4>\n<p><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/8/88a1c37397134074c711c852ac0811c9e5e521cc.png\" alt=\"Project Ethena Structure Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"juHvMBpuDR1RAmMf6dAtA2rHnbK\" width=\"624\" height=\"128\"></p>\n<p>Given the characteristics of the Ethena Protocol and funding rates basis trades, the transactional structure and monitoring system have been set up to be reactive with multiple parties involved from a risk mitigation perspective.

For an extended discussion of risks, please visit the <a href=\"https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/solution-overview/risks\">Ethena Protocol website</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Regulatory Risks.</strong> The digital assets industry is subject to an extensive, highly-evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape. Many of the applicable legal and regulatory regimes were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile technologies, crypto assets, and related technologies. As a result, some applicable laws and regulations do not contemplate or address unique issues associated with the crypto economy, are subject to significant uncertainty, and vary widely across jurisdictions globally. These legal and regulatory regimes, including the laws, rules, and regulations thereunder, evolve frequently and may be modified, interpreted, and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another. To the extent TACO is deemed to have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations in connection with Project Ethena, it could be subject to significant fines and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect MakerDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Minting USDe Risks.</strong> Minting USDe involves interacting with the Ethena Protocol as well as certain off-chain components of Ethena’s business, which may be subject to potential technical, operational and other failures. Ethena has the option to stop minting of USDe, prior to transfer of any assets, due to <a href=\"https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/solution-design/minting-usde/mint-and-redeem-key-functions\">specified conditions</a>.</p>\n<p>Minting USDe comes with the potential for slippage (i.e., the potential to receive more or less than 1.00 USDe for 1.00 USDC or vice versa). An acceptable slippage limit, specified within every deployment / return proposal, can be specified within the Ethena Protocol prior to minting, guaranteeing some level of certainty of the price for transactions. Slippage may be due to an imbalance in the underlying USDe pools, as large minting volumes may cause temporary price dislocations before market makers are able to arbitrage them away. An illustrative example of how certain market makers seek to arbitrage price dislocations, and thus maintain the USDe peg to a dollar may include:</p>\n<p>USDe Trading at a Discount</p>\n<p>If USDe is worth less in an external market than from Ethena, a market maker could:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy 1x USDe at 0.95 from Curve using USDC.</li>\n<li>Redeem 1x USDe at 1.00 from Ethena Labs receiving ETH.</li>\n<li>Sell the received ETH for USDC on Curve.</li>\n<li>Generate a Profit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>USDe Trading at a Premium</p>\n<p>If USDe is worth more in an external market than from Ethena, a market maker could:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mint USDe using ETH from Ethena Labs.</li>\n<li>Sell the USDe in the Curve pool for &gt; 1.00 of USDC.</li>\n<li>Buy ETH using USDC on Curve.</li>\n<li>Generate a Profit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ethena can set a max limit for the number of USDe tokens that can be minted per block.</p>\n<p><strong>Redeeming USDe Risks.</strong> Like minting USDe, redeeming USDe involves interacting with the Ethena Protocol as well as offchain components of Ethena’s business, which may be subject to potential technical, operational and other failures. Redeeming USDe comes with the potential for slippage (i.e., the potential to receive more or less than 1.00 USDe for 1.00 USDC or vice versa) with two potential mechanisms, depending on size and timeframe. First, Ethena holds liquid collateral to process redemptions; however, for users intending to redeem a large amount, they will need to redeem over several blocks, which may cause a delay in redemptions and potential slippage. Second, there is an open market for USDe, including on Curve and Binance, for selling out of USDe and enabling market makers to arbitrage potential dislocations, similar to the methods illustrated in the risk titled “Minting USDe Risks” above. Ethena can set a max limit for the number of USDe tokens that can be redeemed per block, which may cause significant delays in redemptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Staking / Un-staking USDe Risks.</strong> Staking USDe into sUSDe involves interacting with the Ethena Protocol and certain offchain components of Ethena’s business, which may be subject to potential technical, operational and other failures.</p>\n<p>There is a cooldown period, currently set at seven days (subject to change), covering the time from when a user unstakes sUSDe and receives the underlying USDe. This cooldown period can be set by the Ethena protocol up to a maximum of 90 days, which is enforced by smart contracts. Ethena can also impose “locks on sUSDe held in specific wallets due to legal requirements to ensure sanctioned, criminal, and other high-risk actors are not able to interact with the staking contract and receive any protocol rewards, and in the interest of complying with Sanctions, Anti- Money Laundering, and Combating the Financing of Terrorism regimes.” Additionally, it is possible that Ethena may impose such locks for other reasons.</p>\n<p>According to the Ethena website, “[u]sers can only receive a positive or zero yield holding sUSDe. The value of sUSDe will NOT decline, even in periods where the protocol is earning negative yield, as the protocol does not and cannot remove assets from the staking contract.”4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no guarantee that users can only receive a positive or zero yield holding sUSDe.</p>\n<p><strong>Oracle Risks.</strong> Ethena relies on certain oracles, such as Pyth and Redstone oracles during the minting and redeeming of USDe. Using the price feed from these oracles, the Ethena smart contracts will mint / redeem USDe typically within 5% of the price provided by these oracles. Oracle price feeds may be subject to hacks, manipulation, and front-running, among other risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding Rate Risks.</strong> Ethena uses perpetual contracts to hedge the delta of the collateral assets backing USDe and the protocol is thereby exposed to funding rate risks associated with those perpetual contracts. Funding rates are designed to ensure that the prices of perpetual contracts align closely with the underlying asset’s market price, but they can invert rapidly in response to sharp market movements, exposing traders to significant financial risk. Additionally, liquidity in perpetual futures markets is often fragmented across different exchanges, leading to disparities in pricing and increased slippage risk during trade execution.</p>\n<p>Currently, Ethena is integrated with real-time futures market providers, like Coinanalysze, Kaiko and Amberdata, in order to monitor for scenarios like negative funding rates or material reductions in open interest and respond accordingly. The failure of such integrations could result in an impairment of Ethena’s team to understand and mitigate the risks associated with the underlying funding rate risk of sUSDe.</p>\n<p>In the scenario of negative funding rates, where taking a delta neutral position with long spot and short perpetuals results in a payment of interest, Ethena has a reserve fund in place to absorb these payments for a short period. However, in prolonged, severely negative funding scenarios, there is a potential for a loss of value in USDe and sUSDe. The following historical data gives some indication to adverse market scenarios and the resulting funding rate dynamics.</p>\n<p>In the following charts, depicting daily realized funding rate for ETH perpetual futures, one can observe the historical volatility of funding rates, which may or may not be similar or different in the future. In the observed dataset, illustrated below, the most significant negative daily realized funding rate occurred at around -5.7%, which sustained for two days between September 14, 2022 and September 15, 2022 for coin margined ETH perpetual futures on the Deribit exchange. The second most significant negative daily funding rate event occurred at -3.95% on 3/12/23 on Deribit again. It also should be noted that Ethena claims that the yield from ETH staking is a mitigant to negative funding rates.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/9/19943dc5ed629d6770152aad5dedecd8d8f46280.png\" alt=\"Funding Rate Chart 1\" data-base62-sha1=\"3EhxCxCfoa1aT3sWQXIageega2Y\" width=\"621\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/1/f1dd694b8431df623b54a24c00d4d2d489df1500.png\" alt=\"Funding Rate Chart 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"yvDroJFrEzgYiNPCn84qkHOgv9m\" width=\"621\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p>Source: Amberdata</p>\n<p><strong>Liquidation Risks.</strong> Within Ethena’s hedging system, Ethena intends to use minimal leverage on the positions held within perpetual futures exchanges. Despite this policy, there still exists potential for liquidation associated with dislocations between the collateral asset (e.g., stETH) used to margin Ethena’s perpetual futures positions, and the underlying asset of the perpetual future (e.g., ETH or stETH). In such scenarios, if a significant discount in stETH were to occur (e.g., more than 60% discount), the minimum collateral maintenance ratios on perpetual future exchanges may be triggered and positions would be incrementally liquidated. In the event of liquidations, collateral assets may be sold at a discount, depending on the volume of liquidations, resulting in slippage and a potential de-peg of USDe from the U.S. Dollar.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Staking Risks.</strong> Staking yield obtained through liquid staking tokens have two primary risk vectors. First, the underlying Ethereum network validators may be subject to loss of funds associated with slashing events occurring at the validator-level. Second, liquid staking token platforms impose an additional degree of smart contract, governance and liquidity risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Counterparty Risks.</strong> Primary counterparty risk exists with Ethena. The organization behind Ethena Protocol controls the minting/redeeming of smart contracts, off-chain hedging system and front-end application portal. Each of these components are subject to potential technical failure, hacks and closure.</p>\n<p>In addition, secondary counterparty risk exists within Ethena’s hedging system, which interacts with centralized exchanges (e.g., Binance, Derabit), custodians (e.g., Copper), and third-party decentralized finance protocols (e.g., Curve). The proper functioning of Ethena’s hedging system is necessary for USDe to maintain its peg to the U.S. Dollar via market arbitrage mechanisms/opportunities. Such functions are dependent (in part) upon the secondary counterparties described herein and each of these counterparties may be subject to, without limitation, hacks, interrupted services, smart contract risks and/or closures.</p>\n<p>For example, should a centralized exchange that Ethena’s hedging system interacts with suffer from a period of interrupted service or closures, this, in turn, may result in potential loss of funds on such centralized exchange and/or periods of the underlying positions being unhedged. While such counterparty risks to centralized exchanges may be mitigated by having custodians (e.g., Copper) custody the collateral assets backing USDe (e.g., stETH) in off-exchange custodial platforms (e.g., Copper Clearloop), custodial platforms are also subject to risks. For example, should a custodian that Ethena’s hedging system interacts with suffer from a hack, interrupted services and/or closure, it is possible that the Ethena Protocol could suffer a temporary or permanent loss of funds which may result in slippage and a potential de-peg of USDe from the U.S. Dollar. Such a failure could impair the ability of the client to redeem its assets for fair value. Lastly, should a DeFi protocol (e.g., Curve) the Ethena’s Hedging System interacts with suffer from a period of interrupted service or closures, such an event could impair the ability of the Client to redeem its USDe for USDC (or other Digital Assets), resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Custodial Risks.</strong> Coinbase serves as the Custodian on Project Ethena via an account in the name of the Subsidiary. Coinbase offers an institutional platform, the Web3 Wallet (“W3W”), for asset custody, DeFi integrations and wallet solutions. For security, Project Ethena will set up a multi-approver process for W3W, whereby, at least two parties need to be engaged for transactions to be initiated and signed. Additionally, within W3W, the Destination Protection functionality permits assets only to be transferred to pre-approved, pre-vetted addresses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no guarantee that the Custodian’s system will not be subject to security breaches, technical failures, or unauthorized access, which may lead to the loss or theft of assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflicts of Interest.</strong> The Arranger is subject to conflicts of interest in providing its services in connection with Project Ethena. Specifically, a client account advised by the Arranger (and in which capital of BlockTower Persons is invested) is an investor in Ethena, the issuer of USDe/sUSDe, and has equity interest in Ethena. Increases or decreases in USDe/sUSDe may cause increases or decreases in the equity value of Ethena and its platform because it would lead to increases or decreases in total value locked on the Ethena Protocol. Furthermore, other client accounts advised by the Arranger (and in which capital of BlockTower Persons is invested) hold Digital Assets issued by MakerDAO (e.g., MKR and DAI). As the Project Ethena assets are primarily managed for the benefit of MakerDAO, any profits or losses associated with Project Ethena may work to increase or decrease the speculative value of MKR.</p>\n<p>Similarly, given that the Digital Assets used to fund the TACO Account originate from the Andromeda vault (and the Digital Assets contained in the vault are used to back DAI’s peg to the U.S. Dollar), it is possible that any losses sustained by the TACO Account as a result of the contemplated transactions may negatively affect the value of DAI, and in severe, adverse scenarios, may cause potential de-pegs of DAI from the U.S. Dollar. In the event DAI were to de-peg from the U.S. Dollar, a client account advised by the Arranger would be incentivized to purchase discounted DAI in order to close out its DAI denominated loan with the Parent.  Although the Arranger has policies in place to mitigate such a conflict of interest should it arise, it is possible that the Arranger would be required to take actions which may benefit one of its clients at the expense of another.</p>\n            <p><small>12 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/bt-project-ethena-risk-legal-assessment/23978\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/bt-project-ethena-risk-legal-assessment/23978","pubDate":"Thu, 28 Mar 2024 22:06:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-23978"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/bt-project-ethena-risk-legal-assessment/23978.rss","#text":"BT Project Ethena: Risk & Legal Assessment"},"filter":false},{"title":"A High-Performance Product idea; 100% native","dc:creator":"Jadmat","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>We believe this post explains the risks and benefits of USDe better:</p><aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"23924\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/user_avatar/forum.makerdao.com/monet-supply/48/2108_2.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-usde-morpho-lending-integration/23924\">Risk Assessment - USDe Morpho Lending Integration</a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/c/maker-core/92\"><span data-category-id=\"92\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #339941; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF;\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category \" title=\"Maker Core is your destination for all things related to Governance Processes participation.

Currently standing at 30%, it is considerably lower than the initial APY discussed in this forum.</li>\n<li><strong>Excessive DAI Dumping:</strong> Every USD generating profit translates to 1 DAI sold, both for Morpho’s leverage and D3M in direct ownership.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>Our main question is: Does USDe adequately compensate for the risks inherent in its mechanism, considering the volatility of its returns and the dumping against DAI?</strong></em><br>\n** Does the perceived yield from USDe outweigh these factors?*</p>\n<p><strong>It appears there is a significant missed opportunity.

We propose establishing “<em>SubdaoLST</em>”, where user sends ETH and receives METH (LST issued by “SubdaoLST”), which not only carries minting power but also functions as a source of fees for validators, akin to LIDO but with inherent minting capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integration with SparkLend:</strong> <em>SparkLend</em> will complement this setup.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The Hedged Position:</strong><br>\nMETH Vault - on SubdaoLST<br>\nWETH Borrow - on SparkLend<br>\nDAI Lending - on SparkLend</p>\n<h3><a name=\"on-napkin-model-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#on-napkin-model-2\"></a>On Napkin Model:</h3>\n<p>The parameters governing the strategy’s configuration must ensure a healthy and adaptable position, even under scenarios of high volatility.

Essentially, the placement and financing rates are equivalent due to Maker’s ecosystem mechanism.</p>\n<p>We need to establish a fee model in line with this mechanism. Our suggestion:<br>\nThe fee should be variable with respect to the <strong>“Global DAI Rate”</strong>, although we haven’t found evidence if this concept has been utilized or measured. It essentially refers to the <strong>average fee generated per each DAI in circulation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>\n55% of DAI emissions come from PSM + RWA, yielding an average rate of 3.87%*<br>\n45% of DAI emissions come from crypto collateral, with an average rate of 16%*<br>\n*These examples are purely hypothetical and do not reflect actual rates.<br>\nThis results in a global average rate per DAI used of <strong>9,3285% (GF)</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-establishing-global-fee-gf-as-sf-for-subdaolst-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-1-establishing-global-fee-gf-as-sf-for-subdaolst-4\"></a><strong>1- Establishing Global Fee (GF) as SF for SubdaoLST</strong></h3>\n<p><em>We will use GF for METH, and after observing results, a spread may be added if deemed necessary.</em></p>\n<h4><a name=\"we-must-distinguish-between-dai-in-circulation-and-d3m-dai-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#we-must-distinguish-between-dai-in-circulation-and-d3m-dai-5\"></a>We must distinguish between <strong>DAI in circulation</strong> and <strong>D3M DAI</strong></h4>\n<p>Initiatives based on Ethena issue DAI collateralized with the product itself, USDe/SUSDe. All earnings stem from this new exposure, without any prior collateral; just like RWA. These alternatives create POA (Protocol-owned Assets).</p>\n<p>When trying to gauge the potential yield of ESDAI for Maker, we encounter a point of uncertainty. Starting from the premise that “every DAI in circulation generates income for Maker” and that the DAI emitted by ESDAI is “<strong>DAI in circulation</strong>”, then, since this DAI generates an implicit rate (not directly perceived by the product), how do we net out the yield of ESDAI for the DAO? What do we apply to evaluate this? Including this indirect perception is a way to incorporate all income concepts of ESDAI.</p>\n<p>Initially, we thought of using the “Stability Collateral Yield Benchmark” since the PSM seems to be the entry point to ESDAI, with no liquidity limit and without exposing to crypto collateral for the minter. The minter switches from USDC to DAI through PSM and from there to ESDAI.</p>\n<p>However, we encounter possible scenarios where this rate exceeds that of minting from crypto collateral. In such cases, we would be subsidizing a deficit rate, especially if the demand for ESDAI surpasses that of minting from crypto collateral.</p>\n<p>Thus, we revert to the earlier concept: Global Fee (GF). GF will always self-regulate and represents the rate the protocol receives for each DAI in circulation. Therefore:</p>\n<p><strong>If a user enters ESDAI, what they are paying for those DAI, regardless of their source, is already included in GF. Considering this indirect payment is a way to net out the comparison of ESDAI performance against POA alternatives like USDe or RWA.</strong></p>\n<h3><a

ESDAI generates a lower yield (measured in APY) for the DAO compared to other products, revenues can potentially be higher since the risk of ESDAI does not need to limit the debt ceiling as much as it does for other products. For example, an interesting exercise could be comparing ESDAI with the direct implementation of acquiring sUSDe; we didn’t find if a debt ceiling has been defined here based on the net APY perceived by the Dao and its debt ceiling; how much will Maker’s income be with this Ethena product? Then, based on the APY of ESDAI, calculate the TVL needed to achieve the same income for the Dao. So, coming to the final point of the conclusion; the debt ceiling is tied to perceived risk, ESDAI has advantages in this regard, it doesn’t need to limit itself; this is where we see the risk/reward exemplified and mathematically calculated.</h5>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-high-performance-product-idea-100-native/23977\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-high-performance-product-idea-100-native/23977","pubDate":"Thu, 28 Mar 2024 14:42:23 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-23977"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-high-performance-product-idea-100-native/23977.rss","#text":"A High-Performance Product idea; 100% native"},"filter":false}]}}}
