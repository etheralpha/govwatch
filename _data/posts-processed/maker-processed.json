The analysis is divided into cohort, segmentation, and external dynamics, ranging from 1 January 2024 to 1 July 2024, while the snapshot data are taken on 1 July 2024. That is done to provide a deep understanding of how the protocol has developed, and it will then be updated with more interesting dynamics.

Cohort Analysis</h1>\n<p>In the analysis we are presenting, we’ve organized wallets into categories based on the month they first used the protocol. Each category is called a “cohort month.” For example, all the wallets that first used the protocol in January are in the January cohort, those that first used the protocol in February are in the February cohort, etc. We measure how long each wallet has been active with a “Cohort tenure” number. This number is just the number of months since the wallet joined its cohort. So, if a wallet’s Cohort tenure is 1, it means it’s the wallet’s first month since joining; if it’s 2, it’s the second month, and so on.</p>\n<p>One important note is that for our analysis, we’ve put all wallets that joined from May 2023 to January 2024 into a single group, which we’re calling the January Cohort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"healthy-growth-patterns-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#healthy-growth-patterns-3\"></a>Healthy growth patterns</h2>\n<p>After reaching the peak of supplied amounts in February 2024 (~$4.1B), the total supply fell until April, reaching a new low of ~$2.8B (Chart 1). The main reason the total supply has been dropping is the down-market we have been witnessing, with BTC price falling by ~14% from its peak and ETH falling by ~20% from its peak. However, since then, we have seen a new supply coming in May and June. While the bullish sentiment has primarily driven the growth in May (ETH Price increased by ~35%); the growth in June was driven by a new supply coming into a protocol. There had been ~$800M of new supply coming in from the new wallets. The pattern is very similar for total borrows (Chart 4), which reached their low in April 2024, increased in May, and reached new highs in June 2024 (~$1.75B).</p>\n<p>While this metric alone is not enough to assess the protocol’s overall growth, the remaining ones give a clearer picture of SparkLend’s status. Since January 2024, the new cohorts have been supplying less as a percentage of total supplies (Chart 2). However, this changed in June 2024, as new entrants supplied 19.8% of the total supply in the protocol. The lower growth during the previous months has been due to two main factors: (i) the positive retention patterns of the May-January cohort and (ii) the decreasing number of new wallets opening positions on SparkLend (Chart 7). Even though the number of new wallets has been the lowest in the analyzing period, these wallets hold a lot of supply. Up to date, supplied and borrowed amounts have been dropping in the range of 10% - 50% for new cohorts (Charts 3 and 6), except for the April cohort, which exhibited a growth in supply and borrowing. Except for the March and May cohorts, the large wallets’ dominance per cohort tenure has been extremely high for each individual cohort (Chart 8). It shows that even though supply increased by $800M in June, 76% of this supply is due to only five big wallets that joined the protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"supplied-and-borrowed-amounts-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#supplied-and-borrowed-amounts-4\"></a>Supplied and borrowed amounts</h2>\n<p>Regarding total amounts supplied in June 2024, $801M (or 19.8%) came from the June cohort, followed by the February (12.4%) and the March (6.3%), with respectively $502M and $253M. Except for the April cohort (+34%), all other cohorts’ supplied amounts have been dropping, such as March (-47%), February (-37%), January (-15%), and May (-12%).</p>\n<p>The largest cohorts by amount supplied are the same cohorts dominating borrowing, with June borrowing $389M (22.2%), March borrowing $141M (8.1%), and February borrowing $125M (7.1%). The February and March cohorts dropped the most, down 55% and 43%, respectively, since they started using SparkLend.</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the cohorts.</p>\n\nChart 1.

Segmentation Analysis</h1>\n<p>The segmentation analysis assessed the types of positions and strategies SparkLend users are deploying. For a detailed understanding of how these were calculated, please refer to the previously conducted Segmentation Analysis. Compared to the previous analyses, this time we have added new positions that segment LRT users. To summarize briefly, here are the identified segments:</p>\n\nIdentified Segments <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h2><a name=\"the-sparklend-sentiment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#the-sparklend-sentiment-6\"></a>The SparkLend Sentiment</h2>\n<p>In the last analysis, we used individual wallet positions to assess the sentiment of SparkLend users towards the crypto market. It is very interesting to note that most wallets are still exhibiting bullish behavior, with the largest positions being <code>Long ETH LST</code> ($1.77B) and <code>Long Type 1</code> ($1.07B), together accounting for ~70% of the total supply in June (Charts 9 and 10). The third-largest position is the <code>Recursive ETH LST</code> (~$735M), roughly ~18% of the total supply. It is also worth noting that the wallets in the highest supply bucket (&gt;$100M) all have long positions, deployed only in three segments mentioned before (<code>Recursive ETH LST</code>, <code>Long Type 1</code>, and <code>Long ETH LST</code>) (Chart 12).</p>\n<p>Short positions are practically non-existent in relative terms compared to long ones. That tells us that the participants have a bullish outlook for the future. Short positions are currently ~0.3% of total supply, which has decreased from the previous month (~0.4%) and has dramatically dropped from its peak in January 2024 (~2.9%).</p>\n<p>The wallet count per position strategy (Chart 11) highlights a high predominance of <code>Long Type 1</code> (516) users, followed by <code>Long ETH LST</code> (191) and <code>Diversified Borrowers</code> (143). Only 12 wallets display strictly short strategies. The large wallets dominate in strategies <code>Long LRT</code>, <code>Short Type 1</code>, and <code>Supply Only Stablecoins</code> (Chart 14). This is mainly due to a low number of wallets employing these strategies.</p>\n<p>A comparison between the current state of health rates (Chart 16) and the previous analysis shows that Recursive ETH LST has lower debt-weighted health rates (up from 1.02 on 1 May to 1.09 on 1 July). Short strategies also have a higher health rate (1.52 vs. 1.81), the same as does Long ETH LST (2.15 vs. 2.33).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"behavioral-analysis-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#behavioral-analysis-7\"></a>Behavioral analysis</h2>\n<p>User’s interaction with the protocol can provide valuable insights. The need for active management can be primarily seen in <code>Long LTR</code> followed by less active management in the <code>Long ETH + ETH LST + ETH LRT</code> segment and the <code>Diversified Borrowers</code> (Chart 17). It is evident that, on average, a high number of events are performed by wallets with lower and higher health rates (Chart 18), while average health rates on average perform fewer actions. This can indicate that those in these categories must execute more actions to maintain their strategies. There is also a positive relation between how much users supply to the protocol and the number of actions they perform (Chart 19), meaning that the more someone supplies, the more likely they are to execute more actions.</p>\n<p>This distribution highlights a behavioral tendency towards active management in strategies perceived as higher risk, evidenced by the monthly need for more events and a lower health rate associated with <code>Long LRT</code> and <code>Long ETH + ETH LST + ETH LRT</code> strategies. In particular, Long LRT strategies exhibit the highest median value of events per month (3.5). Also, three wallets in the <code>Recursive ETH LST</code> category performed the highest number of actions in a month (45, 39, 38).</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the segments.</p>\n\nChart 9: Supply Amount Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 10: Percentage Supply Amount Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 11: Wallet Count Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 12: Percentage Supply Amount Per Supply Amount Bucket <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 13: Wallet Count Per Supply Amount Bucket <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 14: Top 10 Large Wallet Supply Percentage Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 15: Borrow Per Health Rate <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 16: Debt-Weighted Health Rate Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 17: Events Per Month Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 18: Events Per Month Per Health Rate <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 19: Events Per Month vs Supply Amount <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-external-capital-analysis-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-3-external-capital-analysis-8\"></a>3. External Capital Analysis</h1>\n<p>This analysis aims to assess how SparkLend users behave outside SparkLend by assessing their external capital held and cross-protocol usage. We define external capital as assets held outside the protocol that could be used to protect individual positions. External capital can either be passive (idle in the wallet) or active (used in other protocols). The data refers to a snapshot taken on 1 July 2024.</p>\n<p>SparkLend users hold approximately $5.17B in other protocols (Chart 20), $1.62B of which is in Maker (~31% of the total). The supply of other lending protocols equals 454M on Aave v3 and 146M on Ethena. Furthermore, other protocols used by SparkLend wallets are Lido, Stakefish, and Morpho AAVE. Together, Morpho AAVE (v1 and v3) has a supply from SparkLend users of $743M across 37 wallets.</p>\n<p>By looking at the passive external capital per asset (Chart 21), we can see that users hold WBTC ($164M), GNO ($143M), (W)ETH ($97M), and MKR ($81M) primarily. Since the previous analysis, there has been a significant drop in sDAI popularity, which has decreased from $73M to $24M. The majority of the wallets hold idle ETH (1230 wallets), DAI (400 wallets), and USDC (357 wallets). The other stablecoins are falling behind DAI and USDC, such as USDT ($27M, 216 wallets), sDAI ($24M, 143 wallets), and USDe ($13M, 83 wallets).</p>\n<p>Assessing passive external capital relative to debt (Chart 22), it is evident that 56.7% of users have enough passive external capital to cover 25% of their debt, a slight increase of 0.9 percentage points compared to the previous analysis. However, there has also been a slight increase (0.3 percentage points) in users with a buffer of more than 500% to 10.4% of users. In general, 26.6% of wallets have enough external capital to cover the total debt exposure.</p>\n<p>What would require more attention is the current passive external capital as a percentage of debt (Chart 23) since 86.3% of total debt is covered by less or equal to 25% of capital held in wallets, which was previously 66.2% in December, 78.6% in March, and 83.6% in April. In case of price drops or changing market conditions, this might negatively affect the protocol’s health. On the other hand, 6.7% of total debt is fully collateralized by capital held in wallets (down from 18.8% in March and 9.8% in April).</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the external dynamics.</p>\n\nChart 20: Wallets' Active External Capital Per Protocol <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 21: Wallets' Passive External Capital Per Asset <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 22: Wallets' Passive External Capital Over SparkLend Borrow (Percentage of Wallets) <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 23: Wallets' Passive External Capital Over SparkLend Borrow (Percentage of Debt) <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-9\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The analysis highlighted a positive growth pattern for SparkLend during Q2-2024. While the protocol is still struggling to attract new user interaction (as the number of new wallets per month is still decreasing), the increase in total supplied and borrowed amounts in the last cohorts suggests higher popularity among larger users. Yet, it is essential to note that the five biggest wallets drive the most new supply and borrowing in the protocol from the last cohort. This shift is marked by a significant engagement of new cohorts and strong retention within earlier cohorts, indicating a reliance on established users even through less favorable market conditions.</p>\n<p>The segmentation analysis reveals that with the market moving again into a bullish sentiment, many SparkLend users also maintain bullish sentiment, particularly in long positions with substantial investments in Long Type 1 assets. At the same time, the small portion in short positions reflects a withdrawal from riskier strategies, aligning with the overall conservative trend observed in the cohort analysis. This behavior suggests that while SparkLend users continue to use the protocol, there is a tangible shift towards safety in response to market volatility.</p>\n<p>Regarding external dynamics, the analysis highlights a robust interaction with other protocols. However, there’s a decrease in passive external capital relative to debt, which could pose a risk in adverse market shifts. This condition requires more detailed monitoring of capital buffers to prevent potential liquidations, especially in a volatile market.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"future-work-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#future-work-10\"></a>Future Work</h1>\n<p>BA Labs plans to continue monitoring user metrics to ensure the protocol’s stability. We will also continue providing quarterly analyses of the most important dynamics and suggestions for tackling potential issues. At the same time, we plan to automate this kind of analysis to get live data on user behavior and promptly respond to changing market conditions.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 08:20:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24600"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600.rss","#text":"Sparklend User Metrics & Growth Analysis - Report #3"},"filter":true},{"title":"Promoting Blockchain-based finance system to NGO audience","dc:creator":"Liam_Bodin","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Hey all.

Accounting for Effective Borrow Rates (since users are able to earn some yield on the collateral they supply), Aave v2 markets (USDC and USDT) have particularly increased, with USDT going from ~9% to ~13% and USDC from ~12% to ~18%. At the same time, other v3 markets on Aave and Compound have witnessed a slight rate decrease. We are far from the mid-march environment where rates skyrocketed, and they have stabilized since then, with some minor peaks in mid-April, end of May and beginning of June. This can also be seen in the DeFi Rate 7-Day Volatility, with Aave v2 markets reaching 11% volatility at the beginning of June, with largest v3 markets being more stable. In the second half of June, the Rate Benchmark’s volatility has not surpassed 2%, implying a more stable situation in the DeFi rate ecosystem.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uiVMrLqj81Ub3dzHcXlqrtVuUBW.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_624x308.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uiVMrLqj81Ub3dzHcXlqrtVuUBW\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_624x308.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_936x462.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_1248x616.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F8F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/\">Blockanalitica</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9kZfoOCoQm9qfXPtW7E5QZVtA23.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_624x308.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9kZfoOCoQm9qfXPtW7E5QZVtA23\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_624x308.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_936x462.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_1248x616.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/\">Blockanalitica</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"funding-rates-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#funding-rates-3\"></a>Funding Rates</h2>\n<p>We are far from the March peak, where 7-Day Average funding rates for ETH and BTC have touched 60% APY.

The Stablecoin reserves drop is in line with what was expected after the Accelerated Proposal in March, which substantially increased them to avoid a possible depeg scenario. Following the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp34-mip-amendment-subproposal/23971\">MIP-102c2-SP34</a>, stablecoin reserves should be equal to 25% of DAI Supply. Even though this is not the case currently, reserves are close to that value and, more importantly, have risen from the 20% registered at the beginning of June. Stablecoin reserves remain critical for the FiRE, since substantial deviations from the 25% threshold can introduce higher rates to incentivize collateral dynamics to go back to the equilibrium value.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9SLpBR55qAUgjWV1NlmzAP5NvnL.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_624x308.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9SLpBR55qAUgjWV1NlmzAP5NvnL\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_624x308.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_936x462.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_1248x616.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/charts\">Makerburn</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"fire-implementation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#fire-implementation-5\"></a>FiRE Implementation</h1>\n<p>We have experimented with the FiRE to suggest optimal Base Rates and adjusted the DeFi Benchmark Rate to account for Effective Borrow Rates, which were at the time ignored. The main issues we encountered were the lagging reactions to rate decreases (since it utilizes EMAs to avoid rate spikes) and the non-feasibility of rate benchmarks. Specifically, the issue with DeFi competitive rates was fixed by implementing an Effective Rate Benchmark, while the issue persists for Funding Rates. For this reason, we have temporarily applied a 200 basis points spread (2%) to the Funding Rate Benchmark.</p>\n<p>The FiRE was run with the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CE: 0.7691</li>\n<li>LR: 0.0534</li>\n<li>BR: 0.0872</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And returned a Base Rate of 9.38%.</p>\n<p>This increase in the Base Rate is mainly due to Stablecoin Reserves being &lt;25%. Since we believe that, even though important, bringing Stablecoin Reserves to the 25% threshold is not trivial, we have re-run the model with TE: 0.80, hence allowing more room for breathing to the Base Rate. Under these conditions, the Base Rate was equal to 8.58%.</p>\n<p>Until the FiRE model is finalized based on research similar to this, we will use it as a reference and not strictly adhere to it when making our rate change recommendations. We will continue to adjust the model’s parameters before they are incorporated into the Stability Scope as determined by governance.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"dsr-changes-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dsr-changes-6\"></a>DSR Changes</h1>\n<p>The DAI in DSR, over the last two months, has been slightly dropping from its peak on 19 May, when it was equal to 2.2B.

This ensures less friction in onboarding new contributors and provides appropriate boundaries for long-term contributors to prevent errors. This helps move management from <strong>“Don’t mess up” to “Can’t mess up”</strong>.</p>\n<p>Document models can also be reused or forked by other organizations. All Powerhouse software is open-source. Common organizational tools from payroll, grants program management to a DAO address book can all be built as a document model.

To change a document model, rather than store a new state, the changes are noted by publishing events (or operations) of the specific updates to the document. When viewing the document, all operations (or events) are performed and the end state is the current version of the document. This is similar to Google docs, where every keystroke is marked as an edit that can be viewed and previous versions can be restored.

Many DAOs operate on Google’s Office Product Suite because it allows for easy, simultaneous editing of spreadsheets, word processing and all documents. Never mind this means ceding DAO sovereignty to the googlers in Mountain View.

This has led us to think more broadly about what organizations of the future will look like. What we’ve found, however, is that a DAO is just one component of what we are calling Scalable Network Organizations (SNO). Whereas a DAO is an onchain governance entity, a SNO includes this onchain entity but also interlinks with all of the other offchain infrastructure needed to build a product and bootstrap a network.</p>\n<p>Powerhouse’s ambition is that SNOs can be the structure that builds a decentralized, Uber, Etsy or other software-based marketplaces, where a centralized entity has complete control over a network, rather than those who make up the network. What are some other characteristics of a SNO?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open and transparent - SNOs are freely accessible with a gradual on-boarding path, using open-source software and open data</li>\n<li>Software platform - the core product is some scalable marketplace platform and the organization has its best practices embedded in software and a moving towards progressive automation</li>\n<li>Decentralized - ownership, operations and infrastructure cannot be coopted by a single entity, producing zero lock-in to technology or a platform</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SNOs require new software infrastructure that is decentralized as well as open-source legal templates for establishing and linking offchain processes together with onchain governance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"legal-templates-for-network-organizations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#legal-templates-for-network-organizations-9\"></a><strong>Legal templates for network organizations</strong></h3>\n<p>While Powerhouse’s software enables organizations to build customized and streamlined processes, only if this software is integrated into offline components can it be truly useful.

If the new MKR buffer does not reach its full required capacity using the next payout alone, the MKR from the old buffer will be used to fill the shortfall. Any excess MKR, after filling the new buffer, will then be transferred to the AD. For this reason, we won’t be asking the ADs to submit payment requests this month.</p>\n<p>However, for convenience, we will create a post allowing the ADs to request the Governance Facilitators to distribute this excess MKR through multiple payments.

In the event of opt-out or termination, Pinwheel will remain entitled to rewards that have accrued but have not yet been distributed at that time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CBIUK Suspension Right</strong>: If at any time CBIUK deems Pinwheel to be ineligible for the USDC Rewards Program, Pinwheel’s enrollment in the program will be suspended, however, Pinwheel will remain entitled to the rewards accrued prior to suspension.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: USDC Rewards are calculated on a monthly basis and earned in the form of USDC in accordance with the USDC Rewards Rates. The method of calculation used is the “Monthly Average Balance,” meaning the application of the daily USDC Rewards Rate to the average of “daily snapshots” of USDC held in the W3W each day of the month. The rate used to determine USDC Rewards earned for a particular day is the then current USDC Rewards Rate divided by 365.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rewards Distribution</strong>: USDC Rewards earned in a particular month or part thereof will be credited to the Trading Balance on Pinwheel’s Coinbase account within five business days after the start of the next calendar month.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rate Changes</strong>: CBIUK may change the USDC Rewards Rates at any time by notification to Pinwheel. Unless otherwise stated in the notice, no change will be effective until the first day of the calendar month after such notice is made.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"coinbase-web3-wallet-addendum-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#coinbase-web3-wallet-addendum-14\"></a>Coinbase Web3 Wallet Addendum</h3>\n<p>The W3W Addendum is an agreement between CBIUK and Pinwheel. It is supplemental to the PBA and governs Pinwheel’s use of the W3W services.</p>\n<p>The W3W allows users to engage directly with digital asset networks, including through smart contracts, decentralized exchanges and other decentralized applications. The W3W enables users to (i) store, send and receive digital assets; (ii) access, participate in, and interact with third party services; (iii) view addresses and information that are part of digital asset networks; (iv) sign and broadcast transactions; and (v) access additional functionality as CBIUK may add from time to time.</p>\n<p>During W3W onboarding, there will be a distributed key generation process to create the W3W. Through this process, two key shards will be generated. Parties representing Pinwheel (the “<strong>Pinwheel Representatives</strong>”) will generate a key shard on a mobile device (the “<strong>Pinwheel Key Shard</strong>”) and CBIUK will generate a key shard on its server (the “<strong>Coinbase Key Shard</strong>”). The key shards are independently generated and CBIUK won’t ever have control of the Pinwheel Key Shard. The signing of transactions associated with the W3W address will require both key shards.</p>\n<p>The key terms of the W3W Addendum are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Recovery</strong>: As requested by Pinwheel, CBIUK will not provide a device recovery service and will be unable to restore or grant access to the Pinwheel Key Shard under any circumstance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>LitePSM Integration</strong>: Pinwheel is entitled to connect the W3W to the LitePSM with ongoing access to the W3W. Upon completion of the Prime consensus approval process and transaction signature by Pinwheel, CBIUK will automatically co-sign the transaction to initiate the smart contract connection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key Shard Disposal</strong>: Pinwheel is entitled to dispose of the Pinwheel Key Shard at its own risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unsupported Networks, Assets and Errors</strong>: CBIUK will incur no responsibility or liability with regard to digital assets associated with unsupported digital asset networks sent to a W3W or with regard to digital assets sent to an incompatible wallet address and/or unsupported network.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Changes</strong>: CBIUK may propose updates or changes to W3W Addendum at any time, subject to Pinwheel’s prior written consent. Upon receiving notice of a proposed update,  Pinwheel will have a period of 30 calendar days from the date of the notice to accept or reject the changes. Acceptance can be indicated by Pinwheel’s continued use of the W3W services after the expiration of this period. If Pinwheel does not agree to the proposed changes, Pinwheel may terminate the W3W Addendum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fees</strong>: CBIUK will charge an annual SaaS subscription fee of $50,000 in exchange for Pinwheel’s use of the W3W services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"key-shard-generation-handling-agreement-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#key-shard-generation-handling-agreement-15\"></a>Key Shard Generation &amp; Handling Agreement</h3>\n<p>The Pinwheel Representatives will each enter into a Key Shard Generation and Handling (“<strong>KSGH</strong>”) Agreement with Pinwheel. This agreement outlines the duties of each Pinwheel Representative with respect to (i) the generation of the Pinwheel Key Shard; (ii) signing of the Initial Transaction; and (iii) secure disposal of the Pinwheel Key Shard thereafter.</p>\n<p>The rationale for the destruction of the Pinwheel Key Shard is security and reduction of the risks associated with the Custody Arrangement. See <em>Risks</em> below.</p>\n<p>The key terms of the KSGH Agreement are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key Shard Generation</strong>: The Pinwheel Representatives are required to generate the Pinwheel Key Shard by using the designated application on a mobile device.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Signing of the Initial Transaction</strong>: The Pinwheel Representatives must activate the W3W and sign the Initial Transaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Secure Destruction of the Key Shard</strong>: Following the signing of the Initial Transaction, the Pinwheel Representatives must securely destroy the Pinwheel Key Shard and provide written confirmation of the destruction method employed and time of destruction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Compensation</strong>: Each Pinwheel Representative will be paid 1,000 Dai in exchange for the performance of their duties under the KSGH Agreement. They will also be reimbursed for any reasonable and pre-approved expenses incurred directly in respect of the performance of their duties.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"risks-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#risks-16\"></a>Risks</h2>\n<p>The Migration is intended to replace the existing <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/coinbase-custody-legal-assessment/20384\">Custody Arrangement</a>, which was adopted as an interim solution in May 2023. As noted at the time of adoption, the Custody Arrangement came with the inherent risks associated with custodial solutions. Therefore, when reviewing the risks relating to the Migration, it’s important to not only look at the risks around the Migration itself, but also how it compares to the Custody Arrangement it is set to replace.</p>\n<p>The key improvement presented by the LitePSM and W3W over the Custody Arrangement is the transition from using a custodial solution to a noncustodial one. Following the Migration, assets will remain under the control of the Maker protocol, while still allowing for participation in the USDC Rewards Program.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, as with any arrangement, there are still risks related to the LitePSM and W3W. The key risks are as follows:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"regulatory-risk-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#regulatory-risk-17\"></a>Regulatory Risk</h4>\n<p>The digital assets industry is subject to an extensive, highly-evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape. Many of the applicable legal and regulatory regimes were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile technologies, crypto assets, and related technologies. As a result, some applicable laws and regulations do not contemplate or address unique issues associated with the crypto economy, are subject to significant uncertainty, and vary widely across jurisdictions globally. These legal and regulatory regimes, including the laws, rules, and regulations thereunder, evolve frequently and may be modified, interpreted, and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another. To the extent Pinwheel is deemed to have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations in connection with the LitePSM and W3W, it could be subject to significant fines and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect MakerDAO.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"service-provider-risk-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#service-provider-risk-18\"></a>Service Provider Risk</h4>\n<p>The successful completion of the Migration and its functionality thereafter will rely on the coordinated actions of a number of independent service providers to the Maker protocol including CBIUK, the Director of Pinwheel (Leeward), the Pinwheel Representatives and several other Ecosystem Actors within the Maker ecosystem. Each of these parties plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth execution of the Migration and any failure, delay, or miscommunication among these providers could disrupt the Migration, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, or financial losses. Additionally, the reliance on multiple parties increases the complexity of the migration and the risk of errors or oversights. To mitigate these risks, continuous monitoring, regular updates, and prompt response mechanisms are essential.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"smart-contract-risk-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#smart-contract-risk-19\"></a>Smart Contract Risk</h4>\n<p>The Maker protocol relies on smart contracts to manage and execute transactions. These smart contracts are susceptible to vulnerabilities and bugs that could be exploited by malicious actors. Despite thorough audits and testing, there is no guarantee that all potential issues have been identified and resolved. Exploitation of any vulnerabilities in the smart contracts could lead to loss of funds, disruption of services, and a loss of confidence in the protocol. To mitigate these risks, continuous monitoring, regular updates, and prompt response mechanisms are essential.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/coinbase-web3-wallet-legal-overview/24577\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/coinbase-web3-wallet-legal-overview/24577","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 02:09:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24577"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/coinbase-web3-wallet-legal-overview/24577.rss","#text":"Coinbase Web3 Wallet - Legal Overview"},"filter":false},{"title":"Spark - Aave Revenue Share Calculation & Payment #4 [Q2, 2024]","dc:creator":"Sean","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<h2><a name=\"context-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#context-1\"></a>Context</h2>\n<p>In February 2023, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/phoenixlabs\">@PhoenixLabs</a>, a contributor to the development of <a href=\"https://spark.fi/\">Spark</a>, proposed a Spark Lend profit-sharing program with the Aave community for the FOSS work done on Aave v3.

The budget that an AD is responsible for accumulates in the AD buffer. It cannot be spent until it contains at least 1 month’s worth of budget. Once monthly, all ADs can request payments from their buffers. An AD’s monthly payment request can be any amount as long as there is still at least one month worth of budget remaining after the payments are made. Payments can be requested to multiple addresses at once and can include the address that controls the AD’s PDM. ADs can include descriptions of what the payments are for, which can include personal compensation, compensation to team contributors, research expenses, and more. The Governance Facilitators then include the payments in the next Executive Spell. PDs must only use the full amounts of their budgets if they are contributing significant, best in class work towards the development of the Atlas, and their budget use must generally be scaled according to their level of Atlas contributions.</p>\n<h6><a name=\"atl26341-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#atl26341-12\"></a>ATL2.6.3.4.1</h6>\n<p>An AD buffer stops accumulating when it contains 3 months of an AD’s budget.

The reduction in budget is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 AD budget at 75% voting activity. If an AD falls below 75% voting activity over the last 6 months, it loses qualification for AD income and any AD budget rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest AD by total amount of MKR delegated to their Seasonally Active PDM.

This must be done at a level that adequately protects the Maker Ecosystem from physical risk posed by the potential for attacks against ADs. If there’s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the operational security of an AD has been compromised, or that they have failed to follow best practice or otherwise made operational security errors, FacilitatorDAOs must immediately derecognize the AD. As specified in 2.6.3.4.3 part of the AD Buffer can be confiscated and used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor responsibly provided useful information for determining that the operational security of an AD was compromised. GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of the whistleblower bounty.</p>\n<p>To support the security of the protocol, PDs and RDs must use the PagerDuty emergency tool to deal with spell related emergencies. The operational security requirements of ADs must conform to enable high opsec, best practice use of PagerDuty by ADs.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-bootstrapping-edit-proposal/24557\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-bootstrapping-edit-proposal/24557","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Jun 2024 15:37:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24557"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-bootstrapping-edit-proposal/24557.rss","#text":"Atlas bootstrapping Edit proposal"},"filter":false},{"title":"Request for Assistance with Recovering Stolen ETH Transferred into MakerDAO","dc:creator":"emcee72","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p><strong>Dear MakerDAO Support Team,</strong></p>\n<p>I hope this message finds you well.

The debt ceiling for this vault is at zero, Drop redemptions have been submitted, and there are no additional actions for Maker to take at this time.</p>\n<p>This loan remains backed by a portfolio of Revenue Based Financing assets, in which each asset is a loan to a business (typically a small business or SaaS company), itself collateralized by a percentage of that business’s gross revenues.</p>\n<p>Fortunafi is failing a number of covenants: the co-investor ratio (now almost at zero), the YoY growth rate, and the minimum Fortunafi Tin investment (however, there are two additional affiliated entities which own Tin tokens, and if included, these would increase the ownership percentage above that covenant’s threshold). As mentioned above, the minimum tin percentage is also failing.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"harbor-trade-rwa-004-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#harbor-trade-rwa-004-9\"></a>Harbor Trade (RWA-004)</h2>\n<p>The Harbor Trade transaction still has 1.6mm Dai outstanding from the vault as of the end of May, and the workout process for the portfolio is ongoing. The DAO has reduced the debt ceiling to zero and submitted a redemption for its holdings.</p>\n<p>The vault’s three assets (totaling $2.1mm) are in default. These defaulted assets collateralize the $1.8mm in aggregate Drop token market value and were issued by a single consumer electronics company, which has in turn pledged its receivables as collateral.</p>\n<p>The default began in April 2023 and Harbor Trade is currently engaged in a workout process to recover as much value as possible for the transaction. As of May 2024, Steakhouse <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/harbor-trade-credit-workout-process/24367\">has requested funding for legal expenses</a> from the DAO to assist Harbor Trade in the recovery as it begins litigation in Germany.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"consolfreight-rwa-003-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#consolfreight-rwa-003-10\"></a>ConsolFreight (RWA-003)</h2>\n<p>The ConsolFreight portfolio currently consists of delinquent and defaulted assets. One delinquent asset remains with a balance of $196k alongside two default assets (Hanhwa) totaling approximately $1.9mm. These $2.1M in assets support 1.9M (market value) in Drop tokens, of which $1.7M belong to Maker’s vault.</p>\n<p>The legal process for the defaulted loans (Hanhwa) is still ongoing. In late May, ConsolFreight provided an update on the recovery process:</p>\n<p><em>We remain optimistic that the Court will grant our request for the Liquidator and Directed to provide many, if not most, of the documents we have sought through our subpoenas and preliminary discovery application. A separate application for preliminary discovery has been filed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Regarding our argument on “actual or apparent possession” of the goods that the Liquidator sold upon his appointment, we faced some challenges. While we had a strong enough argument to seek preliminary discovery, the Buyer Trade Finance Agreement (BTFA) does not entirely circumvent the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR) requirements in Australia. The PPSR ensures transparency regarding who has a security interest in goods through registration or possession.</em></p>\n<p><em>Despite these challenges, there is still potential for claims against the Liquidator if the documents reveal that he was aware of any wrongdoing by Hanhwa concerning our goods. Similarly, we may have claims against Directed if it is shown that they were aware of the BTFA when acquiring the goods before liquidation.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Court has not yet delivered a judgment, which is an unusual delay. The delay could indicate that the Registrar is carefully considering which documents should be provided, but it is difficult to determine the exact cause. The Registrar may simply have a heavy workload.</em></p>\n<p><em>With Hanhwa director now bankrupted and out of the picture, our straightforward claim has become more complex. Our chances of success against the Liquidator and Directed will largely depend on the Registrar’s decision on our preliminary discovery application and the documents produced. Once we have access to these documents, we will be able to provide a more informed opinion.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your continued patience and support. We will keep you informed of any further developments.</em></p>\n<p>As a reminder, on August 24th of 2023, Steakhouse and ConsolFreight <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/consolfreight-rwa-003-cf4-drop-default/21745\">alerted</a> MakerDAO that the pools largest position, Hanhwa, was expected to default. The balance of the affected position is roughly 1.8mm out of the 2.5mm portfolio (as of October 2023 month-end). There is not currently a good estimate for expected recovery, but it is very possible the Drop token is impacted.

This current total pool size is $146,500,000.</p>\n<p>In the period 14 March to 18 March, the DAI necessary to be paired dropped from 49,892.39 to 49,889.63 and from 49,890.20 to 49,886.15 in the period 18 March to 29 March, following the trend highlighted in the previous analyses. The same could be seen for 29 March to 14 June, where the DAI necessary to be paired dropped from 74,855.79 to 74,851.59. This time, the drop is also primarily due to the growth in the pool liquidity size, which comes from SBE’s transactions. In the last period, there had also been some visible impact on the market, which resulted in spikes. That could be primarily explained by a fast price movement or gaps in the maker price.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/c/ec69870cfe91fa23e855db306f526833bda0c845.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xJoM26IQe5HNM23v1LqgyEZzSpD.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/c/ec69870cfe91fa23e855db306f526833bda0c845_2_689x425.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"xJoM26IQe5HNM23v1LqgyEZzSpD\" width=\"689\" height=\"425\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/c/ec69870cfe91fa23e855db306f526833bda0c845_2_689x425.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/c/ec69870cfe91fa23e855db306f526833bda0c845_2_1033x637.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/c/ec69870cfe91fa23e855db306f526833bda0c845.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F4F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"distribution-of-delay-periods-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#distribution-of-delay-periods-6\"></a>Distribution of Delay Periods</h1>\n<p>From 14 March 2024 to 18 March 2024 (4.29 days), the SBE executed 15 actions, equal to the theoretical maximum of 15 transactions given <code>hop</code> 26,280.

At <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/introducing-atlas-axis-gait-kick-off-call-jan-29-8pm-cet/23501\">Atlas Axis</a>, our mission is to prepare the foundational infrastructure necessary for this future.</p>\n<p>Driving our efforts is the recognition that a paradigm shift in governance necessitates a corresponding transformation in how ecosystem intelligence is generated. The Atlas is a modular structure composed of collaboratively generated and constantly evolving atomic parts. The efficacy of the Atlas as a whole will depend on the extent to which its parts undergo a “trial by fire” through critical scrutiny and refinement of ideas sourced from the community.</p>\n<p>Today, we are a small team laying the groundwork for the Atlas to serve as the ecosystem’s “Grand Central” of data and knowledge. We are looking for exceptional full-time collaborators to join the founding team of Atlas Axis. Scaling our capacity is critical, as it opens the door to the integration of additional Atlas workstreams and collaborators.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>\n<p>As a founding team member, you will play a critical role in driving forward all key deliverables, from conducting research to gather raw data for the Atlas, to enhancing Atlas core infrastructure and meta-rules; from coordinating Alignment Conservers and other ecosystem stakeholders, to drafting and reviewing Atlas data.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You should be well familiar with the Atlas (gen1, starting <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>) and MakerDAO.

We’re grinding through mountains of data and need intense focus to navigate the multiple interconnections among data points.</li>\n<li>Obsessive about learning and tackling complex problems.</li>\n<li>Strong organizational skills. Meticulous, detail-oriented. A sixth sense for “things being out of order”.</li>\n<li>Exceptional ability to read, analyze and synthesize large volumes of information. Adept at pattern recognition. Strong working memory a must.</li>\n<li>Excellent communication skills.</li>\n<li>Especially, you must write rather quickly (not counting chatGPT). We are a writing-heavy team and we ourselves are learning the Atlas as we build it. This means we have to hash out, in text, fine-grained arguments with one another.</li>\n<li>You must be familiar with wringing meaning out of precise facets of language. Working with the Atlas, you’ll find that seemingly insignificant changes to syntax can transform the logic of a provision. Hopefully, you find this exciting.</li>\n<li>Notion! We’re building out our entire workflow in Notion, so you’ve got to be comfy using it.</li>\n<li>Self-starter. What this means is that you observe and listen deeply so that you can “read between the lines.” We can have a sync, and you can go away with confidence to get from point A to Z with minimal additional direction. You can discern what is needed.</li>\n<li>The above likely means you have operations experience.</li>\n<li>Non-binary thinker. The Atlas presents innumerable, complex legal and ethical issues that cannot be grasped with black-or-white thinking.</li>\n<li>You’re a proud generalist. No hesitation to wear whatever hat is needed. As a founding team member, you’ll be working toward the moonshot with us, but the day to day will involve admin; research; stakeholder coordination; workflow optimization; data input, creation and review; preparation of documentation; etc.</li>\n<li>Culture is key to our future. We look for highly capable colleagues, yes, but also kindness. We look for people who feel sincere love for the mission, people who want to build for a future whose full bloom they will not live to see.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p>\n<p>We offer highly competitive compensation (DAI and MKR), with bonus potential. If you are the right person, there is incredible potential to grow with us.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>\n<p>You can DM me if you’re interested in applying. Tell me about yourself and how you fit the above profile.</p>\n<p>Please provide links to your work product that showcases your fit for this role. For instance, you can submit writing samples (Forum post, essay or research paper) that demonstrate your capacities in fine-grained analysis and reasoning. Or, you can submit a portfolio of your projects or past work experiences; please include a description of your specific role and contributions. Your application will not be considered without work-product samples, portfolio, or similar.</p>\n<p>The application process may proceed to a timed work test (compensated), and the most promising candidate(s) will be onboarded on a trial basis.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Additional Opportunities:</strong></p>\n<p>We also have additional opportunities for a more admin/ops-support focused role, entailing things like data entry, data review, and other aspects of data management.</p>\n<p>The right candidate for this role need not have existing knowledge of the Atlas/MakerDAO, nor excellent capacities in analysis/writing/etc. However, they should be a quick learner; comfortable with Notion; and highly organized, attentive to detail and meticulous.</p>\n<p>DM me if you’re interested in applying for this role and tell me about your experience/skillsets that make you suited for it.

We introduce a USDC migration plan from PSM-USDC-A and Coinbase Custody (RWA014-A) to LITE-PSM-USDC-A and a subsequent offboarding plan for PSM-USDC-A. Next, we elaborate on the motivations driving the migration. Relevant information regarding integrations with the LITE-PSM-USDC-A is included. Thereafter, we provide a parameter overview and proposed parameter changes for each phase of the planned migration. Formal parameter proposals and corresponding Scope language change recommendations will be provided in separate forum posts for each phase individually.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In 2020 the concept of the Peg Stability Module (PSM) was first introduced as a mechanism, contributing to the price stability of DAI. Over time the USDC PSM became a building block for DeFi, with many protocols integrating the PSM into their products for its deep liquidity and low fees. A few years later, after Coinbase Custody <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip81-coinbase-usdc-institutional-rewards/17703\">proposed MIP81</a>, Maker’s USDC liquidity also became a source of revenue for MakerDAO.</p>\n<p>Building upon that experiment, MakerDAO has been collaborating with Circle and Coinbase towards an evolution of that traditional custody setup. The outcome of that work is the Lightweight Peg Stability Module (LitePSM), which allows for the custodied funds to be held in the LitePSM contract as opposed to relying on centralized exchanges or RWA trustees. This way the LitePSM balance acts as a price stability mechanism for DAI, deep liquidity source for DAI/USDC and also generates higher-tier marketing rewards from Coinbase.</p>\n<p>As explained in the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-lite-psm/blob/5df953b2956033c1d9690f6730d3d62dd6fbe660/README.md\">LITE-PSM-USDC-A repository</a>, the Lightweight Peg Stability Module implementation (LITE-PSM-USDC-A/LitePSM) is heavily inspired by previous PSM designs, including the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-psm/blob/v2/src/psm.sol\">current PSM</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-psm/blob/v2/src/psm.sol\">PSM v2</a>. The objective of LITE-PSM-USDC-A is to replace PSM-USDC-A as a facility through which users can swap Dai for USDC — either with no slippage, or with swap fees enabled. One of the most exciting new features for regular users and integrations is much higher gas efficiency while interacting with the module. Below, we briefly explain the most relevant features and functionalities that <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code> enables. For a more detailed technical description of the new LitePSM, refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-lite-psm/blob/5df953b2956033c1d9690f6730d3d62dd6fbe660/README.md\">Lightweight Peg Stability Module (PSM) implementation Github repository</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"new-features-and-functionalities-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#new-features-and-functionalities-3\"></a>New Features and Functionalities</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"new-custody-functionality-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#new-custody-functionality-4\"></a>New Custody Functionality</h2>\n<p>The LitePSM design allows for the PSM <code>gem</code> balance to be held in a different address, with the main constraint being that <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code> should be able to freely move any amount of <code>gem</code> on behalf of the custody address. For Coinbase Prime to distribute USDC rewards to MakerDAO, they need to be custodians of the assets which are used to calculate the USDC reward amount. This requirement is similar to the current Coinbase Custody (RWA014-A) solution, whereby MakerDAO sends USDC from the PSM to Coinbase Custody in connection with the Coinbase Institutional USDC Rewards Program. However in the new system design, all funds are custodied onchain without reliance on TradFi banks and RWA trustees.</p>\n<p>USDC will be kept in a Coinbase Web3 Wallet (W3W) which will not be able to perform any transactions after the setup because at least 1 key shard will be burnt.</p>\n<p>This will be further explained in the separate forum post specifically dedicated to the legal related items and included in the DAO Resolution which will be included in one of the future executive votes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"gas-efficiency-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#gas-efficiency-5\"></a>Gas Efficiency</h2>\n<p>Previous PSM implementations (including PSM-USDC-A) are relatively gas intensive since they directly manipulate the <code>vat</code> on every swap through the minting and burning of DAI. With the purpose of reducing gas costs, the LitePSM is designed to maintain a fixed-sized amount of pre-minted DAI (<code>buf</code>). This design reduces the PSM swap to two ERC20 token transfers in a pool of DAI and the PSM-supported stablecoin. The pre-minted DAI can only be released and enter circulation when new LitePSM stablecoin deposits have been made. The DAI in the (<code>buf</code>) is not considered as circulating supply, and can instead be thought of as a portion of the available debt ceiling supply, but in the pre-minted form.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"no-fees-for-authorized-parties-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#no-fees-for-authorized-parties-6\"></a>No Fees for Authorized Parties</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-psm/blob/v2/README.md\">dss-psm</a> design allows Maker Governance to set optional fees in both directions of a PSM swap. These fees are controlled by the parameters <code>tin</code> and <code>tout</code>. The new LitePSM design will also utilize these parameters for setting optional fees for permissionless swaps. However, the new design also enables authorized parties to swap using the functions <code>buyGemNoFee</code> and <code>sellGemNoFee</code>. This new design offers Maker Governance greater flexibility in setting PSM fees. For example, Maker Governance can set positive <code>tin</code> and <code>tout</code> for permissionless swaps while offering zero fees to authorized actors, which can be used by future AllocatorDAOs responsible for market making and arbitraging with various external markets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"additional-corresponding-features-and-parameter-changes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#additional-corresponding-features-and-parameter-changes-7\"></a>Additional Corresponding Features and Parameter Changes</h2>\n<p>Since the LitePSM has the pre-minted DAI in the (<code>buf</code>), the <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#10-2-3-debt-ceiling-breaker\">LINE_MOM GSM Exception</a> is not sufficient to temporarily disable the module, therefore the PSM_MOM will be deployed which will have the ability to halt swaps on the LitePSM.</p>\n<p>The GSM delay will be reduced during the first phase of the migration process in order to allow for a faster reaction time in case of unwanted events.</p>\n<p>The Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) will be increased, as the long-term plan is to remove this feature from the system and the LitePSM module is not supported by the ESM. There is still some value of maintaining the module until the full deployment of the Allocation System as part of the Endgame, but the threshold should be increased in order to prevent hostile activation when the module should not be used.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"lite-psm-usdc-a-parameters-overview-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#lite-psm-usdc-a-parameters-overview-8\"></a>LITE-PSM-USDC-A Parameters Overview</h1>\n<p>Below, we list LitePSM parameters that need to be determined by Maker Governance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Toll/Fee In (<code>tin</code>): <code>tin</code> is a percentage fee applied when trading the collateral asset into the PSM in exchange for DAI.</li>\n<li>Toll/Fee Out (<code>tout</code>): <code>tout</code> is the percentage fee applied when trading DAI into the PSM in exchange for the collateral asset.</li>\n<li><code>DC-IAM line</code> (Maximum Debt Ceiling): The maximum amount of debt the LITE-PSM-USDC-A can accrue.</li>\n<li><code>DC-IAM gap</code> (Target Available Debt): The target gap between the debt usage and the Debt Ceiling.</li>\n<li><code>DC-IAM ttl</code> (Ceiling Increase Cooldown): The minimum time requirement before it is possible to increase the debt ceiling.</li>\n<li><code>buf</code>: A fixed-sized amount of pre-minted Dai which LITE-PSM-USDC-A is designed to maintain most of the time. Note, however, that when a user calls <code>buyGem</code>, the amount of DAI available can be temporarily larger than <code>buf</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"lite-psm-usdc-a-migration-plan-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#lite-psm-usdc-a-migration-plan-9\"></a>LITE-PSM-USDC-A Migration Plan</h1>\n<p>There are four main goals that need to be considered when deciding on how migration will be processed and parameter values chosen during different phases of the migration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure DAI peg stability through the migration process</li>\n<li>Minimize the negative impact on existing integrations with PSM-USDC-A and incentivize their migration to the LITE-PSM-USDC-A</li>\n<li>Have a test period for the new module with low exposure and potential damage in case of unwanted outcomes</li>\n<li>Maximize the yield generated on stablecoin reserves while achieving above items</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed plan only refers to the first migration, specifically to what currently exists. The later migrations, including wrapper for NST &amp; LitePSM (DAI) and LitePSM (NST) at a later stage can repeat similar steps based on the outcomes of this migration and potentially be improved.</p>\n<p>The target date for Phase 1 part of the migration process is expected to be included in the executive vote on July 11, but could be postponed, which will be communicated in this forum post in such a case. The duration of Phase 1 and Phase 2 is an estimate. Formal proposals for each of the migration phases will be in the form of a separate forum posts, which will follow the regular governance process. The proposal for Phase 1 of migration will also be subject to an onchain governance poll in order to authorize the deployment of LITE-PSM-USDC-A and the migration process. Various parameter values defined in this forum post might change in the formal proposals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"migration-in-phases-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#migration-in-phases-10\"></a>Migration in Phases</h3>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 - Test period (approximate 4 week duration), included in July 11 spell</strong></p>\n<p>The main goal of Phase 1 is to have a low exposure period and additionally give integrators sufficient time to become familiar with the LitePSM and start migrating their solutions from PSM-USDC-A.

This collaboration aims to enhance the functionality and reach of both platforms by supporting BounceBit’s native assets, BBTC and BBUSD, which are Liquidity-Secured Derivatives (LSD) from Ceffu. The integration will enable effective funding rate arbitrage and yield generation for these assets, aligning with the strategic goals of both entities to foster innovation and growth in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"background-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#background-1\"></a>Background</h3>\n<p>BounceBit’s unique CeDeFi infrastructure blends centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to provide parallel yield generation. Users can earn original CeFi yield while utilizing LSD for BTC staking and on-chain farming, known as restaking in Bitcoin. This ecosystem offers three types of yield for Bitcoin holders: original CeFi yield, node operation rewards from staking BTC on the BounceBit chain, and opportunity yield from participating in on-chain applications and the Bounce Launchpad.</p>\n<p>BBTC and BBUSD have been developed as part of a strategic initiative to leverage the stability and security of LSD mechanisms provided by Ceffu. The primary goal is to facilitate seamless and profitable interactions in arbitrage and lending/borrowing scenarios on the BounceBit chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"value-to-the-community-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#value-to-the-community-2\"></a>Value to the Community</h3>\n<p>Integrating MakerDAO’s lending and borrowing services with BounceBit will bring significant value to the community through several use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Utility and Liquidity</strong>: BBTC and BBUSD holders can leverage their assets for yield farming, staking, and arbitrage within a secure and efficient framework.</li>\n<li><strong>Premium Yield Generation</strong>: Users can participate in premium yield generation strategies such as funding rate arbitrage through Ceffu’s MirrorX solution, enabling access to deep liquidity on multiple asset markets with reduced counterparty risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Asset Management</strong>: Users gain access to diversified asset management services, allowing them to choose strategies that best fit their risk tolerance and investment goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Security and Compliance</strong>: The integration will adhere to high standards of security and regulatory compliance, ensuring user trust and system integrity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"additional-information-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#additional-information-3\"></a>Additional Information</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stablecoin Support</strong>: BBUSD is backed 1:1 by USDT and FDUSD in Ceffu, enhancing its stability and reliability. Stablecoins from various EVM-compatible Chains, such as FDUSD on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) and USDT on Ethereum, can be bridged into the BounceBit ecosystem. Once transferred, these tokens are uniformly mapped and represented as BBUSD within BounceBit.</li>\n<li><strong>KYC Requirements</strong>: KYC is only required for very large customers to participate in CeDeFi activities, maintaining ease of access while ensuring compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"proposal-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposal-4\"></a>Proposal</h3>\n<p>We propose that MakerDAO deploy its lending and borrowing protocols on the BounceBit chain to support BBTC and BBUSD. This deployment will allow BounceBit users to leverage their assets for additional financial operations, such as yield farming and arbitrage, within the safe and efficient framework provided by MakerDAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"technical-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#technical-considerations-5\"></a>Technical Considerations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asset Compatibility</strong>: BounceBit will ensure that BBTC and BBUSD are fully compatible with MakerDAO protocols by aligning with the technical requirements of MakerDAO. This includes adapting the asset management to integrate smoothly with MakerDAO’s operations on both testnet and mainnet.</li>\n<li><strong>Security and Compliance</strong>: User contributions to Total Value Locked (TVL) are securely managed by Mainnet Digital’s regulated custodial services, assuring both compliance and safety. These assets are then mirrored via Ceffu’s MirrorX service, a key integration by BounceBit that maintains on-chain visibility and transparency of these assets. All integrations will adhere to the highest standards of security and regulatory compliance, with regular audits and reviews to maintain system integrity and user trust.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"implementation-phases-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#implementation-phases-6\"></a>Implementation Phases</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initial Testing on Testnet</strong>: Deploy MakerDAO protocols on the BounceBit testnet for initial integration testing and to gather user feedback.</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment on Mainnet</strong>: Following successful testnet trials and necessary adjustments, deploy the protocols on the BounceBit mainnet.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"expected-outcomes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#expected-outcomes-7\"></a>Expected Outcomes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced utility and liquidity for BBTC and BBUSD on the BounceBit platform.</li>\n<li>Expanded opportunities for users to engage in lending, borrowing, and arbitrage.</li>\n<li>Strengthened collaboration between BounceBit and MakerDAO, setting a precedent for future cooperative efforts within the DeFi ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-8\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>BounceBit’s infrastructure is meticulously architected to elevate Bitcoin’s status from a passive asset to an active, yield-generating instrument. By offering an integrated platform where Bitcoin holders can capitalize on the strengths of both CeFi and DeFi, BounceBit is pioneering a new chapter in asset optimization and financial innovation within the blockchain space. We believe this proposal aligns with the strategic goals of both MakerDAO and BounceBit, offering substantial benefits to our users and the broader DeFi community.
