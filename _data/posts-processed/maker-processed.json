While it is too early to definitively judge relative efficiency of various LLTV pools, as they have not yet had time to reach stable equilibrium, we saw a few clear trends of user demand based on the order of pools becoming fully utilized. Users showed a strong preference for USDe over sUSDe pools, and also showed a preference for higher over lower leverage, particularly preferring pools with LLTV of 86% and above.</p>\n<p>Users’ preference for USDe (offering 7x points currently) over sUSDe (offering 5x points plus ~30% yield) suggests they are highly valuing Ethena points and opportunity to earn ENA tokens. While the points program is being <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0xF99d0E4E3435cc9C9868D1C6274DfaB3e2721341/GTbzFynrve4gzSjIEKL0vz7Kq0UHkIiekHkup0EXgjU\">updated today</a>, there will still be significant incentives for using USDe and sUSDe collateral on Morpho. Given this preference for points over cash yield, it may be prudent to allocate a greater share of DAI towards USDe pools going forward. This comes with an additional benefit of slightly lower liquidity risk for the collateral, as USDe can be redeemed via Ethena immediately while sUSDe must wait for a 1 week unstaking period before redemption. Allocation to USDe also allows Ethena to retain a greater share of revenue for their insurance fund, which over time can improve the risk profile of Maker’s Ethena allocation. Ethena’s revised points program (“sats” program) will continue to favor USDe over sUSDe, with 20x daily sats per USDe collateral vs 5x sats per sUSDe collateral.</p>\n<p>We’ve also seen the 77% LLTV pools fill up significantly more slowly versus other pools. Based on this, we anticipate that the equilibrium borrow rates supported by these pools will be lower than alternatives, and overall efficiency (borrow rate paid divided by LLTV) may also lag higher LLTV pools.</p>\n<p>Given the above factors, and to help reduce UX complexity caused by offering many different pools, we believe the Spark DAI vault should focus future allocations into the 86% and 91.5% LLTV pool, and more heavily weight USDe versus sUSDe collateral. The 77% and 94.5% LLTV pools can continue to see allocations but at a somewhat lower proportion of deployed assets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"vault-risk-factors-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#vault-risk-factors-2\"></a>Vault Risk Factors</h3>\n<p>We conducted a review of vault risk in our previous post <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-usde-morpho-lending-integration/23924\">here</a>. In this section we review the previously identified risk factors in light of current vault and Ethena protocol status, and consider a few additional risk factors that impact the vault’s risk profile as allocation size increases.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"morpho-rate-models-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#morpho-rate-models-3\"></a>Morpho Rate Models</h4>\n<p>Currently the Spark DAI vault’s pools are all essentially fully utilized, with borrow rates below users’ willingness to pay. After the ENA token generation event and adjustment of points programs, we expect willingness to pay to drop somewhat, and potentially stabilize below the then current optimal borrow rate for the pools (expected to be 50%+ for most pools by mid next week). If this is the case, utilization will fall and Maker’s overall revenue will decline, while the maximum potential losses in a tail risk event will remain the same (up to the full amount deployed to the pool). Given that the next Ethena points season will run until the earlier of September or when USDe reaches $5 billion market capitalization, this potential disruption caused by changes to the points program isn’t expected to recur frequently.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"custody-and-exchange-transparency-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#custody-and-exchange-transparency-4\"></a>Custody and Exchange Transparency</h4>\n<p>Ethena’s dashboard shows a breakdown of collateral by asset and which exchange it is currently pledged to, data as of 30 March is shown below. This breakdown is expected to closely track the distribution of Ethena’s perp hedge positions across exchanges, but may not be 100% aligned as certain positions could use more or less than 1x leverage. We would like to see deeper transparency into futures hedging positions, ideally including dollar value of positions per exchange and per product (eg. linear vs inverse perpetuals, dated futures, etc). This will become more important as Ethena begins to use additional assets such as BTC for delta neutral positions, or potentially allocates a portion of backing to dated futures.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/e/8e77be5066ded83566750240b55aa0de381442e1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kkklGXzVUtLZf4bLc8VvMlREFGx.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/e/8e77be5066ded83566750240b55aa0de381442e1_2_624x291.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"kkklGXzVUtLZf4bLc8VvMlREFGx\" width=\"624\" height=\"291\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/e/8e77be5066ded83566750240b55aa0de381442e1_2_624x291.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/e/8e77be5066ded83566750240b55aa0de381442e1.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/e/8e77be5066ded83566750240b55aa0de381442e1.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1D232B\"></a></div><br>\n<a href=\"https://app.ethena.fi/dashboards/positions\">Ethena Dashboard</a><p></p>\n<p>While Ethena discloses deposit addresses for off exchange custody providers, funds are currently not held in individual onchain addresses after being deposited. This limits transparency for custody balances after the point of initial deposit, and a breakdown of funds per custodian is currently not provided by either Ethena or the custodians themselves. We’d like to see improvement in transparency here as well, including live or near live data provided by Ethena and periodic (at least weekly) assertions from the custodians of AUC attributable to Ethena. Implementation of segregated onchain addresses to hold Ethena collateral would significantly improve transparency.</p>\n<p>We can assume that roughly 50% of collateral is held with Ceffu based on the fact that Copper and Cobo are not approved for trading on Binance, but a more thorough breakdown would be helpful for assessing overall risk to the structure. Greater transparency would also help Maker understand differences between reported collateral balances and USDe in circulation, where there is frequently a discrepancy of tens of millions of dollars, likely caused by assets under custody that have not been pledged to an exchange or delays in data reporting.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"custody-and-exchange-counterparty-risk-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#custody-and-exchange-counterparty-risk-5\"></a>Custody and Exchange Counterparty Risk</h4>\n<p>Currently (as of 30 March), Ethena reports 51% of exchange collateral (48% of total USDe backing) is pledged to Binance, by implication held at Ceffu. With Binance and Ceffu sharing the same ultimate beneficial owner, our current assessment is that they may be under common control and should not be considered independent for the purposes of assessing counterparty risk. Other custodians are independent of exchanges, and provide a higher level of assurance against misappropriation or impairment in the event of exchange failure.</p>\n<p>We also note $185 million of wbETH collateral (~12% of backing) on Binance and $80 million of mETH collateral (~5% of backing) on Bybit. wbETH is a fully custodial managed product so has essentially 100% counterparty exposure to Binance. While mETH is a decentralized product managed under Mantle DAO and a security council multisig with 6 of 13 threshold, we have seen Bybit exert significant pressure on Mantle governance in the past; for example Mantle DAO voted to prevent FTX from converting BIT tokens to MNT, linked with a wider dispute between the FTX trustee and Mirana. So while mETH’s Bybit exposure isn’t as concrete as wbETH and Binance, there remains a non-negligible counterparty risk from using mETH as collateral while trading on Bybit.</p>\n<p>We also note a <a href=\"https://archive.is/hiUm0\">news report</a> about a party hosted by custodian Copper after the recent DAS conference. While this doesn’t have a direct bearing on risk, it can potentially demonstrate weak management and internal company culture, and bears some similarities to the <a href=\"https://x.com/zoeSaintBernard/status/1486123668342116353?s=20\">culture issues</a> present at Prime Trust. Custodians should be expected to have better judgment and higher standards of professional conduct.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"lst-collateral-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#lst-collateral-6\"></a>LST Collateral</h4>\n<p>LST exposure at Ethena represents one of the key systemic risks of the project. If derivatives funding rates fall into the negative range and Ethena is forced to unwind delta neutral positions (either due to users redeeming USDe, or to reallocate to other collateral backing), they may end up selling a significant amount of LST collateral, pushing these assets below peg and creating a long staking exit queue. Large discounts would then tend to create further downward pressure on funding rates, as arbitrageurs would use short derivatives positions to hedge their ETH exposure when buying LSTs below peg. The presence of positive feedback loops here could severely impact LST secondary market liquidity in concentrated liquidity AMMs and destabilize defi protocols that rely on LST collateral.</p>\n<p>Presently, liquid staking tokens comprise roughly 22% of total Ethena backing. This proportion has been falling steadily as USDe’s circulating supply has grown over the past weeks, and now represents a fairly small level of exposure. The Ethena Labs team has communicated they intend to continue to reduce proportional exposure as they grow, and view LST collateral as more helpful in bear market conditions when the collateral yield is important to offset low or negative funding rates. Reduction in LST backing is positive from a risk perspective as this reduces USDe’s exposure to hacks, slashing, LST custody and counterparty risks, potential discount and depegs due to liquidity constraints, and overall systemic risk to the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We also note that the exposure to LST collateral is now significantly below the amount of staked USDe. Given that sUSDe has a 7 day period for unstaking before it can be redeemed, this may help buffer Ethena’s liquidity and duration risk from holding LSTs, as they may be able to directly redeem LST collateral if they see a rush of unstaking requests, rather than being forced to sell on the secondary market.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"stablecoin-collateral-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#stablecoin-collateral-7\"></a>Stablecoin Collateral</h4>\n<p>Based on reported exchange collateral data, Ethena has at least 21% exposure to USDT collateral. USDT is also the primary quote and settlement asset used for linear perpetual contracts across exchanges, and the most frequently used asset for primary market minting and redemptions of USDe. Given these exposures and touchpoints, we conclude that Ethena has existential levels of risk exposure to Tether. A significant depeg or impairment to USDT would cause severe impact on primary market liquidity for USDe and may also cause capital losses. Once the current high growth phase subsides, Ethena is expected to shift towards smaller USDT balances in the 3-5% range, just enough to cover primary market liquidity needs and PNL settlement. Shifting a portion of stablecoin collateral from USDT to USDC may help improve USDe’s risk profile from Maker’s perspective, as Maker already has significant direct exposure to USDC but has remained fairly insulated from Tether. Additionally, trading with inverse perpetuals or linear perpetuals with USDC rather than USDT margin may reduce this indirect Tether exposure.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"risk-evaluation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#risk-evaluation-8\"></a>Risk Evaluation</h3>\n<p>Evaluating risk for Ethena requires subjective judgment, as the overwhelming majority of relevant risk factors are qualitative in nature. For example, the likelihood of counterparty risks emerging is fundamentally a qualitative assessment about creditworthiness and competence of various entities involved in the product. We have created a workbook to aggregate loss probability distributions of various risk factors to USDe, and provided reference inputs based on our best judgement of the likelihood of various types of failures. Users are welcome to test their own assumptions for inputs to derive different outputs.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/7/d733f38dfc0fdd7cbf593ca93456932f881c6315.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uHLXBUGtxkNKth9Tq9SLPObomUZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/7/d733f38dfc0fdd7cbf593ca93456932f881c6315_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"uHLXBUGtxkNKth9Tq9SLPObomUZ\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/7/d733f38dfc0fdd7cbf593ca93456932f881c6315_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/7/d733f38dfc0fdd7cbf593ca93456932f881c6315_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/7/d733f38dfc0fdd7cbf593ca93456932f881c6315.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F6F5\"></a></div><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfKr-haq1AIlFha_4DoIO3sRdk7BG7Xu7_CZMwc88R8/edit?usp=sharing\">sUSDe Review - 1 April 2024</a><p></p>\n<p>The primary model outputs are values for <code>risk premia</code> (an annualized measure of expected losses) and <code>probability of catastrophic loss</code> (potential for Maker to face losses exceeding the capacity to recapitalize through surplus buffer and debt auctions). Risk premia is useful to assess whether returns are adequate, and funds should be removed from allocation to USDe if returns are not at least high enough to cover Maker’s cost of capital (DSR), the risk premia, plus a spread for profitability and to account for uncertainty of risk premia. Probability of catastrophic loss figures can help set overall exposure limits, as this value should be kept to an acceptably low limit. However, the above risk metrics are only a rough estimate, and may over or underweight certain risk factors.</p>\n<p>When evaluating probability of catastrophic losses, we judge Maker’s loss absorbing capacity to be the expected surplus buffer balance (surplus buffer upper limit) plus 5% of outstanding DAI supply; we’ve seen other protocols such as Frax Finance have been able to manage negative equity well above this amount for prolonged periods without facing a bank run, so this threshold seems like a conservative but reasonable estimate of Maker’s financial capacity. We believe that debt ceiling should be constrained to ensure no more than 2% likelihood of exceeding this threshold, which puts catastrophic risk attributable to Ethena on par with other tail risk exposures at Maker including the protocols’ internal technical risk and risks attributable to the Ethereum base layer.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"parameter-recommendation-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#parameter-recommendation-9\"></a>Parameter Recommendation</h3>\n<p><strong>BA Labs recommends the Stability Facilitator to propose increasing the Spark MetaMorpho Vault DDM DC-IAM Line, corresponding MetaMorpho Vault supply caps and recommended dai allocation across the markets, which can go directly to the upcoming executive vote according to the language of the Stability Scope article 5.3.2;</strong></p>\n<h4><a name=\"parameter-summary-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#parameter-summary-10\"></a>Parameter summary:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>DDM DC-IAM Parameters:\n<ul>\n<li><code>line</code>: 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li><code>gap</code>: 100 million DAI</li>\n<li><code>ttl</code>: 24 hours</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Metamorpho Vault Parameters:\n<ul>\n<li>Market Caps:\n<ul>\n<li>USDe 77% LLTV pool cap: 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 86% LLTV pool cap: 500 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 91.5% LLTV pool cap: 200 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 94.5% LLTV pool cap: 10 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 77% LLTV pool cap: 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 86% LLTV pool cap: 200 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 91.5% LLTV pool cap: 50 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 94.5% LLTV pool cap: 10 million DAI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Recommended Vault DAI allocations:\n<ul>\n<li>Total allocation across all pools: 600 million DAI (+ 500 million DAI)</li>\n<li>USDe 77% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI (+ 5 million DAI)</li>\n<li>USDe 86% LLTV allocation: 330 million DAI (+ 320 million DAI)</li>\n<li>USDe 91.5% LLTV allocation: 150 million DAI (+ 120 million DAI)</li>\n<li>USDe 94.5% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI (+ 5 million DAI)</li>\n<li>sUSDe 77% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI (+ 5 million DAI)</li>\n<li>sUSDe 86% LLTV allocation: 50 million DAI (+ 40 million DAI)</li>\n<li>sUSDe 91.5% LLTV allocation: 30 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 94.5% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI (+ 5 million DAI)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"reasoning-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#reasoning-11\"></a>Reasoning</h4>\n<p>In our previous risk assessment, we recommended some general guidelines to constrain total allocation to USDe and sUSDe, limiting exposure to the lower of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10% of total ETH perp OI - roughly 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li>30% of USDe supply including Maker exposure - 600 million DAI</li>\n<li>20% of DAI supply - 980 million DAI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that Ethena is expected to begin allocating to BTC based delta neutral positions in the near future, so futures positions will be spread across a much larger asset base and the total OI threshold will become less of a constraint. Generally, if Ethena collateral base, operations, or other key factors chance, then the assessment of suitable exposure limits will also need to be revisited.</p>\n<p>Using the lowest of the above thresholds yields 600 million maximum recommended exposure to USDe. This will scale up gradually as Ethena grows, but for the time being we believe it is prudent to cap total allocation at this level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we recommend limiting allocation to an amount and configuration that keeps the risk of severe losses to an acceptably low level. This minimizes the risk that Maker itself could face insolvency due to problems with USDe. The return earned on USDe collateral should also be at least high enough to compensate for Maker’s marginal cost of capital (DSR) and annualized expected losses from USDe exposure (risk premium). These metrics are estimated in the risk evaluation section above. Based on our reference loss probability distribution and loss absorbing capacity estimates, we assess that Maker could allocate up to ~800 million to USDe through the Morpho vault within acceptable risk thresholds.</p>\n<p>Based on the above metrics, we recommend limiting allocations to a maximum of 600 million DAI total for the time being. However, we recommend setting the DDM <code>line</code> parameter to 1 billion DAI, to reduce the amount of governance overhead required to increase exposure in the future if relevant constraints change (for example, if USDe circulating supply increases).</p>\n<p>While we recommend to focus deployment on the 86% and 91.5% LLTV pools based on expected risk/reward efficiency, we also recommend to marginally increase funds deployed to the 77% and 94.5% pools to 10 million DAI each (an increase of 5 million DAI per pool). Increased deposit size will ensure pools are large enough for users to efficiently manage their positions and respond to changing interest rates and collateral return. This allows Maker to gather continuing performance data from these pools with greater validity, and ensures that the interest rate models will be properly calibrated based on supply and demand if Maker chooses to allocate more funds to any of these pools in the future.</p>\n<p>As a final note, the recently revealed Ethena points program for season 2 caps total USDe and sUSDe collateral eligible for incentives on Morpho at $500 million. If demand to borrow DAI through the vault drops off after this threshold, the multisig should be empowered to reduce allocations below $600 million until reaching a reasonable supply/demand balance and return profile that aligns with expected return on collateral (this can be roughly estimated by looking at Pendle YT vs PT pricing dynamics).</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/morpho-spark-dai-vault-update-1-april-2024/24006\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/morpho-spark-dai-vault-update-1-april-2024/24006","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 16:55:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24006"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/morpho-spark-dai-vault-update-1-april-2024/24006.rss","#text":"Morpho Spark DAI Vault Update - 1 April 2024"},"filter":true},{"title":"Offering cash bonus for successful employment referrals","dc:creator":"cloaky","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>I am pleased to announce a monetary incentive for referrals.

For those who refer candidates seeking part-time engagements, contributing at least 20 hours weekly, the reward is 500 DAI.</p>\n<p>I have composed a job description that elucidates the nature of the support I am seeking, which aims to contextualize the work drafters at Maker do in such a way that is comprehensible to the uninitiated. Below, you’ll find the job description, which you can use when sharing this opportunity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am reaching out to extend an invitation to those who harbor a profound enthusiasm for decentralized governance and/or game theory. This is an opportunity to deeply engage with the sphere of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), particularly to gain practical experience with MakerDAO, one of the most prominent DAOs in existence. MakerDAO, a multi-billion dollar protocol, is at the forefront of an unparalleled governance experiment designed to surmount the typical challenges encountered in decentralized governance systems. Your contribution could be pivotal.</p>\n<p>MakerDAO is evolving to align the self-interest of each participant within the ecosystem with MakerDAO’s objectives. This is achieved through the Atlas, a comprehensive governance document that delineates the actions and repercussions for various participant roles. Utilizing game theory to its maximum potential, the Atlas is structured to ensure that participants’ incentives are in harmony with the ecosystem’s best interests. Within this framework, a group known as Alignment Conservers is tasked with refining and implementing the Atlas to maintain this alignment. A subgroup, the Aligned Delegates, of which I am a member, exercises direct influence over voting and contributes to the Atlas’s enhancement through research and the development of amendments. I am equipped with budgetary resources to integrate additional support into my platform.</p>\n<p>The current focus of the Aligned Delegates is the development of the next-generation Atlas. To function effectively, the Atlas must be intricately detailed and descriptive, minimizing any ambiguity that could be exploited. To this end, Aligned Delegates are incorporating extensive supporting “data” in the form of structured text. We are specifically working on integrating two types of text data: Annotations and Action Tenets. Annotations clarify the context of terms with less apparent semantic meanings, and Action Tenets provide concrete, detailed legal instructions for the interpretation and execution of the Atlas’s components.</p>\n<p>This enhancement will significantly bolster the Atlas’s efficacy. Following this initial upgrade, the Atlas will be subject to continuous refinement, via a process outlined within its own framework. Artificial intelligence will be utilized in this ongoing process where feasible, and eventually, the Atlas will become so expansive and intricate that AI tools will be essential for its interpretation. These AI tools are currently under development. At this juncture, the Atlas will represent a fully operational, self-evolving autonomous organization without a central authority. The implications of such a system are vast, akin to AGI: a system - comprised of both human and AI elements - operating autonomously to perpetually self-improve, accumulate ecosystem intelligence, and strive towards shared objectives.</p>\n<p>I am involved in the drafting of this next-generation Atlas and am seeking to employ one or more individuals to support my initiatives. If this prospect excites you, I encourage you to make contact so we can discuss further. The potential for long-term engagement and professional development in this domain is substantial, and the experience gained would be highly esteemed within any protocol that employs decentralized governance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/offering-cash-bonus-for-successful-employment-referrals/24003\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/offering-cash-bonus-for-successful-employment-referrals/24003","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 15:06:24 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24003"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/offering-cash-bonus-for-successful-employment-referrals/24003.rss","#text":"Offering cash bonus for successful employment referrals"},"filter":false},{"title":"GOV12.1.2 Bootstrapping Edit Proposal - GOV10.2.3.1A Edit","dc:creator":"rema","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>Please consider adding the following language change to the Governance Scope element 10.2.3.1A, it is an extention of the Debt Ceiling Breaker GSM delay excaption for all crypto collateral vault types.

Some of the most notable progress has been made in developing network effects to boost crowdfunding of public goods, decentralizing and democratizing funding decision-making, and creating potential investment funnels in public goods based on retroactive funding.</p>\n<p>Quadratic Funding:</p>\n<p>QF is an application of quadratic voting that is designed to optimize the distribution of matching funds according to the preferences of the community. This is achieved by giving more weight to the number of people who support a cause over the total monetary amount going toward the cause. By democratizing the fund matching process QF incentivizes small donors to participate in the process and get an outsized influence over which projects get more funding. Meanwhile, large donors get social capital for funding the projects that the community wants to support.</p>\n<p>Retroactive Funding:</p>\n<p>Since it’s much easier to determine the impact of a public good after the fact instead of predicting expected impact, the idea of RF is to guarantee funding for successful public goods projects retroactively — once the impact is already assessed. By guaranteeing funding, an organization can create a market for VCs and individuals to invest in public goods based on their expected impact (instead of expected profitability).</p>\n<p>Impact Certificates:</p>\n<p>While both Quadratic Funding and Retroactive Funding require an external source of funding that can later create network effects around public goods funding, impact certificates attempt to create a market for public goods through speculation on the expected value of an NFT representing the impact of a public good. At the time of writing, this mechanism is still in early stages of development, and questions remain regarding the demand for such certificates (and whether market forces will drive investment based on actual impact, instead of distorting that market) but it shows how far the thinking in the field of regenerative economics has advanced compared to traditional funding models.”</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-4-articulating-a-clearer-vision-of-what-makers-public-good-purpose-system-could-look-like-based-on-the-spirit-of-the-rules-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-4-articulating-a-clearer-vision-of-what-makers-public-good-purpose-system-could-look-like-based-on-the-spirit-of-the-rules-12\"></a><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span> Articulating a clearer vision of what Maker’s Public Good Purpose System could look like, based on the spirit of the rules.</h3>\n<h1><a name=\"refi-aligned-scope-proposals-q1-2024-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#refi-aligned-scope-proposals-q1-2024-13\"></a>ReFi Aligned Scope Proposals Q1 2024</h1>\n<h1><a name=\"regenerative-finance-aligned-voter-committee-refi-avc-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#regenerative-finance-aligned-voter-committee-refi-avc-14\"></a>Regenerative Finance Aligned Voter Committee (ReFi AVC)</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-of-proposals-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#summary-of-proposals-15\"></a>Summary of Proposals</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Maker Atlas Immutable &amp; Mutable Alignment Artifacts (the “Atlas”), Aligned Voter Committees (AVCs) are instructed to draft an Aligned Scope Proposal for each of the five (5) Scopes, specifically focusing on the Advisory Council Articles.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge the current effective version of <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-4-alignment-conserver-ac-bootstrapping-focus\">MIP113 : Alignment Conserver (AC) Bootstrapping Focus</a> provision pertaining to additional AVC requirements::</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AVCs must devote the majority of their time and energy towards discussing and understanding how the Next Generation Atlas will work and how to incorporate AI efficiently into long term governance and AVC operations, as well as assisting in the creation of the Next Generation Atlas.

This exemption is determined retroactively by a Governance Facilitator when calculating AC compensation, and guidance for obtaining the exemption can be provided in advance given specific, Atlas-related KPIs, published by a Governance Facilitator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Members of ReFi AVC devoted the majority of their time and energy in Q1 2024 towards discussing and understanding how the Next Generation Atlas will work and how to incorporate AI efficiently into long term governance and AVC operations. ReFi AVC Member participants attended all meetings held by Atlas Axis during the quarter and devoted significant time during subcommittee meetings to explore what was shared in greater depth, with specific focus on the emerging Strategic Perspective of Regenerative Finance AVC.</p>\n<p><strong>Based on our participation, we believe the purpose and function of AVC Aligned Scope Proposals as defined in the current version of the Atlas should fit in as content inputs through the AVC Member “Reviewer” role in upcoming Atlas Axis workstreams set to begin after a core group of “Drafters” prepares Documents for our review.</strong></p>\n<p>As the practical and hands-on work ramps up on next phases of crafting the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-next-generation-atlas-and-governance-ai-tools/21686\">Next Generation Atlas and Governance AI Tools (GAITs)</a>, we expect the AVC Scope Proposal requirement and AVC Member role will be further clarified via Atlas amendment and shift away from unilateral Advisory Council Article proposals amending the static existing text of the Atlas MIPs set.</p>\n<p>How proposals become part of the Atlas will look entirely different from the current MIP102 monthly governance cycle voting. ReFi AVC believes it is time to focus our efforts on what that future process will look like and accept that progress on Advisory Council (aka “Scope Advisors”) can and should occur within the advanced rule sets and processes being developed through the Next Generation Atlas work streams.</p>\n<p>Accordingly we conclude it is appropriate to reiterate our limited Scope Proposals below, which have remained unchanged since the first pregame quarter-end (Q2 2023). No action or engagement with these proposals in their current form has occurred over the preceding quarters, nor has any consensus emerged on how the publication of this document can be useful, actionable or effective toward a particular end result. What has emerged instead is an impressive adjacent effort regarding the development of the AI-enabled Next Generation Atlas.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"advisory-council-articles-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#advisory-council-articles-16\"></a>Advisory Council Articles</h2>\n<p>Regenerative Finance (ReFi) AVC seeks a work product written by an Advisory Council member from each of the Scopes. This work product will establish the “starting point” that allows ReFi AVC to translate its <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VTd20IGDEX6IKtNUNh2z29P53LUXx7aFEFWdCAwYhtM/edit?usp=sharing\">Strategic Perspective</a> into position documents suited for ratification at the end of Q2 2024.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"introduction-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-17\"></a>Introduction</h3>\n<p>AVCs are tasked with 1) the improvement of the<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#scope-bounded-mutable-alignment-artifact-scope-artifact-\"> Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifacts</a> (Scope Artifacts) via 2) proposing updates to the Advisory Council Articles.</p>\n<p>At this early stage of the Pregame, we are generally aligned with the Atlas requirements that AVCs focus on building a self-sustainable, continuous improvement process for the Scopes, specifically by retaining appropriate<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-8-1-advisory-council-member-ecosystem-actors\"> Advisory Council Member Ecosystem Actors</a>.</p>\n<p>Yet it is not currently possible for AVCs to design an effective protocol for recruiting Advisory Council Members and prioritizing related projects. Such a task presupposes a significant range and depth of professional and experiential expertise in decentralized finance, traditional finance, and the MakerDAO ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The Atlas provides that such expertise should be procured through<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#scope-advisory-councils\"> Scope Advisory Councils</a> and not AVCs. Further, while Advisory Council Members can be domain experts in traditional or decentralized finance, it is not likely that they will have the needed expertise in the MakerDAO/NewDAO ecosystem. Indeed, given the innovative nature of Endgame, the core contributors, Facilitators and engaged Ecosystem Actors are likely the sole ecosystem actors who possess the requisite level of context and expertise in MakerDAO/NewDAO to provide a starting point for effective and helpful contributions by AVCs.</p>\n<p>Notably, the Atlas provides that AVCs may get professional input regarding possible improvements in Scope Artifacts from either Advisory Council Members or FacilitatorDAOs.</p>\n<p>ReFi AVC is not well positioned, nor is it permitted per the Atlas, to micromanage governance.</p>\n<p>In our interpretation, the explicit prohibition against “micromanagement” means that AVCs and AVC Members should not be involved with the day-to-day operating and management decisions being performed by the decentralized workforce of professional Ecosystem Actors, including at this stage defining at a granular level what processes, budgets and requirements should be upheld for Advisory Council hires.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposal-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposal-18\"></a>Proposal</h3>\n<p>A. Appoint Advisory Council Members to Identify High-Value Areas for Improvement in Scopes</p>\n<p>Our key proposal is that the relevant current Facilitators of each Scope Artifact use their powers to appoint one Ecosystem Actor for each Advisory Council. These Advisory Council Members will consult with the respective Scope Facilitators, as the latter are currently the most knowledgeable ecosystem actors and are intimately involved in the day-to-day of the Endgame transition.</p>\n<p>With the assistance of Scope Facilitators, the Advisory Council Members will deliver a report to AVCs that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>identifies the immediate areas for improvement within the Scopes that are most valuable to MKR holders and sets out the reasoning behind this selection; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>presents a proposal in the form of an Amendment to each of the Advisory Council Articles detailing:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(a) the process and objective requirements to guide FacilitatorDAOs in onboarding additional Advisory Council members to address the high-value areas requiring immediate improvement; and</p>\n<p>(b) the process and objective requirements to guide FacilitatorDAOs in allocating resources among the possible Advisory Council projects.</p>\n<p>B. Finding Suitable Advisory Council Members</p>\n<p>Using the Article references in the Governance Scope as an example, ReFi AVC proposes that effective April 1, 2024, Facilitators solicit proposals and find one suitable Advisory Council Member to deliver the above-described work product to the AVCs by June1, 2024.</p>\n<p>C. Timeline</p>\n<p>Facilitators should determine a limited process that meets the requirements of the relevant Scope Artifacts Scope Improvement Articles, and trigger the necessary Governance votes and forum posts in order to have a budget and Ecosystem Actors approved to start work on producing their work output deliverable by May 1, 2024.</p>\n<p>Facilitators should be mindful of the time constraints involved to deliver a useful work product to AVCs by June 1, 2024 giving us one month to incorporate the proposal information into our quarterly Scope Proposals. Thus, the requirements and process for soliciting applicants must be narrowly tailored to meet these constraints to the extent permitted by current versions of the Atlas. Such a process can be improved in later amendments that iterate on what was learned.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-19\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The above Scope Proposal meets the requirements of<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-9-interaction-of-aligned-voter-committees-avcs-aligned-delegates-ads-facilitatordaos-and-advisory-council-gov9\"> GOV 9</a>, as well as the AVC requirements regarding<a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-4-avc-advisory-council-focus\"> Scope Bootstrapping</a>:</p>\n<p>Considering the totality of relevant Atlas Scope Artifact provisions, as well as our mandate as stewards of the “spirit of the rules,” we propose that a foundation must first be laid before AVCs can fruitfully drive forward movement on the Advisory Council Articles.</p>\n<p>As set out above, domain experts should be brought on who can collaborate with Scope Facilitators to hone in on the high-value areas of improvement in the Scopes - starting with Article 1 and in a manner compatible with work underway on <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-next-generation-atlas-and-governance-ai-tools/21686\">the next generation Atlas and governance AI tools</a>. Once this foundation has been laid by the ecosystem actors with the most relevant domain knowledge, AVCs can step in to be more active in steering the quarterly improvement process.</p>\n<p>cc <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/fhomoney\">@fhomoney</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/abundance\">@Abundance</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/christiancdpetersen\">@christiancdpetersen</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/votewizard\">@votewizard</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/ldr\">@ldr</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/jansky\">@JanSky</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/refi-avc-2024-q1-aligned-governance-strategy-aligned-scope-proposals/23997\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/refi-avc-2024-q1-aligned-governance-strategy-aligned-scope-proposals/23997","pubDate":"Sun, 31 Mar 2024 22:59:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-23997"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/refi-avc-2024-q1-aligned-governance-strategy-aligned-scope-proposals/23997.rss","#text":"ReFi AVC 2024 Q1 Aligned Governance Strategy & Aligned Scope Proposals"},"filter":false},{"title":"Spark MetaMorpho DAI Vault Allocation","dc:creator":"rema","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<p>This forum thread will be used for communication in regards to the Spark MetaMorpho DAI vault allocation, according to <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104#5-3-2-2-management-of-metamorpho-vault\">Stability Scope 5.3.2.2</a>.</p>\n<p>The initial risk assessment of factors related to Ethena and Morpho protocols can be seen <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-usde-morpho-lending-integration/23924\">here</a>, but the analysis itself is ongoing and will be expanded through time as new information is obtained or due to possible changes to Ethena and Morpho protocols.

USDe can be minted through the Ethena front-end by whitelisted users who have passed KYC/AML checks or purchased permissionlessly in the secondary market from AMMs and DEXs.</p>\n<p>Unlike most delta-neutral strategies which use spot ETH as the primary collateral, the Ethena protocol generates yield from two sources: the staking yield from Ethereum collateral and the funding rate from short perpetual futures and/or basis spread from expiry futures contracts. The yield from staked ETH has been relatively steady around 5%, and while the yield from short futures positions varies considerably based on market conditions, there has historically been a positive funding rate and basis spread. The collective yield generated by the Ethena protocol collateral and futures contracts is passed to users who stake their USDe for sUSDe. Yield accumulates in the staking contract, increasing the value of sUSDe over time. Ethena maintains a growing reserve fund (currently $25.2M) from protocol surplus created by unstaked USDe to compensate sUSDe holders in the event of negative funding rates.</p>\n<p>Ethena accesses the futures market through a number of different centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget, Deribit, and Okx. In order to mitigate exchange failure risk, Ethena deposits all collateral with off-exchange settlement providers (e.g. Copper Clearloop). In the event of an exchange failure or bankruptcy, the collateral held with the off-exchange settlement provider can be transferred to open new futures positions in a different market. If there is a precipitous drop in the price of ETH and the exchange fails prior to a periodic settlement with the off-exchange settlement provider, it is possible for losses to occur. Ethena will utilize its reserve fund to absorb losses in these events. More information about the reserve fund can be found <a href=\"https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/solution-design/reserve-fund\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>While the Ethena protocol aims to provide a stable, market neutral yield, there remains a series of risks which are discussed in the section titled “<em>Risks</em>” below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"taco-foundation-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#taco-foundation-11\"></a>TACO Foundation</h2>\n<p>TACO Foundation (the “Parent”) is a Cayman Islands exempted limited guarantee foundation.

BlockTower provides its advisory services to privately offered pooled investment vehicles (“Funds”) as well as individual investors pursuant to separately managed accounts (“SMA Clients,” and together with the Funds, the “Clients”).  In rendering its advisory services, BlockTower draws from its personnel’s decades of combined experience across professional investing and trading, venture capital underwriting and investing and credit underwriting and investing.</p>\n<p>BlockTower generally invests with a focus on various cryptocurrencies, cryptocommodities, blockchain-based assets and networks, and decentralized platforms or protocols that are based on the blockchain, distributed ledger, directed acyclic graph or similar technologies (collectively, “Digital Assets”) as well as non-Digital Asset markets such as traditional credit underwriting, structuring and investing. BlockTower’s advisory services consist of investigating, identifying, and evaluating investment opportunities, structuring, negotiating, and making investments, managing and monitoring asset performance and monetizing such investments.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the proposed Separately Managed Account Agreement by and between the Subsidiary and BlockTower (the “Project Ethena SMA”), BlockTower will manage, supervise and direct the assets in the Subsidiary’s managed account based on guidelines and instructions provided by the Subsidiary to BlockTower and the Paying Agent. As noted above, the Project Ethena SMA contemplates a series of transactions whereby Digital Assets from the Andromeda Vault are deployed to acquire USDe and stake such USDe into sUSDe. The guidelines and instructions related to the deployment/return of such Digital Assets can be found in Exhibit A of the Project Ethena SMA and are summarized in “The Transactions and Flow of Funds–Deployment” below.</p>\n<p>For services provided on Project Ethena, BlockTower will be paid Management Fees of 250 basis points (the “Management Fees”).  The Management Fees will be paid on a monthly basis and calculated using the average net asset value of the assets of the Subsidiary’s managed account during the applicable calendar month.  Under the Project Ethena SMA, BlockTower is guaranteed a total minimum fee of $2,500,000 over a one year period.  In recognition of the uncertain crypto regulatory environment in the United States, BlockTower will also have access to an indemnity that is capped at $2,500,000 and will remain available for 48 months following the Inception Date.  In the event that BlockTower needs to access the Indemnity Amount, the Paying Agent is authorized to provide the necessary amount of funds from TACO’s bank account.</p>\n<p>BlockTower brings the professional expertise required to implement Project Ethena and execute strategies related to fund funding rate arbitrage and/or delta neutral investment strategies. Such expertise include executing investment strategies related to digital assets, trading derivatives like futures and perpetual contracts, and managing yield-bearing, staking products. BlockTower and it’s investment professionals demonstrate this expertise through the operation of its Flagship Fund, which invests in the same spot and/or derivative markets that the Ethena Protocol operates on, and previous operation of its Market Neutral Fund, which primarily focused on funding rate arbitrage on major exchanges similar to Ethena.</p>\n<p>** <em>Please note that such registration does not imply a certain level of skill or training.

For an extended discussion of risks, please visit the <a href=\"https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/solution-overview/risks\">Ethena Protocol website</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Regulatory Risks.</strong> The digital assets industry is subject to an extensive, highly-evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape. Many of the applicable legal and regulatory regimes were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile technologies, crypto assets, and related technologies. As a result, some applicable laws and regulations do not contemplate or address unique issues associated with the crypto economy, are subject to significant uncertainty, and vary widely across jurisdictions globally. These legal and regulatory regimes, including the laws, rules, and regulations thereunder, evolve frequently and may be modified, interpreted, and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another. To the extent TACO is deemed to have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations in connection with Project Ethena, it could be subject to significant fines and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect MakerDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Minting USDe Risks.</strong> Minting USDe involves interacting with the Ethena Protocol as well as certain off-chain components of Ethena’s business, which may be subject to potential technical, operational and other failures. Ethena has the option to stop minting of USDe, prior to transfer of any assets, due to <a href=\"https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/solution-design/minting-usde/mint-and-redeem-key-functions\">specified conditions</a>.</p>\n<p>Minting USDe comes with the potential for slippage (i.e., the potential to receive more or less than 1.00 USDe for 1.00 USDC or vice versa). An acceptable slippage limit, specified within every deployment / return proposal, can be specified within the Ethena Protocol prior to minting, guaranteeing some level of certainty of the price for transactions. Slippage may be due to an imbalance in the underlying USDe pools, as large minting volumes may cause temporary price dislocations before market makers are able to arbitrage them away. An illustrative example of how certain market makers seek to arbitrage price dislocations, and thus maintain the USDe peg to a dollar may include:</p>\n<p>USDe Trading at a Discount</p>\n<p>If USDe is worth less in an external market than from Ethena, a market maker could:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy 1x USDe at 0.95 from Curve using USDC.</li>\n<li>Redeem 1x USDe at 1.00 from Ethena Labs receiving ETH.</li>\n<li>Sell the received ETH for USDC on Curve.</li>\n<li>Generate a Profit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>USDe Trading at a Premium</p>\n<p>If USDe is worth more in an external market than from Ethena, a market maker could:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mint USDe using ETH from Ethena Labs.</li>\n<li>Sell the USDe in the Curve pool for &gt; 1.00 of USDC.</li>\n<li>Buy ETH using USDC on Curve.</li>\n<li>Generate a Profit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ethena can set a max limit for the number of USDe tokens that can be minted per block.</p>\n<p><strong>Redeeming USDe Risks.</strong> Like minting USDe, redeeming USDe involves interacting with the Ethena Protocol as well as offchain components of Ethena’s business, which may be subject to potential technical, operational and other failures. Redeeming USDe comes with the potential for slippage (i.e., the potential to receive more or less than 1.00 USDe for 1.00 USDC or vice versa) with two potential mechanisms, depending on size and timeframe. First, Ethena holds liquid collateral to process redemptions; however, for users intending to redeem a large amount, they will need to redeem over several blocks, which may cause a delay in redemptions and potential slippage. Second, there is an open market for USDe, including on Curve and Binance, for selling out of USDe and enabling market makers to arbitrage potential dislocations, similar to the methods illustrated in the risk titled “Minting USDe Risks” above. Ethena can set a max limit for the number of USDe tokens that can be redeemed per block, which may cause significant delays in redemptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Staking / Un-staking USDe Risks.</strong> Staking USDe into sUSDe involves interacting with the Ethena Protocol and certain offchain components of Ethena’s business, which may be subject to potential technical, operational and other failures.</p>\n<p>There is a cooldown period, currently set at seven days (subject to change), covering the time from when a user unstakes sUSDe and receives the underlying USDe. This cooldown period can be set by the Ethena protocol up to a maximum of 90 days, which is enforced by smart contracts. Ethena can also impose “locks on sUSDe held in specific wallets due to legal requirements to ensure sanctioned, criminal, and other high-risk actors are not able to interact with the staking contract and receive any protocol rewards, and in the interest of complying with Sanctions, Anti- Money Laundering, and Combating the Financing of Terrorism regimes.” Additionally, it is possible that Ethena may impose such locks for other reasons.</p>\n<p>According to the Ethena website, “[u]sers can only receive a positive or zero yield holding sUSDe. The value of sUSDe will NOT decline, even in periods where the protocol is earning negative yield, as the protocol does not and cannot remove assets from the staking contract.”4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no guarantee that users can only receive a positive or zero yield holding sUSDe.</p>\n<p><strong>Oracle Risks.</strong> Ethena relies on certain oracles, such as Pyth and Redstone oracles during the minting and redeeming of USDe. Using the price feed from these oracles, the Ethena smart contracts will mint / redeem USDe typically within 5% of the price provided by these oracles. Oracle price feeds may be subject to hacks, manipulation, and front-running, among other risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding Rate Risks.</strong> Ethena uses perpetual contracts to hedge the delta of the collateral assets backing USDe and the protocol is thereby exposed to funding rate risks associated with those perpetual contracts. Funding rates are designed to ensure that the prices of perpetual contracts align closely with the underlying asset’s market price, but they can invert rapidly in response to sharp market movements, exposing traders to significant financial risk. Additionally, liquidity in perpetual futures markets is often fragmented across different exchanges, leading to disparities in pricing and increased slippage risk during trade execution.</p>\n<p>Currently, Ethena is integrated with real-time futures market providers, like Coinanalysze, Kaiko and Amberdata, in order to monitor for scenarios like negative funding rates or material reductions in open interest and respond accordingly. The failure of such integrations could result in an impairment of Ethena’s team to understand and mitigate the risks associated with the underlying funding rate risk of sUSDe.</p>\n<p>In the scenario of negative funding rates, where taking a delta neutral position with long spot and short perpetuals results in a payment of interest, Ethena has a reserve fund in place to absorb these payments for a short period. However, in prolonged, severely negative funding scenarios, there is a potential for a loss of value in USDe and sUSDe. The following historical data gives some indication to adverse market scenarios and the resulting funding rate dynamics.</p>\n<p>In the following charts, depicting daily realized funding rate for ETH perpetual futures, one can observe the historical volatility of funding rates, which may or may not be similar or different in the future. In the observed dataset, illustrated below, the most significant negative daily realized funding rate occurred at around -5.7%, which sustained for two days between September 14, 2022 and September 15, 2022 for coin margined ETH perpetual futures on the Deribit exchange. The second most significant negative daily funding rate event occurred at -3.95% on 3/12/23 on Deribit again. It also should be noted that Ethena claims that the yield from ETH staking is a mitigant to negative funding rates.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/9/19943dc5ed629d6770152aad5dedecd8d8f46280.png\" alt=\"Funding Rate Chart 1\" data-base62-sha1=\"3EhxCxCfoa1aT3sWQXIageega2Y\" width=\"621\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/1/f1dd694b8431df623b54a24c00d4d2d489df1500.png\" alt=\"Funding Rate Chart 2\" data-base62-sha1=\"yvDroJFrEzgYiNPCn84qkHOgv9m\" width=\"621\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p>Source: Amberdata</p>\n<p><strong>Liquidation Risks.</strong> Within Ethena’s hedging system, Ethena intends to use minimal leverage on the positions held within perpetual futures exchanges. Despite this policy, there still exists potential for liquidation associated with dislocations between the collateral asset (e.g., stETH) used to margin Ethena’s perpetual futures positions, and the underlying asset of the perpetual future (e.g., ETH or stETH). In such scenarios, if a significant discount in stETH were to occur (e.g., more than 60% discount), the minimum collateral maintenance ratios on perpetual future exchanges may be triggered and positions would be incrementally liquidated. In the event of liquidations, collateral assets may be sold at a discount, depending on the volume of liquidations, resulting in slippage and a potential de-peg of USDe from the U.S. Dollar.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Staking Risks.</strong> Staking yield obtained through liquid staking tokens have two primary risk vectors. First, the underlying Ethereum network validators may be subject to loss of funds associated with slashing events occurring at the validator-level. Second, liquid staking token platforms impose an additional degree of smart contract, governance and liquidity risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Counterparty Risks.</strong> Primary counterparty risk exists with Ethena. The organization behind Ethena Protocol controls the minting/redeeming of smart contracts, off-chain hedging system and front-end application portal. Each of these components are subject to potential technical failure, hacks and closure.</p>\n<p>In addition, secondary counterparty risk exists within Ethena’s hedging system, which interacts with centralized exchanges (e.g., Binance, Derabit), custodians (e.g., Copper), and third-party decentralized finance protocols (e.g., Curve). The proper functioning of Ethena’s hedging system is necessary for USDe to maintain its peg to the U.S. Dollar via market arbitrage mechanisms/opportunities. Such functions are dependent (in part) upon the secondary counterparties described herein and each of these counterparties may be subject to, without limitation, hacks, interrupted services, smart contract risks and/or closures.</p>\n<p>For example, should a centralized exchange that Ethena’s hedging system interacts with suffer from a period of interrupted service or closures, this, in turn, may result in potential loss of funds on such centralized exchange and/or periods of the underlying positions being unhedged. While such counterparty risks to centralized exchanges may be mitigated by having custodians (e.g., Copper) custody the collateral assets backing USDe (e.g., stETH) in off-exchange custodial platforms (e.g., Copper Clearloop), custodial platforms are also subject to risks. For example, should a custodian that Ethena’s hedging system interacts with suffer from a hack, interrupted services and/or closure, it is possible that the Ethena Protocol could suffer a temporary or permanent loss of funds which may result in slippage and a potential de-peg of USDe from the U.S. Dollar. Such a failure could impair the ability of the client to redeem its assets for fair value. Lastly, should a DeFi protocol (e.g., Curve) the Ethena’s Hedging System interacts with suffer from a period of interrupted service or closures, such an event could impair the ability of the Client to redeem its USDe for USDC (or other Digital Assets), resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Custodial Risks.</strong> Coinbase serves as the Custodian on Project Ethena via an account in the name of the Subsidiary. Coinbase offers an institutional platform, the Web3 Wallet (“W3W”), for asset custody, DeFi integrations and wallet solutions. For security, Project Ethena will set up a multi-approver process for W3W, whereby, at least two parties need to be engaged for transactions to be initiated and signed. Additionally, within W3W, the Destination Protection functionality permits assets only to be transferred to pre-approved, pre-vetted addresses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no guarantee that the Custodian’s system will not be subject to security breaches, technical failures, or unauthorized access, which may lead to the loss or theft of assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflicts of Interest.</strong> The Arranger is subject to conflicts of interest in providing its services in connection with Project Ethena. Specifically, a client account advised by the Arranger (and in which capital of BlockTower Persons is invested) is an investor in Ethena, the issuer of USDe/sUSDe, and has equity interest in Ethena. Increases or decreases in USDe/sUSDe may cause increases or decreases in the equity value of Ethena and its platform because it would lead to increases or decreases in total value locked on the Ethena Protocol. Furthermore, other client accounts advised by the Arranger (and in which capital of BlockTower Persons is invested) hold Digital Assets issued by MakerDAO (e.g., MKR and DAI). As the Project Ethena assets are primarily managed for the benefit of MakerDAO, any profits or losses associated with Project Ethena may work to increase or decrease the speculative value of MKR.</p>\n<p>Similarly, given that the Digital Assets used to fund the TACO Account originate from the Andromeda vault (and the Digital Assets contained in the vault are used to back DAI’s peg to the U.S. Dollar), it is possible that any losses sustained by the TACO Account as a result of the contemplated transactions may negatively affect the value of DAI, and in severe, adverse scenarios, may cause potential de-pegs of DAI from the U.S. Dollar. In the event DAI were to de-peg from the U.S. Dollar, a client account advised by the Arranger would be incentivized to purchase discounted DAI in order to close out its DAI denominated loan with the Parent.

We propose establishing “<em>SubdaoLST</em>”, where user sends ETH and receives METH (LST issued by “SubdaoLST”), which not only carries minting power but also functions as a source of fees for validators, akin to LIDO but with inherent minting capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integration with SparkLend:</strong> <em>SparkLend</em> will complement this setup.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The Hedged Position:</strong><br>\nMETH Vault - on SubdaoLST<br>\nWETH Borrow - on SparkLend<br>\nDAI Lending - on SparkLend</p>\n<h3><a name=\"on-napkin-model-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#on-napkin-model-2\"></a>On Napkin Model:</h3>\n<p>The parameters governing the strategy’s configuration must ensure a healthy and adaptable position, even under scenarios of high volatility.

Essentially, the placement and financing rates are equivalent due to Maker’s ecosystem mechanism.</p>\n<p>We need to establish a fee model in line with this mechanism. Our suggestion:<br>\nThe fee should be variable with respect to the <strong>“Global DAI Rate”</strong>, although we haven’t found evidence if this concept has been utilized or measured. It essentially refers to the <strong>average fee generated per each DAI in circulation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>\n55% of DAI emissions come from PSM + RWA, yielding an average rate of 3.87%*<br>\n45% of DAI emissions come from crypto collateral, with an average rate of 16%*<br>\n*These examples are purely hypothetical and do not reflect actual rates.<br>\nThis results in a global average rate per DAI used of <strong>9,3285% (GF)</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-establishing-global-fee-gf-as-sf-for-subdaolst-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-1-establishing-global-fee-gf-as-sf-for-subdaolst-4\"></a><strong>1- Establishing Global Fee (GF) as SF for SubdaoLST</strong></h3>\n<p><em>We will use GF for METH, and after observing results, a spread may be added if deemed necessary.</em></p>\n<h4><a name=\"we-must-distinguish-between-dai-in-circulation-and-d3m-dai-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#we-must-distinguish-between-dai-in-circulation-and-d3m-dai-5\"></a>We must distinguish between <strong>DAI in circulation</strong> and <strong>D3M DAI</strong></h4>\n<p>Initiatives based on Ethena issue DAI collateralized with the product itself, USDe/SUSDe. All earnings stem from this new exposure, without any prior collateral; just like RWA. These alternatives create POA (Protocol-owned Assets).</p>\n<p>When trying to gauge the potential yield of ESDAI for Maker, we encounter a point of uncertainty. Starting from the premise that “every DAI in circulation generates income for Maker” and that the DAI emitted by ESDAI is “<strong>DAI in circulation</strong>”, then, since this DAI generates an implicit rate (not directly perceived by the product), how do we net out the yield of ESDAI for the DAO? What do we apply to evaluate this? Including this indirect perception is a way to incorporate all income concepts of ESDAI.</p>\n<p>Initially, we thought of using the “Stability Collateral Yield Benchmark” since the PSM seems to be the entry point to ESDAI, with no liquidity limit and without exposing to crypto collateral for the minter. The minter switches from USDC to DAI through PSM and from there to ESDAI.</p>\n<p>However, we encounter possible scenarios where this rate exceeds that of minting from crypto collateral. In such cases, we would be subsidizing a deficit rate, especially if the demand for ESDAI surpasses that of minting from crypto collateral.</p>\n<p>Thus, we revert to the earlier concept: Global Fee (GF). GF will always self-regulate and represents the rate the protocol receives for each DAI in circulation. Therefore:</p>\n<p><strong>If a user enters ESDAI, what they are paying for those DAI, regardless of their source, is already included in GF. Considering this indirect payment is a way to net out the comparison of ESDAI performance against POA alternatives like USDe or RWA.</strong></p>\n<h3><a

ESDAI generates a lower yield (measured in APY) for the DAO compared to other products, revenues can potentially be higher since the risk of ESDAI does not need to limit the debt ceiling as much as it does for other products. For example, an interesting exercise could be comparing ESDAI with the direct implementation of acquiring sUSDe; we didn’t find if a debt ceiling has been defined here based on the net APY perceived by the Dao and its debt ceiling; how much will Maker’s income be with this Ethena product? Then, based on the APY of ESDAI, calculate the TVL needed to achieve the same income for the Dao. So, coming to the final point of the conclusion; the debt ceiling is tied to perceived risk, ESDAI has advantages in this regard, it doesn’t need to limit itself; this is where we see the risk/reward exemplified and mathematically calculated.</h5>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-high-performance-product-idea-100-native/23977\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-high-performance-product-idea-100-native/23977","pubDate":"Thu, 28 Mar 2024 14:42:23 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-23977"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-high-performance-product-idea-100-native/23977.rss","#text":"A High-Performance Product idea; 100% native"},"filter":false},{"title":"Maker DAO Faucet on Goerli giving 0 MKR - blocked bot setup guide still","dc:creator":"LetsMake","category":"Developer's Talk","description":"<p>Hey,</p>\n<p>I’m new to Maker DOE and I am trying to setup an Auction Keeper Bot and to run it against a testnet to learn the internals of Maker DAO more.

The DAO has reduced the debt ceiling to zero and submitted a redemption for its holdings.</p>\n<p>The vault’s three assets (totaling $2.1mm) are in default. These defaulted assets collateralize the $1.8mm in aggregate Drop token market value and were issued by a single consumer electronics company, which has in turn pledged its receivables as collateral.</p>\n<p>The default began in April 2023 and Harbor Trade is currently engaged in a workout process to recover as much value as possible for the transaction. Steakhouse has been communicating regularly with Harbor Trade, who provided an update on the workout process in early January:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Harbor has been diligently working on a workout strategy for the past few months, combining court intervention and negotiation with the defaulted company to establish a formal payment plan. The California court has granted us a writ of attachment, providing the authority to seize assets such as bank accounts and inventory. Additionally, a default judgment has been entered in our favor. We selected California as the jurisdiction for this legal action based on our lawyer’s advice and the knowledge of inventory collateral in the state.</p>\n<p>However, despite these legal advancements, we have encountered challenges in locating the company’s inventory in California.

The Maker protocol will maintain complete control over the parameters of Spark DAI Morpho Vault DDM (DC-IAM, Line, Gap and Ttl) and Morpho Vault supply Caps per market. The vault itself is a new product of Spark, that will be adopted by SparkDAO once it becomes live according to the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/makerdao-endgame-launch-season/23857\">MakerDAO Endgame: Launch Season</a>.</p>\n<p>According to Stability Scope 5.3.2.2, the MetaMorpho vault will be managed via multisig controlled by Governance Facilitators based on instructions by the Stability Facilitator based on advice by the Stability Advisor until SparkDAO is deployed and functional with its own processes regulated by the language of the Stability Scope. The multisig signers can be extended later in time. It is very important to point out that multisig will only be able to allocate capital between the allowed markets that are controlled by their respective supply caps set by Maker governance, the idle market and also controls the total amount of dai being deployed towards markets which is limited by the DDM DC-IAM parameters set by Maker governance. Changes to DDM parameters and MetaMorpho Vault markets and their respective supply caps can only be introduced via Maker executive vote. The potential unwanted outcomes which could be produced by the multisig is thus very limited.</p>\n<p>The MetaMorpho Vault will have the performance fee set to 0, meaning that supplier (Maker’s DDM) will receive all the accrued fees, the parameter can be reconfigured later in time by the Maker governance. In the future there is a possibility that Morpho would turn on the protocol fee, which is currently disabled.</p>\n<p>USDe will use a fixed oracle price set to 1:1 to DAI, while sUSDe will use the Ethena exchange rate based oracle price which is used to calculate interest distribution. This means that user’s collateral in USDe will remain at the same value over time while sUSDe collateral will increase in value. While the markets’ use of a fixed USDe value will not account for any USDe price discount directly, risks can be mitigated via other parameters like LLTV and vault pool caps. Overcollateralization protects from potential USDe price deviation, meaning that allocation to higher LLTV markets is riskier. Given USDe’s relatively low trading volumes and limited exchange support, the use of a market price oracle presents more risk than benefit as it may be subject to manipulation.</p>\n<p>The DDM will also be supported by the <a href=\"https://manual.makerdao.com/governance-processes/executive-vote-considerations/gsm-exceptions#direct-deposit-breaker\">Direct Deposit Breaker GSM Exception</a>, meaning that Maker governance can pull available liquidity out of the Morpho vault without the GSM delay in case of emergency or other reasons.</p>\n<p>The DDM audit report can be seen <a href=\"https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/makerdao-d3m-erc-4626/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in the case of emergency the multisig can be very useful, as it can allocate all non borrowed liquidity to the idle market, thus preventing further borrowing much faster compared to Direct Deposit Breaker which requires a spell execution.</p>\n<p><strong>BA Labs recommends the Stability Facilitator to trigger the deployment of DDM to Spark DAI Morpho Vault, introduce the initial DAI Morpho Vault Markets and their corresponding Caps and propose the initial market dai allocation, which can go directly to the upcoming executive vote according to the language of the Stability Scope article 5.3.2;</strong></p>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>DDM DC-IAM Parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>line</code>: 100 million DAI</li>\n<li><code>gap</code>: 100 million DAI</li>\n<li><code>ttl</code>: 24 hours</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Metamorpho Vault Parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Market Caps:\n<ul>\n<li>USDe 77% LLTV pool cap: 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 86% LLTV pool cap: 100 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 91.5% LLTV pool cap: 50 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 94.5% LLTV pool cap: 10 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 77% LLTV pool cap: 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 86% LLTV pool cap: 100 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 91.5% LLTV pool cap: 50 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 94.5% LLTV pool cap: 10 million DAI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Recommended Vault DAI allocations:\n<ul>\n<li>USDe 77% LLTV allocation: 5 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 86% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 91.5% LLTV allocation: 30 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 94.5% LLTV allocation: 5 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 77% LLTV allocation: 5 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 86% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 91.5% LLTV allocation: 30 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 94.5% LLTV allocation: 5 million DAI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>BA Labs recommends the Stability Facilitator to update the Stability Scope article 5.3.2.1A: Current exposure meta-parameter to 100 million DAI;</strong></p>\n<p>5.3.2.1A: Current exposure</p>\n<p>¤¤¤</p>\n<p>Current target exposure of Morpho sUSDe or USDe vault is: 100 million DAI</p>\n<p>¤¤¤</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Edit (27 March 2024):</strong> Updated proposed allocation for 91.5% LLTV pools from 35 million to 30 million DAI to align total allocation amount with DDM debt ceiling of 100 million DAI.</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/introduction-and-initial-parameters-for-ddm-overcollateralized-spark-metamorpho-ethena-vault/23925\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/introduction-and-initial-parameters-for-ddm-overcollateralized-spark-metamorpho-ethena-vault/23925","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 21:58:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-23925"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/introduction-and-initial-parameters-for-ddm-overcollateralized-spark-metamorpho-ethena-vault/23925.rss","#text":"Introduction and Initial Parameters for DDM & Overcollateralized Spark MetaMorpho Ethena Vault"},"filter":true},{"title":"Risk Assessment - USDe Morpho Lending Integration","dc:creator":"monet-supply","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>The following is a risk analysis and review of integration details for Ethena’s USDe stablecoin (referred to by Ethena as a “synthetic dollar”) as collateral via the Morpho Blue lending protocol.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"morpho-risk-factors-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#morpho-risk-factors-1\"></a>Morpho Risk Factors</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"technical-implementation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#technical-implementation-2\"></a>Technical Implementation</h4>\n<p>The Morpho Blue lending protocol and accompanying Metamorpho vault aggregation protocol has only been on mainnet for a few months, and to date has reached roughly $250 million in total deposits. As the protocol is relatively new and has not held significant TVL for a long period, there may be more risk of technical faults compared with more time tested protocols. However, Morpho Blue and Metamorpho have very compact codebases (~600 LOC and ~800 LOC respectively) with simple logic, which limits the surface area of potential faults.</p>\n<p>Maker also has DDM / conduit deployments which introduce some degree of technical risk. These components will be audited and thoroughly reviewed before deployment of funds to minimize likelihood of faults.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"rate-models-and-liquidity-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#rate-models-and-liquidity-3\"></a>Rate Models and Liquidity</h4>\n<p>The standard Morpho Blue interest rate model uses an automation scheme to adjust borrow rates according to supply and demand of liquidity. In addition to the standard utilization based rate model, borrow rate at optimal utilization is continuously updated if utilization is above or below target, with a maximum rate of change of 2x up or down per 5 days. The borrow rate at 100% utilization is 4x the optimal borrow rate.</p>\n<p>If sUSDe yield changes rapidly, this could result in periods of very high or low utilization. In case of rapid yield increases (greater than 4x from baseline), the market could be stuck at 100% utilization for a multi day period until optimal borrow rate adjusts sufficiently higher. On the other hand, if sUSDe yield falls sharply, the market could sit at very low levels of utilization for a multi day period while borrowing rates adjust down.</p>\n<p>Given the potential for divergence between optimal borrow rate and sUSDe yield (or USDe implied yield from shards), we should expect that the total earnings from the Morpho vault will have some amount of drag on efficiency; when yield increases quickly the borrow rate will be artificially capped, while during rapid yield drops utilization will be well below the optimal ratio. However, the only conditions that would negatively impact Maker risk is when yields increase very quickly, which reduces the vault’s liquidity profile. Rapid declines in yield are risk neutral.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"metamorpho-curator-operations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#metamorpho-curator-operations-4\"></a>Metamorpho Curator Operations</h4>\n<p>Metamorpho vaults rely on curators to manage allocation of funds across pools within pre-set caps. Typically, this role is managed via multisig to maintain agility, while the process of setting caps is done with a more deliberate governance process including timelock delays and potentially veto rights. The DAI vault is planning to use a multisig to manage allocation within caps set by Maker governance. While failure of the curator multisig should not result in loss of funds, because they can only be moved to whitelisted pools within defined limits, it could lead to temporary interruption of service, with funds not being actively rebalanced to maximize performance.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ethena-and-usde-risk-factors-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#ethena-and-usde-risk-factors-5\"></a>Ethena and USDe Risk Factors</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"custody-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#custody-6\"></a>Custody</h4>\n<p>Ethena makes use of off exchange custody providers to manage its collateral for perp hedging positions. This reduces counterparty risk exposure to exchange hacks, credit events, and insolvencies. However, there remain certain custody related risk factors that could impact USDe value.</p>\n<p>Off exchange custody providers have strong track records and operational standards, but they could still fall victim to a hack or other adverse event that could result in losses or interruption in service. Funds are expected to be held in segregated accounts within bankruptcy remote legal structures (to both the exchanges and the custodian’s general operations), but in some cases the protection from creditors may be challenged, and in the case of severe mismanagement or fraud by custody solution providers or exchanges Ethena may still face losses despite these protections. Custodians are also accountable to various jurisdictions and could be forced to censor transactions or freeze assets based on court orders or other legal processes. They are located outside of the US, but may still be forced to comply with US government requests in some circumstances.</p>\n<p>Because off exchange custody arrangements are fairly new, there are limited examples of the arrangements working in practice. The most notable success story is when Coinflex went under and became inaccessible to users, Copper users received 100% of their funds, including unrealized profit/loss, within days. This is a significant, demonstrable benefit versus direct exchange exposure, where Coinflex creditors are still locked in a bankruptcy process.</p>\n<p>Example: Copper Clearloop</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copper has never been hacked or lost users’ funds</li>\n<li>Copper users’ funds were wholly available within days of Coinflex’s (exchange) failure</li>\n<li>Copper users’ funds are a part of a bankruptcy-remote trust, meaning in the event of Copper’s failure, users’ funds are not a part of the Copper estate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Exchanges post collateral with Copper ahead of time to ensure users’ PnL is settled each cycle. This enables Copper to ensure users receive their PnL even if an exchange refuses to settle. Ethena retains the ability to dispute erroneous exchange settlement requests.</p>\n<p>However, in less binary outcomes, it is not clear how any disputes between exchange and user would be adjudicated, and disputes could theoretically result in funds being frozen or unavailable for prolonged periods. Custodians may struggle to safeguard against potential for faulty notices or requests from integrated exchanges, for example liquidation notices that request a transfer of Ethena’s collateral to cure debt, though each solution either protects against this up front via dispute systems or has curing mechanisms for faulty notices or requests.</p>\n<p>We also note that certain exchanges have potential overlapping relationships, interests, or common control with custody providers and/or liquid staking providers. Examples including Binance, Ceffu (now said to be independent but formerly doing business as Binance Custody), and WBETH, along with Bybit and Mantle METH. These overlaps could undermine the protections provided by off exchange custody by giving exchange operators additional leverage over Ethena collateral assets.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"trading-operations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#trading-operations-7\"></a>Trading Operations</h4>\n<p>Ethena carries out basis trading and other operations via sophisticated trading infrastructure. This involves reliance on price feeds, various technical/cloud infrastructure, linkages with custody providers and exchanges, and other dependencies. Key services going down could interfere with Ethena’s trading activity, which may result in loss of funds depending on market conditions.</p>\n<p>Ethena enables minting and redemptions using price feeds and other market data to evaluate the appropriate quote to give counterparties for minting and redeeming USDe, accounting for Ethena’s own trading costs and market impact. Faulty data or compromised systems could result in Ethena’s system giving bad quotes and leaking value. For now minting and redemptions are limited to whitelisted, fully-KYC’d parties which significantly reduces risk via known counterparties, but if this is opened up to a wider set of users in the future the risk of losing money increases. Based on current per block mint and redeem limits, Ethena could lose up to $750,000 per block ($225 million per hour) in a worst case where mint keys are fully compromised and give the worst possible quotes for both ; however this degree of loss is extremely unlikely as there are additional control mechanisms that can shut off mint and redeem operations, and bad quotes would more plausibly result in moderate value leakage, for example roughly $500,000 to $2 million per hour if quotes were 1-2% off market.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting Ethena charges a slight markup for mint/redeem USDe requests given Ethena pays for the ETH gas of the transaction, execution costs on exchange, as well a small buffer in case of market volatility. The cost is calculated by summing the three components that contribute to the all-in minting/redeeming cost. This cost is passed onto users so Ethena minimizes risk of losses arising from slippage or bad pricing (losses could only result from significant and unexpected changes in market prices or conditions). This fee is a constant and is meant to protect the protocol against the possibility of continuous trading operation losses over time.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"authentication-and-systems-integrity-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#authentication-and-systems-integrity-8\"></a>Authentication and Systems Integrity</h4>\n<p>While exchanges and custodians generally have reliable systems and key management practices, including cold storage, customers like Ethena may form a weak link in some cases, resulting in risk of loss. Ethena needs continuous and rapid access to funds to undertake hedging and trading operations, which limits the ability to have true “cold storage” practices for keys and other authentication materials. Compromise of exchange or custodian API keys, crypto wallets involved in system operations, physical authentication tokens, or internal communications methods could result in loss of funds. Insufficient internal controls and role based permissions could also cause losses via unauthorized actions or misappropriation.</p>\n<p>Ethena may have some key man / bus risk factors, depending on how authentication and permissions are distributed across responsible team members and backed up. If key contributors become incapacitated or are out of touch for a period of time, funds could be lost or become temporarily unavailable, or it may not be possible to operate certain system components such as exchange accounts or on-chain addresses.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"ethena-entity-risk-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#ethena-entity-risk-9\"></a>Ethena Entity Risk</h4>\n<p>Ethena is similar to an RWA project in some ways, as the underlying assets backing USDe are currently not secured on-chain but instead are held via legal entities. This allows Ethena to integrate with centralized exchanges and allow for the delta-neutral strategy to reach meaningful scale, which is not currently possible on decentralized perpetual exchanges due to limited liquidity and open interest. But this also introduces various additional legal risks, as the linkage between onchain USDe and off chain backing assets may be somewhat tenuous. Specifically, the tokens do not have clear legal rights to the underlying backing. Imbuing the tokens with more explicit and enforceable legal rights may create other problems if this brings the tokens under various investment regulatory schemes.</p>\n<p>The sUSDe token similarly lacks explicit legal rights. As an example, shortly after public launch the Ethena team announced a change to sUSDe yield payments reducing payouts to a maximum of 15% annualized, before partially reversing the change to a compromise that was somewhat below the original payout scheme used during the private beta period. This indicates the team still exercises complete discretion and control over key operational processes, and users have relatively little protection against unexpected changes. This is somewhat mitigated by the presence of influential coinvestors in USDe/sUSDe, along with reputational stake of VC and Exchange investors on the Ethena Labs cap table, which may help prevent unreasonable actions by the core team. However, Ethena is planning to implement decentralized decision making processes at the conclusion of their shard campaign, which may help provide greater transparency and community input for important decisions.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"exchange-failure-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#exchange-failure-10\"></a>Exchange Failure</h4>\n<p>While Ethena uses off exchange custody solutions to safeguard collateral used on centralized exchanges, the failure of a supported exchange may still cause significant disruption and incur losses to the protocol. If an exchange fails, Ethena would be forced to re-enter short perp hedging transactions on other supported exchanges. Doing so in a short time period would likely cause significant market impact and trading costs. Additionally, if perps were trading below spot prices (which is likely during an exchange failure event) this would also represent a cost to Ethena while opening short positions. Ethena would also lose any unrealized profit from the failed exchange, and would bear price exposure from their last profit settlement on the old exchange until they were able to fully re-hedge their collateral on alternative exchanges. Depending on market conditions, losses could plausibly run up to 20% or more of the futures position size from the failed exchange.</p>\n<p>In some cases, an exchange may remain solvent but particular futures and perps markets may incur significant position bankruptcies. If the bankruptcies exceed the exchange’s insurance fund, this is typically dealt with via auto-deleveraging (ADL), where profits are clawed back from highly levered winning traders to cover losses from bankrupt accounts. Because Ethena settles PNL frequently (expected to be at least daily) and maintains very low leverage, typical ADL processes would not incur serious losses to the protocol. But if Ethena has accumulated high unrealized PNL (for example if the market crashed during the previous settlement period), losses might be substantial. Additionally, if total unrealized PNL is insufficient to cure the bankrupt accounts or if impacted exchanges change their ADL procedures, Ethena may face additional losses beyond their unrealized PNL. While collateral is held in off exchange custody, it may become inaccessible while exchanges and Ethena manage any potential disputes over ADL impacts, or parts of the collateral could be surrendered to the exchange to cover the clawback amount.</p>\n<p>However, we note that the last ADL on a large cap asset contract on a major exchange was Bitmex’s 2019 ADL event. Major exchanges were able to survive Black Thursday (12 March 2020) with Bitcoin’s 50% daily drawdown without impacting perpetual users’ positions. Exchanges also have generally robust insurance funds which provide additional protection on top of their standard risk management and liquidations infrastructure. Overall, the likelihood of ADL on an ETH or BTC contract on a major exchange impacting Ethena is considered very low. The types of market conditions that could cause such an ADL would also be likely to cause significant disruption and systemic risks across the crypto and defi space (e.g. market crashes as sharp as Black Thursday).</p>\n<h4><a name=\"perp-basis-lst-discounts-and-peg-stability-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#perp-basis-lst-discounts-and-peg-stability-11\"></a>Perp Basis, LST Discounts, and Peg Stability</h4>\n<p>Ethena is set up to quote prices for minting and redemption transactions to ensure that the protocol does not lose money due to trading activity. Instead, users bear any additional cost of trading activity and slippage, or price divergences between perp and spot prices. This is generally positive for Ethena’s solvency risk profile as it reduces risk of losing money from primary market operations. But, on the other hand this reduces the strength of USDe’s peg to the dollar, particularly during volatile market conditions. When perp prices trade above spot, this would result in greater cost to redeem USDe (due to higher cost incurred by Ethena when closing short perp positions), while perps trading below spot would cause higher costs for minting USDe.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/3/f37774b03ca269f1178c92536c060427ee783dcb.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/yJNXpoNGYGxodgauMHgqP6lQvvt.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/3/f37774b03ca269f1178c92536c060427ee783dcb_2_624x357.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"yJNXpoNGYGxodgauMHgqP6lQvvt\" width=\"624\" height=\"357\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/3/f37774b03ca269f1178c92536c060427ee783dcb_2_624x357.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/3/f37774b03ca269f1178c92536c060427ee783dcb_2_936x535.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/3/f37774b03ca269f1178c92536c060427ee783dcb_2_1248x714.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAFAF6\"></a></div><br>\nSource: <a href=\"https://velodata.app/chart\">Velodata</a> - ETH Perp Premium/Discount<p></p>\n<p>Similarly, if an LST included in Ethena collateral trades at a discount due to liquidity conditions, this may result in higher costs to redeem USDe as the net asset value backing the protocol is temporarily depressed. Ethena seems to be holding an increasing share of backing in pure ETH rather than LSTs as it grows, which helps reduce the impact of LST liquidity risks. LST percentage of assets backing USDe is below 30% today and this is expected to continue decreasing while bull market conditions persist.</p>\n<p>The result of both effects is that USDe may trade with a loose peg to USD during volatile market conditions and particularly during market crashes (which are typically associated with LST liquidity stress as well as spot vs perp dislocations).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/7/a79fa52ec3cd0090de612fc1f23a20ed2ee4ed0b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nURM6Ey5oixJaCwtl3fzpS5Vi9d.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/7/a79fa52ec3cd0090de612fc1f23a20ed2ee4ed0b_2_624x389.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"nURM6Ey5oixJaCwtl3fzpS5Vi9d\" width=\"624\" height=\"389\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/7/a79fa52ec3cd0090de612fc1f23a20ed2ee4ed0b_2_624x389.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/7/a79fa52ec3cd0090de612fc1f23a20ed2ee4ed0b_2_936x583.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/7/a79fa52ec3cd0090de612fc1f23a20ed2ee4ed0b_2_1248x778.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFCFD\"></a></div><br>\nSource: <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether\">Coingecko stETH</a><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"lst-solvency-risk-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#lst-solvency-risk-12\"></a>LST Solvency Risk</h4>\n<p>Ethena holds direct, non-overcollateralized exposure to liquid staking tokens including WBETH, STETH, and METH. If an integrated LST faces permanent impairment due to hacks, operational issues, or validator slashing, this would flow through directly into Ethena’s collateral value. Losses in excess of Ethena’s reserve fund would need to be recapitalized or socialized as losses for USDe holders. Historically we have not seen major LSTs incur losses but recent concern over client diversity and bugs has resurfaced the potential for tail risk events.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"negative-funding-and-reserve-fund-depletion-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#negative-funding-and-reserve-fund-depletion-13\"></a>Negative Funding and Reserve Fund Depletion</h4>\n<p>Perps often trade with significant negative funding rates during downturns. Ethena does not pass negative funding on to USDe or sUSDe holders, instead covering this from accumulated reserve fund balances. If losses from negative funding exceed the reserve fund this could push the protocol into insolvency. However this is not considered a serious risk as losses would accumulate relatively slowly and users (including Maker collateral integrations) would have time to safely wind down exposure. Ethena could also shift backing into alternative assets such as stablecoins or RWAs, which goes against the protocol’s stated mandate somewhat but would be a viable way to address persistent negative funding.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"maker-integration-review-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#maker-integration-review-14\"></a>Maker Integration Review</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"direct-ownership-vs-overcollateralized-lending-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#direct-ownership-vs-overcollateralized-lending-15\"></a>Direct Ownership vs Overcollateralized Lending</h4>\n<p>Maker can add USDe exposure to the balance sheet either directly (via purchasing in an entity or a PSM swap facility) or through overcollateralized lending. Generally we believe that overcollateralized lending offers a better risk reward tradeoff and is both more resilient and scalable over the medium term. However, Maker may also seek to take on direct exposure in the near term as it may be faster to implement this than a DDM. Direct exposure, if any, should be limited in size to avoid excessive impact on capital at risk.</p>\n<p>By introducing a buffer of user overcollateralization, Maker would only face losses that exceed this collateral requirement. This reduces exposure to some of the most prominent USDe risks including accumulation of negative funding costs and small LST or perp price divergences.</p>\n<p>Overcollateralized lending offers a more robust liquidity profile to meet Maker’s asset allocation needs. Directly holding sUSDe brings exposure to the various peg stability risks discussed above, and additionally there is a 7 day unlocking period to be able to withdraw from sUSDe, which creates additional liquidity and duration risk. While sUSDe can be sold without waiting for unlocking, there is very little secondary market liquidity. All of this means that Maker may be forced to sell holdings at a loss if it faces DAI liquidity constraints like we saw in the past few weeks. Overcollateralized lending externalizes these liquidity risks onto leverage users, who bear the short term liquidity and price risks of holding sUSDe. Maker would be able to address any liquidity needs by increasing borrowing costs, which incentivizes users to repay debt without incurring a loss to the protocol (in fact this may drive increased short term revenue until debt is repaid, which can fund other liquidity support measures like increased DSR).</p>\n<p>Overcollateralized lending will result in somewhat lower yield earned on USDe exposure versus direct holdings, as borrowers will only be willing to open and maintain positions when the borrowing cost is far enough below Ethena yield to achieve their target rate of return. But as long as user return expectations are not unreasonably high, this will still achieve a healthy yield to the protocol all while incuring significantly less risk.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"asset-selection-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#asset-selection-16\"></a>Asset Selection</h4>\n<p>The core yield bearing asset of Ethena is sUSDe, which receives a portion of protocol yield generated by perp basis trading activities. However, during Ethena’s launch period USDe also effectively earns a rate of return via Ethena’s “Shard” program, which is a points program in anticipation of a governance token airdrop. While sUSDe seems likely to be the best candidate for asset allocation over the long term as it will continue to earn yield even when the points farming ends, in the immediate future USDe is also an attractive integration target as it is not subject to a lockup and bears lower liquidity risk.</p>\n<p>For the launch of the Metamorpho vault, we recommend whitelisting pools for both sUSDe and USDe collaterals. Vault management can shift funds between these pools as appropriate to maximize revenues and conduct an orderly winddown of USDe pools if Ethena ends incentives.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"collateral-ratio-selection-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#collateral-ratio-selection-17\"></a>Collateral Ratio Selection</h4>\n<p>Morpho Blue offers a range of collateral ratios when creating pools and allocating through vaults. Currently, the available liquidation loan to value ratio (LLTV) options for pool deployment are 38.5%, 62.5%, 77%, 86%, 91.5%, 94.5%, 96.5%, and 98%. We have modeled potential value capture efficiency across LLTV options, accounting for Maker yield earned (per DAI borrowed) versus base Ethena yield as well as various user sensitivities such as expected return and user position buffer from LLTV.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/7/678ae1efff63a003f6ead4ce8ee7bbb6d0135c32.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/eLYJvryi12KJfVuyKuvi69g3GlI.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/7/678ae1efff63a003f6ead4ce8ee7bbb6d0135c32_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"eLYJvryi12KJfVuyKuvi69g3GlI\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/7/678ae1efff63a003f6ead4ce8ee7bbb6d0135c32_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/7/678ae1efff63a003f6ead4ce8ee7bbb6d0135c32_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/7/678ae1efff63a003f6ead4ce8ee7bbb6d0135c32.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F5F4\"></a></div><br>\nSource: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xl2ZyAgcUHEw4QMmWyJ4nfFdY1MCmYSEwjDfVWY-13U/edit?usp=sharing\">sUSDe Evaluation</a><p></p>\n<p>Based on reasonable ranges of input values, LLTVs from 77% through 94.5% seem to offer the best tradeoff between value capture and risk mitigation. We see that LLTV’s below 77% tend to result in very low expected return for Maker, as the leverage is not high enough to make the trade attractive without extremely low borrowing costs. For LLTV’s above 94.5%, the marginal increase in yield earned is arguably not sufficient to justify the increase in risk.</p>\n<p>We can review user behavior after launch to help tune asset allocations across pools and arrive at an optimal deployment strategy. For example, we can measure user return expectations by comparing sUSDe yield versus Morpho borrow cost and position leverage, which then becomes a valuable input to determine which pools offer the best risk vs reward efficiency. The below graph provides an example of measuring value capture efficiency against user expected returns for an 86% LLTV pool;</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/8/3886a94b3709c691f97c3f23065f730c9049b4c8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/843fqBSZD21gjLBZRex4gBPCDQQ.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/8/3886a94b3709c691f97c3f23065f730c9049b4c8_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"843fqBSZD21gjLBZRex4gBPCDQQ\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/8/3886a94b3709c691f97c3f23065f730c9049b4c8_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/8/3886a94b3709c691f97c3f23065f730c9049b4c8_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/8/3886a94b3709c691f97c3f23065f730c9049b4c8.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"debt-ceilings-and-vault-caps-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#debt-ceilings-and-vault-caps-18\"></a>Debt Ceilings and Vault Caps</h4>\n<p>We evaluate two types of exposure limits for the Morpho USDe facility, Maker’s standard DC-IAM parameters, as well as Metamorpho vault market cap parameters. Metamorpho vault caps provide limitations on how curators can move funds between whitelisted markets, allowing for funds to be reallocated quickly and efficiently between individual collaterals and LLTVs via a multisig while still giving Maker governance ultimate control over maximum funds deployed per pool. These vault caps are further constrained by the overall DC-IAM limits that govern how much total DAI can be deployed into Morpho.</p>\n<p>For Metamorpho vault caps, we propose caps depending on the LLTV of the pool. Allocating to pools with lower LLTV will not increase the overall risk of the vault, so there is no need to apply strict constraints. On the other hand, pools with the highest LLTVs do increase risk so this should be more firmly under the control of Maker governance by implementing tighter caps. At launch, we recommend the following pool caps (mirrored across both USDe and sUSDe pools): 1 billion DAI for 77% LLTV pools, 100 million DAI for 86% LLTV pools, 50 million DAI for 91.5% LLTV pools, and 10 million DAI for 94.5% LLTV pools.</p>\n<p>DC-IAM parameters limit Maker’s total exposure to Morpho USDe collateral lending across all pools included in the vault. The <code>line</code> (absolute maximum value of DAI supplied), <code>gap</code> (maximum increase in current exposure limit per period), and <code>ttl</code> (minimum cooldown period between exposure limit increases) parameters should be tailored to limit risk while allowing for robust growth and revenue generation.</p>\n<p>Total exposure to Ethena, and perp basis trading strategies as a whole, can be evaluated against liquidity and tail risk metrics to arrive at upper limits to exposure (<code>line</code>). Key metrics considered include: perp market aggregated open interest and daily volumes, potential total size of basis trading positions, Ethena USDe circulating supply, DAI circulating supply and liquidity profile, and resilience against potential tail risk events. Generally, Maker should avoid making up to great a share of perp open interest, particularly when levels of basis trading activity are high, to minimize the potential for disruption if a large share of basis trading positions unwind in a short period of time. Additionally, Maker should limit total share of USDe circulating supply, again to limit disruption and stress on Ethena’s trading infrastructure in the event this position needs to be quickly unwound. This is particularly important given Ethena has almost exclusively seen inflows since launch, so their redemption processes are untested at scale. Finally, Maker should limit the share of DAI collateralization from USDe to minimize likelihood of protocol failure from a severe tail risk event. This is also important to maintain a strong sense of product and risk differentiation from Ethena; we should diligently avoid characterization as “wrapped USDe” as this will drive negative PR and is misaligned with DAI users’ demonstrated risk preference for DAI to be boring and predictable.</p>\n<p>We recommend limiting <code>line</code> based on the lowest of the following benchmarks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10% of total perpetual futures open interest - based on ETH perp OI of between $6.5-10 billion (estimates vary based on included exchange list), this would result in up to 650 million to 1 billion DAI <code>line</code> (generally the lowest credible estimate of OI should be used), this value could increase if additional assets such as BTC were used for basis trading</li>\n<li>30% of USDe circulating supply, inclusive of Maker owned supply - with 1.2 billion USDe currently circulating, this would result in a maximum <code>line</code> of up to 515 million DAI</li>\n<li>20% of DAI circulating supply - based on current DAI supply of 4.7 billion, this would result in maximum <code>line</code> of up to 950 million DAI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the USDe circulating supply threshold only applies to exposure through Ethena, while the perpetuals OI and DAI circulating supply threshold should be applied to the sum of all perp basis trading exposures.</p>\n<p>The <code>gap</code> and <code>ttl</code> parameters control the rate of exposure growth. Due to the nature of USDe and the proposed Morpho integration, it is expected that exposure will be at the maximum <code>line</code> limit most of the time, based on Maker governance determined strategic asset allocation targets. So <code>gap</code> and <code>ttl</code> will not be quite as important as they are for volatile crypto collaterals, and we recommend setting them fairly conservatively: <code>gap</code> of 10% of <code>line</code>, and <code>ttl</code> of 24 hours.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"launch-parameter-recommendations-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#launch-parameter-recommendations-19\"></a>Launch Parameter Recommendations</h4>\n<p>Based on the above review of risk factors we recommend the following initial parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>DDM DC-IAM Parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>line</code>: 100 million DAI</li>\n<li><code>gap</code>: 100 million DAI</li>\n<li><code>ttl</code>: 24 hours</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Metamorpho Vault Parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Market Caps:\n<ul>\n<li>USDe 77% LLTV pool cap: 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 86% LLTV pool cap: 100 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 91.5% LLTV pool cap: 50 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 94.5% LLTV pool cap: 10 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 77% LLTV pool cap: 1 billion DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 86% LLTV pool cap: 100 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 91.5% LLTV pool cap: 50 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 94.5% LLTV pool cap: 10 million DAI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Recommended Vault DAI allocations:\n<ul>\n<li>USDe 77% LLTV allocation: 5 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 86% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 91.5% LLTV allocation: 30 million DAI</li>\n<li>USDe 94.5% LLTV allocation: 5 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 77% LLTV allocation: 5 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 86% LLTV allocation: 10 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 91.5% LLTV allocation: 30 million DAI</li>\n<li>sUSDe 94.5% LLTV allocation: 5 million DAI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During the launch phase of the morpho vault, we recommend a low maximum <code>line</code> to limit tail risk (bugs, unexpected market behavior, etc). We also recommend setting the <code>gap</code> equal to the <code>line</code> so the entire amount can be deployed at once, and avoid any unintended impact on Morpho Blue’s rate automation mechanism by frequently adding new supply to the market and pushing down the utilization ratio. Once the full amount is deployed, we will recommend to reduce the <code>gap</code> to 10% of <code>line</code> at the next executive spell. For the vault funds deployment across pools, we recommend allocating a small share of funds to each of the 77% and 94.5% LLTV pools, moderate amount to each of the 86% LLTV pools, and largest share of funds to each of 91.5% LLTV pools (which is expected to offer the best balance between risk vs return). We will monitor performance, user behavior, and efficiency metrics and optimize vault allocations over time, potentially removing liquidity from some LLTVs and shifting exposure between USDe and sUSDe pools.</p>\n<p>A formal recommendation to the stability scope facilitators for approval and implementation is posted <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/introduction-and-initial-parameters-for-ddm-overcollateralized-spark-metamorpho-ethena-vault/23925\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"references-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#references-20\"></a>References</h3>\n<p>Ethena docs: <a href=\"https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Ethena Labs Overview | Ethena Labs</a><br>\nMorpho docs: <a href=\"https://docs.morpho.org/contracts/morpho-blue/\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Morpho Blue | Morpho</a><br>\nAnalysis workbook: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xl2ZyAgcUHEw4QMmWyJ4nfFdY1MCmYSEwjDfVWY-13U/edit?usp=sharing\">sUSDe Evaluation</a></p>\n<p>We would like to thank the Ethena Labs team for providing consistent communication and feedback during our review process.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit (27 March 2024):</strong> Updated proposed allocation for 91.5% LLTV pools from 35 million to 30 million DAI to align total allocation amount with DDM debt ceiling of 100 million DAI.</p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-usde-morpho-lending-integration/23924\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-usde-morpho-lending-integration/23924","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 21:56:59 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-23924"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-usde-morpho-lending-integration/23924.rss","#text":"Risk Assessment - USDe Morpho Lending Integration"},"filter":false},{"title":"Project Ethena - Proposal & Enacting DAO Resolutions","dc:creator":"BlockTower","category":"General Discussion","description":"<h1><a name=\"project-ethena-proposal-enacting-dao-resolutions-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#project-ethena-proposal-enacting-dao-resolutions-1\"></a>Project Ethena - Proposal &amp; Enacting DAO Resolutions</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"preamble-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#preamble-2\"></a>Preamble</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">Title: Project Ethena - Proposal\nPosted: 03/21/2024\nIlks: RWA015-A\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a name=\"legal-disclaimer-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#legal-disclaimer-3\"></a>Legal Disclaimer</h3>\n<p><em>This communication is provided for informational purposes only.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones related to Project Ethena’s investment objectives.  Additional risks and uncertainties that the Arranger is unaware of may become important factors that affect the performance of the TACO Account.  If any of the follow (or unknown) risks occur, the performance of the TACO Account may be materially and adversely affected.  In that event, TACO could lose all or part of its investment.</p>\n<p>MKR Stakeholders should be particularly knowledgeable in investment matters and should ensure they they understand the nature of Project Ethena’s investment objectives and the extent of TACO’s exposure to Project Ethena’s risks.  MKR Stakeholders should ensure they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of Project Ethena, and that they’ve considered the suitability of Project Ethena’s investment objectives in light of MakerDAO’s circumstances, holistic investment objectives and financial condition.  MKR Stakeholders should also consult their own legal, tax, accounting and financial advisers to determine whether they desire to vote in favor or against the Arranger providing the services described in the SMA in respect of Project Ethena.  No representation of guarantee is made that Project Ethena’s investment objectives will be successful.</p>\n<p>MKR Stakeholders are strongly advised to review the SMA in its entirety (including the risks and conflicts disclosed in Appendix B therein) prior to making a decision to vote favor of or against TACO entering into the SMA with the Arranger.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"disclaimers-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#disclaimers-18\"></a>Disclaimers</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/BlockTower-Capital/disclaimers/blob/main/Andromeda-Disclaimers.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PLEASE REFER TO OUR GENERAL DISCLAIMERS HERE</a></p>\n            <p><small>8 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/project-ethena-proposal-enacting-dao-resolutions/23923\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/project-ethena-proposal-enacting-dao-resolutions/23923","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 21:11:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-23923"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/project-ethena-proposal-enacting-dao-resolutions/23923.rss","#text":"Project Ethena - Proposal & Enacting DAO Resolutions"},"filter":false},{"title":"KISS Position Document for Q1 (21st March 2024)","dc:creator":"DAI-Vinci","category":"Kiss AVC","description":"<p>Today, the 21st of March 2024, the KISS AVC releases its fourth “KISS AVC Position Document” for Q1 of 2024.</p>\n<p>The document is available here: <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/zURestIokWaCPQjHAr7ey0vBWhmlGH1y8e8C4fA95tE/\">CryptPad</a></p>\n<p>Everybody can download the .md file (File-&gt;Export) and verify its sha256sum:</p>\n<p><code>40554318a4da9b85fad0e1d1e8d5878a0951126ac98637982a7a7a37d7294ca1</code></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Signed message:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">Today, the 21st of March 2024, the KISS AVC releases its fourth “KISS AVC Position Document” for Q1 of 2024.\n\nThe document is available here: [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/zURestIokWaCPQjHAr7ey0vBWhmlGH1y8e8C4fA95tE/)\n\nEverybody can download the .md file (File-&gt;Export) and verify its sha256sum:\n\n40554318a4da9b85fad0e1d1e8d5878a0951126ac98637982a7a7a37d7294ca1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Signature:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">0x5835a8f4187fda44ee71c64eb8e0b7e2bb12cefc7978f53192bccf1f5dc072f87f9262a42046a0c6d92bfc41b6a31309270ee3548f1f87fd4043064180eaba9f1c\n</code></pre>\n<p>Etherscan link: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/verifySig/38672\">https://etherscan.io/verifySig/38672</a></p>\n            <p><small>10 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/kiss-position-document-for-q1-21st-march-2024/23920\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/kiss-position-document-for-q1-21st-march-2024/23920","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 19:43:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-23920"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/kiss-position-document-for-q1-21st-march-2024/23920.rss","#text":"KISS Position Document for Q1 (21st March 2024)"},"filter":false},{"title":"Market Conditions and Competition Analysis - 21 March 2024","dc:creator":"monet-supply","category":"General Discussion","description":"<h3><a name=\"risk-and-competitive-rates-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#risk-and-competitive-rates-1\"></a>Risk and Competitive Rates</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e2cf76542268f62930ee373aa75208310db608fd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wmsoqQs7F6AhI2pRPh5YCMNwe0R.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e2cf76542268f62930ee373aa75208310db608fd_2_624x373.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"wmsoqQs7F6AhI2pRPh5YCMNwe0R\" width=\"624\" height=\"373\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e2cf76542268f62930ee373aa75208310db608fd_2_624x373.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e2cf76542268f62930ee373aa75208310db608fd_2_936x559.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e2cf76542268f62930ee373aa75208310db608fd.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E1E1E1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N0t8PueRmNsNeEYQJyaRbAVWiwM2ht5vz8-7vfsGOR0/edit?usp=sharing\">Risk Premiums &amp;

As a result, crypto prices and leverage demand increased rapidly. In addition, external rates in the DeFi ecosystem had increased, making Spark and Maker relatively cheap lending protocols for larger volumes.</p>\n<p>Looking at DeFi rates at the time of the proposal, we see that 7-day borrow rates on major lending markets had been rising steadily throughout the previous month. The largest pools by TVL on 8 March showcased borrow rates in the range of 13.23% to 36.36%, with an average 7-day borrow rate of 19.13% and a TVL-Weighted borrow rate of 16.81%. This was substantially above the fixed Spark DAI borrow rate of 6.70% and the core vaults’ stability fees ranging between 6.16% and 7.18%. This, in turn, led to users shorting DAI through a carry trade whereby they minted cheap DAI, sold it for other assets, and deposited assets into other high yielding opportunities in the space.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/d/dd826b995866368e39a124b75e651061d504f9e3.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vByWBjEXdD5RZa384Xw4YtPSOxZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/d/dd826b995866368e39a124b75e651061d504f9e3_2_624x357.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"vByWBjEXdD5RZa384Xw4YtPSOxZ\" width=\"624\" height=\"357\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/d/dd826b995866368e39a124b75e651061d504f9e3_2_624x357.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/d/dd826b995866368e39a124b75e651061d504f9e3_2_936x535.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/d/dd826b995866368e39a124b75e651061d504f9e3.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E2E3E1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/stablecoin-rates\">Tokenlogic</a> &amp;

In order to understand the true underlying situation, it is important to take into account the effect that supply rates have on borrowing rates. Namely, Aave and Compound provide a yield on collateral pledged into their pools, which ranges between 0.06% and 2%. This corresponds to a slightly lower Effective Borrow Rate. With a supposed 150% Collateralization Ratio on ETH supplied to borrow stablecoins, we can get an approximation of what the Effective Rate is. We then weight the Borrow Rates with the TVL of the markets, in order to gain a better approximation of what is the Average Borrow Rate of the overall stablecoin market. This results in a 7-Day Average Borrow Rate of 16.81% and a 7-Day Effective Borrow Rate of 14.33%.</p>\n<p>At the same time, funding rates on major centralized exchanges for ETH Perpetuals have collapsed to align with the broader market landscape. Annualized Funding Rates range between 8.21% and 32.98% across Binance, Bybit, OKx and Deribit. We take these values and weight them by their Open Interest, in order to get weighted funding rates. This corresponds to an Average OI Weighted Funding Rate of 17.52%.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/1/11843dc01d55d432ed75397dcebc93dbcfbda772.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/2uXrqVy4ixSBqugavRDtskScUzo.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/1/11843dc01d55d432ed75397dcebc93dbcfbda772_2_624x133.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"2uXrqVy4ixSBqugavRDtskScUzo\" width=\"624\" height=\"133\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/1/11843dc01d55d432ed75397dcebc93dbcfbda772_2_624x133.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/1/11843dc01d55d432ed75397dcebc93dbcfbda772_2_936x199.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/1/11843dc01d55d432ed75397dcebc93dbcfbda772_2_1248x266.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E7E8E7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Sources: <a href=\"https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v2/ethereum/markets/\">Blockanalitica</a>, <a href=\"https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/stablecoin-rates\">Tokenlogic</a> and <a href=\"https://velodata.app/futures/ETH\">Velo</a></p>\n<p>We will consider the three calculated rates as benchmarks, namely:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>TVL Weighted 7-Day Effective Borrow Rate</li>\n<li>TVL Weighted 7-Day Average Borrow Rate</li>\n<li>OI Weighted Annualized Funding Rate</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are then used to calculate the Differences (Δₙ) and assess the feasibility of stability fees. We can see that for many vault types, current Stability Fees are more expensive than the Market Effective Borrow Rate. This is why we believe that the stability fees are not in line with current market conditions and should be lowered slightly. This is the rationale behind the new proposed Stability Fees, which will range between 13% and 14.75% for different vault types, with the Spark Effective Borrow APY equal to 14% and the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) equal to 13%.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/a/ba09a01915f0b4b79ba70e62a8fe222c9829905f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qxLqLNT7WqvhQnflSjAKIcU7Zf1.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/a/ba09a01915f0b4b79ba70e62a8fe222c9829905f_2_624x217.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"qxLqLNT7WqvhQnflSjAKIcU7Zf1\" width=\"624\" height=\"217\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/a/ba09a01915f0b4b79ba70e62a8fe222c9829905f_2_624x217.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/a/ba09a01915f0b4b79ba70e62a8fe222c9829905f_2_936x325.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/a/ba09a01915f0b4b79ba70e62a8fe222c9829905f_2_1248x434.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E1DFDB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-17\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The current high rate environment suggests that Stability Fees may need to stay higher for longer in order to adjust to market changes and to accommodate more stablecoin exposure in the short to medium term.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the current high rates in DeFi are most likely not sustainable over the longer term since (i) demand for leverage may subside as the price of cryptoassets fall, and/or (ii) the current rate disparity between DeFi protocols and other CeFi alternatives may converge as market actors find ways to bridge the disjoint rate environments.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the recent rate hikes in Maker have likely helped precipitate a sizable Spark DAI market outflow. However, it should be noted that, while we have seen some refinancing from Spark to other lending protocols, the recent market sell-off has led to less TVL in general in DeFi.</p>\n<p>Exposure from crypto collateral (Native and Non-Native Vault Types) in Maker remains elevated in spite of the recent Stability Fee hikes. However, even though Maker Core Vault Type positions appear to be more inelastic compared to the Spark DAI market, additional vault users may unwind and/or withdraw their positions if Stability Fees are not lowered to reflect recent market changes.</p>\n<p>Taking this into account, before returning to normal governance cadence and Core Stability Parameters update frequencies, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> will soon propose new parameter changes in accordance with article 3.3 in the Stability Scope. In a separate forum post, we will propose a decrease in Stability Fees, Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY, and the DSR.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"future-plans-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#future-plans-18\"></a>Future Plans</h2>\n<p>The implementation and outcome of the March 8 accelerated proposal has provided us with information and data that can be used to improve parameter change proposals in the future. <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> plans to propose a few changes regarding:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Determining Stability Fees</li>\n<li>The Maker Governance Process</li>\n<li>The GSM Delay</li>\n<li>Stability Scope Language Edits</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"determining-stability-fees-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#determining-stability-fees-19\"></a>Determining Stability Fees</h3>\n<p>With the current volatile market conditions and high rate environment, we are of the opinion that MakerDAO needs to be even more attentive to external market rates. <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> regularly assesses market conditions and external rates, and reports significant changes through our research product “<a href=\"https://maker.blockanalitica.com/forum-archive/?category=Market%20Conditions%20and%20Competition%20Analysis\">Market Conditions and Competition Analysis</a>”.</p>\n<p>However, following the introduction of the Stability Scope, rate changes are bound by the Scope rules and formulas. Since the Stability Scope is still in its early stages, additional language changes are still planned for inclusion. Before the Stability Scope is sufficiently developed, this may result in additional scenarios where the discrepancy between external market rates and internal Stability Scope formulas diverge to unsustainable levels, requiring accelerated proposals and out-of-schedule executive votes.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> therefore plans to propose a new iteration of the Exposure Based Model for determining Stability Fees. In the new iteration, we plan on applying a new spread which will account for external market rates as well as the total crypto collateral percentage exposure in the portfolio backing DAI. More information on this will be provided on the Maker forum at a later point in time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-maker-governance-process-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#the-maker-governance-process-20\"></a>The Maker Governance Process</h3>\n<p>In order to make the governance process less disruptive and more predictable in the current volatile market environment, we believe that certain changes need to be made to the governance cycle. We believe that once Maker returns to normal governance procedures, governance cycles will need to be made shorter. This will allow Maker to respond faster to sudden volatile market changes and minimize potentially disruptive accelerated proposals and out-of-schedule executive votes.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-gsm-delay-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#the-gsm-delay-21\"></a>The GSM Delay</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay#description\">GSM (Governance Security Module) Pause Delay</a> parameter sets the minimum amount of time after an executive vote has passed before changes will come into effect in the Maker Protocol. Prior to the Accelerated Proposal on March 8, 2024, the GSM Delay was 48 hours. As a result of the accelerated proposal on March 8, this value was changed to 16 hours.</p>\n<p>The current GSM Delay parameter value is intended to be temporary, and is in our opinion too low in normal circumstances. However, in order for MakerDAO to be able to react faster in the current market environment, a case can be made that a value lower than 48 hours may be beneficial. <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> plans on proposing a new GSM Delay value at a later point in time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"stability-scope-language-edits-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#stability-scope-language-edits-22\"></a>Stability Scope Language Edits</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"defined-directives-for-accelerated-rate-change-proposals-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#defined-directives-for-accelerated-rate-change-proposals-23\"></a>Defined Directives for Accelerated Rate Change Proposals</h4>\n<p>At the time of writing, the Stability Scope lacks certain guidelines and directives as to what should be done in times when fast governance decisions need to be made. As a member of the Stability Scope Advisory Council, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> plan on proposing more concrete instructions in case similar proposals are needed in the future.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"allocatordao-regulatory-framework-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#allocatordao-regulatory-framework-24\"></a>AllocatorDAO Regulatory Framework</h4>\n<p>The need for an AllocatorDAO regulatory framework will grow stronger as we approach the official launch of SubDAOs. As a member of Stability Advisory Council, BA Labs, together with the Stability Facilitators and other stakeholder in Maker, are working on defining clear language for AllocatorDAO Junior Capital requirements, capitalization requirements, and DAI deployment requirements.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-8-accelerated-proposal/23909\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-8-accelerated-proposal/23909","pubDate":"Wed, 20 Mar 2024 11:35:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-23909"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-8-accelerated-proposal/23909.rss","#text":"Impact Analysis: March 8 Accelerated Proposal"},"filter":false}]}}}
